<h3>Okita and Saito&#39;s age difference</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493315687">Ran into some confusion about who exactly was older: Saito or Okita? <br/>
Saito was born in 1844. He was about 25 in 1868, correct? But what <br/>
about Okita?<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was pretty much settled that he was 25 when he died in <br/>
1868. Most sites I know of list his birth year as 1844. It&#39;s also <br/>
said that he was 10 years younger than Kondo, who was born in 1834. <br/>
But is this absolutely true?<br/>
<br/>
One site did mention that there was a possibility that Okita might <br/>
have been born in 1842. It also gives the date of 1844 and says that <br/>
it has been handed down through the family that he was 25 when he <br/>
died. But then it makes the bizarre claim, without any explanation <br/>
why, that it&#39;s now &quot;generally accepted&quot; he was born in 1842. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any insight into this?<br/>

tried to access.<br/>
<br/>
As I know, he has two possible year of birth, 1842 or 1844, so it&#39;s not sure <br/>
if he died at the age of 25 or 27.<br/>
Some reliable Shinsengumi site like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toshizo.com/">http://www.toshizo.com/</a> mentions these <br/>
two possibility.<br/>
But I don&#39;t know so far why many people mention 1842, either where did these <br/>
difference come from. May be could momoiro san clarify it better than me?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I don&#39;t have seen Azumi yet, but I like Jo&#39;s sword fight very much!<br/>

In the document which remains in Okita&#39;s house, there are data that <br/>
Souji was 20 years old in Bunkyu 3 (1863), and it is the basis of <br/>
the opinion in 1844. <br/>
(Please calculate by kazoedoshi.)<br/>
And it is the basis of the opinion in 1842 which was written to be <br/>
22 years old to the list of names when participating in Roushi-tai. <br/>
Recently, the opinion in 1842 is said to be leading. That is because <br/>
these list of names are the documents of a public institution. <br/>
<br/>
In my memory, when I got to know Shinsengumi, almost all researchers <br/>
were writing the opinion in 1844. <br/>
(Incidentally, it is about 18 years ago that I got to know <br/>
Shinsengumi.) <br/>
In the world of manga, since there is a tendency which makes age of <br/>
the character young, most works set up Souji in the opinion in 1844. <br/>
