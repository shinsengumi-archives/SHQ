<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510313053">I have gradually been installing a top navigation frame for <br/>
shinsengumihq.com...<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/topframe.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/topframe.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that we could use more:<br/>
-Movie- reviews (you can post differing opinions too)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm</a><br/>
*The depiction of the Shinsengumi in various films deserve study as <br/>
you can note attempts of portraying them as humans, or exaggerated <br/>
killing machines or contains some blatant historical innaccuracies.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have seen NHK's Shinsengumi you can also comment on <br/>
certain episodes or details (for example the folktale peformed by <br/>
the Yagi father and son is the same story told in the movie GOJOE)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/tv.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/tv.htm</a><br/>
*your commentary is valuable<br/>
<br/>
Translations and fact sheets were uploaded<br/>
(*new members* please read these pages) <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/facts.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/facts.htm</a><br/>
and I would like to urge future contributors that they include a <br/>
personal website I can link with their names...<br/>
{for example "Masayoshi" is linked with his personal <br/>
website, "MissB" is linked to her fanfiction.net page, "Wetheril" is <br/>
linked to her Livejournal page...as long as your site is in general <br/>
rated-G}  SHQ.com has been enjoying ALOT of traffic so whatever link <br/>
you give me will also receive visitors<br/>
<br/>
Do you need links? then please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumidb.com">http://www.shinsengumidb.com</a> <br/>
because the database categorizes the links and gives a summary<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is you want to contribute please email shinsengumihq(a)<br/>
yahoo.com...basically if want more people to better understand the <br/>
time period and history then PLEASE give info generously...of all <br/>
our affiliate sites shinsengumihq.com has enjoyed the most hits and <br/>
is perhaps now second to Serizawa's site (*new folks please read <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html)">http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html)</a><br/>
<br/>
If you are writing a report you MUST include a bibliography [isbn# <br/>
of books are also helpful) and properly quote the author otherwise <br/>
you are plagiarizing [it is ILLEGAL folks].<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*I have been getting messages from many new members asking some <br/>
questions concerning historical Saitou Hajime...please visit "FILES" <br/>
and read the uploaded human translations of a Japanese site.  The <br/>
site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hajime3.hp.infoseek.co.jp/index.html">http://hajime3.hp.infoseek.co.jp/index.html</a> (formerly 3-<br/>
hajime.com) does focus on history and used textual resources. Keep <br/>
in mind that "history" may also include stories handed down by <br/>
friends and family.  <br/>
