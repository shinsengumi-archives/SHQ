<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173597746">please search at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumidb.com">http://www.shinsengumidb.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Books which mention the Shinsengumi<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
General books about the political conditions in which the Shinsengumi<br/>
and revolutionaries operated<br/>

***note the Aizu section which would be highly relevant to not only<br/>
Saitou's personal biography (and the small group of Shinsengumi who<br/>
stayed in Aizu) but also the last shogunate stronghold<br/>
<br/>
You may try visiting a local college or university library which<br/>
should have a few books on the restoration.  Try not to buy a book<br/>
before you "preview" it at a library first.  If you are not a student<br/>
at a university yet you may try requesting access to the library<br/>
without borrowing privileges.<br/>
<br/>
**I know you want to focus on the Shinsengumi but if you are really<br/>
short on time then writing a report on Ryoma Sakamoto may be -easier-<br/>
(^_^) he is a very well researched figure and you will probably find<br/>
many sources on him<br/>
