<br/>
I'm trying to sift out the difference between fact and fiction. <br/>

<br/>
Is there any known reason for his joining Shinsengumi?<br/>
Was his father really learning about western things?<br/>
Did he ever fight in any of the battles?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ever so much for you help :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393002043">I can get you the exact sources and citations later, but off the top of my <br/>
head I know for sure that Ichimura Tetsunosuke's family background has its <br/>
roots in the Ogaki domain of Mino Province (incidentally, a domain which <br/>
formed part of the Imperial army in 1868). Shinsengumi member Shimada Kai <br/>
also had family background in that domain. Tetsunosuke was indeed part of <br/>
Shinsengumi, and Hijikata's page-- and it's because of him leaving Hakodate <br/>
in time that the famous photo of Hijikata exists. As far as his father, I <br/>
don't really know.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard that he died in the Seinan War around a decade later, but there <br/>
are other people here who know Seinan better than me.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I've always wondered what the interaction would have been <br/>
between Ichimura Tetsunosuke and Inoue Taisuke, who was Kondou's page.<br/>

<h3>Re: Tetsunosuke Ichimura</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832845906">Born in 1854, Ichimura Tetsunosuke was the third son of Ichimura Hanemoki.  In 1867, he <br/>
joined the Shinsengumi with his older brother Tatsunosuke and served as Hijikata <br/>
Toshizou's page. In 1868,  Tatsunosuke left the Koyochinbutai (the renamed Shinsengumi) <br/>
after the battle in Koshu. However, Tetsunosuke decided to stay with the group.  He <br/>
continued to fight in numerous battles (for example, in Aizu, Fukushima, Sendai and <br/>
Hakodate.)<br/>
<br/>
During the Hakodate War, on April 15 (lunar calendar) or May 3 (lunar calendar) 1869, <br/>
Tetsunosuke was instructed by Hijikata to bear his photograph, letter, death poem, <br/>
katana, and several strands of his hair to the home of his brother-in-law, Sato Hikogoro, <br/>
in Hino. <br/>
<br/>
Tetsunosuke arrived in Hino three months later and stayed at Sato's house for 2-3 years.  <br/>
During his time in Hino, Tetsunosuke studied kenjutsu and literature(?). Later, <br/>
Tetsunosuke returned home to Ogaki and was reunited with Tatsunosuke.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few theories in regard of Ichimura Tetsunosuke's death date, while many <br/>
believe that Ichimura joined Saigo Takamori's army and died during the Satsuma Rebellion <br/>
in 1877, some believe that he died from an illness in 1873. <br/>
<br/>
The uploaded scans from "Shinsengumi Dokuhon~Taishi Gaiden 2" support the latter <br/>
theory.<br/>
