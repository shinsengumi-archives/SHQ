<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745957999">Have you searched google for &quot;Sadao Kotaka&quot; the last surviving <br/>
student of the youngest member of the Shinsengumi who lived past <br/>
WWII (I think)...(AND Dr. Kotaka is a relative of the capt of the <br/>
10th squad), he insists that the Shinsengumi Chief&#39;s name should be <br/>
Kondou IsamU.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Kotaka is establishing or attempting to establish the classical <br/>
kendo federation (which is NOT part of mainstream sport <br/>
kendo)...this has attracted some controversy but I have read one <br/>
post on a budo forum from someone who have seen Dr. Kotaka perform <br/>
his katas and the person, a long time kendoist, was very impressed.<br/>
<br/>
Classical kendo federation site is currently down for <br/>
maintenance...but search for him...he has a very different &quot;take&quot; on <br/>
things understandably.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416225917">I feel that it has more to do with the up hill battle with making his<br/>
classical kendo more legitimate and his teacher&#39;s influence on him.<br/>
Many martial arts practitioners are focused on &quot;preserving&quot; what is<br/>
well established rather than starting what they feel is something new.<br/>
 Dr. Kotaka is doing something kind of against this current by saying<br/>
he is trying to preserve something old that was not mainstream due to<br/>
the social/political climate.  One of his students posted in other<br/>
forums and mentioned low light training and outdoor training on<br/>
hills/incline which I found to be fascinating and perhaps unorthodox<br/>
in the world of mainstream kendo.<br/>
<br/>
I recall posting about the Tennen Rishin Ryu video and Serizawa<br/>
mentioned that it isn&#39;t that great...if Tennen Rishin Ryu is going the<br/>
 way of many lineages which are arguably waning to put it lightly then<br/>
classical kendo may be the only shot in the study/preservation of the<br/>
martial arts the Shinsengumi practiced.<br/>
