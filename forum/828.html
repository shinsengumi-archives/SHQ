<h3>Upcoming Movies and Anime</h3>
by <i>unsafesects</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029301299">These are some upcoming movies and anime, none of which are <br/>
Shinsengumi-related, but which may be interesting to you guys, <br/>
nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
Onmyoji - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onmyojimovie.com/">http://www.onmyojimovie.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
During the Dark Ages of Demons and ghosts, the Emperor relies on the <br/>
Onmyoji to protect the Kingdom.  However, as the birth of the <br/>
Emperor&#39;s heir approaches, political intrigue and jealousy will lead <br/>
to the most dangerous betrayal from within the Onmyoji.<br/>
<br/>
Angrybee&#39;s note:  I&#39;ve seen the trailer for this, and it looks <br/>
utterly spectacular.  Might be good &quot;research&quot; for anyone wanting to <br/>
explore the &quot;magic&quot; themes in PMK in fics.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai7 - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-7.com/">http://www.samurai-7.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Samurai7 is based off of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Seven Samurai, but set in <br/>
the -future-.  <br/>
<br/>
Angrybee&#39;s Note:  There&#39;s a good article on Samurai7 in the June/July <br/>
issue of &quot;Anime Insider&quot;.  Of course, it&#39;s being done by Gonzo, <br/>
which...I believe, are also the ones who did PMK.  <br/>
<br/>
Samurai Champloo: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samuraichamploo.com/">http://www.samuraichamploo.com/</a><br/>
Gallery: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samuraichamploo.com/Gallery/index.html">http://www.samuraichamploo.com/Gallery/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Samurai Champloo, while an odd name, is the first work of Shinchiro <br/>
Watanabe since Cowboy Bebop.  It is set to air in Japan starting May <br/>
19th.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have enjoyed this list of coming attractions!  Now, if only <br/>
my local PBS would air the Shinsengumi Drama....<br/>
