<h3>Five places in English to look at.</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754476779">Ok, so there IS some Japanese on these pages. However the person <br/>
behind these articles was kind enough to include an English <br/>
translation, so there&#39;s no need to bring out the evil goldfish. <br/>
<br/>
This first article is about the place we discussed last Sunday during <br/>
the chat session. Serizawa Kamo very kindly translated a name the <br/>
translator had mutilated beyond all recognition, so I know this place <br/>
is connected to Hijikata. <br/>

<br/>
The next two sites I&#39;ve known about for a while actually. The first <br/>
is about the war and Goryokaku. The next one is about the monument <br/>
built to Hijikata and the other Tokugawa forces killed in battle.<br/>

<br/>
The next article is about my new hero, Yanagawa Kumakichi! This has <br/>
cleared up a bit of a mystery for me!<br/>

<br/>
So this is the temple that the www.tamahito.com site keeps going on <br/>
about! While the EXACT location of Hijikata&#39;s grave remains unknown, <br/>
it seems that it is probably somewhere on the side of Mt. Hakodate. <br/>
But I thought that the bodies were cremated? I guess they mean he <br/>
buried the ashes? Or is the translator just messing with my head?! <br/>
Well, maybe the mystery isn&#39;t COMPLETELY cleared up...-_-<br/>
<br/>
Now if I could just figure out what this &quot;Wood Eagle&quot; thing is. It <br/>
seems to be the place that Enomoto (and of course Hijikata) first <br/>
landed in Hokkaido. They keep showing pictures of some beach.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m off the point now. The point is all you Ishin-haters out <br/>
there will really find your blood boiling and know why I have such <br/>
tremendous respect for this man!<br/>
<br/>
And if that isn&#39;t enough to condemn the new government&#39;s actions in <br/>
Hokkaido, then check this article out. This appears to be dealing <br/>
with some of the Aizu people who joined Hijikata in Hokkaido.<br/>

So are you angry yet?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890868060">Hmmmm, killing the sick and wounded [real] bravery...well there are <br/>
no rules in warfare sadly.  Just like in the Seinan War the gov. was <br/>
extremely concerned with their image and they made a strong effort <br/>
to enforce their &quot;do not &#39;harass&#39; the womanfolk policy&quot; but you know <br/>
they couldn&#39;t keep an eye on thousands of guys.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what I&#39;d like to know is when the Aizu samurai/troops went up <br/>
to Hakodate because <br/>
1) it means they escaped the clutches of the invading Imperial army <br/>
right before the enemy entered the domain<br/>
2) or they somehow escaped -after- the army secured the <br/>
domain...basically I&#39;m concerned with how the defense of the domain <br/>
must&#39;ve fallen apart.<br/>
<br/>
I have several books with me however NONE discuss the fall of Aizu <br/>
extensively...sure it mentions Matsudaira here and there but only in <br/>
a political context in Kyoto.  It&#39;s kind of like how chapters on the <br/>
Seinan War do not mention the Seige at Kumamoto Castle/Garrison when <br/>
very clearly many authors say it was THE act of war (point of no <br/>
return) for Saigo&#39;s forces...up until this time the gov. was seeking <br/>
negotiations with Satsuma and was willing to pardon him [!].<br/>
<br/>
I did read a bit on Japanese funeral practices and there are some <br/>
similarities to a culture I&#39;m studying...basically you cremate the <br/>
bodies and interr the ashes/bone in a cemetary (it is common for <br/>
family to take some home and worship the remains)...its like in the <br/>
case of Fujita Goro&#39;s grave...I assume only his ashes/bones are <br/>
there under the stone marker...not a &quot;grave&quot; in a Western sense.<br/>

list, I thinK) that dealt with this. Apparently Matsudaira Katamori was <br/>
yelling at Hijikata to go get reinforcements from Shonai (a neighboring <br/>
domain), so Hijikata took a group (don&#39;t know how large) of Aizu samurai and <br/>
left. After he left, he heard that Shonai had fallen, so he instead went to <br/>
Sendai and joined up with Enomoto, who was on his way to Hokkaido.<br/>

I believe that what happened there is that some of these men were ordered to <br/>
accompany Hijikata when he was sent to enlist aid from the other domains. <br/>
After all, Matsudaira had him out inspecting the defenses earlier. Obviously he <br/>
placed a great deal of trust in the man and wouldn&#39;t want to risk him falling <br/>
into enemy hands by going it alone. Others are probably the Aizu forces who have <br/>
been mentioned as having been fighting beyond the domain borders to stop the <br/>
Imperial army&#39;s advance. Once the enemy broke through, I&#39;m sure there were <br/>
many men who found themselves suddenly cut off from returning to Aizu and had to <br/>
fight elsewhere.<br/>
