<div id="ygrps-yiv-201668379">Some parts of this episode are fictional.<br/>
According to Shinsengumi side records, they assassinated Uchiyama<br/>
because he cornered the market of rice then oil to raise the price, in<br/>
order to lose Shogunate&#39;s credit as Uchiyama communicated secretly with<br/>
Choshu clan.<br/>
Other side explains differently the reason, saying that assassination<br/>
was caused by the rivality between Shinsengumi and Osaka Bugyosyo.<br/>
As it was showed in the drama, Uchiyama pursued the question of<br/>
Shinsengumi&#39;s responsibility for the killing of Sumo wrestlers.<br/>
So Shinsengumi people killed him considering Uchiyama as obstacle for<br/>
their activity in Osaka.<br/>
But the real reason of the assassination is unknown, and I read recently<br/>
that the descendants of Uchiyama didn&#39;t know until recently that the<br/>
culprit of the murder of their ancestor was Shinsengumi. They had<br/>
believed culprit was Choshu ronins.<br/>

<br/>
I think the main point of the question is Saito&#39;s capture and torture<br/>
part was completely invention of the scriptwriter.<br/>
The members who executed the assassination were, according to Shimozawa<br/>
Kan&#39;s book, Kondo, Okita, Harada,Nagakura and Inoue. And Nagakura said<br/>
there were also Hijikata, Shimada, and Yamazaki.<br/>
Anyway Saito&#39;s name didn&#39;t appear in this affair...<br/>

May be momoiro san could rectify or add something to what I wrote.<br/>
I&#39; d like to reply for other posts too but it will take more time.<br/>

P.S. I understand that for some people it would be shocking to see Saito<br/>
tied up and beaten like that!<br/>
