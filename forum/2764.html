<h3>NHK &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; OST II</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722030711">I don't know the specifics of what is on this release, but in case anyone is interested, a second volume of music from the taiga has recently come out and someone has uploaded it to d-addicts.  The torrent is named "NHK Shinsengumi! Drama - Original Soundtrack II" and is currently showing on the first page of the torrent list ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php">http://d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php</a> ).  If you leave it till later, just type in NHK Shinsengumi in the search field on that page (you don't have to specify anything else) and it'll bring up the OST torrents for the drama.  File size is approximately 110MB.<br/>
