<h3>Updates Fujita Goro +Tokio  Bio after 1868 + Nagakura Documentary</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828584302">According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.1to5.net/saito/index.html">http://www.1to5.net/saito/index.html</a><br/>
The Fujita family has donated the original photo(s) of their ancestor<br/>
to a location in Aizu for display.  <br/>

into <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate</a><br/>
I am *assuming this is meant to coincide with this SAturday's (9/24)<br/>
events at Aizu. Which include:<br/>
1) Shinsengumi parades/cosplay<br/>
2) "Who wants to be SAitou contest" (no detail on how to win this contest)<br/>
* The event will have Shinsengumi club members from all over Japan in<br/>
attendance and ofcourse the Aizu chapter will be doing alot of the work<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear which photograph, or if these are *new* photos. <br/>
Perhaps it is the photo printed in a magazine earlier this year of a<br/>
very old Fujita Goro at Tsuyoshi's (second son) wedding/engagement.<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Goro's time at Aomori (Northern Japan) after the defeat of the Aizu<br/>
domain still remains a mystery.  To read the sketchy details we have<br/>
and see a timeline go to the "FILES" section and open the "SAitou"<br/>
folder.  All we know is that he and his first wife Yaso lived in two<br/>
households: The Kurasawa family and another family.<br/>
<br/>
The Kurasawa home and the area in Aomori where many Aizu immigrants<br/>
lived is explored at this webpage<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/">http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/</a><br/>
There is 2 pages of info and photos specifically on Saitou here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/saitou.html">http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/saitou.html</a> (scroll to bottom to<br/>
go to the 2nd page)<br/>
<br/>
The Kurasawa family is related to Takagi Tokio.<br/>
Tokio was adopted into the Kurasawa family!  The very high possibility<br/>
remains that Mr. Fujita met Tokio while still married to Yaso.<br/>
But why was Tokio adopted---her own father was a senior inspector for<br/>
Aizu.<br/>
The answer seems to have been posted here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://8907.teacup.com/yazikita/bbs">http://8907.teacup.com/yazikita/bbs</a><br/>
Again, no text is cited so we don't know where the info is coming from<br/>
but it seems that both of Tokio's parents "died of illness", leaving<br/>
her without an older male relative to protect her or her younger<br/>
brother Goro (later known as Takagi Morinusuke).<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
I have been told by one of volunteer translators that Takagi<br/>
Morinusuke, later a Public Prosecutor or Chief Prosecutor should be<br/>
very "researchable" as he handled many important cases at Fukushima<br/>
and Hakodate.  He was famous and would've appeared in Meiji Era<br/>
newspapers.  Unfortunately many newspapers during the Meiji era are<br/>
not digitalized---you cannot "search" for names---you have to manually<br/>
search page by page in newspapers or try to find a specific case<br/>
Morinusuke prosecuted and "follow along". <br/>
<br/>
Why would Takagi Morinusuke be possibly important in terms of Fujita<br/>
Goro's biography?  We know that his sons studied kenjutsu with Uncle<br/>
Goro---clearly he was close with the Takagi family. If his sons wrote<br/>
down anecdotal stories about their studies with Uncle Goro---then you<br/>
have some valuable information.<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Tokio's Bio *before* 1868<br/>
This is based on a question and speculation by a Japanese fan (however<br/>
the reasoning is very sound).<br/>
"If the Takagi family was based in Edo---wouldn't Tokio have been<br/>
raised in the Matsudaira household?  More specifically the official<br/>
Aizu mansion in Edo?"<br/>
The poster, who seems to have an outstanding command of historical<br/>
minutia, is giving information which corroborates with the biography<br/>
of Matsudaira Katamori's own granddaughter (Princess Chichibu).  That<br/>
is the children of retainers are raised in the household of the<br/>
daimyo, in fact children of SERVANTS were also raised in a similar<br/>
fashion.  All of this makes sense.  Young Sada, Tokio, would need the<br/>
education and familiarity with etiquette needed to later work with<br/>
Teruhime.<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Several months ago, many TV stations aired a documentary on Nagakura<br/>
Shinpachi made by one of his descendants in the media industry.<br/>
This documentary recently won or atleast was nominated for a<br/>
prestigious award.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-458493243">By any chance do you know what the name of that documentary of Nagakura was?   Or any other minor detail like who aired it, who produced it, and other stuff like that?   This sounds like something intresting to watch.   Thank you ^_________^<br/>

<h3>Re: Updates Fujita Goro +Tokio  Bio...(BETTER VERSION of New Pic)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-835722196">Use http://www.nifty.com/globalgate<br/>
http://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/<br/>
is a blog run by the owner of a hot springs in Aizu<br/>
If you flip back through the archives you will read some neat little <br/>
things like "Sagawa Kanbei's descendant will be in the historical <br/>
parade and ride this horse {pic of horse}" and he posts -ALOT- of <br/>
cosplay stuff<br/>
<br/>
and neat details like "when I was a kid I used to swim in such and <br/>
such a pond which---Hijikata used" and stuff like that<br/>
<br/>
He is a long time fan of Saitou Hajime and he found out that one of <br/>
his ancestors was related to the Takagi family<br/>
He also has ties with Shinsengumi clubs all over Japan---to attract <br/>
people to his business---he had a mural of Hijikata completed on the <br/>
side of the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  "HE" yes HE is the very very very rare older gentleman who is a <br/>
Shinsengumi fan<br/>
<br/>
[For the HIJIKATA fans]<br/>
You have to go to the month of September to see photos of Hijikata's <br/>
descendants who visited Aizu<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I tried to make this simple...to see totally different pics of <br/>
KOJI (NHK Hijikata)<br/>
please <br/>
visithttp://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/archives/2005/09/index.h<br/>
tml<br/>
scroll down to 9/25 and 9/24<br/>
<br/>
[For the NAGAKURA fans]<br/>
http://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/archives/2005/10/index.html<br/>
scroll down to 10/11 to see pics of Nagakura's descendants visiting <br/>
the Fujita family grave<br/>
<br/>
[Fujita Goro]<br/>
lastly<br/>
The new photo of Fujita Goro, second son Tsuyoshi, daughter in law <br/>
(and likely in there Tokio I figure) taken in 1914 was printed in a <br/>
magazine and Tama had scanned the image for us a while back <br/>
<br/>
you are NOT allowed to take photos of the museum exhibits (located in <br/>
the reconstructed flying crane castle of Aizu)---however this fan just <br/>
couldn't help himself  (^_^) (the Aizu museum police should stumble on <br/>
his blog any day now...)<br/>
<br/>
look for 5/1 entry...keep scrolling past yet MORE pics of Koji<br/>
http://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/archives/2005/05/index.html<br/>
<br/>
the publication of the photo in the magazine led to some interesting <br/>
discussions on japanese boards regarding whether or not it was a <br/>
collage (very common practice in big group photos back then)<br/>
clearly from this sharper image you can tell that it was not a collage<br/>
{I had also forwarded this to someone who has studied western 19th <br/>
century photography and she agrees that it is NOT a collage}<br/>
<br/>
since he took the photo of the photo---I wish he wouuld've just went <br/>
ahead and gotten images of other items in the Fujita Goro/Saitou <br/>
Hajime display case (calligraphy by Yamakawa Kenjiro) Kenjiro's <br/>
calligraphy is very unique and I have samples to compare with<br/>
<br/>
another example of fans breaking the rules<br/>
the lot where the Fujita family residence once stood (other pages say <br/>
that since it is private property one shouldn't take pics)--again they <br/>
could not help themselves<br/>
http://denji102.geo.kyushu-<br/>
u.ac.jp/denji/student/obana/shinsen/hongo/hongo.html<br/>
just a coincedence that nearby there is a business? which has a sign <br/>
that says "Saitou Hajime"<br/>

<h3>Henry Schnell</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153634317">I think some people might enjoy this--<br/>
<br/>
The newspaper "The North-China Herald," in its article on 25 Sept. 1868 <br/>
("The Albion at Neegata"), describes Henry Schnell-- the Prussian gun runner <br/>
who became a senior councilor serving Matsudaira Katamori.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, he wore a kimono top, silk haori, red obi, either 2 Japanese <br/>
swords or one European cavalry saber, had his hair combed back from the <br/>
forehead, and wore trousers and long boots. Everyone bowed whenever they saw <br/>
him, and he was always accompanied by officials and a retinue.<br/>
<br/>
I am SURE he crossed paths with Hijikata Toshizo.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this might present somewhat of an interesting challenge to those of <br/>
you wanting to study or draw clothing of that era. I know I intend to do a <br/>
drawing of him in that outfit ASAP-- sounds delightfully eclectic!<br/>
<br/>
-M.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. But I think Hijikata in his suit looks cooler. :)</div>

He is also the inspiration for the character 'Herr Schnell' in the <br/>

targeted at young adults.  It was pretty good.  Several of the <br/>
characters are based on historical figures.  I think that Matsudaira <br/>
makes an appearance, but I do not remember if the Shinsengumi do.<br/>

I suppose this is a potential inspiration for some fiction:  the Vice-<br/>

boots....western underwear.  The NHK drama had a scene about this <br/>

How do you measure a samurai's inseams without getting yourself stuck <br/>
