<h3>Updates Fujita Goro +Tokio  Bio after 1868 + Nagakura Documentary</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828584302">According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.1to5.net/saito/index.html">http://www.1to5.net/saito/index.html</a><br/>
The Fujita family has donated the original photo(s) of their ancestor<br/>
to a location in Aizu for display.  <br/>

I am *assuming this is meant to coincide with this SAturday&#39;s (9/24)<br/>
events at Aizu. Which include:<br/>
1) Shinsengumi parades/cosplay<br/>
2) &quot;Who wants to be SAitou contest&quot; (no detail on how to win this contest)<br/>
* The event will have Shinsengumi club members from all over Japan in<br/>
attendance and ofcourse the Aizu chapter will be doing alot of the work<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear which photograph, or if these are *new* photos. <br/>
Perhaps it is the photo printed in a magazine earlier this year of a<br/>
very old Fujita Goro at Tsuyoshi&#39;s (second son) wedding/engagement.<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Goro&#39;s time at Aomori (Northern Japan) after the defeat of the Aizu<br/>
domain still remains a mystery.  To read the sketchy details we have<br/>
and see a timeline go to the &quot;FILES&quot; section and open the &quot;SAitou&quot;<br/>
folder.  All we know is that he and his first wife Yaso lived in two<br/>
households: The Kurasawa family and another family.<br/>
<br/>
The Kurasawa home and the area in Aomori where many Aizu immigrants<br/>
lived is explored at this webpage<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/">http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/</a><br/>
There is 2 pages of info and photos specifically on Saitou here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/saitou.html">http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/saitou.html</a> (scroll to bottom to<br/>
go to the 2nd page)<br/>
<br/>
The Kurasawa family is related to Takagi Tokio.<br/>
Tokio was adopted into the Kurasawa family!  The very high possibility<br/>
remains that Mr. Fujita met Tokio while still married to Yaso.<br/>
But why was Tokio adopted---her own father was a senior inspector for<br/>
Aizu.<br/>
The answer seems to have been posted here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://8907.teacup.com/yazikita/bbs">http://8907.teacup.com/yazikita/bbs</a><br/>
Again, no text is cited so we don&#39;t know where the info is coming from<br/>
but it seems that both of Tokio&#39;s parents &quot;died of illness&quot;, leaving<br/>
her without an older male relative to protect her or her younger<br/>
brother Goro (later known as Takagi Morinusuke).<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
I have been told by one of volunteer translators that Takagi<br/>
Morinusuke, later a Public Prosecutor or Chief Prosecutor should be<br/>
very &quot;researchable&quot; as he handled many important cases at Fukushima<br/>
and Hakodate.  He was famous and would&#39;ve appeared in Meiji Era<br/>
newspapers.  Unfortunately many newspapers during the Meiji era are<br/>
not digitalized---you cannot &quot;search&quot; for names---you have to manually<br/>
search page by page in newspapers or try to find a specific case<br/>
Morinusuke prosecuted and &quot;follow along&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Why would Takagi Morinusuke be possibly important in terms of Fujita<br/>
Goro&#39;s biography?  We know that his sons studied kenjutsu with Uncle<br/>
Goro---clearly he was close with the Takagi family. If his sons wrote<br/>
down anecdotal stories about their studies with Uncle Goro---then you<br/>
have some valuable information.<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Tokio&#39;s Bio *before* 1868<br/>
This is based on a question and speculation by a Japanese fan (however<br/>
the reasoning is very sound).<br/>
&quot;If the Takagi family was based in Edo---wouldn&#39;t Tokio have been<br/>
raised in the Matsudaira household?  More specifically the official<br/>
Aizu mansion in Edo?&quot;<br/>
The poster, who seems to have an outstanding command of historical<br/>
minutia, is giving information which corroborates with the biography<br/>
of Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s own granddaughter (Princess Chichibu).  That<br/>
is the children of retainers are raised in the household of the<br/>
daimyo, in fact children of SERVANTS were also raised in a similar<br/>
fashion.  All of this makes sense.  Young Sada, Tokio, would need the<br/>
education and familiarity with etiquette needed to later work with<br/>
Teruhime.<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Several months ago, many TV stations aired a documentary on Nagakura<br/>
Shinpachi made by one of his descendants in the media industry.<br/>
This documentary recently won or atleast was nominated for a<br/>
prestigious award.<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-2561">&gt;</a> Re: Updates Fujita Goro +Tokio  Bio...(BETTER VERSION of New Pic)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-835722196">Use http://www.nifty.com/globalgate<br/>
http://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/<br/>
is a blog run by the owner of a hot springs in Aizu<br/>
If you flip back through the archives you will read some neat little <br/>
things like &quot;Sagawa Kanbei&#39;s descendant will be in the historical <br/>
parade and ride this horse {pic of horse}&quot; and he posts -ALOT- of <br/>
cosplay stuff<br/>
<br/>
and neat details like &quot;when I was a kid I used to swim in such and <br/>
such a pond which---Hijikata used&quot; and stuff like that<br/>
<br/>
He is a long time fan of Saitou Hajime and he found out that one of <br/>
his ancestors was related to the Takagi family<br/>
He also has ties with Shinsengumi clubs all over Japan---to attract <br/>
people to his business---he had a mural of Hijikata completed on the <br/>
side of the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  &quot;HE&quot; yes HE is the very very very rare older gentleman who is a <br/>
Shinsengumi fan<br/>
<br/>
[For the HIJIKATA fans]<br/>
You have to go to the month of September to see photos of Hijikata&#39;s <br/>
descendants who visited Aizu<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I tried to make this simple...to see totally different pics of <br/>
KOJI (NHK Hijikata)<br/>
please <br/>
visithttp://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/archives/2005/09/index.h<br/>
tml<br/>
scroll down to 9/25 and 9/24<br/>
<br/>
[For the NAGAKURA fans]<br/>
http://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/archives/2005/10/index.html<br/>
scroll down to 10/11 to see pics of Nagakura&#39;s descendants visiting <br/>
the Fujita family grave<br/>
<br/>
[Fujita Goro]<br/>
lastly<br/>
The new photo of Fujita Goro, second son Tsuyoshi, daughter in law <br/>
(and likely in there Tokio I figure) taken in 1914 was printed in a <br/>
magazine and Tama had scanned the image for us a while back <br/>
<br/>
you are NOT allowed to take photos of the museum exhibits (located in <br/>
the reconstructed flying crane castle of Aizu)---however this fan just <br/>
couldn&#39;t help himself  (^_^) (the Aizu museum police should stumble on <br/>
his blog any day now...)<br/>
<br/>
look for 5/1 entry...keep scrolling past yet MORE pics of Koji<br/>
http://www.aizu.com/ryokan/fudoutaki/blog/archives/2005/05/index.html<br/>
<br/>
the publication of the photo in the magazine led to some interesting <br/>
discussions on japanese boards regarding whether or not it was a <br/>
collage (very common practice in big group photos back then)<br/>
clearly from this sharper image you can tell that it was not a collage<br/>
{I had also forwarded this to someone who has studied western 19th <br/>
century photography and she agrees that it is NOT a collage}<br/>
<br/>
since he took the photo of the photo---I wish he wouuld&#39;ve just went <br/>
ahead and gotten images of other items in the Fujita Goro/Saitou <br/>
Hajime display case (calligraphy by Yamakawa Kenjiro) Kenjiro&#39;s <br/>
calligraphy is very unique and I have samples to compare with<br/>
<br/>
another example of fans breaking the rules<br/>
the lot where the Fujita family residence once stood (other pages say <br/>
that since it is private property one shouldn&#39;t take pics)--again they <br/>
could not help themselves<br/>
http://denji102.geo.kyushu-<br/>
u.ac.jp/denji/student/obana/shinsen/hongo/hongo.html<br/>
just a coincedence that nearby there is a business? which has a sign <br/>
that says &quot;Saitou Hajime&quot;<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-2642">&gt;</a> Henry Schnell</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153634317">I think some people might enjoy this--<br/>
<br/>
The newspaper &quot;The North-China Herald,&quot; in its article on 25 Sept. 1868 <br/>
(&quot;The Albion at Neegata&quot;), describes Henry Schnell-- the Prussian gun runner <br/>
who became a senior councilor serving Matsudaira Katamori.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, he wore a kimono top, silk haori, red obi, either 2 Japanese <br/>
swords or one European cavalry saber, had his hair combed back from the <br/>
forehead, and wore trousers and long boots. Everyone bowed whenever they saw <br/>
him, and he was always accompanied by officials and a retinue.<br/>
<br/>
I am SURE he crossed paths with Hijikata Toshizo.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this might present somewhat of an interesting challenge to those of <br/>
you wanting to study or draw clothing of that era. I know I intend to do a <br/>
drawing of him in that outfit ASAP-- sounds delightfully eclectic!<br/>
<br/>
-M.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. But I think Hijikata in his suit looks cooler. :)</div>

targeted at young adults.  It was pretty good.  Several of the <br/>

I suppose this is a potential inspiration for some fiction:  the Vice-<br/>
commander&#39;s new clothes....the use of buttons and wearing <br/>
boots....western underwear.  The NHK drama had a scene about this <br/>
that was pretty cute.  <br/>
<br/>
How do you measure a samurai&#39;s inseams without getting yourself stuck <br/>
with a sharp object that is not a straight pin?....and all the while <br/>
Ito hovers about wearing a tape measure like a feather boa....<br/>
