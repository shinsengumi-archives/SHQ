<h3>Question for Tama-san</h3>

<br/>
(for those who don't know Japanese, that's "I have a question" ^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I'm conducting research on the Boshin War, and I was wondering-- is there <br/>
anywhere I can get a list of the hatamoto and gokenin of Nagaoka han? This <br/>
was the domain in Echigo, ruled by the daimyo Makino Tadayuki, and was <br/>
famous for having the local army under Kawai Tsuginosuke, using Gatling <br/>
guns. Any information would be VERY much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Domo arigatou gozaimasu!!!<br/>

<br/>
I think it means hanshi (or hanshin) of Nagaoka han, because the term <br/>
hatamoto and gokenin are reserved for Shogun's direct retainers.<br/>
After googling on the net, I couldn't find out any list of Nagaoka hanshi.<br/>
<br/>
May be you already knew these sites, but I put some adresses.<br/>
