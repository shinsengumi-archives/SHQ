<h3>Happy 4th!  Fujita Goro + Koga</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-875438628">I already mentioned on the messageboard that <br/>
Fujita Goro had (gasp) a friend (just because he was quiet does not<br/>
mean that he was anti-social LOL!) in the TMPD named &quot;Koga&quot; (they even<br/>
lived near each other.<br/>
<br/>
You can read about Mr. Koga at <br/>
(cut and paste)<br/>

*the webmaster says that their families must have known each other<br/>
(sec imagines Mrs. Fujita gossiping with Mrs. Koga)<br/>
(go to the main page and see pics from the NHK studio tour)<br/>
<br/>
3-hajime.com messageboard mentions a novel starring Fujita Goro<br/>
&quot;&quot;Metropolitan Police Department -- album leaves -- the novel &quot;<br/>
(no Wounds, I have tried I can&#39;t find the isbn number---but I really<br/>
want to!)<br/>
<br/>
which I guess is connected to the stage play mentioned here<br/>

***here is the connection &quot;Mr. Koga&quot; his friend is also featured in<br/>
this play unless ofcourse I am misreading everything<br/>
<br/>
as we all know...&quot;all characters shown in this play/novel resembling<br/>
real or historic people are entirely coincidental blah blah blah&quot; yeah<br/>
sure whatever...<br/>
<br/>
something tells me that a playwright/novelist did some serious research<br/>
<br/>
*~* Have a wonderful 4th of July! *~*</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924307583">Hmmm... People are identified with the friends they keep... I haven&#39;t <br/>
read the link yet Sec but I will. I really want to know how Fujita-<br/>
san was as a person...<br/>
<br/>
As for the book, would you happen to know the romaji title? Ah well <br/>
drop me a line if you do find it... I&#39;ll keep my eyes open just in <br/>
case though...<br/>
