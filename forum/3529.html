<div id="ygrps-yiv-558789422"><p>Since I&#39;m just starting any information is helpful. I&#39;m hoping to be able to focus on Kawakami Gensai since he will be a major supporting character to my fictionalized shishi character. I will of course introduce Kido, Ryoma,and Saigo, but for now I&#39;m more interested in information on Kawakami. The other three information is abundant.</p><p>Another topic I&#39;d like to try and find information on is the Sehiko Army or the False Army.I&#39;m under the understanding that a at one time captain of the shinsengumi was the 2nd captain of this small army.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">so I guess in general as much information on the shishi would be fabulous.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">btw my thesis application was denied, but that won&#39;t stop me from writing this story.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Thanks so much &nbsp;</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-558789422ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &lt;shq@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-558789422ygrps-yiv-558775951">Hello,<div>I&#39;m doing research on Gensai Kawakami, He is a fairly large character in my story. the master of my fictional male character.
