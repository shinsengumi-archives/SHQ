<h3>Gensai Kawakami</h3>
by <i>pilgrimscribe</i>
<br/><br/>
Hello, <br/> I'm doing research on Gensai Kawakami, He is a fairly large character in my story. the master of my fictional male character. Trying to find information on him has not been easy. What Han did he go to after Kumamoto? I'm getting the idea that he aligned more or less with Choshu, but I want to clarify Choshu or Satsuma. Does anyone know? Or could guide me to some reading that would help shed light on this?<br/> Thanks so much<br/> Sarah<br/>Hello,<p></p><div>I'm doing research on Gensai Kawakami, He is a fairly large character in my story. the master of my fictional male character.

Since I'm just starting any information is helpful. I'm hoping to be able to focus on Kawakami Gensai since he will be a major supporting character to my fictionalized shishi character. I will of course introduce Kido, Ryoma,and Saigo, but for now I'm more interested in information on Kawakami. The other three information is abundant.<br/> Another topic I'd like to try and find information on is the Sehiko Army or the False Army.I'm under the understanding that a at one time captain of the shinsengumi was the 2nd captain of this small army. <br/> <br/><br/> so I guess in general as much information on the shishi would be fabulous.<br/> <br/><br/> btw my thesis application was denied, but that won't stop me from writing this story. <br/> Thanks so much  <br/> <br/><br/>---In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, <shq@yahoogroups.com> wrote:<br/><br/> Hello, I'm doing research on Gensai Kawakami, He is a fairly large character in my story. the master of my fictional male character.
