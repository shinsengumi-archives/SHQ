<h3>Apology</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074299303">I&#39;m sorry, everyone. In my rush out the door I received that email message <br/>
about the alleged truth behind the Hitokiri Battousai&#39;s existence, and did <br/>
not bother to read through it carefully. As a historian-in-training, this is <br/>
a true shame on me, and for that, I humbly ask your forgiveness. I&#39;ll try <br/>
not to be so stupid from now on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648459979">There is no need to apologize.<br/>
I would also like to add that this is a very instructive example of <br/>
how one should cite textual resources when providing new info.<br/>
