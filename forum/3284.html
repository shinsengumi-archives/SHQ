<h3>The &quot;BS&quot; Business</h3>
by <i>anreg1</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-876300128">It is truly a sad day for 'free speech' and critical, objective <br/>
scholarly analysis. The actions and writings of BS smack of the old-<br/>
style Soviet custom of 'disinformation', which means that if you keep <br/>
on repeating untruths long enough, people start believing them.<br/>
<br/>
By surpressing objective analysis of his work BS is putting <br/>
disinformation into play and what he wrote will eventually become <br/>
the 'truth' for many who read his work without the benefit of a <br/>
scholarly analysis of it. <br/>
<br/>
One of my regrets is that I even bought that book in the first place, <br/>
given the turn of events. But when I purchased it, I was less <br/>
informed about the subject matter than I am now. But people learn. I <br/>
certainly will not buy anything else that BS has written in the past <br/>
or will write in the future.<br/>
<br/>
As you mentioned, he should be thanking the researcher. (He should be <br/>
paying the researcher for correcting his errors!) BS could have used <br/>
the critique as an opportunity to write a 'revised' edition the next <br/>
time the book was printed. This may have increased his sales, because <br/>
perhaps people would buy a second copy of the book just to get the <br/>
corrected information. BS isn't as smart as he thinks. He just passed <br/>
up a money making opportunity!<br/>
<br/>
If the mods think that my comments may get the message board into <br/>
trouble, please feel free to delete this post.</div>

<br/>
True!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore there was a way out other than simply making a post<br/>
"disappear".<br/>
<br/>
The way out would've been for BS to reply under a username and dispute<br/>
the review point by point.<br/>
<br/>
The review cited Japanese works which are well known to researchers<br/>
and Japanese fans.  BS knows the review cannot be disputed because<br/>
those are facts which BS cannot reconcile with the text which was<br/>
designed a "certain way" to push a certain interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi enthusiasts in their native land -do- read and discuss the<br/>
same issues we do here, they review books as well too.  This is not a<br/>
matter of taking "sides" if some Japanese read BS they may say worst<br/>
and they'll even throw more sources at BS to prove the text wrong<br/>
point by point.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can see the official page of BS on a well known internet book<br/>
store.<br/>
<br/>
There were some interesting reviews there too.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between those reviews and what BS was unhappy is that<br/>
the review -deleted- basically nailed the text.<br/>
<br/>
BS needs to go and argue with the Japanese authors not the messenger<br/>
who quoted those works.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
People have taken similar cases on free speech to the supreme court<br/>
you know.  <br/>
<br/>
And look at us...I've been fair and even pimped the book on SHQ! <br/>
Serious, we probably comprise a large number of people who bought the<br/>
work too...<br/>
<br/>
What is BS saying? "thanks for buying my BS, but you can't find errors<br/>
in it otherwise I get unhappy"<br/>
<br/>
These posts do not mention any names at all.  There are no grounds for<br/>
legal action or intimidation whatsover.  I had to delete stuff cuz<br/>
someone wanted to exercise understandably the utmost caution.<br/>
Again BS would have to prove the work is BS (^_^)<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
When we post a short, concise essay about how the Imperial Army was<br/>
founded illegally:<br/>
<br/>
1) waged war illegally via the use of a FORGED IMPERIAL<br/>
EDICT--resulting in the deaths of countless of civilians in Aizu and<br/>
northern domains<br/>
2) bore illegal Imperial standards (because some were made by Okubo<br/>
Toshimichi---this was from a "pro" Okubo bio! ^_^ )<br/>
3) stole bakufu property (the STONEWALL battleship) and in one<br/>
case...bakufu guns (this undermines the popular view that the<br/>
shogunate was not modernizing, if it wasn't how come it had so many<br/>
toys the Imperialists wanted? The bakufu not the Meiji had already<br/>
brought in French personel for modernizing the army!).<br/>
4) first democratic elections (ok it's just a small group of guys)<br/>
took place amongst samurai at Hakodate---buy the remnants of the<br/>
bakufu men (Enomoto, western educated, and our Hijikata Toshizo). <br/>
<br/>
The list can go on and on and everything above is from good texts.<br/>
<br/>
These are not popular views but they are the finer details sacrificed<br/>
for the sake of a master narrative designed for a people to feel<br/>
fierce pride for their nation---without understanding we're all human<br/>
beings, we're all good and bad---what's up with the LIES?  <br/>
<br/>
And all this info is gonna appear on a humble fansite, all shock full<br/>
of citation (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants to question us can go right ahead, cross check our<br/>
work a million times.<br/>
<br/>
We're not afraid of a different opinion because we stick to the facts.<br/>
 They can present their facts in the same way and we'll put stuff side<br/>
by side.  <br/>
<br/>
Suddenly the Boshin war takes on a new dimension and then you start to<br/>
 understand why people were mad, why they fought and why blood was shed.</div>
