<h3>Inoue Genzaburo & family</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-692620002">I notice here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/inoue.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/inoue.htm</a> it states "He<br/>
was born in Tama County (1829, March 1st) in Hino, as the third son of<br/>
Inoue Matsugorou, of the Hachiouji Sennin Toushin." - however a short<br/>
biography I have of him in the Gakken Rekishi Gunzo Shinsengumi book<br/>
(2003) states that he is the son of Inoue Touzaemon. It goes on to say<br/>
that Inoue Matsugorou is Genzaburou's (second) older brother, and<br/>
Inoue Taisuke is Matsugorou's son.  I see on that link that it<br/>
mentions that the second son eventually changed his name to<br/>
Matsugorou, so it makes sense, but could I get some clarification<br/>
here? Was Inoue Touzaemon AKA Matsugorou?  Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494671204">I hope that some of the more knowledgeable members than I will be able <br/>
to answer your question.<br/>
But for now I'd like to mention that I'd be very grateful if you can <br/>
provide the ISBN number for Gakken Rekishi Gunzo Shinsengumi so I can <br/>
get the full citation and note this additional information on Inoue's <br/>
page.  It is possible that the two names may be labels for the same <br/>
guy, an alternate reading of the name or this is discrepency which <br/>
should be noted (in any case I don't know Japanese so I'm not helpful).<br/>
It's our policy to put all details, whether or not they are conflicting <br/>
side by side on the site and whatever information you have would <br/>
greatly enhance our understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to add that we have an enormous body of Japanese texts <br/>
(usually older and rare from the Aizu side which cannot be purchased) <br/>
which needs to be translated.  Right now we only have Hirotada Tokugawa <br/>
who has taken upon himself to do the work---if anyone would like to <br/>
volunteer please contact us. Ofcourse what interests the volunteer is <br/>
most important and we'll find something to match your passion. For <br/>
instance I recently scanned a detailed narrative on the Kinmon "the <br/>
gate incident" and we have Yamakawa Hiroshi's Kyoto Shugoshoku.... book <br/>
a pillar text on Aizu's role as head of security in the capital <br/>
therefore this text is incredibly vital to understanding the context in <br/>
which the Shinsengumi operated.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays everyone...as soon as the computer lab opens I'll try to <br/>
catch up with updating <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a>  (alot of stuff <br/>
from Hirotada Tokugawa and some stuff Michael recommended).  As for me, <br/>
I'm still gathering info for the timeline and doing some more work on <br/>
Unmasking the Meiji Era <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Ishin-1.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Ishin-1.htm</a><br/>
We welcome any contribution.  Say wouldn't it be neat if we could make <br/>
trailers for Shinsengumi movies (like for instance our own fantasy <br/>
movie?)<br/>
<br/>
For now please occasionally check<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm interested in member biographies for the moment, particularly the<br/>
lesser known members without much info, so if you have anything<br/>
applicable, let me know, and I'd be willing to pull out some useful info.</div>
