I posted info and downloadable zip file on &quot;Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s<br/>
Page&quot; Takamine Hideo who bore the serving trays to the daimyo between<br/>
the critical months of April to September 1868.  Hideo was 15 that<br/>
year and as a young man recognized for his intelligence he may have<br/>
had more important jobs. As Matsudaira&#39;s page he would have incredible<br/>
insight into the army&#39;s retreat and various negotiations, keep in mind<br/>
that he may very well have met Hijikata Toshizo & Co at Aizu. So<br/>
sometimes to get really good info look for possible &quot;informants&quot; and<br/>
check to see if they left memoirs.  <br/>
<br/>
(some of the translations on the following pages required the<br/>
assistance of up to 3 volunteer translators to *confirm* the little<br/>
details which did not appear in earlier translations)  Takamine<br/>
Hideo&#39;s daughter had memories of both Tokio and Goro<br/>

*now with a bit more info on her brother Morinusuke and confirmation<br/>
from 2 volunteer translators on Tokio&#39;s mother who had a reputation<br/>
for being a beautiful woman<br/>
[note] the Tokio page does have alot of information but there are also<br/>
images as well if you go to the timeline look at the year 1889 and see<br/>
an image of a graduating class---these were the girls Tokio mentored.<br/>
