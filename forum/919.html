<h3>Kyoto Patrol Districts!!!</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-666283497">You guys!!!! (jumps up and down) Get this! On page 7 of the guidebook<br/>
to the NHK series, I found a map of Kyoto with the different districts<br/>
that the different patrol groups ran, as of July 1866!!! I&#39;ve posted a<br/>
sketch of it (I don&#39;t have access to a scanner right now) in the<br/>
Photos section!!!<br/>
<br/>
Interesting thing of note-- Shinsengumi didn&#39;t patrol a large area,<br/>
but they DID patrol the area around their HQ which included Shimabara<br/>
(w/courtesans and all), which is on the left side of the map I posted,<br/>
AND, they patrolled what I think is Gion (the geisha/teahouse<br/>
district), which is the one on the right side. Leave it to our guys to<br/>
get all the babes....lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083132297">Really? That&#39;s uber-sugoi! OMG that&#39;ll definitely send a big leap for my manga. And when I go to Japan someday I&#39;ll be sure to check out those areas while in Shinsengumi uniform. Wow! Now I have more to visit than just Kyoto and Mibu...<br/>
<br/>
I ought to start saving! I&#39;ll do some more research and see if I can&#39;t find anything else interesting to send back to you as a thanks for that ^.^x<br/>

novel/manga myself.<br/>
<br/>
As for going to Japan, I&#39;m going there next year, and I&#39;ll be in<br/>
Osaka, 20 minutes away from Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us updated on your work! If there&#39;s anything (sketches, etc.),<br/>
you&#39;ve done so far, please show us!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400662383">Thank you very much! *grins* I&#39;ve been working on it for a long while. At first, it was based on the Ishin Shishi, but then I fell in love with the Shinsengumi. I&#39;ll post some pics as soon as I can! Also, the link is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fictionpress.com/read.php?storyid=1519468.">http://www.fictionpress.com/read.php?storyid=1519468.</a><br/>
 <br/>
I want to read yours too! It&#39;s really hard finding Shinsengumi fans nowadays. *sighs* I&#39;m really glad that this group has been started and all. Keep the fandom alive and long live the Shinsengumi! ^.^x<br/>

I&#39;m so envious.  One of my daughter&#39;s close friends is currently in Japan, but I&#39;m not sure where he is and it&#39;s only for a month.  How long are you going to be there, M.?<br/>

I&#39;m going in August 2005 and returning June 2006. And then hopefully<br/>
I&#39;l l be able to get a job there teaching, straight out of college,<br/>
after June 2007.<br/>

posting it.<br/>
<br/>
Now if we could only come across what &quot;uniforms&quot; or distinguishing <br/>
things the other patrol groups wore it would definitely be a writer&#39;s <br/>
dream come true.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180726936">Thanks so much Masayoshi! I&#39;ve been wondering about this with the <br/>
fic I was doing... It&#39;s nice to know my instincts were right after <br/>
all! WEEEE!!!! The Mimawarigumi&#39;s also have a patrol site close to <br/>
the our boys, ah you have no idea how easier you made my life get... <br/>
Thanks again!!!<br/>
