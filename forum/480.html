<h3>Fourth part of Watsuki&#39;s interview</h3>
by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-644386958">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Here is the fourth par of Watsuki's interview. I didn't translate the <br/>
first half of it, as the focus was more on Watsuki's work as an <br/>
assistant during his teenage years. The second half is what really <br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
It's true that it's sad, for Shinsengumi fans, that some ideas <br/>
expressed here never were concretise, but reading some of Watsuki's <br/>
answers, I wonder if finally, it's not a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I let you be judge. The notes at the bottom are the ones of the <br/>
French version, so "he is now about to do it" refers to last summer.<br/>
<br/>
Mary-Ann<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
"I want to draw a hero who evolves along with the series"<br/>
<br/>
Q- To sum up, Rurouni Kenshin was your first manga, and at first, you <br/>
often said that you preferred Shojo, but during the Kyoto Arc, you <br/>
discovered how interesting drawing Shonen was. Which kind of manga <br/>
will you choose to draw next?<br/>
<br/>
W- I will repeat myself, but since I discovered the joys of drawing <br/>
Shonen, I just want to draw more. As Kenshin was the kind of <br/>
character who is strong from the start, in my next manga, I want to <br/>
picture a hero who will become stronger and wiser as the time goes <br/>
by. For that, he will have, of course, to win battles, but it will be <br/>
close calls.<br/>
<br/>
"And now that Rurouni Kenshin is over?"<br/>
<br/>
Q- Does that mean that the hero of your next manga will be a young <br/>
boy?<br/>
<br/>
W- Everything is not decided yet, but yes it will be a young boy of <br/>
about thirteen or fourteen years old. I will also create another type <br/>
of character, which I couldn't picture in Rurouni Kenshin: the strong <br/>
and powerful heroine.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Doesn't Kaoru and Misao belong in that category?<br/>
<br/>
W- More or less. I would want to picture someone even stronger, at an <br/>
equal stand with the hero I would also like to create dumb <br/>
characters, as Banjin or Cho, who are pleasures to draw. This time, I <br/>
would want to have them as main characters. (laughs) In Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin, the characters were a little too deep, they had internal <br/>
conflicts, a side of their personality they were hiding and that they <br/>
didn't want to show to others, etc. This time, I would prefer <br/>
characters who are easy to understand and who, without all of those <br/>
complex character traits, would be better. (laughs).<br/>
<br/>
Q- In which era would this story take place? In modern days?<br/>
<br/>
W- Yes, I'll stop drawing historical mangas for now. If one day, I <br/>
want to draw historical mangas again, I will do it, but until then, I <br/>
only wish to draw stories that happen in today's world.<br/>
<br/>
Q- You already draw one, "Meteor Strike", no?<br/>
<br/>
W- Yes. There's that one. (laughs). When I drew it, I was taking two <br/>
weeks off Rurouni Kenshin and the planning was really tight. There <br/>
are many things in that manga that I would have like to change, and <br/>
when I read it back, I can see that it was a very moronic story, but <br/>
it's not that bad. (laughs). At least, they didn't let me write a <br/>
story where Kenshin was hit by a meteor. (laughs).<br/>
<br/>
Q- The episode shown at the end of the Kenshin Kaden vol. 2, is <br/>
officially ending the series, but do you have any regrets, or <br/>
something you would have want to draw, but couldn't?<br/>
<br/>
W- In fact, whoever reads the end of the Kyoto Arc understands that <br/>
Soujiro leaves for Hokkaido. At the time, I wanted to draw another <br/>
arc later on, located in that area, and where Soujiro would have been <br/>
on the Kenshingumi's side.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Are you talking about the Hokkaido Arc that so many people wanted <br/>
to read? [1]<br/>
<br/>
W- Yes. I also wanted to introduce a new character during that arc: <br/>
Shinpachi Nagakura, the Shinsengumi second division's captain, in <br/>
accordance with the possibilities. But I thought about it a lot, and <br/>
I preferred ending the series with the Revenge Arc, so the Hokkaido <br/>
Arc never saw the day.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Was the Hokkaido Arc a darker or a more hopeful arc?<br/>
<br/>
W- It was a happier arc. I had envisioned it as a kind of Western. <br/>
The government's army would have been the cavalry, Hokkaido's new <br/>
inhabitants and the samourai-peasents [2] would have been the <br/>
settlers, people without a precise goal and who would have wander <br/>
until then would have been the outlaws and, finally, the natives <br/>
would have been the Indians And the Kenshingumi would arrive in the <br/>
middle of all of that.<br/>
<br/>
Q- It seems to be very different from what we saw so far in the rest <br/>
of the manga, no?<br/>
<br/>
W- Well we can't always draw the same kind of things. (laughs). <br/>
Also, with the end of the Revenge Arc, the main theme of Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin had come to an end: what marked Kenshin's character the most, <br/>
his culpability, his search for an answer, for a way of explaining <br/>
the crimes he committed. That's why the following arc should have <br/>
been completely different, if not, it wouldn't have made sense. <br/>
That's why I had imagined a sort of western. (laughs). It would be <br/>
very funny to surprise the readers with a wagon full of American's <br/>
settlers appearing right in the middle of all of that. (laughs).<br/>
<br/>
Q- Aside from Soujiro, which other characters did you wanted to re-<br/>
use for this Arc?<br/>
<br/>
W- I would have like to re-use Fuji. It could have been interesting <br/>
to make him intervene precisely when Kenshin was in danger. I thought <br/>
that Fuji looked very cool when he was digging the fields in <br/>
Hokkaido. Anji is also imprisoned in Hokkaido, so I would have made <br/>
him reappear. As he is the only character who haven't been <br/>
spiritually "salved", it bothered me, and I finally wanted to offer <br/>
him a second chance in life.<br/>
<br/>
Q- You already had a clear idea of the plot, don't you think that <br/>
many readers would want to read that arc now that you're telling us <br/>
more about it?<br/>
<br/>
W- Hum Yes, but no. I prefer using the ideas I got for that arc in <br/>
my next manga.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Really. (laughs). Then, let me ask you when are you going to start <br/>
working on that new manga? [3]<br/>
<br/>
W- I'm only working on the main lines of the plot right now, so I <br/>
really don't know. I wish to start really working on it by the middle <br/>
of next year.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Will it be very different, in style and spirit, from Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin?<br/>
<br/>
W- Yes, I would like to create an as interesting story, but from a <br/>
different perspective. That said, I'm still the same author, hence I <br/>
think that the basis of both stories will be very similar. Of course, <br/>
I will use what I learned from Rurouni Kenshin.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Rurouni Kenshin being your first series, you must have learn a lot?<br/>
<br/>
W- Enormously. There were some passages where I lost focus and there <br/>
are a lot of hiccups, but aside of that, it's true that I learned a <br/>
lot while working on that manga. It brought me a lot, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Which was the most important thing to you during those five years?<br/>
<br/>
W- My readers' support. Drawing manga is my job, yes, but being able <br/>
to draw what I really want, and to realise that the public loves it, <br/>
is very satisfying. Every time a reader told me that he liked this or <br/>
that in my manga, it gave me a boost of energy. The readers are <br/>
everything to an author.<br/>
<br/>
Q- Do you have something to say to the readers who have follow your <br/>
work until now?<br/>
<br/>
W- Thanks, thanks to all, thanks a lot. That's mostly what I want to <br/>
say. If they also want to read my next manga, I will be very happy. I <br/>
will do my best, so see you!<br/>
<br/>
Q- I would like to thank you for the time you took for this very long <br/>
interview.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[1] : There had been a short report in Shonen Jump about the Hokkaido <br/>
Arc, which finally never saw the day, as the series ended with the <br/>
Revenge Arc. Many Shinengumi fans were disappointed by this decision, <br/>
along with Soujiro fans.<br/>
<br/>
[2] : Due to financial problems, those samurai were peasants, but in <br/>
times of conflicts, they were ready to take up arms in case the <br/>
border had to be defended against Russia.<br/>
<br/>
[3] : The Kenshin Kaden vol. 2 has been published at the end of 1999 <br/>
in Japan, so this interview also took place by the end of that year. <br/>
The manga which they are talking about hence is "Gun Blaze West", <br/>
which has been published in Shonen Jump but suddenly stopped after <br/>
only three volumes. Since then, Watsuki hasn't draw anything, but he <br/>
is now about to do it.</div>

Thank you so much for translating that for us!<br/>
<br/>
The Hokkaido Arc would have been so cool. After how Watsuki brought <br/>
Saitou back to life in such an incredible way I would die to see how <br/>
he'd give us Shinpachi. (he'd be no band-aid wearing moppet I'm sure).<br/>

<br/>
I'm [devastated]...a Hokkaido arc w/ Nagakura Shinpachi...ofcourse he<br/>
would have to explain how Nagakura ended up there and why...we were<br/>
cheated out of a depiction of Hijikata and the remaining Shinsengumi<br/>
at Goryokaku.  It would've been an amazing arc because N.W. would have<br/>
to deal with Soujiro...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351697153">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Barb and Tiffany thanks for the quick feedback. It's good to know <br/>
that the interview interested you. (^-^) I hadn't thought about <br/>
putting it in the files section, but it's a good idea and it's <br/>
definitely the next thing I'm going to do.<br/>
<br/>
For those who didn't knew, "Gun Blaze West" was Watsuki's next manga <br/>
and its publication stopped after only three volumes as the story was <br/>
not a huge success. After RK, the fans' expectations were really <br/>
high Those three volumes have been translated and published in <br/>
German anyway and some group in France are trying to convince Glénat <br/>
(RK's publisher) to translate it as well. I don't know if it will <br/>
work, but it's true that even if the story wasn't successful in <br/>
Japan, many RK fans will probably buy it just to see (I'm definitely <br/>
among them).<br/>
<br/>
Watsuki wrote the one-shot "Meteor Strike" for a contest in Shonen <br/>
Jump. That one-shot has been enclosed at the end of the French <br/>
version of RK vol. 28. In his notes about that story, Watsuki says <br/>
that it revolved around three themes: a meteor, a young boy wearing <br/>
construction gloves, and a young girl wearing a helmet. Watsuki says <br/>
that it's a "moronic" story, but it's not that bad. There are a few <br/>
very good jokes<br/>

Can't thank you enough for translating the Hokkaido Arc interview... <br/>
I'm quite devastated that it didn't push through... It would've been <br/>
so cool to see Shinpachi and Soujirou as main characters, but most of <br/>
all I'll still have more RK Saitou goodness to read... Remember Aoshi <br/>
said Saitou was in Hokkaido... *cries* I wonder how Watsuki would've <br/>
portrayed Shinpachi, his relationship with Saitou and all that <br/>
goodness. <br/>
<br/>
I can't believe he chose to deviate from writing historical manga... <br/>
I mean yeah it's been discussed before and many times that the his <br/>
following mangas were not "par" with RK. Didn't he for once think <br/>
that "I will be the King of Historical Manga". Why oh why did he <br/>
stopped...<br/>
