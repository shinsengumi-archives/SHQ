MissB found some intriguing info for us regarding Aizu settlers in <br/>
California in 1869.  I have grabbed the pdf file and placed it in <br/>
the &quot;Files&quot; section for future reference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299675810">I wish I could give a positive update...but here is what I got via<br/>
email...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;there is some concern with the issue of intellectual property<br/>
rights of the photo images.  This is currently being considered by the<br/>
Department of Parks and Recreation legal staff.  The photos were not<br/>
taken by the newspaper.    However, I can send to you information on<br/>
the Wakamatsu site that is included in the state registry program.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
things to keep in mind are...California is suffering a state deficit<br/>
and -maybe- that is why these items have taken so long to go through<br/>
the preservation and recording process.  The California State Park<br/>
received these items in 2001[!] and the museum which will in the<br/>
future house the items is a very very small museum in the middle of a<br/>
nature preserve complete with park rangers (this is based on a<br/>
assumption that there are hiking trails etc).  Sadly, the individuals<br/>
I contacted were not able to divulge even if the sword&#39;s tang bears<br/>
any identifying feature such as the maker&#39;s name.  I also asked what<br/>
-kind- of bowl is in possession of the park.  My other question was<br/>
the dimension of the white silk banner. <br/>
<br/>
I thought I would get the photos by now (basically I was expecting<br/>
like a brochure/pamphlet thing which museums print---wasn&#39;t looking<br/>
for anything fancy)...as the person even requested my mailing address.<br/>
<br/>
So in conclusion...as of this moment we have nothing (-_-)<br/>
Hopefully, in the future, such educational facilities such as museums<br/>
will be able to address the enthusiasm the public may have for items<br/>
in their possession.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582257185">***Update***<br/>
Artifacts from Aizu 1870s owned by the State Parks in<br/>
California<br/>
finally DETAILS :)<br/>
<br/>
1) the banner is approximately 3x5 feet<br/>
[thinking] this is a small banner, perhaps worn at the back of a <br/>
cavalryman?<br/>
<br/>
2) the sword is a short sword about 20 inches long; <br/>
[thinking] does anyone know samurai burial practices?  what happen <br/>
to the longsword?<br/>
<br/>
3) the bowl is bronze about 8 inches in radius. <br/>
[thinking] bronze conducts heat...this bowl is not used for eating?  <br/>
perhaps for another purpose requiring cool water?<br/>
<br/>
still waiting for stuff in the mail...<br/>
<br/>
IF ANYONE HAS CONTACT INFO FOR MUSEUM(S) IN AIZU<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737882277">There are many museums in Aizu Wakamatsu, but I think better way is <br/>
making contact with Fukushima Museum, which is prefecture one located in <br/>
Aizu Wakamtsu city.<br/>
They should have real curators and specialist in the establishment where <br/>
other little local or private type museum doesn&#39;t necessarily have.<br/>
I put the official site address here, which has also English version <br/>
page with every contact information.<br/>

<br/>
I put also the info on Aizu Folk Museum which is little one but <br/>
eventually they can ask questions. (I think advantage of private type <br/>
museum is sometimes people would be less officialist, so they can try it)<br/>
