****The ladies at 3-hajime.com are commenting on how NHK Saitou is<br/>
getting/delivering some good lines.  I know some of you get to view<br/>
the show without Eng. subs...but for those of you who get the Eng subs<br/>
do you have any idea -what- Saitou is saying?  The posters are always<br/>
like NHK Saitou is sooo "groovy" he says this and that and you know<br/>
our translating fish isn't very "clear".  Since the older series<br/>
Shinesngumi Kepporoku costs like over $100 and the TV Series<br/>
Mibugishiden is also around that range can you ~imagine~ how much this<br/>
Taiga drama will cost and you know with this Shinsengumi fad they are<br/>
probably going to make limited edition dvds or something for sure o_0</div>

<br/>
Ummm, what posters?  I wasn't aware that NHK made posters out of the drama?!  Are the fans saying that Saitou is groovy or are the 'posters' saying it?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, those who watched the last episode of Shinsengumi . . . I think it was the 9th episode . . . who is the main character in that particular ep?  I just started watching it and my friend told me it started at 9:30 when it started showing at 9:00 so I missed the first half.  Anyway, nobody ever said his name again.  Just wondering  Is it Kondou Isami? cuz Hijikata's pretty young!  (and extremely handsome . . .^^;;;) yeah . . .oh, and the time is pre-Shinsengumi,right?<br/>

<h3>Re:Shinsengumi #9</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-138989527">That's the first episode I saw when we got the satellite thing (no <br/>
subtitles though) Here's  a synopsis of Episode 9 from the Shinsengumi <br/>
War Zone site: Maybe it will help.<br/>
<br/>
Synopsis<br/>
January 1863....<br/>
A little baby covered with blankets lying on the tatami. It's Isami and <br/>
Tsune's baby daughter, Tama, who was just born few months ago. Isami <br/>
leans over to Tama and gently press his cheek against the baby's cheek <br/>
for a few secs. Then, he gets up, smiling, "Father is going now...".<br/>
Tsune sees Isami off outside. Isami is going to Kobusho with Toudou <br/>
Heisuke, today is his first day to teach kendo at Kobusho.<br/>
<br/>
Tsune serves breakfast for Okita, Yamanami, Nagakura and Harada. Okita <br/>
is wondering where Hijikata is, Tsune said he has left in the early <br/>
morning. "Hee....lately, he always goes out frequently, ne..." Okita <br/>
said. Harada believes it must because of a woman...<br/>
On the bridge, Hijikata sees Okoto is happily throwing little rocks to <br/>
the river. She notice Hijikata's there, then wave to him excitedly. <br/>
Hijikata just smile, then walk forward.....<br/>
<br/>
Tsune ask for Mitsu and Okita Rintarou(Mitsu's husband)'s help to take <br/>
care of Tama, while she's going out to visit her parents in law(Shusuke <br/>
and Fude)'s house.<br/>
<br/>
At Kobusho, suddenly Isami is told that he is no longer a Kobusho's <br/>
teacher, and it was Matsudaira Chikaranosuke's words. Isami is shocked <br/>
and ask them to confirm to Chikaranosuke once again, coz its very clear <br/>
that he was appointed to teach at Kobusho several months ago.... <br/>
However, the result is still a 'no'......<br/>
Inside, Chikaranosuke is talking to Sasaki Tadasaburo. He just got the <br/>
information that Isami Kondou was born in Tama, a farmer's birth son. In <br/>
an underestimating tone, "We can't let him stay here to teach...its <br/>
going to be a farmer kenjutsu dojo, what a joke!".<br/>
<br/>
Mitsu is trying to stop Tama from crying, she tried everything to stop <br/>
her cry, but none worked. She ask Yamanami to carry Tama for awhile, but <br/>
he refused, he said he's not good with babies. Harada offered Mitsu to <br/>
let him carry Tama, but Mitsu think impossible for him to stop Tama from <br/>
crying. Then, Harada showed his scar on his belly to Tama....then, Tama <br/>
amazingly stop crying and looking at the scar ^_^ (note: Tama is such a <br/>
cute baby!!^o^)<br/>
<br/>
Mitsu told Rintarou to join Shieikan pupils to train under Okita's lead. <br/>
Okita start the training and teach them Tennen Rishin Ryuu's stance <br/>
position. Stick is straight to the front, with their body leans to the <br/>
left a bit, right foot and left foot forming a 90 degrees angle to the <br/>
left. However, Rintarou takes the stick along to the left. Okita tells <br/>
him, that its wrong, he should positioned his stick still straightly to <br/>
the front. Rintarou keeps doing the same mistake... Mitsu then calls <br/>
Okita to come over for a moment....<br/>
Mitsu tells Okita to carry Tama, and she stops crying, reaching on <br/>
Okita's face. "Why are you so good at that?" Mitsu asked him, referring <br/>
to Okita's nature with little kids, including babies.<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura takes over the training hall. He tells the pupils the right <br/>
stance position, and he tells them according to Shindo Munen Ryuu...his <br/>
origin kenjutsu style. Nagakura criticize Rintarou's position as a bad <br/>
stance position, which is actually what Okita has taught him <br/>
earlier...its a Tennen Rishin Ryuu's stance^^;<br/>
<br/>
Dissapointed, Isami is about to go back to Shieikan with Toudou, when <br/>
suddenly he meets again Sakamoto Ryoma on the street. Isami ask <br/>
Sakamoto, how's the Tosa plan going...Sakamoto said, there is no longer <br/>
Tosa clan. Recently, he has been hanging out frequently with Katsu <br/>
Kaishuu, the Shogun's direct retainer who found the Shogun's navy.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata's head is lying on Okoto's lap. He tells her how everyone at <br/>
Shieikan make a big fuss about the bakufu and all, and how he feels <br/>
peaceful now here. Okoto said, that her mother asks to bring Hijikata <br/>
over to her house sometime. Hijikata tells her, that he has already told <br/>
her from the start, he's not going to marry her. Okoto said yes to that, <br/>
however she thinks that was a long ago. They have been meeting a lot in <br/>
this one year, their relationship have to develope anyway. Hijikata <br/>
still holds his principal, "Afterall, isn't it better if our <br/>
relationship stay like this?". Okoto is really dissapointed.....they get <br/>
into a little fight, then Hijikata leaves her......<br/>
<br/>
Back in Shieikan, this time, Yamanami takes over the training hall. He <br/>
teach the pupils the Itou stance position, one of them, is to move the <br/>
stick a bit. Okita, who is carrying Tama on his back, comes to the <br/>
training hall and calls over Yamanami. He said, a man named Yamaoka <br/>
Tetsutaro is looking for him. Yamanami leaves the hall....when Okita is <br/>
about to leave the hall, too...he takes a glance to Rintarou, "Wait, <br/>
wait...that's not what I taught, haven't I told you several times?! And <br/>
what is that stance?? Kakko warui jannai ka??(such a bad position..)". <br/>
Then, Rintarou gives up......^-^;;;<br/>
<br/>
Sakamoto brings Isami and Toudou to Katsu's house, which has lots of <br/>
Western furnitures inside, including sofa, dining table, etc. Isami is <br/>
amazed with all the Western stuff. Sakamoto also showed Isami, the <br/>
globe...Isami do not understand. Sakamoto tells him, that its the world <br/>
and the little islands he pointed, is Japan. Isami still do not <br/>
understand ^-^;<br/>
Then, Katsu show up and serve them champagne. Isami ask them where did <br/>
Sakamoto and Katsu meet. Katsu tells Isami, their first meet is a bit <br/>
funny, there was a misunderstood. Later, Sakamoto tells Isami, that <br/>
Katsu is Sakuma Shozan's brother in law.<br/>
<br/>
Tsune visits Shusuke and Fude's house, and finds Inoue Genzaburou in the <br/>
backyard, sweeping. Shusuke and Fude moved to another house several <br/>
months ago, due to Fude's unhappiness to the new people(aka guest <br/>
swordsmen), who keeps coming to Shieikan. Tsune meets Shusuke and gives <br/>
him a basket of oranges, and tells him to eat it together with Fude. <br/>
Tsune also shows Tama's hand print on a paper. Shusuke gives Tsune a <br/>
mochi cake to give it to Isami later...<br/>
<br/>
In Katsu's house, Isami and Toudou are served champagne in Western <br/>
glasses. Toudou throw up the champagne, it seems he cannot stand the <br/>
hard taste. Katsu and Sakamoto are laughing at Toudou. Sakamoto ask <br/>
Isami, whether he's okay. Isami said he has once drink champagne at the <br/>
British Legation.<br/>
Sakuma Shozan comes to the house. And, Sakamoto tells him, that Isami <br/>
Kondou is here. Sakuma said, he do not know who he is. "Sensei...!! He's <br/>
one of the young lad who joined us to see the Kurofune 9 years ago!" <br/>
Sakamoto reminds him. "I dont usually remember people's face," Sakuma <br/>
said ignorantly.<br/>
<br/>
Tsune is back to Shieikan and thanked Mitsu and Okita for taking care of <br/>
Tama, while she's gone. Yamanami ask whether Isami is already <br/>
home...Okita tells him, Isami is not back yet. Then, Yamanami calls <br/>
Tsune to come for a moment.<br/>
Yamanami writes a letter and tell Tsune to give the letter to Isami. The <br/>
letter contains information on the establishment of roushigumi in Kyoto, <br/>
which news he just received from the man named Yamaoka Tetsuro.<br/>
Tsune doesn't look happy with this......<br/>
<br/>
Back to Sakamoto-tachi's place...Isami is telling Sakamoto how he is <br/>
appointed by Matsudaira Chikaranosuke to teach at Kobusho several months <br/>
ago, and suppose to start to teach today, but suddenly told that he is <br/>
no longer a Kobusho's teacher. Isami is really upset and ask them, if <br/>
they might know what is wrong. Katsu then, tells Isami, that <br/>
Chikaranosuke suddenly dont want him to teach at Kobusho anymore, <br/>
because of Isami's earlier status. Isami was born in a farmer's class in <br/>
Tama, not born as a samurai. Chikaranosuke holds the principal that a <br/>
farmer would never be a samurai. Isami is shocked with this, and <br/>
together with Toudou, he runs back to Kobusho.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata, who's just walking on the bridge, stopped by a group of men, <br/>
leads by Okoto's older brother. Okoto's brother thinks Hijikata just <br/>
want to play around with his sister, so he has to get what he deserved. <br/>
Okoto's brother tells his men to beat him up. Hijikata do not fight <br/>
back. Okoto comes running, and shocked to see Hijikata is being beaten, <br/>
she's about to stop them, but her brother holds her back. Then, Okoto's <br/>
brother tells his men to stop, and leave the place. And drag Okoto <br/>
along, while Okoto keep staring to her back, not saying anything...but <br/>
her face expressing sorry to Hijikata....<br/>
<br/>
Isami arrive at Kobusho. And coincidentally, finds Chikaranosuke walking <br/>
exits the training hall. Isami calls him loudly, "Matsudaira-sama!!!!!", <br/>
and runs towards him, but is stopped by Chikaranosuke's men. "It's true, <br/>
that I was born in a Tama farmer family!!! But, I am, now, a Tennen <br/>
Rishin Ryuu follower, the 4th generation Shieikan's owner!!! I am now <br/>
Kondou Shuusai's son!!! I'm a samurai!! Matsudaira-sama!!!!!". <br/>
Chikaranosuke glance at him cynically, ignores him and just goes inside. <br/>
Sasaki is out and tells Chikaranosuke's men to let go Isami and Toudou. <br/>
Sasaki then, kneels before Isami. Isami tells Sasaki in a small voice, <br/>
"Sasaki-sama.....I am a samurai...". Sasaki shake his head, "You were <br/>
born as a farmer, not a samurai...".<br/>
<br/>
Mitsu and Tsune are in a room, putting Tama into bed. Tsune tells Mitsu, <br/>
that Yamanami all think about is the bakufu problems. While, Tsune only <br/>
wants to lead a peaceful life together with Isami and the baby. Mitsu <br/>
suggested Tsune, to hide the letter from Isami, and not to tell him <br/>
about the letter.<br/>
<br/>
Okita and Nagakura are playing (jap traditional)chess, with Toudou and <br/>
Harada watching them playing. Hijikata is back, with bruises on his <br/>
face. Okita ask him what happened. But Hijikata is not answering... <br/>
Toudou then ask Nagakura where he has been today(coz earlier, together <br/>
with Isami, Toudou found Nagakura working as labour, building a house <br/>
with other few men). However, Nagakura is not giving a straight answer. <br/>
Harada jumps in, "You're not asking about me?". "ahh...Harada-san wa?" <br/>
Toudou asked. "Me?? I'm eating such great foods today!". Okita mumbles, <br/>
"Sanosuke-san is the type that always relaxing all day, ne...". It <br/>
strucked Harada, "Sou ka? Sou desu ne...my life has always been like <br/>
that.....if I think of it, I never had meaningful incidents nor anything <br/>
that worried me in my life,". "I envy you!" Okita said.<br/>
<br/>
Isami tells Tsune to sit in front of him. Isami tells her, that he has <br/>
failed to become a Kobusho teacher, it seems no matter what, he can <br/>
never do something great in his life, he hopes that Tsune feels alright <br/>
to have a husband that cannot do anything great. Tsune says, all that <br/>
matters for her, is Isami and their child leads a good life together <br/>
with her. Isami is touched with that, and tells her, that they should <br/>
take Tama someday to hanami(to see and enjoy sakura's beauty). Tsune is <br/>
really happy to hear that, she's about to leave to prepare dinner, but <br/>
she stopped and goes back to the room, "Is there anything you want for <br/>
dinner tonight?". Isami answers, "Anything would be fine..", "Please, <br/>
just say it, anything," Tsune insist. "Jaa....fuwafuwa tamago(note: a <br/>
kind of egg cooks),". "Hai!".<br/>
<br/>
Tsune is holding the letter from Yamanami, and is now assured, that she <br/>
should just hide it from Isami. She keep the letter inside the cabinet <br/>
together with the mochi cake from Shusuke. Then she goes to the market <br/>
and runs back to Shieikan bringing a basket of eggs. She bumped someone <br/>
and falls.....she immediately check the eggs, then smile relieved to see <br/>
the eggs are okay.<br/>
<br/>
Isami and Hijikata are in the training hall. Isami tells Hijikata that <br/>
he always admire Sakamoto and Katsura Kogoro, who always discussing and <br/>
care about the country's situation, and they are able to serve and do <br/>
something for the country. He wants that too, he really wants to be able <br/>
to serve the country, to serve the Shogun. When he was appointed as a <br/>
Kobusho teacher, he was so excited and thought that at last, he can <br/>
serve the country with this, he feels he has find his life path. But now <br/>
its all gone, his hopes are all gone, his paths are all gone...<br/>
Hijikata is not saying any words, just listening to his bestfriend's <br/>
sorrow... Isami gaze at Hijikata, "Your face really bruised badly, <br/>
na?!". "No need to talk about me...", "What happened? Got into a fight <br/>
again, huh? Coz of woman?", "I told you, dont talk about me...!".<br/>
<br/>
Harada looks for Tsune in Tama's room, to ask for foods. Tsune is not in <br/>
the room, so he search around....and finds the mochi cake in the <br/>
cabinet. He excitedly takes it away, unaware that he left the cabinet <br/>
open, and the letter is halfway out of the cabinet........<br/>
<br/>
Tsune is working hard, cooking for Isami....<br/>
<br/>
Isami is in Tama's room now. He keeps staring at Tama. Tama lift her <br/>
hand tries to reach his father. Isami smile, then he lies besides her, <br/>
coindentally bump on the cabinet, and the letter falls off its <br/>
place...right in front of Isami....<br/>
Isami takes the letter, read it...........and.............he is <br/>
stunned......!!<br/>
He rush off to the kitchen and excitedly ask Tsune, "Tsune!! What is <br/>
this??". Tsune is shocked, she doesnt know what to say. "This <br/>
letter...?!?". Then Tsune says, "I've forgotten!!!! Sumimasen(sorry)!!". <br/>
Isami hugs Tsune happily, "Tsune, do you know?! With this......I have <br/>
found my own path!! The path I'm gonna choose!". "I'm going now!" but <br/>
Isami see the mixed eggs Tsune just made, so he hesitates. But Tsune <br/>
immediately says, "Okiotsukete(pls, becareful)!". Isami smiles, then he <br/>
runs outside............on the bridge, he jump and shouts excitedly!<br/>
