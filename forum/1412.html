Well, because I forgot to check I missed the earlier showings, but there&#39;s still one more showing this weekend of &quot;The 47 Ronin, Part 1&quot; on IFC (Independent Film Channel).  It comes on at 3:00 a.m. in my area (Mountain/Pacific time), so look for it early in your area.<br/>
 <br/>
Following is the Samurai Saturday on IFC fare for next week to August 21:<br/>
 <br/>
July 31st -- The 47 Ronin, Part 2<br/>
August 7th -- Kill!  (Kiru!)<br/>
August 14th -- Sanjuro<br/>
August 21st -- Samurai Spy<br/>

 <br/>
Though it&#39;s not Japanese, but may be of interest, on July 31st IFC is having a &quot;Chop-Socky Fest&quot; in the evening... 2 films and a new documentary examining the history of the Hong Kong martial arts film tradition.  The films will be &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; (Jet Li) and &quot;Project A&quot; (Jackie Chan).<br/>

<br/>
Too bad I don&#39;t have IFC or cable otherwise I&#39;d be watching. I have <br/>
seen fist of Legend though and I think that was one of the first <br/>
movies that turned me to a Jet Li fan a year ago... On another note <br/>
if you are going to watch more Chinese films try out Fong-Sai-Yuk and <br/>
Fong-Sai-Yuk II... I believe his mother in that movie is the love <br/>
interest of Yun Fat.. I think her name was Michelle Yeo or was it <br/>
Ziyi Zhang? Sorry I get them mixed up, it&#39;s been a while...</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, well, I&#39;m not the only one here who&#39;s just added a new extra-curricular activity, now am I?  How on earth did so many of us end up in the same RK RPG?<br/>
 <br/>
At least I don&#39;t have to come up with a reason why my character is still alive and give him a new persona in this one.  Bringing Sagara back to life in rk_onigokko is too cool, but exhausting. (So if I&#39;m flirting with Seta over on onigokko, is Saitou going to be flirting with Seta in this one? &lt;wink&gt;  And to think, I never liked Seta... ) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never been a big fan of Hong Kong films but I love mainstream cinema from the People&#39;s Republic and Taiwan (geez... just thought about that... is Taiwan politically correct?), usually those that are period pieces (like director Zhang Zhimou&#39;s work... spelling probably off... the actress Gong Li is usually always in his films... &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; and &quot;Ju Dou&quot; come immediately to mind) or that explore current society.  The only martial arts films I&#39;ve really liked were the old samurai films (and probably the new ones when I get a chance to see them).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested enough in cinema history in general, though, that I&#39;ll watch the festival, especially the documentary.<br/>

Kill was on last weekend too. If you didn&#39;t see it then you really ought to check it out when it comes on again. It had a pretty good story and plenty of humor. The fellow playing the former-Samurai-turned-Yakuza/hero wasn&#39;t bad looking either... <br/>

of me, I won&#39;t be able to tell ^_^*<br/>
<br/>
As for samurai films it&#39;s only now that I started watching them <br/>
they&#39;re pretty good although I DO miss the action from the old Kung <br/>
Fu movies. I watched them when I was a kid though so maybe they <br/>
weren&#39;t really as good... - Again not sure if those Kung Fu movies <br/>
were HK/Chinese or what...</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-510503189">Kill! or Kiru! is directed by Kihachi Okamoto (the same director as <br/>
Sword of Doom)...the hero is played by Tatsuya Nakadai who was the <br/>
terminator in Sword of Doom.  <br/>
Tatsuya Nakadai&#39;s best performance is in Harakiri/Seppuku as a <br/>
grandfather who avenges the death of his son-in-law and his own <br/>
daughter (in a way).  If you&#39;ve seen Kiru! then you will note how <br/>
they made fun of the &quot;bamboo sword&quot; bit @_@<br/>
<br/>
Okamoto also directed a parody of JAMES BOND (Japan loved James <br/>
Bond)...also starring Nakadai...basically a geek, complete with horn <br/>
rimmed glasses is supposed to be transformed into an ultra cool <br/>
sleuth type the problem is those neat gadgets don&#39;t always work ^_^ <br/>
and someone who saw it said it was HILARIOUS.<br/>
<br/>
Nakadai can also be seen in the very dark comedy THE KEY (Kagi) <br/>
directed by Kon Ichikawa (who did the animated movie Shinsengumi <br/>
using shadows/paper). THE KEY is widely available.<br/>
<br/>
*I have seen Nakadai as a male model in a magazine (part of a book <br/>
on cinema history) and he was REALLY cute back in his day...he looks <br/>
TOTALLY different ofcourse when he is playing a deranged swordsman.  <br/>
Also highly recommended is the movie THE FACE OF ANOTHER (Tanin no <br/>
kao)....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He also directed &quot;Red Lion&quot; (&quot;Akage&quot;), another very dark comedy that explores what villages were going through during the Tokugawa/Meiji transition, specifically those that were still in shogunal territory during the Boshin, and the obvious use and betrayal of Sagara Souzou.  The first scenes of the movie with Sagara are delightful and nothing like RK.  Stars Mifune Toshiro and M&#39;s favorite jingle (&quot;It&#39;s okay!  It&#39;s okay!  Never mind!&quot;)<br/>
