What we need:<br/>
<br/>
simplification of Hillsborough narrative to be incorporated into the <br/>
page (basically the pages need to be simplified)---especially with <br/>
the &quot;land battle&quot; (still incomplete) which would be relevant to <br/>
Hijikata Toshizo and Otori Keisuke/Keiske.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a really great book called the Kinse Shiriaku... and it does <br/>
detail the land battle however it is very &quot;fragmented&quot; (the dates are <br/>
also hard to follow) and if someone can simplify Hillsborough text I <br/>
can match it with the Kinse.. Or you can go through and simplify the <br/>
text currently online<br/>
<br/>
currently the page is a bunch of notes, please skim it to get an idea <br/>
of what we have already and see if you can make it easier to understand<br/>
anyone who wants to volunteer can email me at secretarytocapt3(a)<br/>
hotmail.com and I&#39;ll give you the html files to work on<br/>
<br/>
I used other sources to get an idea of what the Eagle/Kaiten/Kuaiten <br/>
had planned for the Stonewall---Hijikata was on this ship as an <br/>
observer<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to note that when you get as many sources as possible <br/>
and place them side by side you do find considerable differences <br/>
(this is why I said book A may say something different from book B and <br/>
why it is necessary to put everything together for comparative <br/>
purposes)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Banryu and Takao would draw up alongside the anchored Stonewall <br/>
Jackson.  Their troops would storm the ironclad with their swords <br/>
drawn and before the enemy troops had a chance to defend themselves, <br/>
capture the ship and crew...That *grand *plan *failed *miserably was <br/>
on account of rough seas and mechanical failures--cruel fate so <br/>
inseperably intertwinved with that relentless Sun Goddess.&quot;  <br/>
(HILLSBOROUGH~ Shinsengumi 172) whenever possible he mentions the sun <br/>
goddess (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
vs<br/>
<br/>
&quot;THE SHINSENGUMI APPEAR ON THE EAGLE&quot; see to get varied accounts and <br/>
why details were varied <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Hakodate.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Hakodate.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
where the tone in other accounts were surprised how the <br/>
Kaiten/Eagle/Kuaiten was close to pulling off a major victory ~ <br/>
brilliantly with the use of the American flag---other narratives also <br/>
mentioned that Nomura (of the Shinsengumi) was not shot---but killed <br/>
with a pike onboard<br/>
<br/>
The Stonewall *was taken completely by surprise by the Eagle, and from <br/>
the accounts on the page you will note how the Stonewall was pretty <br/>
ineffective overall in defending herself in the well timed ambush<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough also mentioned the issue of neutrality in regards to the <br/>
Stonewall---however he fell short of stating the truth of the matter:<br/>
<br/>
The Imperialists STOLE it from the Shogunate---the ship was paid with <br/>
Shogunate money after all... (^_^)</div>
