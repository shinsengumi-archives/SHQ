<h3>Pics from Kyoto</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-210731495">I've finally started uploading my pictures of my trip to Kyoto to<br/>
Flickr.  I've had to resize them all, since they are all 3000 pixels,<br/>
so I've only done about 50 so far.  I'll let you know when I get more<br/>
up there.  I've organized them into three groups so far,<br/>
"Shinsengumi", which contains all of the Shinsengumi and Bakumatsu<br/>
related images, "Nijo palace", which has all of the Nijo palace<br/>
images, and "Other" for the ones that are sort of random.<br/>
<br/>
Here they are, let me know what you think:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you look at this image:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/2375667420/in/set-72157604321244361/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/2375667420/in/set-72157604321244361/</a><br/>
<br/>
The entrance on the left is the entrance to Hirayama and Serizawa's<br/>
quarters. I'll see if I can explain it - Directly inside is the<br/>
genkan, with a low hanging spear-rack.  Once you get inside the entire<br/>
building is maybe 40 feet long, all tatami, and then at that time<br/>
there was a partition where Hirayama Goro was (the partitions are now<br/>
gone, but the low hanging beams that held them are only about 6.5 feet<br/>
above the floor.  His "room" was about 8 feet long and maybe about<br/>
that wide, and then another partition, where Serizawa was. Serizawa's<br/>
"room" had direct access to the garden - and by "garden" I mean a<br/>
really small area that looks like a typical "Japanese garden". <br/>
Someone here would know better than I how the attack played out, but I<br/>
 do remember from the guide that Serizawa stumbled onto the wooden<br/>
walkway before the garden, and took a left into the Yagi's sleeping<br/>
quarters where he was killed.  There is a cut in the top of the<br/>
doorway there, supposedly from a sword slash from that night.  No<br/>
pictures were allowed inside or in the garden, unfortunately.  But it<br/>
is all a pretty small area. It was pretty interesting walking through<br/>
these rooms that I'd read about.<br/>
<br/>
If I have time, I'll add more pictures tomorrow - I still have about<br/>
100 more to go.  I got some great pics of Osaka castle and elsewhere.</div>

 </span></blockquote> If you look at this image:<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/2375667420/in/set-72157604321244361/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/2375667420/in/set-72157604321244361/</a><br/>
 <br/>
 The entrance on the left is the entrance to Hirayama and Serizawa's<br/>
 quarters. I'll see if I can explain it - Directly inside is the<br/>
 genkan, with a low hanging spear-rack.  Once you get inside the entire<br/>
 building is maybe 40 feet long, all tatami, and then at that time<br/>
 there was a partition where Hirayama Goro was (the partitions are now<br/>
 gone, but the low hanging beams that held them are only about 6.5 feet<br/>
 above the floor.  His "room" was about 8 feet long and maybe about<br/>
 that wide, and then another partition, where Serizawa was. Serizawa's<br/>
 "room" had direct access to the garden - and by "garden" I mean a<br/>
 really small area that looks like a typical "Japanese garden". <br/>
 Someone here would know better than I how the attack played out, but I<br/>
  do remember from the guide that Serizawa stumbled onto the wooden<br/>
 walkway before the garden, and took a left into the Yagi's sleeping<br/>
 quarters where he was killed.  There is a cut in the top of the<br/>
 doorway there, supposedly from a sword slash from that night.  No<br/>
 pictures were allowed inside or in the garden, unfortunately.  But it<br/>
 is all a pretty small area. It was pretty interesting walking through<br/>
 these rooms that I'd read about.<br/>
 <br/>
 If I have time, I'll add more pictures tomorrow - I still have about<br/>
 100 more to go.  I got some great pics of Osaka castle and elsewhere.<br/>
