<h3>Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi (a PS2 game)</h3>
by <i>serizawakamo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672558007">This is a more &quot;conventional&quot; game for PS2, due<br/>
December 22nd in Japan, produced by D3 Publisher.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.d3p.co.jp/shinsengumi/">http://www.d3p.co.jp/shinsengumi/</a><br/>
<br/>
This is the story about a girl from Aizu who is<br/>
&quot;adopted&quot; (kind of) by Teruhime and joins the<br/>
Shinsengumi as the first woman in the troop. Needless<br/>
to say (?!), she eventually falls in love with one of<br/>
the members -- or is supposed to do so, since she is<br/>
the main character of the story, controlled by the<br/>
player :D<br/>
<br/>
This is a game meant for girls and not for boys (for<br/>
obvious reasons). And it is about falling in love with<br/>
one of the many Shinsengumi members, which happen to<br/>
be almost all bishonen :D Except Yamazaki Susumu, who<br/>
happens to be gay in the game O_O (and with a costume<br/>
suspiciously similar to Misao in Rurouni Kenshin) It<br/>
is kind of an animated shoujo manga.<br/>
<br/>
For those who want to check the opening movie, it is<br/>
located at:<br/>

<br/>
(by the way: Miki Shin-ichiro is the voice actor for<br/>
Saito Hajime in this game)<br/>
<br/>
It will cost 5040 yen and in the first (limited)<br/>
edition, it will present also a calendar for 2005.<br/>

&quot;I am the bone of my sword.<br/>
    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.<br/>
  I have created over a thousand blades.<br/>
       Unknown to Death.<br/>
   Nor known to Life.<br/>
Have withstood pain to create many weapons.<br/>
     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.<br/>
         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-1936">&gt;</a> Demon&#39;s Circular... not?!</h3>
by <i>enma_o</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845447749">Found something slightly interesting while going through my old RPG books last night, and was able to find the author&#39;s website today.<br/>
<br/>
It seems the &quot;maru&quot; element which is now usually read as &quot;round&quot; was commonly used as a suffix to young boys&#39; names, and also swords&#39; names, before the Tokugawa period. Back then it used to denote affection, so it has nothing to do with things actually *being* round, even though in modern times it&#39;s usually written with the kanji for maru = &quot;round&quot; since the other one is much more complex. <br/>
<br/>
So in the case of the sword Onimaru for example, which I&#39;ve heard mentioned in connection to Saitou, it seems likely the name means &quot;dear demon&quot; or something...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065138749">In other word yet ANOTHER game that we&#39;ll never see here in the U.S.? Is that <br/>
what you&#39;re telling me? I&#39;m beginning to think that this is all a plot by <br/>
some sadistic Neo-Ishin fangroup to drive the SHQ members insane...<br/>

*Serizawa the webmaster didn&#39;t get a chance to change your name on <br/>
the essay yet...so you are still &quot;S.K.&quot; on this document<br/>
<br/>
*we also have to remember that oni/demon is not &quot;demon&quot; in a bad way <br/>
I have read of &quot;demon&quot; in regards to how hard a person works...for <br/>
example Tesshu was a &quot;demon&quot; in the dojo...that is he practiced very <br/>
diligently and gave it 110% <br/>
<br/>
*there was a Japanese fanfic which continuously called Saitou &quot;demon&quot; <br/>
of Kyoto as well<br/>
