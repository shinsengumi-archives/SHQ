(Hijikata icon) there is a guy (oh my gosh a GUY posted on 3-hajime!)<br/>
who said this:<br/>
<br/>
Heaven dragon Sho, beginning, today. 隲ｾ 譁� With you say. From now on,<br/>
every acquaintance. To tell the truth my wife with Kitakata city<br/>
graduate something, the lineage of the grandmother is the Aizu feudal<br/>
clan loyal retainer. You think that there is a memorial stone monument<br/>
of the person, &quot;Nakane United States seven&quot;, in Kumakura, but that<br/>
person becomes the grandfather of the grandmother of the wife. It<br/>
seems that as for this person at the time of 謌� 霎ｰ war being in blue<br/>
dragon party, it survives, causes &quot;thought bridge incident&quot; incident,<br/>
goes to Seinan war. It is drawn Saigo prosperously and together with<br/>
the brocade picture of Seinan war. After that, returning to Kumakura,<br/>
being to commit hara-kiri, it does, but that time, Saito one where had<br/>
become the policeman helped the United States seven from the spy, so<br/>
is. Naturally, as for the blood of that United States seven it is not<br/>
flowing to me, but when you think, that that blood is succeeded in the<br/>
children, you think very in pride. When this time, going home in<br/>
Kitakata, you think that I would like to go to visiting a grave.<br/>
<br/>
basically his wife is related to an Aizu retainer who served in the<br/>
blue dragon party (for those of you who are new the defense of Aizu<br/>
was split into age groups, genbu/turtle (oldest), seiryu? dragon,<br/>
phoenix (Saitou was part of phoenix) and white tiger (youngest<br/>
guys)...the rest I&#39;m not clear...the man is happy that his kids have<br/>
Aizu blood in their veins it seems</div>
