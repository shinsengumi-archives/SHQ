 </span></blockquote>The ADV site didn&#39;t have any release info for it that I saw. *pout* I do <br/>
know that the anime has things in much different order than the manga <br/>
though (such as Saitou & Yamanami&#39;s first appearances)<br/>
<br/>
No Maro though since he was the anime writers&#39; invention. AS the world&#39;s <br/>
only Maro fan I think he was a most interesting character and they could <br/>
have done a lot with him as a subplot, too bad they screwed it <br/>
up--really, really screwed it up in his last episode.<br/>
