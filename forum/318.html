same plot but with Okita and another girl disguised as a boy...Kaze<br/>

like in PMK)<br/>

I know exactly what you mean... I've been eyeing that site for TOO <br/>
long now. Still trying to decide whether actually buying from jpqueen <br/>
is better than buying from www.sasugabooks.com. I mean the price per <br/>
tankoubon is high like 5-6 USD but it's new and shipping is slightly <br/>
lower and I'll get it faster unlike Jpqueen. But I don't know there's <br/>
so many other things I want to buy from jpqueen like manga <br/>
anthologies, doujinshis... They have better prices but shipping kills <br/>
the deal... We need to get a "Japanese connection" so to speak. You <br/>
know a person who can bid for us in yahoo japan, scour the streets <br/>
for doujinshis and tankoubons dealing with Saitou and the <br/>
Shinsengumi. While he/she is at it, we might as well ask that person <br/>
to find us movies, figures, and possibly "historical" novelties... <br/>
<br/>
*Dear Lord... We already have very good language translators... Now <br/>
all we need is another person to do our shopping for us in Japan*<br/>
<br/>
Oh for those people who have been looking for Japanese historical <br/>
books per se, sasugabooks has a better collection than Amazon albeit <br/>
the price...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450460369">www.sasugabooks.com (they have to order from Japan and I'm on my 5th<br/>
week now waiting for a book--- Hiroshi Kurogane's Shinsengumi the one<br/>
that was turned into an animated movie)...www.kinokuniya.com is also<br/>
good you can call them and they'll search for books right over the phone<br/>
