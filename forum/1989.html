(In Japanese, it is the meaning of "A happy new year".If it <br/>
translates literally, it will become "the new year, dawn, <br/>
furthermore congratulations".)<br/>
<br/>
In fact, Japan is still the daytime on December 31 now. <br/>
However, I separate from a network for about five days after this. <br/>
Therefore, I greet you previously. <br/>
<br/>
Japanese people send the postcard called "Nengajyou" (New Year's <br/>
card) to friends. <br/>
It arrives on January 1. <br/>
I send Nengajyou to everybody of SHQ similarly.^_^ <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414457987">I'd like to wish everyone a very belated Happy New<br/>
Year too!<br/>
<br/>
And wish I could draw like momoiro-san as well.<br/>
<br/>
Currently in Kurashiki (Okayama), accessing the Net<br/>
after a 9-day hiatus.<br/>
<br/>
Just noticed that these days I have been visiting most<br/>
of the important spots on the Ishin Shishi side ^^;;<br/>
Went to Satsuma (Kagoshima), Choushuu (Yamaguchi) and<br/>
now after spending a night here in Bizen (Okayama), I<br/>
will be off to Tosa (Kochi). Amazing :D<br/>
<br/>
Went to Shiroyama in Satsuma and was VERY impressed at<br/>
the caves used by Saigo Takamori, Kirino Toshiaki and<br/>
others to hide. They are very small.<br/>
<br/>
Went to Shoukason-juku in Hagi and was VERY impressed<br/>
at Yoshida Shoin's teachings o.o (sugoi koto wo<br/>
oshiete imashita) <br/>
<br/>
Went to Katsura Kogoro's house also in Hagi and was<br/>
VERY impressed at how beautiful Ikumatsu (Matsuko) was<br/>
o.o (didn't know there was a picture of her) Also, it<br/>
was good to see another picture of Takasugi Shinsaku<br/>
other than that most famous one (ano Takasugi wa<br/>
chotto kakko yoku nai desu ^^;;;)<br/>
<br/>
Went to Okayama Art Museum in Okayama (duh :P) and was<br/>
VERY impressed at how beautiful Kikuichimonji Norimune<br/>
is o.o (no wonder he was the January of the Emperor's<br/>
swordsmiths...)<br/>
<br/>
As for the Shinsengumi, read that Shinsengumi manga by<br/>
Golgo 13, I mean, Saito Takao. It is reasonable. Also,<br/>
read that "Shinsengumi Ibun" (I guess the name was<br/>
like that) and enjoyed one of the most absurd mangas<br/>
(historically speaking) on the Shinsengumi. It demands<br/>
some guts to come up with such a nonsense story about<br/>
the group!<br/>
<br/>
And last, but not least, read "Dandara", by Akana Shu.<br/>
Liked very much the drawing. Quite cool.<br/>

Didn't you go to Kumamoto Castle? <br/>
Since a fierce battle was fought here during Seinan war, there are <br/>

At the teenage time, I believed that Kirino Toshiaki (as Nakamura <br/>

He had the capacity to find the hidden talent which all people have.<br/>
His thought attracted young students and made them consider the <br/>
future of Japan. <br/>
In fact, most of famous Ishin-Shishis of Choshuu are the students of <br/>
Shoukason-juku. <br/>
Takasugi Shinsaku, Yoshida Toshimaro, and Kusaka Genzui are the <br/>
excellent students to whom Yoshida Shoin was looking forward to the <br/>
future. <br/>
Moreover, the first Prime Minister's Itou Hirofumi was the student <br/>
here. <br/>
And Katsura Kogorou was the student of Shoin and was also a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Choshuu had a grudge against the Tokugawa government from Sekigahara <br/>
war (A.D.1600). <br/>
They were deceived by Tokugawa and lost many territories. <br/>
(The Mouri family who is the daimyo of Chosyuu held the ceremony of <br/>
a curse secretly to Tokugawa on January 1 every year.) <br/>
However, I think that the reason in which the students of Shoukason-<br/>
juku hated Tokugawa is that the Tokugawa government executed Shoin <br/>
for the unreasonable reason. <br/>

His face was very long. <br/>
When he rode on a horse and walked along a town, people teased him, <br/>
saying "He is wearing the face of a horse rather than the horse." <br/>
However, he was liked very much by women^_^<br/>
<br/>
By the way, don't you know the present appearance of Takasugi house? <br/>
I looked at the news to which that is closed several months ago. <br/>
(The posterity of Takasugi had answered that it became impossible to <br/>
preserve it.) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for replying to my question. <br/>
Truly, Takasugi's house was closed. <br/>
(It is a very shocking fact.)<br/>
<br/>
Takasugi is shishi which has many fans even now. <br/>
If I confess honestly, I like him most on Ishin-shish side.<br/>
When I was a high school student, I visited that.<br/>
And I considered his thing in the small house and small yard.<br/>
It is already impossible experience now. <br/>
<br/>
However, thank you for teaching the situation of the present Hagi. <br/>
Please continue a good travel. <br/>

<br/>
Truth be told, the only people I really like/respect in any amount on the <br/>
Ishin Shishi side are Katsura, Takasugi, and Ryoma. Katsura because to me it <br/>
seems his conscience wasn't disabled, unlike some other people <br/>
*cough*Saigou*cough*, Takasugi because he's just cool, and Ryoma because <br/>
he's just so darn hard to figure out-- although it annoys me that he was so <br/>
full of himself.<br/>
