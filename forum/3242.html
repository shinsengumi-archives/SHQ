<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013496284">That is incredibly cute!   I loves it!!!   And that lil fundoshi ^.^   This is hours of fun and cuteness for me!   <br/>
<br/>
Mmm, may I suggest something that might improve your daughter's work?   If she can make it so that somehow you can scroll the clothes.   I found it a bit difficult to scroll for his handsome attire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-583332944">Thank you, Bunny, Did you scroll over Kae's fundoshi and see him get <br/>
mad? lol The scrolling was a problem. She tried to get it to scroll  <br/>
frontwards & backwards but  it wasn't working.<br/>

You have to see Anne Cain's (http://www.dragonsdisciple.com) drawing <br/>
of Kaemon Nakagawanomiya over at http://www.chloemichelle.com , <br/>
either as a chibi or in full fledged art form he is very adorable <br/>
(^_^).<br/>
<br/>
I really support a fanfic crossover between Peacemaker Kurogane and <br/>
Mirror,Mirror <br/>
http://mardigraspublishing.com/mirrormirror.html  <br/>
(Amazon release 7/7) just because in my mind Emmie would beat the <br/>
crap out of Tetsu (LOL!) then again Emmie and Tetsu have some things <br/>
in common too.<br/>
<br/>
Wait my pretties...soon SHQ will be fantabulous...<br/>
<br/>
both me and the programmer working on SHQ have been really busy <br/>
lately but rest assured you all will be very very happy with the new <br/>
functions.<br/>
<br/>
People who would like to submit fanart, photos, fanmade vids, <br/>
reports, book or movie reviews please continue to do so...updates <br/>
will resume once the new site if fully functional...(and yes I know I <br/>
said it would be done earlier) but amhosting (the server for SHQ) <br/>
actually CHARGES us if we ask questions as to why certain things we <br/>
install do not work.  We email a question, they decline to help <br/>
(*_*)...it really sucks...  <br/>
<br/>
It's not always the  matter of if the programmer can accomplish <br/>
certain tasks but the whether or not the server at its current status <br/>
even allows us to do so....moving SHQ to let's say GEOCITIES would be <br/>
very expensive due to the enormous amount of files and bandwidth <br/>
needed (geocities is waaaay more expensive).<br/>
<br/>
So to prevent higher expenses the programmer just sits there and <br/>
figures things out on her own and we test things out on the <br/>
server...hence the delays, the angst and many late nights (T_T).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761184988">YES!!!!   That was the cutest face ever!   The only reason I scrolled over it was because you had said something about fundoshi in your lil post and I got curious because I didn't see it as one of the options in the cloths lineup. ^.^<br/>
