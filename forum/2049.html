<h3>Imperial Court communications to Shogunate</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069101616">From "Charismatic Bureaucrat: A Political Biography of Matsudaira Sadanobu <br/>
1758-1829," by Herman Ooms.<br/>
<br/>
"When the court wished to take some action that was unprecedented, it had to <br/>
confer with the Bakufu through the Bakufu's Kyoto deputy (Kyoto Shoshidai). <br/>
Contract with the deputy was maintained through two court officials (buke <br/>
denso, messengers to the military) who were in charge of transmitting <br/>
memorials to and from the Kyoto deputy. The deputy relayed important matters <br/>
to the Senior Council in Edo by couriers, who traveled the distance between <br/>
Kyoto and Edo in about six days. Bakufu decisions followed the same route <br/>
back to the court messengers, but these latter had no direct access to the <br/>
Emperor. They contacted the kampaku or imperial advisor who then conferred <br/>
with the Emperor."<br/>
<br/>
But if it involved Aizu, and since the Shogun came to Osaka Castle and later <br/>
Nijo Castle, the communication could probably be done right there. Aizu was <br/>
also probably directly apprised of this stuff.<br/>
