<h3>saitou in disguise</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-975990167">OMG! That IS him, I just know it!<br/>
<br/>
And was anyone as intrigued as me by the glimpse of broad half naked <br/>
chest inside that kimono????<br/>
<br/>
The hentai thoughts are not my fault I've just been reading about the <br/>
lecherous Maeda Toshiie  his 12 yr old wife (when he was 22), 16 kids <br/>
and the concubine who was 33 yrs his junior (!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819591861">Why would an overworked animator go through the trouble of designing<br/>
an "extra" with 2 swords. AND show the EXACT same guy in 2 scenes<br/>
(this "mystery" guy is in 2 -separate- scenes right?)...they wouldn't<br/>
go through that much trouble for nothing remember it takes hundreds of<br/>
cells to make an animated film and lots of work (even with the aid of<br/>
computers)...it could be an inside joke for all we know.<br/>
<br/>
I know that sarcastic smirk anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
It's Saitou with a wig...which kind of worries me and adds the<br/>
possibility of Saitou with Kamatari tendencies. 0_0  What is more<br/>
scary Saitou with a wig or SAitou coloring his hair...green for that<br/>
matter LOL<br/>
<br/>
In the manga...check maigo-chan's translation Saitou specifically<br/>
criticizes Kenshin for getting himself injured AND CAUSE SOMEONE TO BE<br/>
PERMANENTLY INJURED (the kid Yutaro)...take that Kenshin...I remember<br/>
this distinctly because this was an example of how a couple of words,<br/>
IMPORTANT words were left out of the anime (hisssss).  I read this in<br/>
the Thai translation of the manga and was surprised Nobuhiro would<br/>
"turn on" his hero.<br/>
<br/>
And I used this point to discuss with my sister how Saitou is<br/>
protective of kids (Eiji + Misao)...although Miss B reinterprets the<br/>
Misao part :P<br/>
<br/>
I will probably duplicate this thread on Shinsengumimb.com<br/>
so tired...just finished fanart...fingers covered with blue marker and<br/>
I posted a long message explaining why SAitou didn't anticipate<br/>
Shishio's metal headband.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379040714">And note, his eyes aren't always amber...in one flashback scene his<br/>
eyes are blue...or did S.H. go through the trouble of wearing contacs?<br/>
 So it doesn't matter if his eyecolor is off.<br/>
<br/>
Stupid tight black T-shirt has been obscuring our view the entire<br/>
time!!!...note bandages around the lower chest...just like Sano...at<br/>
this point in the story KEnshin already met Sano right? ... if this is<br/>
S.H. and I THINK SO then Saitou would have already seen Sano with<br/>
Kenshin...Saitou with a green wig AND sporting Sano-like bandages 0_0<br/>

<h3>Re: saitou in disguise (2 swords)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-560344706">okay, further speculation...this mystery guy uses 2 swords.<br/>
I just read an article on left handed people and how many gain a high<br/>
level of ambidexterity depending on the social environment they lived<br/>
in...now I will always insist that hist. Saitou was a natural lefty<br/>
and acquired "social" ambidexterity...in the case of handing things to<br/>
people/writing in front of other (you usually hand things to people<br/>
with both hands or right hand at least in Japanese culture - I<br/>
heard)...and many martial artists, e.g. bare-handed techniques will<br/>
purposefully try to gain ambidexterity helpful in<br/>
grappling/throws/pins etc...so it is possible Saitou could use 2<br/>
swords very well.</div>

Like I said, if you'll give me a couple of days I'll get the screenshots up on my site and post the direct URL in response to MissB's original post about the guy.  No need to start a new thread.<br/>

 <br/>
Can't help thinking of Yamazaki in PMK... :-D  Personally, I just can't see RK Saitou being believable as a woman.  He's gorgeous as a man, but he'd make one big, ugly woman (heh... like the Big Bad Wolf trying to pass as a granny?).  Still, there is that academy award winning act he pulled off with Itou's group.<br/>

phil (who's just gone through the fight between Saitou & Sano outside Katsu's house frame by frame and is amazed yet again at how many faces Saitou shows!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even if Saitou hadn't seen Sano yet, the wrappings seem to be common attire for the times.  I see them in a lot of movies and on other characters in anime.  Not sure if it was more common to street types, like Sano.  (Good practice for when he gets with Sano, ne?  He'll know how to get Sano in and out of them... though I have to admit, I much prefer it when he takes them off with his katana... ;-P)<br/>

by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040877348">I would speculate no further than it was just part of his diguise.  By the same token, I wouldn't be surprised if he was quite handy with two swords (though not as suave as Aoshi --- TWO kodachi in ONE sheath??? <snicker> one of my favorite quotes from RK). Do we really have any idea just how many different styles Saitou was schooled in?  And given how slick RK Saitou is, I'd expect him to be ambidextrous (he certainly was against Sano in their little fist fight... at least twice it was a right upper-cut that knocked Sano silly.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443773468">Barbara, it is chainmail...see Nakajima NObori portrait...he is<br/>
wearing chainmail right under his clothes...read Tenma house incident<br/>

<br/>
Remember in Gohatto when Okita tells Hijikata (runs into the room late<br/>
at night) that the old dude and everyone's object of desire went to<br/>
that inn alone...Okita ran into the room wearing mesh/armor thing<br/>
too...you can see it on his arms.<br/>
<br/>
Other portraits by Nakajima show other Shinsengumi wearing chainmail<br/>
(if they were dressed traditionally---some wore modern clothing).<br/>
