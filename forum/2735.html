If anyone wants to help...we'd all really appreciat it if someone<br/>
could go through the Hillsborough book...I'm only in the early 1860s<br/>
with another book<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[The following post is about Fujita Goro and Tokio during the Meiji Era]<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/2589">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/2589</a><br/>
I had discussed the strong possibility of Fujita Goro and Kano Jigoro<br/>
but at the time I did not have a solid biography of Kano (other than a<br/>
few judo websites) in front of me to establish a really good time line.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I obtained a copy of THE FATHER OF JUDO A BIOGRAPHY OF<br/>
JIGORO KANO by Brian N. Watson. I recommend this short book for people<br/>
who are interested in martial arts bios and getting a crash course in<br/>
how "fun" education can be during the Meiji Era...<br/>
<br/>
I updated <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a> with a few<br/>
brief paragraphs of info regarding these details and a quote of Kano<br/>
hiring good kendo teachers for Tokyo Normal School (called Teacher<br/>
Training College in this book).  Many people knew that Kano's student,<br/>
Saigo Shiro was the son of Saigo Tanomo, senior retainer of Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori.  How would Mr. and Mrs. Fujita miss this? <br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It took a really really long time to get confirmation on a minor<br/>
detail regarding Tokio's friend.  Please see<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm</a><br/>
click on "Memories of Tokio" <br/>
and read near the end of the paragraph, <br/>
I also added a pic of Tokio's much older friend Takamine Kinoko.  <br/>
<br/>
More information including on her can be found here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Kinoko was an interesting older woman (she was not shy at all)<br/>
who also recorded what<br/>
happened to her and her family after the defeat of the Aizu domain.<br/>
Thus, her narrative is one of the few written by a woman in that<br/>
situation (at this time I cannot find any record written by an Aizu<br/>
woman which has been published).  <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally I found it funny that this elderly lady Takamine Kinoko<br/>
dragged her grand daughters to the Fujita household---because<br/>
according to the American scientist Edward Morse, she also was a<br/>
babysitter to a herd of boys (maybe? the Fujita boys too?)<br/>

click on "Normal School This and That"<br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I had to revise the timeline's format here<br/>

[scroll down to 1919]<br/>
<br/>
I used the Watson book to get more solid info on the ultimately severe<br/>
protesting by the faculty, and alumni of the Normal School (where both<br/>
Fujita Goro and Tokio were employed).  The most open opposition shown<br/>
by these educators occurred after Mr. Fujita died...however Tokio was<br/>
still very much alive to observe these movements at the school.  <br/>
<br/>
You will note that I am not saying either Mr. or Mrs. Fujita was in<br/>
any way involved or if they agreed or disagreed with any of this. <br/>
<br/>
Unless both kept their eyes and ears closed at work they would be very<br/>
much aware of these incidents. The school was pretty small and run<br/>
like a "family" even if Mrs. FUjita was retired it would be hard for<br/>
not to take an interest in these situations (covered by national<br/>
newspapers).  Tokio would have co-workers/friends and students still<br/>
there and she would feel a deep attachment to her workplace.<br/>
<br/>
In other English texts, no specific dates were recorded for<br/>
***earlier*** "threats" by the faculty/staff of the Normal School<br/>
which should have occurred at the very beginning of the 20th century<br/>
[during Fujita Goro years] and not just before the 1920s.  These were<br/>
all well coordinated efforts where teachers would sign petitions draw<br/>
up lists and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
"Threats" being mass walk outs to protest the Ministry of education's<br/>
stubborness in increasing pay and so forth.  Walk outs and<br/>
resignations were SIGNATURE tactics for these pesky teachers (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that mass protests were discouraged by the Meiji gov.<br/>
which had a distaste for such public displays (which occurred shortly<br/>
after the Russo-Japanese war in 1905)...these teachers faced possible<br/>
arrest and imprisonment (a small handful of teachers were banished<br/>
from Tokyo earlier in the era for political reasons).</div>
