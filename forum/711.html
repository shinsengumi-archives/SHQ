<h3>Interesting Info from Japan...</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-214254650">secretarytocapt3 crying tears of joy...<br/>
now, I admit my hands were shaking a bit when I had to open my email<br/>
inbox (fear of more nutty emails)...lo and behold "Hi from Japan"<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3 thinks "oh no not MORE Japanese junk mail"<br/>
<br/>
turns out that being a total P.I.T.A** on Japanese Shinsengumi related<br/>
messageboards has paid off..<br/>
<br/>
momoiro-usagi found us and has taken upon his/herself to use a<br/>
translation software to add more info to our board...via email<br/>
by the way I asked what software was used because the English is very<br/>
very good...<br/>
<br/>
so friends please head on over to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> and if<br/>
you have been diligently using the "mark forum" read function then the<br/>
brand new updates should show up immediately...all of momoiro-usagi's<br/>
words are in italics and I didn't edit/speculate (why do I hear a sigh<br/>
of relief from all of you?)<br/>
<br/>
What is not on the messageboard is...<br/>
momoiro-usagi says that he/she can't understand all of our posts...so<br/>
maybe we have to use simple English especially in the history threads<br/>
because momoiro seems to be concentrating on these questions<br/>
<br/>
strangely, momoiro has picked up on our babelfish jokes...<br/>
"At first, the meaning of "the manual laborer year three" was not able<br/>
to understand to me.<br/>
And when I have understood it, I laughed heartily.<br/>
Truly, it is the troubled fish."<br/>
<br/>
Teasers:<br/>
Hijikata was good with scissors...<br/>
Hijikata hanging out in the Shinsengumi cemetary...<br/>
Mystery woman info...<br/>
Nagakura was ALSO a runaway...rebel...(probably had issues with his dad)<br/>
<br/>
So please send good karmic thoughts to momoiro-usagi who spent alot of<br/>
time composing a very long email</div>
