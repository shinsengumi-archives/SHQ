<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749103741">Dear momoiro-usagi:<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you very much for the time you took commenting the article. *bows gratefully*<br/>
Concerning the comment I made about  Tekiya and Hijikata, was meant as a sort of joke (very poorly done on my side, I admit, but as I&#39;m not a native speaker (I&#39;m Argentine), sometimes I lack the grace and subtlety required for performing such feats).<br/>
 <br/>
Of course that the drama can&#39;t be taken as a reliable historical source. To be honest, at first the historical inaccuracies ticked me off quite a bit, but then I reconsidered, since  it&#39;s not a documental, but a TV series, meant to entertain, in the same vein as many American productions for TV as well as Hollywood movies. So after accepting this basic fact, I sat comfortably to enjoy Shinsengumi! for what it was worth. <br/>
 <br/>
But your advice is certainly very accurate, and appreciated. Thanks for your concern.<br/>
 <br/>
Firuze<br/>

Since the article was very serious, I have not noticed it^^;;; <br/>
Talking in the language which is not a native language suffers <br/>
troubles mutually. <br/>
And I am writing this text using translation software. <br/>
I am worried that an impolite thing may be written to you. <br/>
<br/>
Taiga drama is often introducing in others the small episode which <br/>
is not made to appear. <br/>
However, it also has many episode which is not facts. <br/>
Taiga drama is not a thing for studying a historical fact. <br/>
It is a thing for merely enjoying oneself as a drama. <br/>
You know the right way of enjoying oneself of Taiga drama^^<br/>
There are people who believe that the episode in Manga, a novel, or <br/>
a drama is a fact among Shinsengumi fans. <br/>
The fans of a certain Shinsengumi manga are introducing information <br/>
on a network only in the knowledge from the work. <br/>
They are people who are young mostly and have not read other <br/>
Shinsengumi works. <br/>
(I cannot understand why they become the feeling which got to know <br/>
Shinsengumi only in the knowledge of that work.) <br/>
I am not going to deny fictions&#39; worth. <br/>
They become a wonderful entrance to a historical fact. <br/>
Moreover, people of a time far from us are made a nearer existence. <br/>
However, it is dangerous to believe it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I feel that only good portions were written too much about <br/>
Yakuza. <br/>
Many Yakuzas which were popular allies actually existed. <br/>
However, probably, many Yakuzas which were hard on the weak with <br/>
regards to the man of power also existed. <br/>
And probably Yakuza which did not perform a bad thing at all does <br/>
not exist. <br/>
The same may be said of the situation after Meiji Era. <br/>
About the time after Meiji Era, there was certainly a situation <br/>
where you wrote. <br/>
Yakuzas with political ideas was related to the politician or the <br/>
army. <br/>
However, Yakuzas which valued the territory like ancient times also <br/>
existed. <br/>
Although I wanted to write in detail about this, for performing it, <br/>
I am too ignorant.<br/>
Although I think that the contents which Firuze-san wrote are the <br/>
people rather called &quot;Uyoku&quot; (the right wing), I cannot say it with <br/>
a corroboration. <br/>
I have neither existence of Uyoku nor the knowledge about thought. <br/>
They have a close relation to Yakuza. <br/>
They instigated the politician and the army and often caused <br/>
trouble. <br/>
<br/>
(Although I am a Japanese, I am very ignorant about Japan and sense <br/>
that it is shameful. I come to SHQ and am very conscious of it. <br/>
After coming to SHQ, I came to think of Japan seriously. In that, I <br/>
am thankful to everybody of SHQ.) <br/>
<br/>
Please introduce, if there are some interesting articles ^^<br/>
