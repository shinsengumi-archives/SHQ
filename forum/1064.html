folder: Seinan+TMPD+FrenchPolice <br/>
open folder and the new file is "seinan4.zip"<br/>
password "makoto" to download<br/>
file size 3.77mb<br/>
*and please take advantage of other seinan files because these <br/>
images are not on the net...other files are in pdf format for <br/>
citation purposes but I didn't have access to Acrobat today...so the <br/>
new file is zipped"<br/>
<br/>
now, for those of you who have a hard time imagining women wielding <br/>
halberds...I highly recommend you download this file because there <br/>
are some pretty interesting paintings showing women on a bridge <br/>
fighting gov. troops...same thing that happened in Aizu...if you <br/>
look carefully at other paintings you will see a bunch of women at <br/>
after a battle and there is ummm a human head on the table and the <br/>
woman is cleaning her sword...clearly The Last Samurai left out some <br/>
of these interesting details...<br/>
ofcourse I couldn't scan the whole book and some pages were huge <br/>
foldouts...but there are women EVERYWHERE in these battles...some <br/>
paintings easily contain 100 figures and in the mix are clearly <br/>
women based on their lips/clothing/hair...of all the images with <br/>
women...only one shows a woman actually being killed perhaps the <br/>
artist felt really sensitive about showing women being <br/>
slaughtered...for any of you who can read Japanese, there is a <br/>
painting of a castle surrounded by guys in traditional dress and the <br/>
castle is full of gov. troops...I wonder if this is of the siege of <br/>
Kumamoto castle/garrison</div>
