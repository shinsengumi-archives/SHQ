<h3>Saito Hajime&#39;s memorial service pictures</h3>
by <i>serizawakamo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505254483">Tama-san, as always, provided a first-hand report on<br/>
the memorial service ^^ So, I don't have many more<br/>
things to add. There were the traditional greetings<br/>
after the arrival of the Shinsengumi parade, some<br/>
words by Fujita Taro (the great-grandson of Fujita<br/>
Goro), the memorial service and a demonstration<br/>
(hounou enbu, actually) of Mugai-ryu iaijutsu. And I<br/>
could get to meet Tama-san in person, which was really<br/>
great ^.^<br/>
<br/>
For those who are interested, I have uploaded some<br/>
pictures I took at the memorial service. They are in<br/>
the Photos section of yahoogroups. Again, the images<br/>
are very heavy...<br/>
<br/>
And I couldn't go to the Shinsengumi summit either.<br/>
Pity.<br/>

You are both spectacular!<br/>
Everyone please give a round of applause to our agents in Japan (^_^)<br/>
I think it is *wonderful* that there is a sign with Japanese and<br/>
English with a biography of Saitou Hajime.<br/>
If anyone can type what the sign says and post I would be happy...I<br/>
cannot zoom in at all to read it (please help).<br/>
<br/>
I am [truly] grateful for these rare images!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there any signboard of explanation in present Fujita's grave? <br/>
When I went there, it did not exist. <br/>
<br/>
(Ne, Fujitake no haka wa medatsu tokoroni atta deshou?)<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, Fujita's grave did not appear in Aizu's sightseeing map <br/>
before two years.<br/>
Every year, many tourists visit the place of the relation of a Taiga <br/>
drama. <br/>
Aizu is very kind this year.^^ <br/>

Currently I am living in Aizu Takada (30 min from Aizu<br/>
Wakamatsu), but from next week I will live in Aizu<br/>
Wakamatsu, about 10 minutes from Amida-ji. Amida-ji is<br/>
located in Nanoka-machi, which is next to<br/>
Nisshin-machi, where I am going to live.<br/>
