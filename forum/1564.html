<h3>Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Company</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890848748">Sec I went back and looked at that link again. I think the problem <br/>
was I typed something wrong. The correct url is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.directcon.net/pharmer/Wakamatsu/Wakamatsu.html">http://www.directcon.net/pharmer/Wakamatsu/Wakamatsu.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The name of the site is Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony at Gold <br/>
Hill, California. If the url still won't work, then type the name <br/>
into Yahoo. It will definitely come up that way.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who are a bit confused, during the Boshin War a man <br/>
named J. H. Schnell smuggled refugees out of Aizu and brought them to <br/>
America. One was a young woman named Okei. They founded the Wakamatsu <br/>
Tea and Silk Company at Gold Hill in 1869 (near modern day <br/>
Placerville, CA), but it folded after only two years. Everyone went <br/>
their seperate ways. Okei remained in the area as an employee of a <br/>
local family. She seems to have died very young of tuberculosis and <br/>
her grave is on a hill near where the community once existed.<br/>
<br/>
While searching for the site again I came across two more pdf files:<br/>
co.el-dorado.ca.us/bos/pdf/ang8-27.pdf<br/>
co.el-dorado.ca.us/bos/pdf/cang08-27-2002.pdf<br/>
<br/>
(The first url might end /cang8-27.pdf. I have no idea if these two <br/>
files are the same or not. Still need to download that reader...)<br/>
<br/>
But wait! I found something even more exciting! A man named Jonathan <br/>
Pearce has actually writen a book about the colony! It's called The <br/>
Far Side of the Moon. ISBN# 1-59411-011-5  (Note I saw more than one <br/>
ISBN# for this book. The one I listed appears to be more recent.)<br/>
<br/>
He explains the reason he wrote the book at the below url:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.balona.com/moonwhy.html">http://www.balona.com/moonwhy.html</a><br/>
There is mention of another book called Samurai at Gold Hill by <br/>
Yoshiko Uchida. I guess that means this book should be available here <br/>
in the U.S.? Worth checking into anyway.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a brief letter to the author from a decendant of the <br/>
family that Okei worked for:<br/>

<br/>
The very first of the migration from Japan was the midst of Boshin <br/>
war in 1868.<br/>
They emigrated to Hawaii. <br/>
Then, Japanese people emigrated to some countries. <br/>
Although the reason of people who emigrated was various, there were <br/>
people who cannot live in Japan on the organization of a country <br/>
having changed. <br/>
<br/>
Enomoto Takeaki escaped from Edo together with the Tokugawa navy, <br/>
and went to Hokkaido. <br/>
While they were staying in Sendai, the foreigner who calls the <br/>
government official of Hawaii came and he recommended them to defect <br/>
to Hawaii. <br/>
Although Enomoto considered it, he refused. <br/>
In fact, the foreigner was an arms merchant who does slave trade. <br/>
It seems that he was going to sell off Tokugawa's deserters as <br/>
slaves. <br/>
Probably, history of Japan was considerably different if Enomoto <br/>
trusted him. (It is dangerous!) <br/>

I am in contact with someone at the Marshall Gold Discovery State<br/>
Historic Park...(keep your fingers crossed)...excerpt from email...<br/>
<br/>
"I believe he may have digital photos<br/>
that he can forward to you.  The banner is currently with a <br/>
conservator for the purpose of acquiring a conservation report for <br/>
the item.  The<br/>
other two are in storage in West Sacramento."<br/>

secretarytocapt3 is very very happy...<br/>

Off topic : as we know the Fujita family's kamon is used by others...<br/>
Even in the documentary in Disc 2 of Tom Cruise's "THE LAST SAMURAI"<br/>

<br/>
many years ago when I found the miburo.com site and saw it for the <br/>
first time I didn't "think" of them as bamboo leaves...I saw it very <br/>
differently...they looked like Thai designs (basically the leaves are <br/>
step 1 in drawing more elaborate designs)...attached is how the <br/>
design can be converted into traditional Thai art (much of which is <br/>
also based on geometry and symmetry)...sometimes you will see similar <br/>
patterns in textiles, household utensils and architecture...<br/>
