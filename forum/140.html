<br/>
Classical Japanese, or &quot;Bungo&quot; (&quot;Literary-language&quot;), as it&#39;s called,<br/>
basically uses an incredible amount of kanji and kana (syllabary<br/>
characters) that have been dropped as of 1868. Also, the type of<br/>
spoken bungo depended on what social class the person was from. So, a<br/>
farmer would talk differently than a samurai, the shogun would talk<br/>
differently than a ronin, and the Emperor&#39;s bungo was so archaic that<br/>
even when Showa Tenno (Emperor Hirohito) delivered his surrender<br/>
speech over the radio in 1945, most of the people had no idea what he<br/>
was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the word &quot;Bungo&quot; in this case is not to be confused with<br/>
the former province of Bungo (now Oita Prefecture) in Kyushu...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, not the same Shimabara. Amakusa Shougo&#39;s Shimabara is in Kyushu.<br/>
That was the site of the bloody Shimabara Uprising of the 1630s, where<br/>
the Tokugawa slaughtered the entire Christian population of Shimabara<br/>
down to the last man...I may love the Tokugawa in many ways, but this<br/>
is definitely _not_ one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea why the red-light district in Kyoto is called Shimabara.<br/>

Is it just me, or is he based on Amakusa Shiro (the _real_ leader of<br/>
the Shimabara Uprising)? He looks like most of the portraits of<br/>
Amakusa that I&#39;ve seen. Plus, I&#39;ve seen several crosses in scenes with<br/>
Maro or that spellcaster. And , in Episode 17 of PMK, Maro is burned<br/>
alive-- much like the &quot;mino odori&quot; (&quot;raincoat dancing&quot;) torture with<br/>
which many of the Japanese Christians died-- forced to wear straw<br/>
coats and then set alight...seeing that was almost too creepy for me...<br/>
