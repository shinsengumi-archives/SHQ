<h3>Thinking about Nakajima Nobori paintings (again)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-491774471">The first time I saw the painting of S.H. at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.miburo.com/info/truesait.jpg">http://www.miburo.com/info/truesait.jpg</a> by Nakajima Nobori (N.N.) a<br/>
couple of years ago I thought...I've seen that posture before...the<br/>
whole stepping on some poor guy's back...now I think I'm making some<br/>
connections and I have gathered some proof.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have seen the painting of Hijikata staring into the<br/>
distance wearing a traditional outfit with a tiger design and holding<br/>
a signalling flag.  Obviously, the tiger design was not draw merely<br/>
for the sake of aesthetics...but also symbolism...Hijikata's ferocity<br/>
as a warrior. To see the pic go here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tamahito.com/">http://www.tamahito.com/</a><br/>
(Hijikata is on the right and Kondo is on the left). So my point<br/>
is...he uses symbolism in his work.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, many gods in both the Chinese and Japanese Buddhist<br/>
pantheon are derived from the Hindu pantheon (they just go through a<br/>
name change just like Greek>>>Roman gods/goddesses). <br/>
So just recall S.H. portrait by N.N. and look at these sculptures of<br/>
Bishamonten<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/students/nrclark/">http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/students/nrclark/</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/bishamonten.shtml">http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/bishamonten.shtml</a><br/>
same or similar postures can also be found in depictions of Siva or<br/>
other major Hindu goddesses with just one foot on the<br/>
dwarf/yaksha(usually giants but made small next to a god/goddess) of<br/>
ignorance/fear.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that N.N. is an artist and he painted all these portraits<br/>
-and- wrote his memoirs while he was a prisoner of war...so he had<br/>
plenty of time to think...this was also probably part of his own<br/>
personal healing process and a way to salute people he had fought with<br/>
(he took to the field on numerous occasions during major battles<br/>
during the opening of the Boshin war and at Aizu, and he went w/<br/>
Hijikata to Hakodate). So N.N. like all artists are a bit romantic<br/>
(the guy did own a firearms store AND cultivated orchids too<br/>
geez)...note how his portrayal of the mysterious 17 year old heroine<br/>
of Aizu is shown in battle with a beautiful kimono etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The Japanese webpage which displayed his work was sadly deactivated<br/>
due to inactivity <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Palace/8636/bekkan.html">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Palace/8636/bekkan.html</a><br/>
To me, his work is very valuable...each person has unique features,<br/>
some faces capture, fear, anger, pain...one had a man with his hands<br/>
over a leg wound but he looked eager to return to the battle...one was<br/>
of a very young boy had blood streaming down his ankles.  The images<br/>
are graphic but very honest.<br/>
<br/>
I have an old thread at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> about N.N.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.showMessage?topicID=11.topic">http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.showMessage?topicID=11.topic</a><br/>
<br/>
Just a side note...I know I'm repeating myself from old posts but his<br/>
info on the people he painted are innaccurate...take for instance the<br/>
guys who stayed to fight at Buddha Hall didn't all DIE...a couple<br/>
survived I think one guy lived to be 90! But I and perhaps a couple of<br/>
you too may wonder if he didn't make these mistakes on purpose<br/>
sometimes just to cover for his buddies.  If he painted these while a<br/>
prisoner I imagine a guard tapping him on the shoulder and asking <br/>
prison guard:  "who are those guys?"<br/>
N.N.: "They are friends and sadly they have all perished" (puts the<br/>
back of wrist to forehead).<br/>
prison guard: "oh, okay carry on..."<br/>
N.N. proceeds to paint and paint 40 works<br/>
<br/>
Eventhough N.N. seemed to have painted them for himself, who would buy<br/>
portraits of the loser Shinsengumi? N.N. was the son of a merchant and<br/>
I doubt N.N. was a career artist.  Atleast the prisoners around him<br/>
must've seen his work because I've seen photos of an exhibit (online<br/>
and each portrait was around -I'm guessing- 2.5").</div>
