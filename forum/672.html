<h3>S.O.S.</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868432666">Would someone *please* find RK Saitou and send him over to me ASAP?  I desperately need a cigarette!!!!!!!  Unless you're a smoker, you cannot imagine how difficult it is to go through the RK manga after you've run out and no prospect for more for hours to come --- I swear Saitou just conjures them out of the air... or like he has some kind of magic pack that replenishes itself.  The number of cigarettes he just tosses aside after he's just lit it... I could smack him for that!!  So sad to sit here and stare at all those unsmoked cigarettes... ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
phil (wondering how expensive cigarettes were in Japan at the time... how long they were available only as import... assuming that Japan eventually did create it's own, but maybe not... hmmm....)<br/>

I recall seeing somewhere (on some long-forgotten website) that they were <br/>
sold in a box, but it didnt' say how big or anything. I would assume that at <br/>
first it was like a cigar box though. He probably had some sort of case to carry a <br/>
few in.<br/>
<br/>
The cigarette as we know it  was first mass-produced in Cuba in 1853. It <br/>
remained something that only the rich indulged in until 1854-6, which British <br/>
soldiers in the Crimean War picked up the habit from the Turks, who were their <br/>
allies. (A group of Eygptian artillerymen started making the first paper-wrapped <br/>
cigarettes in 1832, when a communal clay pipe was broken by a Turkish <br/>
cannonball fire! War is responsible for all evils, ne?) <br/>
<br/>
 It is possible that the Japanese were beginning to produce their own by the <br/>
beginning of the Meiji era. Some of you recall me post on the messageboard <br/>
about the no smoking law? Well, I don't remember if I mentioned it there or not, <br/>
but they were growing some tobacco (illegally of course) in Japan during the <br/>
Edo period.  And I know they were producing and exporting matches at the time <br/>
RK was set in. (Match info from another long-forgotten website!)<br/>
<br/>
The info comes from a book called Reader's Digest Everyday Life Through the <br/>
Ages. (1992) ISBN# 0-276-42035-7<br/>
