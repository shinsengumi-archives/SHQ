<h3>Fujita Goro and Ulcers and what does it all really mean?</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994073351">I read a bit on ulcers summer 2005 and stopped when it got complicated<br/>
with genetics, brain chemistry and the new nobel prize winning discovery <br/>
which points to ulcers as being an infectious disease caused by a<br/>
bacteria of some sort (link which explains this discovery is in the<br/>
document below)<br/>

<br/>
I decided to spend a couple of hours typing this because one of my<br/>
older much loved, albeit annoying co-workers is an ulcer patient.  He<br/>
DOES FIT these personality traits...and to top it off he is the "rare"<br/>
kind of ulcer patient.  The juvenile ulcer patient...and to make it<br/>
more interesting...he's a leftie. After grilling him with questions I<br/>
formed from my superficial study I knew that there is "something to"<br/>
these kinds of people--after all ulcers have mental causes.<br/>
<br/>
ok my mini fangirl essay will not and cannot prove that Fujita Goro was<br/>
1) a juvenile ulcer patient<br/>
however I think that there are some things in the essay which will be<br/>
of interest to some people<br/>
<br/>
I can't upload it to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> because unlike the <br/>
Okita + TB essay<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
this ulcer essay was based on notes I typed without page numbers,<br/>
HOWEVER I do know exactly which books everything came from and the<br/>
author's names are noted after quotes<br/>
<br/>
often, shinsengumihq.com will use the good old MLA citation system in<br/>
an attempt to maintain information integrity <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mla.org/style">http://www.mla.org/style</a><br/>
<br/>
and because this particular piece lacks page numbers wwhich would<br/>
allow verification I decided not to upload it (T_T)<br/>
<br/>
but it is still....interesting...very interesting<br/>
<br/>
if people have questions you can aim me at "badgerturtle" or see me in<br/>
the MIRC chat room Bunneh set up...sometimes questions help me recall<br/>
a detail I forgot to include</div>

<h3>List of Pages (no pun intended)</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282098630">Here is a list of pages (kosho) of big figures, whose names I've <br/>
encountered. Name of the big figure comes first.<br/>
<br/>
Kondou Isami-- Inoue Taisuke (Genzaburo's nephew)<br/>
Hijikata Toshizo- Ichimura Tetsunosuke<br/>
Matsudaira Katamori- Takamine Hideo<br/>
Matsudaira Sadaaki- Tatsumi Kanzaburo (aka Tatsumi Naofumi)<br/>
<br/>
Of all of these pages, Inoue Taisuke and Ichimura Tetsunosuke would have <br/>
known each other very well, and Takamine Hideo and Tatsumi Kanzaburo might <br/>
have at least seen each other if not interacted.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I know of photos exisiting for all but Tetsunosuke.<br/>
