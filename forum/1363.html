THE BACHELOR: Hijikata ^_^<br/>
<br/>
I keep mentioning that Mamoru Oshii's (famous for Ghost in the Shell)<br/>
Jin Roh: The Wolf Brigade is influenced by the Shinsengumi...now I<br/>
have even more proof.  Mamoru Oshii also made a film called Jigoku no<br/>
banken: kerubersu (1991) or Stray Dog: Kerberos Panzer Cops (USA<br/>
release 2003) (actually made in 1991)I think Kerberos is a corruption<br/>
of Cerberus the 3 headed dog of the underworld.  It can be categorized<br/>
as an art film and it is not for everyone.  "Stray Dog" is almost a<br/>
live action verson of "Jin Roh: The Wolf Brigade" (easy to find in the<br/>
U.S.) but with a totally different storyline.  Same group of guys<br/>
(with armor and night vision capabilities) but this time it is about 2<br/>
surviving members of Kerberos.  One was a prisoner for 3 years, I'll<br/>
call him Mr. A, and the stock phrase "best behavior" was in the<br/>
subtitles...one escapes to China.  Most of the movie takes place on a<br/>
shrimp farm in China as the subordinate officer tries to understand<br/>
his former superior officer (commander of the Kerberos Group) let's<br/>
call him Mr. B.  Mr. A receives a deal from the government to track<br/>
down Mr. B so Mr. A is working for the new government on an informal<br/>
basis.  The movie makes a bid deal about "dogs" and their value in<br/>
society and their role to their masters (Jin Roh replaces dogs with<br/>
wolves)...and how dogs are used and discarded.  The movie contains<br/>
flash backs, during the end of the Kerberos force, Mr. A is abandoned<br/>
by his commander Mr. B.(this is the source of confusion for Mr. A).<br/>
Now after the government is established both Mr. A and Mr. B have lost<br/>
all direction in life.  Kerberos and Jin Roh are without a doubt a<br/>
synthesis of Shinsengumi history and not any other group because of<br/>
the emphasis on the end of an era and noticeably in Kerberos the<br/>
bringing together of various stary dogs (ronin?), giving them the best<br/>
equipment money can buy and organizing them into small units (namely<br/>
1,2,3).  Kerberos and Jin Roh are not armies they are a special task<br/>
force of the police department thus there is no basis for connecting<br/>
them to let's say the Satsuma samurai now known to the west as the<br/>
Last Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
QUOTES FROM THE MOVIE...(and ummm some of it will sound very familar)<br/>
"The riots were over and became just a part of history.  The<br/>
government officials had completely oppressed and annihilated the<br/>
opposition.  However, this lead to another battle against the elite<br/>
security unit that is known as "kerberos" who refused the order from<br/>
their officials to disband. It created a symbolic figure at the end of<br/>
this age.  It was a rebellion of watch dogs who had lost their<br/>
masters.  People called it the Kerberos Uprising."<br/>
<br/>
I'm still human inside even though I was trained to be a dog.<br/>
<br/>
the ability to "smell" comrades and find them<br/>
<br/>
desire to choose a master to be faithful to..."like a nation or a thought"<br/>
<br/>
"I wish we both could find masters who we won't regret"<br/>
<br/>
"They(watch dogs) will never know the reason why their master had to<br/>
dump them."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm going to talk about and impressive but tragic story about a dog<br/>
who is looking for his master and his future."<br/>
<br/>
"There are many reasons why masters dump their dogs...you can even<br/>
call it a historical necessity.  No matter how unreasonable it may<br/>
sound the dog has to pay for any misfortuneon his own even if he<br/>
couldn't understand the reason why."<br/>
<br/>
Hero/main character got out of jail fast because "given a separate<br/>
trial and was a well-behaved model prisoner."<br/>
<br/>
"the time when dogs will disappear from this country will come...Even<br/>
if your membory of the time you were a dog fills your hear with<br/>
excitement humans have to live only as humans."<br/>
<br/>
[I have screenshots from this film and will put them side by side with<br/>
 Jin Roh and will probably go all crazy and do a write up for<br/>
SHQ...even though I have to finish other stuff ^_^]<br/>
<br/>
I watch Onmyoji (recommend by unsafesects I think) and it is from the<br/>
director of Mibu Gishi Den (When the Last Sword is Drawn)...decent<br/>
film about the sorcerer Seibei who lived during the Heian era AND HE<br/>
WAS A REAL PERSON!!!!  I watched the extras and found the extras to be<br/>
very cool because the guy who portrays seibei, a kyogen actor(?), had<br/>
to go to Seibei's shrine in Kyoto (built at the location of his.<br/>
Seibei's house).  The actor in the extras and in the movie talks about<br/>
the significance of names for spells and how names ARE spells.  He<br/>
said "when I get tired of myself I can/will just change my name".<br/>
<br/>
And to finish off my marathon movie watching weekend my new copy of<br/>
Twilight Samurai arrived.  If Mibu Gishi Den is about what was going<br/>
on in Kyoto then Twilight Samurai deals with what was happening in the<br/>
 countryside during the exact same time period.  The 2 fight scenes in<br/>
Twilight Samurai are ~masterful~ (and I wish Mibu Gishi Den had more<br/>
of these scenes!) and the movie gets and A+ from me for great story,<br/>
cinematography and acting.  The film will touch on the koku rice<br/>
system, famine, the escalating violence in Kyoto, the hardship of<br/>
ronin, the representation system in Edo (where retainers hardly meet<br/>
their lords) and low ranking samurai.  The domain in which the movie<br/>
takes place was pro shogunate and close to Aizu (heroine was supposed<br/>
to marry a retainer in Aizu)...and well you can kind of guess the<br/>
ending.  This film is not an epic it is like Mibu Gishi Den a very<br/>
good drama.  Twilight Samurai is a must see because it will allow us<br/>
to better understand the demographics in the Shinsengumi not everyone<br/>
was from a high ranking samurai family e.g. Saitou.</div>
