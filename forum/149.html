I hope this message gets posted unlike my other replies today<br/>

Ofcourse, I have not found an explanation for the significane of dying <br/>
while sitting in the seiza position which was mentioned on either <br/>
http://1to5.net or http://www.3-hajime.com...so I posted this question at the <br/>
www.e-budo.com forum under the username Fujita Makoto :P<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884361901">The seiza thing sounds like how Takuan Soho, the Zen Master and friend<br/>
of Yagyu Munenori (of Yagyu Shinkage Ryuu), died. Just before he<br/>
passed on, he took his calligraphy brush, assumed a seiza position,<br/>
wrote "Yume" (dream), put down the brush, and died.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds similar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697568641">So far the replies mentioned its religious significance<br/>
and the historical figure Yamaoka Tesshu (born Ono Tetsutaro) 1836 - <br/>
1888, founder of Muto-ryu sword school (book on him titled:The Sword <br/>
of No Sword).<br/>
<br/>
My personal {interpretation} is historical S.H. wanted composure, <br/>
presence of mind and wanted to witness his own death.  A majority of <br/>
Japanese people at the time practiced a synthesis of Shintoism and <br/>
Buddhism (many many sects/interepretations)...S.H. was buried at the <br/>
temple of Amitabha Buddha so (I'm guessing that he was a Pure Land <br/>
Buddhist).  As mentioned by Serizawa Kamo he may have practiced <br/>
Mugai ryu kenjutsu (NOT iaijutsu/iaido(?)) which survives today and <br/>
has websites.  Mugai ryu is heavily influenced by Buddhism---but <br/>
ofcourse we don't know the extent of S.H.'s devotion/piousness.  <br/>
Mugai ryu emphasizes swordsmanship hand in hand with Buddhist <br/>
beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
In Buddhist meditation you want to cultivate awareness by observing <br/>
the breath and mental fluctuations...so maybe this is what <br/>
historical S.H. was aiming for.  Hindu-Buddhist beliefs in <br/>
reincarnation aside, all we know for sure is that no one can <br/>
remember their birth but they -can- experience their death (if they <br/>
die naturally).  Back then I don't think people had/used painkillers <br/>
so someone in S.H.'s situation had to suffer a really long time <br/>
(gastric ulcers -symptoms- can take years before it becomes fatal). <br/>
Many people today who pass on in hospitals lose consciousness long <br/>
before their last breathe. So maybe S.H. was thinking along these <br/>
lines...he was a policeman and soldier, he had a life filled with <br/>
violence (I don't think he forgot the people he killed even in cases <br/>
of self defense) and I'm sure his own mortality was on his mind alot.<br/>
<br/>
My last and lamest interpretation was that he may not have died like <br/>
this for -himself- but as a gift to his family who would ofcourse <br/>
find him in this way.  Like a testament to them about all of his <br/>
prior actions, all of his intentions.  A way for them to never <br/>
forget him and how he lived.  His last demonstration of strength and <br/>
will after a prolonged illness and turbulent life.  Recall in RK OVA <br/>
Remembrance when Kaoru's mother or father's (I can't recall) body is <br/>
on the futon and the person's face is covered with a small white <br/>
clothe...the impact of a loved one's passing is devastating enough <br/>
now how is this different from find that person sitting in the seiza <br/>
position after he had been confined to a sick bed for so long?<br/>
<br/>
It is raining where I am so such gloomy thoughts emerge easily.<br/>
