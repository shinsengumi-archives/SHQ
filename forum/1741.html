<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035761234">Actually, I had a similar view when I first started watching the series as well. After about 4 eps I was actually thinking about not watching the rest of the series till a friend told me it actually gets better. (I also had this same opinion with MADLAX, but that and PMK both turned out great) He was right as things started picking up about ep 8 or so. Most of this probably had to do with being used to watching other Shinsengumi related shows which were a bit more fast paced. <br/>

...could you possibly recommend any of those shows? I know there&#39;s supposed to be a lot of anime and such that relates to them.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I don&#39;t agree with the reviewer... I thought the show started out all right, got rather boring at times in the middle (then again, that may be because I don&#39;t care for the Maro/fake Okita storyline at all, I think it had potential but they did very little useful with it) and really picked up from #18 onwards. <br/>
