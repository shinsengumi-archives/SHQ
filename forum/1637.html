<h3>First report of Saito Hajime ceremony</h3>
by <i>tamagot93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-796379555">I'll post later more detail of this event with Aizu autumn festival reportand <br/>
photos.<br/>
Just I'd like to tell you this year, a great grandson of Fujita <br/>
Goro,Mr.Fujita Taro attended at the Saito Hajime comemorative ceremony and he mentioned <br/>
again aboutthat unknown photo of Goro in the speech.<br/>
He said that the photo was taken in 2nd year of Taisho (1914), andseeing the <br/>
photo,  he thinks Goro is a very tall man and looks like his grandfather <br/>
Tsutomu verymuch.<br/>
<br/>
As I can't attend the symposium because of the train schedule, I don'tknow if <br/>
the photo was shown to public today, but we can expectsomething in the near <br/>
future. <br/>
<br/>
