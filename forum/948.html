<div id="ygrps-yiv-495965232">For a show called the &quot;Tokaido Road&quot; they sure didn&#39;t have much about <br/>
it! The mentioned it all of two or three times! They mentioned the 47 <br/>
Ronin, but then said that their mass suicide was the act of revenge! <br/>
I thought their suicide was their punishment for their revenge?! Am I <br/>
wrong?! They also mentioned (just barely) the fall of the Shogunate, <br/>
but not only did they not say anything about the Boshin War, they <br/>
made no reference to Saigo, Okubo, or Katsura! They mentioned <br/>
Takasugi of all people!!! So basically if you missed the program, you <br/>
didn&#39;t miss anything the group hasn&#39;t already discussed. -sigh- And I <br/>
went and got my hopes up for nothing...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713609062">LOL that&#39;s good for me. I was so pissed when I missed it! I guess I didn&#39;t really miss much...I can relax now. I was so mad at myself when I found out I missed it XD but, how could they mention Taka-what&#39;s-his-face and none of the other guys? *grumbles* Baka peoples...<br/>
