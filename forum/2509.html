<h3>Anyone know about this exhibit at the Edo Tokyo Museum?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216614066">The article is dated July last year, so I don&#39;t know if the exhibit is<br/>
even still there or not.  I can&#39;t really make too much of the<br/>
translations I&#39;m getting, and the museum&#39;s English site is welcome,<br/>
but not very informative.  From what I can tell you can&#39;t order from<br/>
their museum store online.  Check out the cover to one of the exhibits<br/>
books at<br/>

It looks like it might have a lot of photos and information - and the<br/>
Edo Tokyo museum is known to be unusually English friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know anything else about this exhibit?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks yo,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701094502">Just from the look of it it seems to have been in conjunction with last <br/>
year&#39;s Taiga drama. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was still going on, <br/>
though, especially considering that they&#39;re going to have the continuation <br/>
this coming year.<br/>
