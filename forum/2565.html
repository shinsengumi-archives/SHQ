Shinsengumi: The Shogun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps by Romulus Hillsborough<br/>
the original title had &quot;bloody legacy&quot; in it which wouldn&#39;t be an <br/>

too negative sounding, or else the Shinsengumi have become well enough known<br/>
recently that the publishers wanted the group&#39;s name more prominent in the<br/>

<br/>
I got my copy yesterday and have read a few bits and pieces of it so far.<br/>
It&#39;s quite good and has a lot of information in it.  It also has a lot of<br/>
the author&#39;s opinions, but the distinction between what&#39;s fact and what&#39;s<br/>
biased opinion seems to be fairly clear for the most part.  It seems<br/>
well-written and very readable.  Anyway, I&#39;m so glad it finally came out and<br/>
we finally have a source in English for a lot of this history.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427803121">Hm. Haven&#39;t had a chance to read it fully, but in skimming it noticed a few interesting things.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First - a map of Kyoto interior.  (Finally we have a location for Mibu village with other key patrol areas marked.)  <br/>
<br/>
The list of references are provided in two different ways. First a straight list and then organized by book chapters (so you can see where particular statements are taken from).     There seems to be a heavy dependence on a few works in his narratives.    (He also cites himself I believe at least twice, which I have some issues with:)  )   I think there also isn&#39;t really an attempt on his part to evaluate the sources he cites from.  <br/>
<br/>
Photos: Really there are only four.  The images of Kondo and Hijikata have all appeared frequently on the web.   Kondo&#39;s jacket/haori with the skull is also included.  There is one banner from the Hijikata museum that graces the back cover.   As for the woodblock cover, still can&#39;t figure out where it comes from, although it appears to have been provided by Kojima Masataka of the Kojima Museum (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/)">http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/)</a> .  <br/>
 (It appears to be Satsuma clan based on their headdresses vs. Bakufu.)<br/>
 <br/>
As for the role of the Shinisengumi in the deaths of Ito, Takeda and Yamanami, I am not sure that fans of the taiga or anime depictions  will like what is presented here.  It certainly isn&#39;t the noble version of history that the taiga tries to portray.   <br/>

Samurai Corps&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
(Review)<br/>
 <br/>
The reason why history is so &quot;dull&quot; to many is that the disciplined<br/>
historian attempts to record and organize information in a straight<br/>
forward manner.  He or she strives to provide this valuable service<br/>
without letting personal bias interfere with the goal.<br/>
<br/>
Romulus Hillsborough, lived in Japan for 15 years and is fluent in<br/>
Japanese.  So I&#39;m in no position to criticize him as I can&#39;t compare<br/>
his sources with his interpretations.  He took on the difficult task<br/>
of writing the first book on the Shinsengumi in English.  However he<br/>
makes no attempt at adopting a dispassionate tone needed in dealing<br/>
with this &quot;legal terrorist organization&quot; (121).<br/>
<br/>
Besides the constant sarcasm he uses the term &quot;propensity to kill&quot;<br/>
***atleast over 30 times in the narrative (I stopped counting). <br/>
Hillsborough makes no attempt to add variation to his stock phrase<br/>
&quot;Okita the genius swordsman&quot;.  He even attempts poetry or add flare to<br/>
his prose with the mentioned phrase &quot;propensity to kill&quot;.  You see,<br/>
this is why the original title contained the words &quot;bloody legacy&quot;.  I<br/>
think most of us will agree that because we are STUDYING A CIVIL<br/>
[WAR], no one was using rubber bullets nor bamboo swords.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
heard of a bloodless war.  Atleast he mentions in passing the<br/>
loyalists who also had a &quot;propensity to kill&quot;.  Almost forgot to<br/>
mention Kondou and Hijkata&#39;s irrepressible &quot;will to power&quot; (read that<br/>
phrase 20 times). I did not think his constant use of the &quot;sun<br/>
goddess&quot; in her intervention of state affairs was a good idea.  He<br/>
wanted the goddess to represent &quot;fate&quot; and she had her darlings on the<br/>
loyalist side.  <br/>
<br/>
After completing the book I began to wonder if this Shinsengumi book<br/>
was simply written to bolster his previous works on his personal heroes.<br/>
<br/>
To this author the people of Kyoto loved the loyalists with all their<br/>
heart.  I am kicking myself for not recording the book which mentions<br/>
that a folk song was written and sung in praise (not by professionals<br/>
but peasants) of the Protector of Kyoto.  It may be common sense to us<br/>
that many people in the city just wanted to live in peace and could<br/>
care less for the politics (either for the bakufu or the Imperialists).<br/>
<br/>
His bibliography is very limited.  He used one of Akama&#39;s books and<br/>
entirely ignores perhaps her most famous work on Saitou Hajime, which<br/>
is one of most often cited books on Japanese sites.  Hence, in the few<br/>
sentences on Saitou Hajime&#39;s life in the Meiji he is said to have<br/>
wandered southwest to the Takada Han for a while and then moved to<br/>
Tokyo and married a daughter of a retainer from Aizu.  <br/>
<br/>
In many stories there is ofcourse more than one version.  Many<br/>
Japanese sites are able to discuss and post information.  For example<br/>
the death of Takeda may have been attributed to a stroke or by<br/>
Saitou&#39;s hand.  Hillsborough has a few footnotes but he should&#39;ve used<br/>
them to more effectively to give a different take on stories.<br/>
<br/>
He should be credited for introducing the story of Kondou&#39;s daughter<br/>
Oyu (born to his mistres Otaka sister of Miyuki) to the western world.<br/>
 Prior to reading this book I did read a ***fanfic*** translated via<br/>
nifty which portrays Fujita Goro as helping the daughter of Kondou. <br/>
According to Hillsborough a policeman formerly affiliated with the<br/>
Shinsengumi attempted to save Kondou&#39;s daughter from life in the<br/>
red-light district. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise the book provides an ok introduction to the era and details<br/>
we never had before.  The limited bibliography may help a serious<br/>
scholar in the future start his or her work.  If anyone has the money<br/>
please consider donating a hard cover copy to your local library.<br/>
<br/>
This book proves again that such a subject needs to be studied as a<br/>
group in teams from different perspectives.<br/>
Mr. Hillsborough would&#39;ve also benefited GREATLY from the<br/>
knowledgeable and open minded Japanese fans.  Amongst those cosplayers<br/>
and great collectors of Shinsengumi doujinshi are critical thinkers. <br/>
He should&#39;ve atleast interviewed the authors of some of the recent books.</div>

<br/>
&quot;Aizu Higo-sama Kyoto Shugoshoku tsutomemasu. Dairi hanjou de kuge andou. <br/>
Tokoyononaka you ga ishou&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was written shortly after Aizu kicked Choshu out of Kyoto, and it means <br/>
&quot;Lord Aizu Higo (no Kami) is the Protector of Kyoto. The Palace is safe, the <br/>
nobles are unharmed. Peace and order have returned to the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
(Commentary)<br/>
<br/>
For the record, though I&#39;ve only read part of &quot;Samurai Sketches,&quot; I have <br/>
never trusted Romulus Hillsborough-- a man who, despite having never been <br/>
trained in critical historical analysis, has the pretense to write &quot;history&quot; <br/>
books which, like your review said, are essentially in support of his own <br/>
heroes. I have less of a problem with him than with Stephen Turnbull, <br/>
though-- a man who, though trained as an historian, writes books (including <br/>
a whole chapter in one of them about Aizu) with GAPING inaccuracies.<br/>
<br/>
As I am currently working on a full-length (50 or so pages) paper about the <br/>
Aizu domain in teh Bakumatsu period (including Shinsengumi), I feel the need <br/>
to point out some things that I have noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough is essentially of the Marius Jansen school-- the school of <br/>
thought which says &quot;Aizu=Tokugawa partisans to the end, end of story.&quot; The <br/>
fact of the matter is that Aizu was the only domain bound in writing to obey <br/>
the Shogunate to the last, but that even so, the internal dissent against <br/>
going to Kyoto was so extreme that Saigo Tanomo and Tanaka Tosa, two of the <br/>
senior councilors, went all the way to Edo to beg Katamori to reject it. But <br/>
men like Matsudaira Shungaku (this is mentioned in Conrad Totman&#39;s book <br/>
&quot;Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;) basically gave Katamori a guilt trip, <br/>
saying that the Aizu founder Hoshina Masayuki would have taken the job in a <br/>
heartbeat. Katamori, being adopted, must have felt guilty, so knowing full <br/>
well the impact it would have on his domain&#39;s peasants, but also knowing <br/>
full well that he had his hands tied in every way imaginable, went to Kyoto. <br/>
In the Boshin War, Katamori had long since given up on Yoshinobu, and he and <br/>
Enomoto Takeaki, far from wanting to reinstate the Shogun, kept begging for <br/>
mercy and making proposals for peaceful settlements (this is mentioned in <br/>
the book &quot;Young Japan&quot;). Katsu Kaishu was also working hard for a peaceful, <br/>
generous settlement for the Tokugawa-- but as in Kyoto with the &#39;extreme&#39; <br/>
Choshu faction that was attacked by Shinsengumi at Ikedaya-- in Edo, the <br/>
Shogitai-- the REAL &quot;Tokugawa Partisans&quot;-- who I would go so far as to <br/>
describe as &quot;rabid&quot; partisans-- attacked the forces of the new government <br/>
and thus dashed any hopes for peace.<br/>
<br/>
The Northern Alliance (Oetsu Reppan Domei) is also seen by the Jansen school <br/>
as being &quot;pro-Tokugawa,&quot; when in fact most of its members were &quot;outer&quot; <br/>
(tozama) lords, with only a handful of Tokugawa vassal (fudai) domains and a <br/>
couple of Tokugawa-branch domains, probably only Aizu and Moriyama or Miharu <br/>
(not sure which one). Their intentions? As stated in their statement to the <br/>
foreign powers, &quot;We will destroy the offenders (Satsuma/Choshu). Those who <br/>
fly before us we shall not pursue; but we will reconquer Japan, that the <br/>
Emperor may indeed reign over it.&quot; (from &quot;Young Japan&quot;) Thus, it wasn&#39;t a <br/>
matter of Shogun vs. Emperor, it was a matter of a grudge that Choshu had <br/>
against Aizu for sponsoring the anti-Choshu expeditions and fighting against <br/>
the Choshu &quot;activists&quot; in Kyoto. Hence the reason why Katamori begged for <br/>
mercy but was not heard-- he was operating under the assumption that what <br/>
was going on concerned the Emperor, when in fact it was simply between him <br/>
and Choshu, and with Choshu surrounding the Emperor (as Aizu had done <br/>
before),�@there would be no answer to his pleas.<br/>
<br/>
Neither was Rinnoji no Miya, the Imperial prince who led the Northern <br/>
Alliance, a &quot;second Emperor&quot; like the Northern and Southern Courts <br/>
(Nanbokucho) era. Though the Northern Alliance adopted a new reign name <br/>
(Taisei instead of Meiji), Rinnoji no Miya was never referred to as <br/>
&quot;tenno&quot;-- &quot;Emperor,&quot; though he did take the name of Tobu.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there was extortion and forcible appropriation on both sides. This too <br/>
deserves to be studied more closely in order for both sides to be studied <br/>
properly. The actions of the Shogitai are particularly unfortunate, in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
However, what amazes me is that even when Enomoto was in Hokkaido he still <br/>
practically begged for mercy and a peaceful settlement, saying &quot;We pray that <br/>
this portion of the Empire (Hokkaido) may be conferred upon our former <br/>
master, Tokugawa Kamenosuke (Yoshinobu&#39;s adopted son and successor), and in <br/>
that case, we shall repay your benificence by our faithful guardianship of <br/>
the northern gate.&quot; (&quot;Young Japan,&quot; page 241) Naturally, however, having <br/>
endured the campaigns in Echigo, Aizu, and Mutsu/Dewa, and the unfortunate <br/>
episode of the Shogitai, the new government was in no disposition to listen <br/>
to such a request, and moved to attack Hokkaido.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is, in the words of General William Tecumseh Sherman, that <br/>
&quot;war is Hell.&quot;<br/>

Ok... I&#39;m fairly new and am well aware that theres a<br/>
TON of info I don&#39;t know about the Shinsengumi, and<br/>
this was just another thing that I&#39;ve never ran<br/>
accross while going through various webpages.   I<br/>
think I read a long time ago that Kondou was married<br/>
sometime before he left to Kyoto (as Roshigumi) and a<br/>
daughter was born shortly after he left, and<br/>
appearently he never meet his daughter even when he<br/>
returned to Edo to recruit more men.   But know that I<br/>
read this, I wonder if what I read was even correct.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I was wondering you by chance you still have<br/>
the link to that fanfic (sounds intresting).   And<br/>
also, may I ask for the members on this mailing list<br/>
to help me find another fanfic that I can&#39;t find<br/>
anymore.   The fic is a RK one, saddly I don&#39;t<br/>
remember the name of the piece or the author.   The<br/>
few chapters that I read started pretty much a few<br/>
days before the Ikedaya, it dealed mostly of what the<br/>
Shinsengumi were doing.   One chapter in particular<br/>
centered completely around Hijikata discoving a few<br/>
tradors amoung the ranks (4 men I think) and ordering<br/>
their deaths (when each man was by himself).   After<br/>
being confronted by Hijikata himself, one of the men<br/>
is willing to commit seppuku and asks for Hijikata to<br/>
be his kaishaku.   After the man split his belly open,<br/>
Hijikata picks up the short sword used by the man and<br/>
walks away, warning everyone that if they help the<br/>
man, they will suffer the same faith.   He really was<br/>
depicted as a deamon in this part of the fic ...and<br/>
thats pretty much all I remember about the fic.<br/>

Nifty translates some things very well like &quot;you are my doll&quot; and <br/>

The initial moments of the raid on Ikedaya were well directed and <br/>
Hijikata&#39;s dance to intimidate &quot;Seki&quot;(Itou) was beautiful. It also <br/>
