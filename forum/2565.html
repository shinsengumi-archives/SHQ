too negative sounding, or else the Shinsengumi have become well enough known<br/>
recently that the publishers wanted the group's name more prominent in the<br/>
title.  Perhaps all three.)<br/>
<br/>
I got my copy yesterday and have read a few bits and pieces of it so far.<br/>
It's quite good and has a lot of information in it.  It also has a lot of<br/>
the author's opinions, but the distinction between what's fact and what's<br/>
biased opinion seems to be fairly clear for the most part.  It seems<br/>
well-written and very readable.  Anyway, I'm so glad it finally came out and<br/>
we finally have a source in English for a lot of this history.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427803121">Hm. Haven't had a chance to read it fully, but in skimming it noticed a few interesting things.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First - a map of Kyoto interior.  (Finally we have a location for Mibu village with other key patrol areas marked.)  <br/>
<br/>
The list of references are provided in two different ways. First a straight list and then organized by book chapters (so you can see where particular statements are taken from).     There seems to be a heavy dependence on a few works in his narratives.    (He also cites himself I believe at least twice, which I have some issues with:)  )   I think there also isn't really an attempt on his part to evaluate the sources he cites from.  <br/>
<br/>
Photos: Really there are only four.  The images of Kondo and Hijikata have all appeared frequently on the web.   Kondo's jacket/haori with the skull is also included.  There is one banner from the Hijikata museum that graces the back cover.   As for the woodblock cover, still can't figure out where it comes from, although it appears to have been provided by Kojima Masataka of the Kojima Museum (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/)">http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/)</a> .  <br/>
 (It appears to be Satsuma clan based on their headdresses vs. Bakufu.)<br/>
 <br/>
As for the role of the Shinisengumi in the deaths of Ito, Takeda and Yamanami, I am not sure that fans of the taiga or anime depictions  will like what is presented here.  It certainly isn't the noble version of history that the taiga tries to portray.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bloody Legacy Of The Shinsengumi" to "Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last<br/>
Samurai Corps".  <br/>
<br/>
(Review)<br/>
 <br/>
The reason why history is so "dull" to many is that the disciplined<br/>
historian attempts to record and organize information in a straight<br/>
forward manner.  He or she strives to provide this valuable service<br/>
without letting personal bias interfere with the goal.<br/>
<br/>
Romulus Hillsborough, lived in Japan for 15 years and is fluent in<br/>
Japanese.  So I'm in no position to criticize him as I can't compare<br/>
his sources with his interpretations.  He took on the difficult task<br/>
of writing the first book on the Shinsengumi in English.  However he<br/>
makes no attempt at adopting a dispassionate tone needed in dealing<br/>
with this "legal terrorist organization" (121).<br/>
<br/>
Besides the constant sarcasm he uses the term "propensity to kill"<br/>
***atleast over 30 times in the narrative (I stopped counting). <br/>
Hillsborough makes no attempt to add variation to his stock phrase<br/>
"Okita the genius swordsman".  He even attempts poetry or add flare to<br/>
his prose with the mentioned phrase "propensity to kill".  You see,<br/>
this is why the original title contained the words "bloody legacy".  I<br/>
think most of us will agree that because we are STUDYING A CIVIL<br/>
[WAR], no one was using rubber bullets nor bamboo swords.  I've never<br/>
heard of a bloodless war.  Atleast he mentions in passing the<br/>
loyalists who also had a "propensity to kill".  Almost forgot to<br/>
mention Kondou and Hijkata's irrepressible "will to power" (read that<br/>
phrase 20 times). I did not think his constant use of the "sun<br/>
goddess" in her intervention of state affairs was a good idea.  He<br/>
wanted the goddess to represent "fate" and she had her darlings on the<br/>
loyalist side.  <br/>
<br/>
After completing the book I began to wonder if this Shinsengumi book<br/>
was simply written to bolster his previous works on his personal heroes.<br/>
<br/>
To this author the people of Kyoto loved the loyalists with all their<br/>
heart.  I am kicking myself for not recording the book which mentions<br/>
that a folk song was written and sung in praise (not by professionals<br/>
but peasants) of the Protector of Kyoto.  It may be common sense to us<br/>
that many people in the city just wanted to live in peace and could<br/>
care less for the politics (either for the bakufu or the Imperialists).<br/>
<br/>
His bibliography is very limited.  He used one of Akama's books and<br/>
entirely ignores perhaps her most famous work on Saitou Hajime, which<br/>
is one of most often cited books on Japanese sites.  Hence, in the few<br/>
sentences on Saitou Hajime's life in the Meiji he is said to have<br/>
wandered southwest to the Takada Han for a while and then moved to<br/>
Tokyo and married a daughter of a retainer from Aizu.  <br/>
<br/>
In many stories there is ofcourse more than one version.  Many<br/>
Japanese sites are able to discuss and post information.  For example<br/>
the death of Takeda may have been attributed to a stroke or by<br/>
Saitou's hand.  Hillsborough has a few footnotes but he should've used<br/>
them to more effectively to give a different take on stories.<br/>
<br/>
He should be credited for introducing the story of Kondou's daughter<br/>
Oyu (born to his mistres Otaka sister of Miyuki) to the western world.<br/>
 Prior to reading this book I did read a ***fanfic*** translated via<br/>
nifty which portrays Fujita Goro as helping the daughter of Kondou. <br/>
According to Hillsborough a policeman formerly affiliated with the<br/>
Shinsengumi attempted to save Kondou's daughter from life in the<br/>
red-light district. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise the book provides an ok introduction to the era and details<br/>
we never had before.  The limited bibliography may help a serious<br/>
scholar in the future start his or her work.  If anyone has the money<br/>
please consider donating a hard cover copy to your local library.<br/>
<br/>
This book proves again that such a subject needs to be studied as a<br/>
group in teams from different perspectives.<br/>
Mr. Hillsborough would've also benefited GREATLY from the<br/>
knowledgeable and open minded Japanese fans.  Amongst those cosplayers<br/>
and great collectors of Shinsengumi doujinshi are critical thinkers. <br/>
He should've atleast interviewed the authors of some of the recent books.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The song appears in the film "Byakkotai," and goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
"Aizu Higo-sama Kyoto Shugoshoku tsutomemasu. Dairi hanjou de kuge andou. <br/>
Tokoyononaka you ga ishou"<br/>
<br/>
It was written shortly after Aizu kicked Choshu out of Kyoto, and it means <br/>
"Lord Aizu Higo (no Kami) is the Protector of Kyoto. The Palace is safe, the <br/>
nobles are unharmed. Peace and order have returned to the world."<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
(Commentary)<br/>
<br/>
For the record, though I've only read part of "Samurai Sketches," I have <br/>
never trusted Romulus Hillsborough-- a man who, despite having never been <br/>
trained in critical historical analysis, has the pretense to write "history" <br/>
books which, like your review said, are essentially in support of his own <br/>
heroes. I have less of a problem with him than with Stephen Turnbull, <br/>
though-- a man who, though trained as an historian, writes books (including <br/>
a whole chapter in one of them about Aizu) with GAPING inaccuracies.<br/>
<br/>
As I am currently working on a full-length (50 or so pages) paper about the <br/>
Aizu domain in teh Bakumatsu period (including Shinsengumi), I feel the need <br/>
to point out some things that I have noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough is essentially of the Marius Jansen school-- the school of <br/>
thought which says "Aizu=Tokugawa partisans to the end, end of story." The <br/>
fact of the matter is that Aizu was the only domain bound in writing to obey <br/>
the Shogunate to the last, but that even so, the internal dissent against <br/>
going to Kyoto was so extreme that Saigo Tanomo and Tanaka Tosa, two of the <br/>
senior councilors, went all the way to Edo to beg Katamori to reject it. But <br/>
men like Matsudaira Shungaku (this is mentioned in Conrad Totman's book <br/>
"Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu") basically gave Katamori a guilt trip, <br/>
saying that the Aizu founder Hoshina Masayuki would have taken the job in a <br/>
heartbeat. Katamori, being adopted, must have felt guilty, so knowing full <br/>
well the impact it would have on his domain's peasants, but also knowing <br/>
full well that he had his hands tied in every way imaginable, went to Kyoto. <br/>
In the Boshin War, Katamori had long since given up on Yoshinobu, and he and <br/>
Enomoto Takeaki, far from wanting to reinstate the Shogun, kept begging for <br/>
mercy and making proposals for peaceful settlements (this is mentioned in <br/>
the book "Young Japan"). Katsu Kaishu was also working hard for a peaceful, <br/>
generous settlement for the Tokugawa-- but as in Kyoto with the 'extreme' <br/>
Choshu faction that was attacked by Shinsengumi at Ikedaya-- in Edo, the <br/>
Shogitai-- the REAL "Tokugawa Partisans"-- who I would go so far as to <br/>
describe as "rabid" partisans-- attacked the forces of the new government <br/>
and thus dashed any hopes for peace.<br/>
<br/>
The Northern Alliance (Oetsu Reppan Domei) is also seen by the Jansen school <br/>
as being "pro-Tokugawa," when in fact most of its members were "outer" <br/>
(tozama) lords, with only a handful of Tokugawa vassal (fudai) domains and a <br/>
couple of Tokugawa-branch domains, probably only Aizu and Moriyama or Miharu <br/>
(not sure which one). Their intentions? As stated in their statement to the <br/>
foreign powers, "We will destroy the offenders (Satsuma/Choshu). Those who <br/>
fly before us we shall not pursue; but we will reconquer Japan, that the <br/>
Emperor may indeed reign over it." (from "Young Japan") Thus, it wasn't a <br/>
matter of Shogun vs. Emperor, it was a matter of a grudge that Choshu had <br/>
against Aizu for sponsoring the anti-Choshu expeditions and fighting against <br/>
the Choshu "activists" in Kyoto. Hence the reason why Katamori begged for <br/>
mercy but was not heard-- he was operating under the assumption that what <br/>
was going on concerned the Emperor, when in fact it was simply between him <br/>
and Choshu, and with Choshu surrounding the Emperor (as Aizu had done <br/>
before),�@there would be no answer to his pleas.<br/>
<br/>
Neither was Rinnoji no Miya, the Imperial prince who led the Northern <br/>
Alliance, a "second Emperor" like the Northern and Southern Courts <br/>
(Nanbokucho) era. Though the Northern Alliance adopted a new reign name <br/>
(Taisei instead of Meiji), Rinnoji no Miya was never referred to as <br/>
"tenno"-- "Emperor," though he did take the name of Tobu.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there was extortion and forcible appropriation on both sides. This too <br/>
deserves to be studied more closely in order for both sides to be studied <br/>
properly. The actions of the Shogitai are particularly unfortunate, in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
However, what amazes me is that even when Enomoto was in Hokkaido he still <br/>
practically begged for mercy and a peaceful settlement, saying "We pray that <br/>
this portion of the Empire (Hokkaido) may be conferred upon our former <br/>
master, Tokugawa Kamenosuke (Yoshinobu's adopted son and successor), and in <br/>
that case, we shall repay your benificence by our faithful guardianship of <br/>
the northern gate." ("Young Japan," page 241) Naturally, however, having <br/>
endured the campaigns in Echigo, Aizu, and Mutsu/Dewa, and the unfortunate <br/>
episode of the Shogitai, the new government was in no disposition to listen <br/>
to such a request, and moved to attack Hokkaido.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is, in the words of General William Tecumseh Sherman, that <br/>
"war is Hell."<br/>

Ok... I'm fairly new and am well aware that theres a<br/>
TON of info I don't know about the Shinsengumi, and<br/>
this was just another thing that I've never ran<br/>
accross while going through various webpages.   I<br/>
think I read a long time ago that Kondou was married<br/>
sometime before he left to Kyoto (as Roshigumi) and a<br/>
daughter was born shortly after he left, and<br/>
appearently he never meet his daughter even when he<br/>
returned to Edo to recruit more men.   But know that I<br/>
read this, I wonder if what I read was even correct.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I was wondering you by chance you still have<br/>
the link to that fanfic (sounds intresting).   And<br/>
also, may I ask for the members on this mailing list<br/>
to help me find another fanfic that I can't find<br/>
anymore.   The fic is a RK one, saddly I don't<br/>
remember the name of the piece or the author.   The<br/>
few chapters that I read started pretty much a few<br/>
days before the Ikedaya, it dealed mostly of what the<br/>
Shinsengumi were doing.   One chapter in particular<br/>
centered completely around Hijikata discoving a few<br/>
tradors amoung the ranks (4 men I think) and ordering<br/>
their deaths (when each man was by himself).   After<br/>
being confronted by Hijikata himself, one of the men<br/>
is willing to commit seppuku and asks for Hijikata to<br/>
be his kaishaku.   After the man split his belly open,<br/>
Hijikata picks up the short sword used by the man and<br/>
walks away, warning everyone that if they help the<br/>
man, they will suffer the same faith.   He really was<br/>
depicted as a deamon in this part of the fic ...and<br/>
thats pretty much all I remember about the fic.<br/>
