<h3>Sonno Joi</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-504405952">I know that the term Sonno Joi was the Ishin  slogan for their Revere <br/>
the Emperor/Expel the Barbarians (and line our own  pockets in the <br/>
process) agenda.<br/>
<br/>
In a book I just bought--Emperor of Japan--Meiji and His World [ <br/>
0-231-12340-X, 2002 Univ of Columbia Press] it says that Emperor Komei's <br/>
closest confidant and advisor, Prince Nakagawa was much admired by the <br/>
Ishin and that they assumed his advocacy of Joi would help them in their <br/>
takeover (they in fact hoped he'd literally  lead the battle against the <br/>
Shogunate)<br/>
<br/>
My question is this am I right in thinking that the Joi part of the <br/>
phrase Sonno Joi concerns revering the Emperor?<br/>
<br/>
Here's a bit of trivia--like our man Saitou, Nakagawa was also a man of <br/>
many aliases....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it's the other part ^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Son" -> revere<br/>
"Ou" -> king<br/>
"Jou" -> expel<br/>
"I" -> barbarians<br/>
<br/>
Something like that ^^;; <br/>
