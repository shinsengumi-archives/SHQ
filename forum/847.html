<h3>Tsukuba Mountain</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330637577">Okay, I *really* need a real translation now.  In looking for terms for secretarytocapt3 to use, I went back to two articles, one on Sagara and the one we recently had babelfished on Suzuki --- and found a connection that appears to be prior to the Itou Affair.  The problem is the babelfish translation is impossible for me to decipher WHAT is being talked about.<br/>
 <br/>
On Dr. FangLang's Pavement article on Sagara (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4081/colj102.html">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4081/colj102.html</a> ):<br/>
 <br/>
"In 1863, he worked as a follower of Mito Clan at Tsukuba-san Mountain Riot.  But he had to leave Mito Clan.  Thereafter he worked as a follower of Mr. Takamori Saigou from Satsuma Clan."<br/>
 <br/>
From the babelfished "Three Trees Saburo" article (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Cosmos/4774/page015.html">http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Cosmos/4774/page015.html</a> --- I hope):<br/>
 <br/>
"But because the will chiku is exactly close from the Tsukuba mountain, you worry, it meaning that circumstances are not attached, as looked at the will chiku, you ask to Miki.  Entering Miki and Tsuchiura, when lunch is taken with the hotel, it could happen to be present the heaven �� party, but ignoring, it enters to the will chiku quickly in the basket.  It enters to the will chiku, when it is critical through Kawamata of the uncle, in order to do poor ability, it requests the effect which comes from Edo to the feudal clan."<br/>
 <br/>
Masayoshi & Serizawa Kamo --- what can I offer in exchange for getting the Suzuki article translated into understandable English????  It's hard to know what to search for on this guy (Suzuki) by what babelfish spits out.<br/>
