Some of the prologue text to the most recent publication (1992) of Aizawa Seishisai&#39;s 1825 &quot;New Theses&quot; (in translation) is made available about five pages into the preview.  (Aizawa was a Mito scholar and firm proponent of joi.)  From the book &quot;Anti-Foreignism and Western Learning in Early Modern Japan: The New Theses of 1825&quot; (Harvest East Asian Monographs, Vol. 126), by Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi (ISBN#0674040376).  I believe this is a version of the book M recommended in regards to Mito scholarship.  (Thank you, M!)<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have the book itself, but someone graciously indulged my Sagara fetish and has given me the opportunity to read the theses, which I just started tonight.  Too cool to be finally reading something I&#39;m sure my hero read as well (even if I am an American located somewhere near the rear end of the world, stupid and incompetent as nature dictates, and have to read it in translation  :-D )<br/>
