wow, I wonder if this is the oldest Shinsengumi film...I'm sooo<br/>
curious to see how they did the sword play...probably really stylized<br/>
<br/>
Is it me or does Okita look 10 years old in this film :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915781658">Chiezo Kataoka is in the lead role as Kondo in this<br/>
movie. At first glance you might think he was Mifune;<br/>
both had pretty long and distinguished acting careers.<br/>
Kinnosuke Nakamura is Okita as that website pointed<br/>
out, this movie is one of his earliest roles. Both<br/>
Kataoka and Nakamura had a bunch of roles where they<br/>
played the leading actors in the same movie in the<br/>
1950�s.  Not too long after this movie they played in<br/>
a trilogy based on the story you know as �Sword of<br/>
Doom� with Kataoka playing the mad swordsman and<br/>
Nakamura playing the young avenging brother.<br/>
 <br/>
 This Shinsengumi movie is one that definitely<br/>
deserves to be subtitled. I can�t give you too many<br/>
details, but based on memory the story starts out with<br/>
the Shinsengumi storming the Ikedeya Inn right away<br/>
with some really fast swordplay as I remember.<br/>
Eventually they deal with the Ito Kashitaro group<br/>
defection and the movie ends near the battle of Toba<br/>
and Fushimi. There are some love interests in the<br/>
story for both the main characters and I remember that<br/>
near the end the group burns the Makoto flag as a<br/>
symbolic ceremony of their group ending.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918132803">Geez... even just your description of the film was exciting!   It sounds like a really rich story... the burning of the makoto flag --- powerful image just thinking about it (and I'm not one of those people who's really big into the sanctity of flags).  Maybe if interest in the Shinsengumi continues to grow someone will look into restoring & subtitling it.<br/>
 <br/>
I know there are various ways of trying to bring films to the attention of conservation programs here in the US, but I don't know how much foreign film they're interested in (oh, they're interested, but the process is so labor & cost intensive that American film can often take precedence.)  Any ideas on who in Japan is working on preservation of Japanese film that one might contact to suggest a film like this receiving attention?  (In fact, it's something that would be good for a group... say like ours... to petition for preservation.)<br/>

 That movie was given to me as gift from a friend some<br/>
time back so I assume it is available in Japan. The<br/>
problem of course is that it doesn't have subtitles so<br/>
I can't tell you much more than I already have. I will<br/>
watch it again this weekend when I get a chance and<br/>
see if I can dig up more. <br/>
 The eleven part Shinsengumi Keppuroku tv series spent<br/>
an episode dealing with the Ito departure and Saitou<br/>
going undercover on that one if you can hunt that one<br/>
down.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542350276">Really great to hear it's been restored.  Too many people don't <br/>
realize that films as recent as the 70's are in danger of being lost <br/>
and there's *SO* much of it without even considering anything outside <br/>
of Hollywood. (My background is in book & paper conservation, but for <br/>
a long time I've wanted to get involved in film preservation... <br/>
unfortunately I'm too far away from the labs doing it... rats!) Japan <br/>
is one country I would think of as having the money and the <br/>
resources/technology to protect their cinematic history.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll have to go back through livejournal entries in one of the <br/>
communities I'm in to hunt up the person who was looking for some <br/>
feedback on translation styles and see if they have any suggestions <br/>
about pursuing getting it fan-subbed.  (This person does either fan-<br/>
subbing or pro-subbing or both... don't remember exactly what they <br/>
wrote.)  Unless someone else here has some leads???  I know a lot of <br/>
you rely on fan-subbing for anime that hasn't already been pro-subbed <br/>
or dubbed.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really interested in seeing this film after you described it, but <br/>
I'd definitely want to be able to understand it.  (Unless all the <br/>
actors as gifted as Charlie Chaplin at getting story across without <br/>
words.)  :-D<br/>
