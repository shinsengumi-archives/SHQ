wow, I wonder if this is the oldest Shinsengumi film...I&#39;m sooo<br/>
curious to see how they did the sword play...probably really stylized<br/>
<br/>
Is it me or does Okita look 10 years old in this film :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915781658">Chiezo Kataoka is in the lead role as Kondo in this<br/>
movie. At first glance you might think he was Mifune;<br/>
both had pretty long and distinguished acting careers.<br/>
Kinnosuke Nakamura is Okita as that website pointed<br/>
out, this movie is one of his earliest roles. Both<br/>
Kataoka and Nakamura had a bunch of roles where they<br/>
played the leading actors in the same movie in the<br/>
1950�s.  Not too long after this movie they played in<br/>
a trilogy based on the story you know as �Sword of<br/>
Doom� with Kataoka playing the mad swordsman and<br/>
Nakamura playing the young avenging brother.<br/>
 <br/>
 This Shinsengumi movie is one that definitely<br/>
deserves to be subtitled. I can�t give you too many<br/>
details, but based on memory the story starts out with<br/>
the Shinsengumi storming the Ikedeya Inn right away<br/>
with some really fast swordplay as I remember.<br/>
Eventually they deal with the Ito Kashitaro group<br/>
defection and the movie ends near the battle of Toba<br/>
and Fushimi. There are some love interests in the<br/>
story for both the main characters and I remember that<br/>
near the end the group burns the Makoto flag as a<br/>
symbolic ceremony of their group ending.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918132803">Geez... even just your description of the film was exciting!   It sounds like a really rich story... the burning of the makoto flag --- powerful image just thinking about it (and I&#39;m not one of those people who&#39;s really big into the sanctity of flags).  Maybe if interest in the Shinsengumi continues to grow someone will look into restoring & subtitling it.<br/>
 <br/>
I know there are various ways of trying to bring films to the attention of conservation programs here in the US, but I don&#39;t know how much foreign film they&#39;re interested in (oh, they&#39;re interested, but the process is so labor & cost intensive that American film can often take precedence.)  Any ideas on who in Japan is working on preservation of Japanese film that one might contact to suggest a film like this receiving attention?  (In fact, it&#39;s something that would be good for a group... say like ours... to petition for preservation.)<br/>

 That movie was given to me as gift from a friend some<br/>
time back so I assume it is available in Japan. The<br/>
problem of course is that it doesn&#39;t have subtitles so<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you much more than I already have. I will<br/>
watch it again this weekend when I get a chance and<br/>
see if I can dig up more. <br/>
 The eleven part Shinsengumi Keppuroku tv series spent<br/>
an episode dealing with the Ito departure and Saitou<br/>
going undercover on that one if you can hunt that one<br/>
down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542350276">Really great to hear it&#39;s been restored.  Too many people don&#39;t <br/>
realize that films as recent as the 70&#39;s are in danger of being lost <br/>
and there&#39;s *SO* much of it without even considering anything outside <br/>
of Hollywood. (My background is in book & paper conservation, but for <br/>
a long time I&#39;ve wanted to get involved in film preservation... <br/>
unfortunately I&#39;m too far away from the labs doing it... rats!) Japan <br/>
is one country I would think of as having the money and the <br/>
resources/technology to protect their cinematic history.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to go back through livejournal entries in one of the <br/>
communities I&#39;m in to hunt up the person who was looking for some <br/>
feedback on translation styles and see if they have any suggestions <br/>
about pursuing getting it fan-subbed.  (This person does either fan-<br/>
subbing or pro-subbing or both... don&#39;t remember exactly what they <br/>
wrote.)  Unless someone else here has some leads???  I know a lot of <br/>
you rely on fan-subbing for anime that hasn&#39;t already been pro-subbed <br/>
or dubbed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really interested in seeing this film after you described it, but <br/>
I&#39;d definitely want to be able to understand it.  (Unless all the <br/>
actors as gifted as Charlie Chaplin at getting story across without <br/>
words.)  :-D<br/>
