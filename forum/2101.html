<h3>Toba-Fushimi Anniversary</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-775266418">For those of you who haven't checked you Shinsengumi calender lately, <br/>
the anniversary of Toba-Fushimi is coming up this Thursday, Jan 27. <br/>
This would be Jan. 3 by the lunar calendar that was in place at the <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
As I recall, what little info we have about the Shinsengumi's <br/>
involvement places them in Fushimi during the battle. Captain Inoue <br/>
Genzaburo (one of the original Shieikan members of the group and <br/>
supposedly close friend of both Kondo and Hijikata) was shot and <br/>
killed during the battle. I've read that he followed Hijikata's <br/>
orders without being daunted during the fighting. Also killed was <br/>
Yamazaki Susumu. Injured earlier, he could not swim to safety when <br/>
his boat sank during the retreat.<br/>
<br/>
During the battle, Hijikata tried to charge the Satsuma guns and was <br/>
forced back. He said afterwards that the "age of the sword and spear <br/>
had already passed". (He was leading this fight because Kondo had <br/>
recently been injured in an attempt on his life by the remaining <br/>
members of Ito's group.) Nagakura and Saito fought at the rear during <br/>
the retreat. Saito must have taken a small injury of some sort, since <br/>
he went for medical treatment a few days afterwards. It was also at <br/>
this time that Shimada Kai had to help Nagakura over an earthen bank <br/>
or fence he could not get over alone. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Following info on the battle from Mark Ravina's The Last Samurai-<br/>
<br/>
The fight began in the evening when Satsuma opened it's cannons up on <br/>
the Bakufu forces at Toba. Satsuma had 900 men there facing the <br/>
Tokugawa's 2,500 men. At Fushimi, the Bakufu forces had some 3,000 <br/>
troops (including Aizu and Shinsengumi) against 500 Satsuma, 725 <br/>
Choshu, and 200 Tosa. The Bakufu forces were not only larger, but <br/>
they had some of the best trained troops in Japan. (The shogun's <br/>
French-trained infantry for instance.)<br/>
<br/>
On at least two occassions, Aizu troops rushed the Satsuma and Choshu <br/>
troops and forced them to flee despite their inferior weapons. <br/>
However, there were many problems that undermined the Bakufu's <br/>
efforts: No real leadership and no particular strategy, troops always <br/>
in the wrong places at the wrong time, poor morale, and failure of <br/>
reinforcements to deploy when ordered among other things.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest blows came at the end, when it became clear the <br/>
Bakufu could lose. Tsu domain's artillery forces, during a critical <br/>
engagement on 1/6 (1/30), switched sides. Instead of shelling <br/>
approaching imperial troops, they began attacking Aizu forces. <br/>
Yoshinobu flees Osaka for Edo upon recieving the news, realizing the <br/>
battle is lost.<br/>
