<h3>The perfect noodle...</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-883694302">There was a movie I saw ages and ages ago that kept me laughing through the whole thing, but I could never remember the name of it --- "Tampopo" (aka "Dandelion"), from 1985.  In searching for the title, I came upon Roger Ebert's review of it and laughed all over again ---<br/>
 <br/>
"The hero is Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a lone rider with a quizzical smile, who rides a semi instead of a horse. Along with some friends, he stages a search for the perfect noodle restaurant but cannot find it."<br/>
 <br/>
In addition to the title, I'd forgotten the main character was named "Goro"!!  :-D   Maybe there was something to this idea of Saitou/Fujita being a soba aficionado?  Sounds like the perfect plot for an RK parody.  (I can even imagine it as a PMK parody... the search being somewhat more mystical...)<br/>
 <br/>
It's a hilarious film... check it out if you get the chance.<br/>
