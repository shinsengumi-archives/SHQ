<div id="ygrps-yiv-550567669">No, they didn't name their swords themselves.  More or less like many of the famous guns, <br/>
swords were named after the swordsmiths.  For example, "the Nagasone Kotetsu" is the <br/>
collective name given to the swords forged by Nagasone Kotetsu. (It's highly unlikely that <br/>
Kondou wielded a real Kotetsu made by Nagasone Kotetsu though.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32863639">Chuck, try rooting around on this site...they have all the <br/>
Shinsengumi swords listed (that's what I recall)<br/>
the site is spectacular because the information is organized in charts<br/>

<br/>
some swords owned by the Shinsengumi are very old and valuable<br/>
this was something I wrote a long time ago on Saitou's sword---with <br/>
some assistance<br/>

<br/>
SHQ used to have a page with all Shinsengumi swords listed...however <br/>
due to a technical issue that data was lost.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right-- according to Yasu Kizu's pamphlet on Kotetsu, Kondou's sword is <br/>
believed to be the work of Minamoto no Kiyomaro.<br/>
<br/>
This is a Kiyomaro:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontou.net/photo-kityomaro.html">http://www.nihontou.net/photo-kityomaro.html</a> Note the date-- 1848-- shows <br/>
Kiyomaro was contemporary with Kondou Isami.<br/>
<br/>
This is a Kotetsu: <br/>

<br/>
This page mentions Kondou, Kotetsu, and Kiyomaro, all in the same place: <br/>
