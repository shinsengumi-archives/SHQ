<div id="ygrps-yiv-32863639">Chuck, try rooting around on this site...they have all the <br/>
Shinsengumi swords listed (that&#39;s what I recall)<br/>
the site is spectacular because the information is organized in charts<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
some swords owned by the Shinsengumi are very old and valuable<br/>
this was something I wrote a long time ago on Saitou&#39;s sword---with <br/>
some assistance<br/>

<br/>
SHQ used to have a page with all Shinsengumi swords listed...however <br/>
due to a technical issue that data was lost.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right-- according to Yasu Kizu&#39;s pamphlet on Kotetsu, Kondou&#39;s sword is <br/>
believed to be the work of Minamoto no Kiyomaro.<br/>
<br/>
This is a Kiyomaro:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontou.net/photo-kityomaro.html">http://www.nihontou.net/photo-kityomaro.html</a> Note the date-- 1848-- shows <br/>
Kiyomaro was contemporary with Kondou Isami.<br/>
<br/>
This is a Kotetsu: <br/>

(page on the sword: <br/>

<br/>
This page mentions Kondou, Kotetsu, and Kiyomaro, all in the same place: <br/>
