<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105648324">1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you would like us to <br/>
know about you)<br/>
<br/>
I am called Angrybee.  My IM name is: captsaitou <br/>
<br/>
2) How did you discover the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
In 1910, I was on an archeological dig in Egypt and suddenly was<br/>
transported through a wormhole to Mibu, wherein I met Okita Souji and<br/>
sold him my armwarmers for underneath his arm guards.  In return, he<br/>
gave me food and tuberculosis.  After a few weeks, I died of<br/>
complications, and was later reincarnated to the form you see now. <br/>
Unfortunately, I recall nothing of this adventure, which has only been<br/>
revealed to me through the mystical sayings I find on fortune cookies.<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Okita Souji.  I find his life to be so symbolic and inspiring. <br/>
I feel very awed by his abilities, especially his ability to continue<br/>
fighting as long as he could.  I have had lung problems all my life,<br/>
stemming from a rare lung disease I had as a child, so he is quite<br/>
inspiring to me, and I wish to emulate his spirit and fervor in my<br/>
daily life.<br/>
<br/>
Next on my list would be Harada Sanosuke, or Genzaburou Inoue.  Harada<br/>
because most of the portrayals I have seen of him crack me up, and<br/>
Gen-san because I think he is -most- misunderstood and not given his due.<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
<br/>
The usual.  I haven't seen Band of Assassins, though.  And, I have<br/>
much of NHK left to watch.<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>
think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Most definitely, Shinsengumi Keppuroku best captured Okita.  I<br/>
think he is a very hard character to get right, so I applaud them.  It<br/>
is too easy to make him -too- goofy or innocent, or just completely<br/>
drown him in the tragedy of his own life.  I think SK did a good job<br/>
of balancing many aspects which are often taken to extremes.<br/>
<br/>
As for Harada, I have not seen all of NHK, but what I've seen of him<br/>
so far really amuses me.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think I've ever seen a decent portrayal, to my satisfaction,<br/>
of Gen-san.<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>
particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
<br/>
Not at the moment. <br/>
