<h3>Some info about Choshu guns, etc.</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446516823">Found a site that will be of interest to those who want to know what <br/>
sort of guns were being used in the battle of the Bakumatsu and the <br/>
Boshin War and where they came from. Apparently Choshu, through <br/>
Satsuma, dealt with a British arms dealer named Thomas Blake Glover. <br/>
<br/>
Choshu bought 4300 Minies and 3000 Gewehrs in October of 1865. Each <br/>
Minie cost 18 ryo and each Gewehr was about 5 ryo. The total bill <br/>
came to 92,000 ryo!  <br/>
<br/>
It also gives the original name of the gunboat Otchu-maru that Ryoma <br/>
commanded during the battle near Oshima-gun. It used to be the USS <br/>
Union of the (what else?) Union army. I did a search on the boat and <br/>
all I've been able to learn about her so far is that she was used to <br/>
stop Confederate blockade runners and therefore unlikely to have seen <br/>
any major action during our Civil War. <br/>
<br/>
The boat cost the Choshu 37,000 ryo. The conservatives tried to get <br/>
Katsura to settle for a 60 horsepower vessel, but he stubbornly held <br/>
out for a 120 horsepower ship. (This would have been a steam engine <br/>
of course.)<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot more here about Nagasaki at the time and Ishin leaders <br/>
and is in English. <br/>

<br/>
I did some checking but could not find any gun called a "Gewehr" from <br/>
that time period. They do appear on searches from a slightly later <br/>
date. I assume that these could have been some sort of proto-type for <br/>
the later guns. Mauser, a German gunmaker, made the ones that I could <br/>
find info on:<br/>

<br/>
As far as the Minie rifles are concerned my guess is since they were <br/>
dealing with a British arms merchant they would have most likely <br/>
bought the Enfield Rifle Musket, which  was not only the most popular <br/>
weapon of the time with British soilders but saw a great deal of <br/>
action during the American Civil War. For further info on it go to <br/>
