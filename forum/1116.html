I&#39;m so  happy you decided  to join us and post!<br/>
<br/>
You guys, Tama has _seen_ the Shinsengumi exhibit in Tokyo and has many <br/>
interesting things to share.  This is the person who was so kind to <br/>
share the  Hijikata singing clip that I watch and listen to each and <br/>
every day.<br/>
