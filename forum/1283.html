<h3>Weird novel.... Shinsengumi in Shanghai and scheming Czar Russia???</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23962388">In updating the description on some of the books in the ShinsengumiDB <br/>
I found this...<br/>
<br/>
This is probably one of the most bizzare writings/works that I have <br/>
come across dealing with the Shinsengumi. I believe it is a novel and <br/>
that the setting is in China, Shanghai to be exact. The characters <br/>
are historic men like Okita Soji, Ryoma Sakamato, etc. What makes <br/>
this bizzare is that it is a romance novel with &quot;guest&quot; stars like <br/>
Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Billy the Kid, etc.... Oh it also <br/>
incorporates elements from every country including Russia???<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has this book PLEASE let me know the gist of it! Thanks.<br/>
