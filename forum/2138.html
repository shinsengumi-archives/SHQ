Hey, all. I was just wondering if anyone knew what the different <br/>
colors of the Shinsengumi uniform meant? I know that there's the <br/>
standard blue one, but I've also seen a black one and a white one.<br/>
As far as the black ones go, I think that's just dramatic effect for movies. <br/>
Gohatto and Mibu Gishi-Den both have them in black, but that wasn't a real <br/>
uniform. People in the film industry seem to think the real blue and white <br/>
uniforms aren't eye-catching enough, which is all they're worried about. <br/>
<br/>
The standard blue and white uniform is a copy of the uniform of the 47 ronin, <br/>
whom the Shinsengumi admired. It had the exact same strips on the sleeves and <br/>
hem, but the color of their uniform was black (I think). The white strips are <br/>
supposed to allow for easy recognition of an ally during a sword fight, when <br/>
thing could get pretty hectic. "In a real sword fight you don't have time to <br/>
think," as Saito Hajime put it.  The light blue color was supposed to be the <br/>
color that shows a samurai's resolve.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the white one with the black triangles on the sleeves, that was <br/>
supposed to be the uniform of the leader of the group. (Or leaders. Shinsengumi <br/>
Keppuroku and the NHK Shinsengumi drama both have only Kondo wearing it, but <br/>
Hijikata is wearing this version in PMK as well.) So basically it was a reversal <br/>
of the colors the 47 ronin wore. <br/>

reality, from everything I've turned up so far, the 47 ronin barely wore any <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now, the real Shinsengumi uniform does not remain. <br/>
Blue haori which we look at with an image is the clothes which <br/>
researchers produced based on testimony of people of those days. <br/>
Therefore, nobody knows whether really the Shinsengumi uniform was <br/>
that form. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally that haori was made of hempen cloth. <br/>
A hempen kimono is a kimono for summer. <br/>
I think that it is from June to September that they wore that haori.<br/>
Members stopped wearing it after Ikedaya.<br/>
(In fact, it is about one year that they wore that haori, after <br/>
forming Shinsengumi.) <br/>
When Itou Kashotarou who wears haori of silk crape joined <br/>
Shinsengumi, the haori did not already exist^_^<br/>
 <br/>
Their uniform after a blue haori is stopped is not known well. <br/>
At testimony of a certain Shishi, it seemed to be the black haori <br/>
and the black hakama. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980169760">Hello,<br/>
I read on this page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio2.html">http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio2.html</a><br/>
about the possible yellow version of the uniform which is due to Aizu.<br/>
NHK shows the Shinsengumi working for Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
In the film BYAKKOTAI (which shows the Shinsengumi and Aizu)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm</a><br/>
The uniform is off-white with blue triangles. BUT, the off-white is<br/>
actually yellow!<br/>
<br/>
Before the restoration, Japanese dyes were really light colored.<br/>
So I was thinking if the Shinsengumi haori was yellow "asagi,"<br/>
wouldn't it make sense that it'd be done with cheaper, indigenous<br/>
material, and NOT be the BRIGHT Yellow we think of when we think<br/>
"yellow"?  Because it would be expensive to make alot uniforms a<br/>
bright color.<br/>
<br/>
So I think the pre-restoration idea of yellow is not the same as OUR<br/>
modern idea of yellow.<br/>
<br/>
I go with the light yellow with blue triangles theory.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279215923">This is a repost of a thread Momoiro-san replied to. Apparently there's a possible black version as well. <br/>
<br/>
As for yellow, remember that the names used to describe yellow and light blue on Serizawa's site are exactly the same, only the kanji is written differently. <br/>
<br/>
From a Japanese book I have, it's mentioned the light blue came from the light blue color of the formal kamishimo attire. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928953450">I like not knowing how the uniforms came to be or what color it really was.   It gives diffrent artist opptions on what they think looks good (although the blue haoi seems to be the most popular).<br/>
 <br/>
It's difficult to know what the true color was.   That suggestion of them changing the haoi as time went on seems to be the most logical.   When they first became the Roshigumi in Mibu, it was said that the only thing that kept them from becoming beggers were their swords (from the Serizawa page).   Serizawa got some protection money to get the first haois made.   As a new group, it's understandable that they didn't have the full financial backup to get themselves a uniform.   From that, it seems like money was a factor in getting the uniform.<br/>
 <br/>
After the Ikedaya raid they pretty much became idols overnight and where recognized throughout the city.   At this point, they were probably making enought to get the uniform that they had first wanted.<br/>
 <br/>
Mmm... well, thats what I think anyways... Momo-san's explaination of the colors being changed with the season is also worth taking into account.   People back then used to wear cretain colors with in certain seasons (as best seen with geishas).<br/>
