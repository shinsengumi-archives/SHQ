<h3>TRANSLATION of Saitou stuff on www.toshizo.com/name</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409401778">Saitou Hajime<br/>
(from www.toshizo.com/name, translated by Shimazu Masayoshi, June 15,<br/>
2004. Note: some missing information added)<br/>
<br/>
--Born in Tenpo 15 (1844), 1st day (or 2nd day) of the 1st month. Died<br/>
Taisho 4 (1915), September 28, at age 71.<br/>
--Hometown: Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo).<br/>
--Style: Itto-ryu<br/>
--Original name: Yamaguchi Hajime. Other names: Yamaguchi Jirou,<br/>
Ichinohe Denpachi, Fujita Gorou.<br/>
--Born into the house of a Shogunal retainer.<br/>
--Father: Yuusuke. Brother: Hiroaki. Sister: O-Katsu (married Soma<br/>
Yoshiaki, chief physician of the Mito Tokugawa clan).<br/>
--Family was from Akashi, because his father was an ashigaru (low-rank<br/>
foot soldier samurai) of the Akashi han.<br/>
--Hajime's father, entrusting family affairs to his younger sister,<br/>
went to serve in Edo, earning a small sum and buying stocks for the<br/>
family with it.<br/>
--In Ansei 5 (1858), Hajime had his genpuku (coming of age ceremony).<br/>
After this, he studied Itto-ryu swordsmanship in the dojo at the Aizu<br/>
clan's Edo mansion (despite the many branches of Itto-ryu, Aizu<br/>
retainers studied Mizoguchi-ha Itto ryu). This kindness of the Aizu<br/>
clan was brought about by Hajime's father's service in Edo (comment:<br/>
kindness of teaching Itto-ryu to an incredibly low-ranking samurai's<br/>
son, I suppose).<br/>
--At 19, he mistakenly killed a man and was forced to flee from Edo to<br/>
Kyoto.<br/>
--In Kyoto, he became an assistant instructor (Shihan dai) in<br/>
Yoshida's Taishi Ryu dojo (probably Yoshida Katsumi of the Shotoku<br/>
Taishi Ryu). After this, in Bunkyu 3 (1863), he met up with his old<br/>
friend Kondou (Isami), who had just arrived in Kyoto with the<br/>
Roushitai. Before long, Saitou had entered the Shinsengumi.<br/>
--A very mysterious fellow. Conducted internal spying on possible<br/>
enemy operatives (i.e. the Itou case), as well as monitoring other<br/>
intelligence and possible enemy activity.<br/>
--After the collapse of the Shinsengumi, he stayed for awhile in Aizu,<br/>
and it's thought that he was with childhood friends there (from his<br/>
days at the Itto-ryu dojo). After the "Restoration", he worked in the<br/>
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and lived the rest of his life<br/>
under the name Fujita Gorou.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff about Saitou (originalHajime-san Are-kore- literally<br/>
"Hajime-san this and that")<br/>
	--Was not a man predisposed to small talk.<br/>
	-- According to the testimony of those who knew him, Saitou was tall,<br/>
and his eyebrows served to accentuate his direct, clear, piercing gaze<br/>
(comment: the "light shone from his eyes" line). Throughout his life,<br/>
he was rather husky, but later on in life, he put on some weight. As<br/>
for the remaining portrait of him, his eldest son served as the model.<br/>
It's said that a real photo of him exists in the Shinsengumi<br/>
Houmotsukan (comment: `Shinsengumi Treasure House'. No idea where this<br/>
is, but it's probably the picture that was in the lower area of the<br/>
photo of the display with his haori in it).<br/>
	--The character of "Saitou" in the manga "Rurouni Kenshin" is<br/>
tremendously different from the real Saitou Hajime. Unfortunately,<br/>
many many people think that they are one and the same. This is unfair,<br/>
and the real Saitou deserves to be known more.<br/>
	--There is word that he was left-handed.<br/>
	--It's said that in swordsmanship, he was one of the strongest of the<br/>
Shinsengumi, on par with Okita himself.<br/>
	--He went with Itou's splinter group as a spy for Kondou and<br/>
Hijikata, although there is no evidence to this end (comment: huh?). A<br/>
surviving aide of Itou said "Saitou himself stole money in order to<br/>
support a woman." He believed this even after the Restoraton.<br/>
	--Also, after the Restoration, he was known for washing and changing<br/>
his underwear (known in the Bakumatsu as a fundoshi) every day,<br/>
washing it thoroughly and striking it with both hands to get the<br/>
wrinkles out and hanging it with a pin.<br/>
	--Whenever he sat, he would sit straight up in seiza position, always<br/>
keeping aware, so that if attacked he could react instantly.<br/>
	--In his later years, he was quiet as always. However, he would<br/>
sometimes drink sake with his brother in law Morinosuke, as well as<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi, and would indignantly lament the evils of the times<br/>
(comment: Like Hiko Seijuurou in the Rurouni Kenshin OAV: "They are<br/>
afflictedthe times, and the mind of man")<br/>
	--The name "Fujita Gorou" was granted by Lord Matsudaira Katamori. As<br/>
a result, it was very very important to Saitou.<br/>
	--Married Tokio, the eldest daughter of Aizu retainer Takagi<br/>
Kojuurou, in the 7th year of Meiji (1874). At this time, Fujita<br/>
(Saitou) was 31, and Tokio was 2 years younger than him.<br/>
	--In Meiji 7 (1874), Saitou married Tokio, the eldest daughter of<br/>
Aizu retainer Takagi Kojuurou. At this time, Fujita (Saitou) was 31,<br/>
and Tokio was 2 years younger than him. The lesser go-betweens in the<br/>
marriage deal were Yamakawa Hiroshi and Sagawa Kanbee (Aizu chief<br/>
retainer), and the main go-between was Lord Matsudaira Katamori himself.<br/>
	--ChildrenHis eldest son, Tsutomu, was born in Meiji 9 (1876).<br/>
Extant records show that Tsutomu's godfather was Yamakawa Hiroshi.<br/>
Second son was Tsuyoshi, who spent many years abroad. Tsuyoshi's wife,<br/>
Yuki, was the granddaughter of Tanaka Tosa. The third son, Tatsuo, was<br/>
adopted from the Numazawa family, who were relatives of Tokio's mother.<br/>
	--While Saitou was in Aomori (comment: specifically, in the Shimokita<br/>
Peninsula), before having married Tokio, he married a woman named<br/>
Yaso, who was 4 years older than him.<br/>
	--At the Battle of Aizu, Yamamoto Yaeko (sister of Yamamoto Kakuma,<br/>
and later, the wife of Niishima Jo (famous Japanese Christian and<br/>
founder of Doshisha University)) left with Saitou for the front. Yaeko<br/>
used a rifle, and outdid everyone in "masculine braveness" (?),<br/>
fighting side by side with the men. She tried cutting off her hair<br/>
with her wakizashi (short sword), but (comment: a little weird after<br/>
this. Not quite sure what's going on) it is said that "Takagi<br/>
Morinosuke's elder sister Tokio cut her (Yaeko's) hair".<br/>
	--Around Meiji 23 (1890), Saitou was serving as a police inspector in<br/>
Azabu (an area in modern Tokyo). There is also record remaining that<br/>
he participated in Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department sword<br/>
competitions.<br/>
	--Later in life, Fujita (Saitou) and Tokio served together at Tokyo's<br/>
Joushi Takashi (Women's High School, now Ochanomizu University<br/>
(comment: not sure about the name)). When the school day would be out,<br/>
he would be in charge of traffic control for rickshaws. He was also in<br/>
charge of finances and general affairs.<br/>
	--His favorite sword was the Settsu Juu Ikeda Kishinmaru Kunishige<br/>
(comment: Not sure about the name). Length2 shaku, 3 sun, 1 bu</div>

***can you clarify this point Yamamoto Yaeko was the wife of Niishima<br/>

 on his rare occasions speak about the battles at Aizu to Tokio and<br/>
mention Yamamoto Yaeko and I imagine Tokio saying "wait...I know her I<br/>
cut her hair that day!" M. I think you just unleashed a new wave of<br/>

So Saito was husky?! Well, that is COMPLETELY different than the picture RK paints of him, isn't it?! The part about Kondo being his "old friend" is interesting. Thanks for clearing that up M!<br/>

M, you know I completely forgot that several months ago you found pics<br/>
of Yamamoto Yaeko and uploaded them to the miburo list...I put both<br/>

she didn't die fighting the invaders...yet another clear example that<br/>
one shouldn't mess with women from Aizu<br/>

Come to think of it, I guess when the situation was critical someone<br/>
like Saitou (Yamaguchi Jiro at Aizu) just didn't have a problem with<br/>
women fighting alongside him...its just too much of a coincidence that<br/>
Tokio cut her hair that day (small world I guess)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On the subject of Saito, no they never had any daughters. And the youngest son actually wasn't their child. They adopted him. Apparently he was the son of some of Tokio's relatives. He found out when he was in college by asking an aunt. We've yet to figure out exactly what made him suspicious, but the most likely explanation is that his name doesn't appear of the Fujita house documents.<br/>
<br/>
As for Hijikata, there was a rumor that a marriage had been arranged for him at one point, but he never went through with it. Then there's another rumor that someone did have a little girl by him, but unfortunately the baby died soon after birth. So he apparently died single and childless. Such a shame.<br/>

The extent which can be bought with the nest egg which is saved with<br/>

which ~seems~ to the poster that the whole business with buying stocks<br/>

the new selection group (Shinsengumi).<br/>

you know the business with Saitou studying swordsmanship in Aizu also<br/>
means that he had at least minimal knowledge of the geography of the<br/>
domain which made him the perfect candidate to temporarily lead the<br/>
Shinsengumi while Hijikata was recovering from an injury<br/>
<br/>
and another thought...unless toshizo.com's webmaster is drawing quick<br/>
conclusions...this also means that Saitou + his dad atleast had to<br/>
spend a considerable amount of time in Aizu...how can one possibly<br/>
consider X-ryu (Mizoguchi Ittoryu gosh these names are hard to<br/>
remember) to be part of your art if you didn't spend some serious time<br/>
studying it...its not like you can study it for a month while your dad<br/>
was there on "business" and then say I'm part of x-ryu<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hajime's father doesn't buy stocks for the family  but Gokenin-Kabu<br/>
Gokenin is a rank of Shogun's direct vassal and a Gokenin could sell his <br/>
estate to merchant, farmer or samurai of lower rank. Those who get Gokenin-Kabu <br/>
become Gokenin, but this practice is considered as adoption for the public.<br/>
It's a way of social promotion in this periode just like some bourgeois in <br/>
Europeen countries who bought their title of nobility in the past.<br/>

family a higher social rank? Now that's a fascinating bit of news.  I <br/>
suppose this is how our Hajime was able to be involved with Matsudaira <br/>
of Aizu and marry well?<br/>
<br/>
I knew the Matsudaira arranging his marriage was all about knowing the <br/>
"right people".<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266593786">I *know* people hate to think of Saitou doing this, but this really makes me wonder if he divorced Yaso in order to make a more socially advantageous marriage to Tokio, perhaps even acting on advice from Matsudaira.  Someone check me on my dates, but isn't there some indication of when Yaso isn't around anymore (the census thing in Shimokita, when he was sharing the house with another family) and *very* soon after he's married to Tokio?  Another "like father, like son" in terms of raising the family's status. He seems to have been a man very conscious of such things (thinking of how strict he was in his behavior), as well as very loyal to Matsudaira.<br/>

of this page from Japanese <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.3-hajime.com/hitobito.html">http://www.3-hajime.com/hitobito.html</a><br/>
<br/>
in a nutshell...it is very likely that his first wife Yaso was real, <br/>
she and Saitou may have married around 1871 but may have died before <br/>
1874...(dates/facts are never exact when it comes to anything <br/>
concerning Saitou)<br/>
As Phil mentioned, they shared a home with another family too<br/>
<br/>
Yaso may have<br/>
1)died (I think Miss B came up with a highly likely theory of death <br/>
during childbirth...which was very common back then)<br/>
2)got a divorce<br/>
<br/>
but I also agree with Phil's theory that may have wanted upward <br/>
social mobility by using his marriage with Tokio...now here's the <br/>
catch...on 3-hajime it mentions the amount of koku (increment in <br/>
measuring rice) was given to the Takagi family...it didn't seem like <br/>
a whole lot...but he may have been concerned with the connections <br/>
she had because even their sons married women descended from Aizu <br/>
retainers<br/>
