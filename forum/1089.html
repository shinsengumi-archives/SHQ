<h3>TRANSLATION of Saitou stuff on www.toshizo.com/name</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409401778">Saitou Hajime<br/>
(from www.toshizo.com/name, translated by Shimazu Masayoshi, June 15,<br/>
2004. Note: some missing information added)<br/>
<br/>
--Born in Tenpo 15 (1844), 1st day (or 2nd day) of the 1st month. Died<br/>
Taisho 4 (1915), September 28, at age 71.<br/>
--Hometown: Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo).<br/>
--Style: Itto-ryu<br/>
--Original name: Yamaguchi Hajime. Other names: Yamaguchi Jirou,<br/>
Ichinohe Denpachi, Fujita Gorou.<br/>
--Born into the house of a Shogunal retainer.<br/>
--Father: Yuusuke. Brother: Hiroaki. Sister: O-Katsu (married Soma<br/>
Yoshiaki, chief physician of the Mito Tokugawa clan).<br/>
--Family was from Akashi, because his father was an ashigaru (low-rank<br/>
foot soldier samurai) of the Akashi han.<br/>
--Hajime&#39;s father, entrusting family affairs to his younger sister,<br/>
went to serve in Edo, earning a small sum and buying stocks for the<br/>
family with it.<br/>
--In Ansei 5 (1858), Hajime had his genpuku (coming of age ceremony).<br/>
After this, he studied Itto-ryu swordsmanship in the dojo at the Aizu<br/>
clan&#39;s Edo mansion (despite the many branches of Itto-ryu, Aizu<br/>
retainers studied Mizoguchi-ha Itto ryu). This kindness of the Aizu<br/>
clan was brought about by Hajime&#39;s father&#39;s service in Edo (comment:<br/>
kindness of teaching Itto-ryu to an incredibly low-ranking samurai&#39;s<br/>
son, I suppose).<br/>
--At 19, he mistakenly killed a man and was forced to flee from Edo to<br/>
Kyoto.<br/>
--In Kyoto, he became an assistant instructor (Shihan dai) in<br/>
Yoshida&#39;s Taishi Ryu dojo (probably Yoshida Katsumi of the Shotoku<br/>
Taishi Ryu). After this, in Bunkyu 3 (1863), he met up with his old<br/>
friend Kondou (Isami), who had just arrived in Kyoto with the<br/>
Roushitai. Before long, Saitou had entered the Shinsengumi.<br/>
--A very mysterious fellow. Conducted internal spying on possible<br/>
enemy operatives (i.e. the Itou case), as well as monitoring other<br/>
intelligence and possible enemy activity.<br/>
--After the collapse of the Shinsengumi, he stayed for awhile in Aizu,<br/>
and it&#39;s thought that he was with childhood friends there (from his<br/>
days at the Itto-ryu dojo). After the &quot;Restoration&quot;, he worked in the<br/>
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and lived the rest of his life<br/>
under the name Fujita Gorou.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff about Saitou (originalHajime-san Are-kore- literally<br/>
&quot;Hajime-san this and that&quot;)<br/>
	--Was not a man predisposed to small talk.<br/>
	-- According to the testimony of those who knew him, Saitou was tall,<br/>
and his eyebrows served to accentuate his direct, clear, piercing gaze<br/>
(comment: the &quot;light shone from his eyes&quot; line). Throughout his life,<br/>
he was rather husky, but later on in life, he put on some weight. As<br/>
for the remaining portrait of him, his eldest son served as the model.<br/>
It&#39;s said that a real photo of him exists in the Shinsengumi<br/>
Houmotsukan (comment: `Shinsengumi Treasure House&#39;. No idea where this<br/>
is, but it&#39;s probably the picture that was in the lower area of the<br/>
photo of the display with his haori in it).<br/>
	--The character of &quot;Saitou&quot; in the manga &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is<br/>
tremendously different from the real Saitou Hajime. Unfortunately,<br/>
many many people think that they are one and the same. This is unfair,<br/>
and the real Saitou deserves to be known more.<br/>
	--There is word that he was left-handed.<br/>
	--It&#39;s said that in swordsmanship, he was one of the strongest of the<br/>
Shinsengumi, on par with Okita himself.<br/>
	--He went with Itou&#39;s splinter group as a spy for Kondou and<br/>
Hijikata, although there is no evidence to this end (comment: huh?). A<br/>
surviving aide of Itou said &quot;Saitou himself stole money in order to<br/>
support a woman.&quot; He believed this even after the Restoraton.<br/>
	--Also, after the Restoration, he was known for washing and changing<br/>
his underwear (known in the Bakumatsu as a fundoshi) every day,<br/>
washing it thoroughly and striking it with both hands to get the<br/>
wrinkles out and hanging it with a pin.<br/>
	--Whenever he sat, he would sit straight up in seiza position, always<br/>
keeping aware, so that if attacked he could react instantly.<br/>
	--In his later years, he was quiet as always. However, he would<br/>
sometimes drink sake with his brother in law Morinosuke, as well as<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi, and would indignantly lament the evils of the times<br/>
(comment: Like Hiko Seijuurou in the Rurouni Kenshin OAV: &quot;They are<br/>
afflictedthe times, and the mind of man&quot;)<br/>
	--The name &quot;Fujita Gorou&quot; was granted by Lord Matsudaira Katamori. As<br/>
a result, it was very very important to Saitou.<br/>
	--Married Tokio, the eldest daughter of Aizu retainer Takagi<br/>
Kojuurou, in the 7th year of Meiji (1874). At this time, Fujita<br/>
(Saitou) was 31, and Tokio was 2 years younger than him.<br/>
	--In Meiji 7 (1874), Saitou married Tokio, the eldest daughter of<br/>
Aizu retainer Takagi Kojuurou. At this time, Fujita (Saitou) was 31,<br/>
and Tokio was 2 years younger than him. The lesser go-betweens in the<br/>
marriage deal were Yamakawa Hiroshi and Sagawa Kanbee (Aizu chief<br/>
retainer), and the main go-between was Lord Matsudaira Katamori himself.<br/>
	--ChildrenHis eldest son, Tsutomu, was born in Meiji 9 (1876).<br/>
Extant records show that Tsutomu&#39;s godfather was Yamakawa Hiroshi.<br/>
Second son was Tsuyoshi, who spent many years abroad. Tsuyoshi&#39;s wife,<br/>
Yuki, was the granddaughter of Tanaka Tosa. The third son, Tatsuo, was<br/>
adopted from the Numazawa family, who were relatives of Tokio&#39;s mother.<br/>
	--While Saitou was in Aomori (comment: specifically, in the Shimokita<br/>
Peninsula), before having married Tokio, he married a woman named<br/>
Yaso, who was 4 years older than him.<br/>
	--At the Battle of Aizu, Yamamoto Yaeko (sister of Yamamoto Kakuma,<br/>
and later, the wife of Niishima Jo (famous Japanese Christian and<br/>
founder of Doshisha University)) left with Saitou for the front. Yaeko<br/>
used a rifle, and outdid everyone in &quot;masculine braveness&quot; (?),<br/>
fighting side by side with the men. She tried cutting off her hair<br/>
with her wakizashi (short sword), but (comment: a little weird after<br/>
this. Not quite sure what&#39;s going on) it is said that &quot;Takagi<br/>
Morinosuke&#39;s elder sister Tokio cut her (Yaeko&#39;s) hair&quot;.<br/>
	--Around Meiji 23 (1890), Saitou was serving as a police inspector in<br/>
Azabu (an area in modern Tokyo). There is also record remaining that<br/>
he participated in Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department sword<br/>
competitions.<br/>
	--Later in life, Fujita (Saitou) and Tokio served together at Tokyo&#39;s<br/>
Joushi Takashi (Women&#39;s High School, now Ochanomizu University<br/>
(comment: not sure about the name)). When the school day would be out,<br/>
he would be in charge of traffic control for rickshaws. He was also in<br/>
charge of finances and general affairs.<br/>
	--His favorite sword was the Settsu Juu Ikeda Kishinmaru Kunishige<br/>
(comment: Not sure about the name). Length2 shaku, 3 sun, 1 bu</div>

like to know the differences too (yes but I&#39;ll always be an RK Saitou fan)<br/>

3-hajime/1to5.net) that he &quot;acting like a husband&quot; to a woman or some<br/>
weird babelfish phrase...perhaps this is what Toshizo.com is referring<br/>

***yeah, but some people sit seiza with their big toes<br/>
crossed...sitting seiza allows you to kind of hop up fast to defend<br/>
yourself versus getting up from sitting in a cross-legged<br/>

***can you clarify this point Yamamoto Yaeko was the wife of Niishima<br/>
Jo?  So she survived the battles ^_^...interesting...Fujita Goro could<br/>
 on his rare occasions speak about the battles at Aizu to Tokio and<br/>
mention Yamamoto Yaeko and I imagine Tokio saying &quot;wait...I know her I<br/>
cut her hair that day!&quot; M. I think you just unleashed a new wave of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253137661">AH! So the translator DID chose the wrong word when it was translating the part about his first wife!!! I suspected it might have, but I had not way of knowing for sure. So Saito was husky?! Well, that is COMPLETELY different than the picture RK paints of him, isn&#39;t it?! The part about Kondo being his &quot;old friend&quot; is interesting.

she didn&#39;t die fighting the invaders...yet another clear example that<br/>
one shouldn&#39;t mess with women from Aizu<br/>

Come to think of it, I guess when the situation was critical someone<br/>
like Saitou (Yamaguchi Jiro at Aizu) just didn&#39;t have a problem with<br/>
women fighting alongside him...its just too much of a coincidence that<br/>
Tokio cut her hair that day (small world I guess)<br/>

Sec, their pictures are at the very bottom-- if you click on the<br/>
thumbnail-size pictures, full-sized ones will appear. But that&#39;s only<br/>
a few of the women who fought there, I think. At any rate, I&#39;m going<br/>

Apparently he was the son of some of Tokio&#39;s relatives. He found out when he was in college by asking an aunt. We&#39;ve yet to figure out exactly what made him suspicious, but the most likely explanation is that his name doesn&#39;t appear of the Fujita house documents.<br/>
<br/>
As for Hijikata, there was a rumor that a marriage had been arranged for him at one point, but he never went through with it. Then there&#39;s another rumor that someone did have a little girl by him, but unfortunately the baby died soon after birth. So he apparently died single and childless. Such a shame.<br/>

&quot;That &quot;Yamaguchi &#31056; help transferred family estate to the younger<br/>
sister, appeared in Edo and saved the nest egg with intermediate<br/>
public service, acquired family stocks&quot; there is an oral book of the<br/>
Fujita Tsutomu person, so is, but it probably is not to be unnatural?<br/>
The extent which can be bought with the nest egg which is saved with<br/>
intermediate public service, are family stocks probably to have<br/>
declined heavily? Although there is no either family estate &#12387; &#12390;<br/>
great circumstance, those which can be transferred? It is doubtful<br/>
very. So as for being the family fact. If with it does, with the<br/>
family we have related to espionage activities originally with the<br/>
parent and child, and the espionage activities where one enlists in<br/>
new &#25776; group it turns out and with being on? &quot;Chain &#24119; child&quot; arrival<br/>
it is with we wait for the opinion whose everyone is harsh densely.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
which ~seems~ to the poster that the whole business with buying stocks<br/>
and stuff add validity to the theory that Saitou&#39;s father really was<br/>
involved with &quot;espionage&quot;... the poster seems to make a huge leap in<br/>
trying to say &quot;like father like son&quot; in that Saitou was a spy within<br/>
the new selection group (Shinsengumi).<br/>
<br/>
you know the business with Saitou studying swordsmanship in Aizu also<br/>
means that he had at least minimal knowledge of the geography of the<br/>
domain which made him the perfect candidate to temporarily lead the<br/>
Shinsengumi while Hijikata was recovering from an injury<br/>
<br/>
and another thought...unless toshizo.com&#39;s webmaster is drawing quick<br/>
conclusions...this also means that Saitou + his dad atleast had to<br/>
spend a considerable amount of time in Aizu...how can one possibly<br/>
consider X-ryu (Mizoguchi Ittoryu gosh these names are hard to<br/>
remember) to be part of your art if you didn&#39;t spend some serious time<br/>
studying it...its not like you can study it for a month while your dad<br/>
was there on &quot;business&quot; and then say I&#39;m part of x-ryu<br/>

Gokenin is a rank of Shogun&#39;s direct vassal and a Gokenin could sell his <br/>

become Gokenin, but this practice is considered as adoption for the public.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266593786">I *know* people hate to think of Saitou doing this, but this really makes me wonder if he divorced Yaso in order to make a more socially advantageous marriage to Tokio, perhaps even acting on advice from Matsudaira.  Someone check me on my dates, but isn&#39;t there some indication of when Yaso isn&#39;t around anymore (the census thing in Shimokita, when he was sharing the house with another family) and *very* soon after he&#39;s married to Tokio?  Another &quot;like father, like son&quot; in terms of raising the family&#39;s status. He seems to have been a man very conscious of such things (thinking of how strict he was in his behavior), as well as very loyal to Matsudaira.<br/>

<br/>
in a nutshell...it is very likely that his first wife Yaso was real, <br/>
she and Saitou may have married around 1871 but may have died before <br/>
1874...(dates/facts are never exact when it comes to anything <br/>
concerning Saitou)<br/>
As Phil mentioned, they shared a home with another family too<br/>
<br/>
Yaso may have<br/>
1)died (I think Miss B came up with a highly likely theory of death <br/>
during childbirth...which was very common back then)<br/>
2)got a divorce<br/>
<br/>
but I also agree with Phil&#39;s theory that may have wanted upward <br/>
social mobility by using his marriage with Tokio...now here&#39;s the <br/>
catch...on 3-hajime it mentions the amount of koku (increment in <br/>
measuring rice) was given to the Takagi family...it didn&#39;t seem like <br/>
a whole lot...but he may have been concerned with the connections <br/>
she had because even their sons married women descended from Aizu <br/>
retainers<br/>
