<h3>Need Help with Military Uniform Terminology</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525468837">Sort of off-topic, but somone here might know the answer or be able to point me in a direction to find the answer.<br/>
 <br/>
The Sekihoutai uniform in RK...  What is the sleeveless jacket-type garment called... the part of the uniform that was red & lined with grey?  And the headband or bandana (is one English term more appropriate?) that they & others wore, does it have a more proper term?  If it doesn't have an official label as part of a uniform, what would be the Japanese word for it?<br/>
 <br/>
Many thanks in advance!<br/>
