<h3>upcoming Shinsengumi Filmography</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848063640">Michael over on the Ninja Dojo movie forum has posted a bit of a teaser <br/>
which I&#39;m posting (with permission). (I&#39;ve also posted this over on the <br/>
message board)<br/>
<br/>
# # # #<br/>
These will be included in the SHINSENGUMI filmography ,but SHISHI NO <br/>
JIDAI (1980)stars BUNTA SUGAWARA as an ex Tokugawa Samurai who wages a <br/>
one man war against MEIJI all the way up to 1888 (its a true story )at <br/>
one point he joins HIJIKATA in FORT EZO ,<br/>
<br/>
MOYOKEN (BURNING SWORD )TBS 1990 follows HIJIKATA all the way to his <br/>
death at FT EZO (KOJI YASHUKO stars),<br/>
<br/>
the new (not any more )taiga drama will end with the death of NAGAKURA <br/>
SHINPACHI in 1915 (so says NHK but they change things ,they made major <br/>
changes to MUSASHI last year not for the better either),<br/>
<br/>
BYYAKO TAI (1984)features a KONDO less SHINSENGUMI as they arive in AIZU <br/>
than goes on to the WHITE TIGERS ,<br/>
<br/>
And (best for last)GORYOKAKU(1989) (5 POINT STAR AKA FT, EZO )chronicles <br/>
HIJIKATA&#39;S many attempts to revive the SHINSENGUMI after KONDO&#39;S death <br/>
finaly him and SOJI (ok SOJI died a month after KONDO but not in this <br/>
film )hook up with ENOMOTO TAKEAKI at GORYOKAKU (FT EZO)for the final <br/>
stand of the Samurai against the modern SATSUMA forces (beats the hell <br/>
out of the CRUISE film)this is ok its a tv movie if it was not for that <br/>
id say its one of the best SAMURAI films ever made (not that i have seen <br/>
everyone by any mean&#39;s but its great trust me<br/>
<br/>
The same people also made another fantastic film KEI HEITAI about <br/>
TAKASUGI SHINSAKU and the CHOSHU EXTRAORDINARY CORP&#39;S )<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure Miss B will agree that it&#39;s rather difficult to consider any <br/>
film about Takasugi &quot;fantastic&quot; but then we have issues...<br/>

Sour Grapes had a movie made about him?! That&#39;s scary...<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we both have issues. But some issues are deeper than others, ne? <br/>
(Hijikata in a woman&#39;s kimono for example. LOL!)<br/>
