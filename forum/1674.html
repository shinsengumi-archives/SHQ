 </span></blockquote>"GetsumeiSeiki Sayonara Shinsengumi"<br/>
<br/>
I know. <br/>
It is the work which I like to No. 1 among the latest Shinsengumi <br/>
Mangas. <br/>
In Japan, the 4th volume is already put on the market. <br/>
The hero of this Manga is Hijikata Toshizou. <br/>
When this Manga started, some Shinsengumi fans were surprised. <br/>
That is because this work has Hijikata of a face cuter than Okita <br/>
unlike other Shinsengumi Mangas. <br/>
<br/>
I think that this work is very high-level. <br/>
However, I dislike the page of the beginning of this Manga. <br/>
It is because Shinsengumi and the present girl idol group are <br/>
related forcibly and explained. <br/>
And I love the other pages very much. <br/>
The scene of a sword fight etc. is very powerful. <br/>

It is the site of the magazine which serializes this Manga.<br/>
Please click the left-hand side of the bottom of this page. <br/>
You can read the episode 1 of this Manga. <br/>
(It is Japanese though regrettable.) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have the first four volumes of it. Actually, the<br/>
name of the manga is "Getsumei Seiki" ("tsuki akiraka<br/>
ni hoshi mare naki"), and the subtitle is "sayonara<br/>
Shinsengumi". Currently being published in Young<br/>
Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
The main character is Hijikata Toshizo (as usual).<br/>
<br/>
The story itself uses plenty of well-known fictional<br/>
clichees taken from various sources, like the fight<br/>
between Hijikata and Sakamoto Ryoma in the Genbukan<br/>
(seen also in Bakumatsu Fuunroku Makoto), the death of<br/>
Niimi Nishiki assisted by Harada Sanosuke (100% Moeyo<br/>
Ken) and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there are two interesting things that I<br/>
haven't seen so often:<br/>
1) Okita Souji is not a bishonen. He isn't ugly<br/>
either, but he isn't so handsome. And his eyes are<br/>
very slant, like the description left of him.<br/>
2) Saito Hajime *is* an Aizu spy working for<br/>
Matsudaira Katamori and leading a number of ninjas.<br/>
And he has a scar on his face.<br/>
<br/>
The art is quite good. The story, though not<br/>
breathtaking, is reasonably interesting. I am buying<br/>
only the tankobons, so I don't know the latest<br/>
developments of the story, but the last part I have is<br/>
the night prior to the murder of Serizawa Kamo (no,<br/>
not me :P)<br/>

Is this Manga which Koudansya published? <br/>
In fact, I am not reading this Manga.<br/>
Is this interesting? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that "Getsumeiseiki" has set up Kondou's character very <br/>
well. <br/>
Other Shinsengumi works value Hijikata and Okita and recognize <br/>
Kondou's existence small in many cases. <br/>
Especially Manga has many the tendencies. <br/>
If Kondou's charisma character cannot be expressed, it becomes <br/>
impossible to explain Hijikata's action.<br/>
I think that this will be an important setup if Hijikata is made <br/>
into the main character. <br/>
And I think that almost all Shinsengumi Manga has gone wrong in this <br/>
point. <br/>
<br/>
There is assassination of Serizawa in the 5th volume. <br/>
I have not seen Serizawa sadder than this Manga. <br/>
 <br/>
The episode of Ikedaya started with the magazine (Young Sunday). <br/>
Masuya was arrested by Shinsengumi this week. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, although it got cold in Tokyo suddenly, how is Aizu? <br/>
It is better to take care about condition, since it will get cold <br/>
still from now on. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shinsengumi in which Toba-Fushimi war was lost has returned to Edo <br/>
by ship on January 15, 1868. <br/>
(This date is the thing of an old Japanese calender.) <br/>
They stayed at a hotel called Kamaya on the first day. <br/>
Okita and Kondou were hospitalized in the hospital of Tokugawa. <br/>
(Okita has tuberculosis. Kondou was shot by the member of the Itou <br/>
group and his shoulder was injured.)<br/>
And they stayed with a samurai called Akizuki Ukyounosuke. <br/>
From February 15 to the 25th, they guarded Tokugawa Yoshinobu who <br/>
has behaved himself (kinsin). <br/>
<br/>
The Tokugawa government ordered them to protect Koufu castle. <br/>
This was an artifice for driving out inconvenient Shinsengumi from <br/>
Edo to reconciliation of new government army and Tokugawa. <br/>
(Or there is an opinion that there was a secret contract between <br/>
Shinsengumi and Tokugawa government official.) <br/>
<br/>
They organized the army for going to Koufu. <br/>
This is Kouyouchinbutai. <br/>
Kondou changed the name into Okubo Yamato. <br/>
Hijikata changed to Naitou Hayato. <br/>
They left Edo on March 1. <br/>
They marched through the Koushu Highway (Kousyukaidou) toward Koufu.<br/>
On the way to Kofu, there was Tama area which is their hometown.<br/>
People of their hometown welcomed their army.<br/>
The party was held in many villages along which they passed. <br/>
Their pace became late and the schedule was overdue. <br/>
Furthermore, the mountain path which goes to Koufu from Busyu was <br/>
heavy snow. <br/>
<br/>
To the contrary, the new government army was very quick. <br/>
Before Kouyouchinbutai arrived there, the new government army went <br/>
into the Koufu castle.<br/>
The new government army had more soldiers and arms than they.<br/>
Hijikata returned for demanding reinforcements to Edo. <br/>
However, the battle started on March 6 before Hijikata returns. <br/>
The result was the crushing defeat of Kouyouchinbutai. <br/>
They escaped to Edo. <br/>
When they returned to Edo, Nagakura and Harada resisted Kondou and <br/>
went away. <br/>
Furthermore, many soldiers escaped. <br/>
<br/>
Kondou and Hijikata made their army stay at a place called <br/>
Goheishinden (March 13). <br/>
Goheishinden is present Adachi-ku, Tokyo.<br/>
They hid true character and stayed at Kaneko's residence which is <br/>
the influential person of this place. <br/>
Kondo read books in this place. <br/>
Hijikata did fishing on the river. <br/>
<br/>
Episode which Miss.B may like ^^;;;<br/>
While Hijikata is doing fishing on the river, all the girls of the <br/>
village have gathered. <br/>
They stood on the bank and saw Hijikata. <br/>
They did not know that the man was Hijikata of Shinsengumi. <br/>
Girls gathered for seeing that the very handsome samurai is doing <br/>
fishing. <br/>
"A nice man" They gossiped. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They moved the army to Nagareyama on April 2. <br/>
However, their transfer was known by the new government army which <br/>
was staying in Kasukabe. <br/>
They were surrounded by the new government army on April 3. <br/>
Kondou reported to the new government army as Tokugawa's samurai's <br/>
Okubo Yamato.<br/>
(However, his true character has become clear immediately.)<br/>
They were disarmed by the new government army and they escaped to <br/>
Aizu on April 4. <br/>
Hijikata infiltrated into Edo, in order to save Kondou. <br/>
Edo was governed by the new government army and was in the very <br/>
dangerous state for him. <br/>
Hijikata visited Katsu Kaishuu and requested rescue of Kondou. <br/>
Hijikata made the petition write to Katsu. <br/>
However, Hijikata's efforts were useless. <br/>
Kondou was executed in Itabashi on April 25. <br/>
<br/>
Hijikata joined Tokugawa's army on April 10. <br/>
They gathered in a place called Kokufudai and composed the army <br/>
which made Ootori Keisuke the top on April 12. <br/>
They were divided into three groups and aimed at Aizu. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for the ability not performing detailed explanation. <br/>
It is difficult for me to explain in English. <br/>
 <br/>
In fact, I do not understand this question. (Maria-san gomennasai)<br/>
Seeing the answer of M-san, I understood somehow.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup, I only knew the existence of this manga (Getsumei<br/>
Seiki) after coming to Japan ^^<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

money!) to do so T_T<br/>

I have seen several Shinsengumi mangas, but none got<br/>
really my attention.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not that much. It's interesting how the author<br/>
portrayed Serizawa-Hijikata interaction, but the art<br/>
is below average and the story isn't that appealing,<br/>
not to mention that they don't use the famous<br/>
Shinsengumi uniform ^^;;;<br/>
<br/>
It really seems that it was ended because of<br/>
"uchikiri".<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Serizawa is a good character in this manga. Though,<br/>
the BEST Serizawa so far is still that Serizawa from<br/>
"Shinsetsu Shinsengumi", IMHO ^^;;; Mechakucha kakkoii<br/>

<br/>

that it was the beginning of the Ikedaya incident.<br/>
These days I was too busy checking Pluto, so... ^^;;;<br/>
btw, Pluto is a HIGHLY recommended manga, though it<br/>
has NOTHING to do with the Shinsengumi ^^;;; It's<br/>
about Astro Boy ^^;; Urasawa Naoki rules *_*<br/>

a pain. But at night, the Tsurugajo Castle is very<br/>
nice ^^<br/>

Before half a year, many bookstores had a Shinsengumi corner. <br/>
(It is the influence of Taiga drama.) <br/>
Although the time was easy to look for Shinsengumi-Mangas, it has <br/>
finished. <br/>
The bookstore is preparing the following Taiga drama (Minamoto no <br/>
Yoshitsune) books. <br/>
Kanashii....<br/>
<br/>
I think that Shinsengumi-Manga is a genre very difficult for <br/>
creators. <br/>
Many Manga readers are not interested in the difficult situation of <br/>
Bakumatsu. <br/>
Or there is no feature in the work and readers may get bored. <br/>
Most Shinsengumi-Mangas stops the series for reasons of non-<br/>
popularity. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
"PAPUWA" and "Gintama" are jokes^^;;;<br/>
Demo sitteiru kara kowai....<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, you know to Shinsengumi-material of Yamato. <br/>
Uchusenkan-Yamato(Space Battleship Yamato / Star Blazers)<br/>
Why does Kamo-san know it? I was panicked. <br/>
It is famous to Japanese Shinsengumi fans.<br/>
However, I did not think at all that the foreign Shinsengumi fan <br/>
knew it. <br/>
In order to notice it, you need to know the Japanese name of the <br/>
captains of Yamato. <br/>
Furthermore, you need to be a Shinsengumi fan. <br/>
I think that this is miraculous probability. <br/>
<br/>
Omisoreitashimashita....^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although there is almost no Shinsengumi Anime, a parody is seen <br/>
occasionally^^;;;<br/>
Incidentally, does Kamo-san know this Anime? <br/>

<br/>
"uchikiri"...yahari sore ka.<br/>
There are many works stopped by the halfway story. <br/>
There is almost no Shinsengumi-Manga which continued to Hakodate. <br/>
Many Mangas were announced by the influence of a Taiga drama this <br/>
year.<br/>
However, the most is a short story. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
>That's true enough. Kondou tends to play rather a<br/>
>secondary role in most manga.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this is the influence of "Moeyo Ken". <br/>
The novels of Shiba Ryotarou give gifted character to the main <br/>
character, and there is a tendency to set up people around it <br/>
foolish. <br/>
Kondo Isami and Ootori Keisuke received this damage by "Moeyo Ken". <br/>
The present Shinsengumi works have followed a setup of "Moeyo Ken" <br/>
mostly. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
>o.o I haven't seen the 5th volume yet... I have to<br/>
>search for this...<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, I made misunderstanding to you. <br/>
Sale of vol.5 is on December 3. <br/>
Since I am reading YS, I know the contents of vol.5. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Serizawa of that Manga is "Kakkoyosugi". <br/>
Owing to it, Hijikata is not conspicuous ^^;;; <br/>

<br/>
Although I read "MASTER KEATON" and "Monster", "Pluto" is not <br/>
reading. <br/>
Since my younger sister likes the works of Urasawa, I borrow it from <br/>
her. <br/>
