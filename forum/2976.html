<h3>Assassin, Shinsengumi and Professor:  The Story of Takagi Teisaku</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97558778">shinsengumihq.com is still undergoing format conversion by the <br/>
professionals at http://www.Ai-dax.com<br/>
<br/>
We have many updates however we cannot add them to the site until the <br/>
conversion is complete.  We feel that the following bio will be of <br/>
great interest in showing an unknown dimension of Shinsengumi <br/>
demographics and "what happened" to the survivors.<br/>
<br/>
The article was written mostly by HIrotada Tokugawa and with the <br/>
assistance of secretarytocapt3<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may be familiar with Saitou Hajime's wife, Takagi Tokio. <br/>
Tokio was the daughter of a senior retainer in the service of Lord <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori of Aizu, who was Shinsengumi's Shogunate-<br/>
appointed patron and supervisor. <br/>
<br/>
The following biography is of another Takagi who entered the <br/>
Shinsengumi.  At this time we cannot prove a family relationship <br/>
between this Takagi and Takagi Tokio.  Due to the complex family <br/>
relations of these samurai bloodlines, there is no way to determine <br/>
if there is a connection to the Takagi family of Aizu which was <br/>
posted in Edo (Tokio's family) and this Takagi.<br/>
<br/>
Takagi Teisaku was a retainer of Matsudaira Katamori's brother, <br/>
Matsudaira Sadaaki. While Matsudaira Katamori was the Kyoto <br/>
Shugoshoku, Matsudaira Sadaaki was the Kyoto Shoshidai.  <br/>
<br/>
Sadaaki, as lord of the Kuwana domain, had many capable retainers in <br/>
Kyoto, just as his brother did. One of them was Takagi Teisaku. Born <br/>
in Kuwana in 1848, he came from good background-- he was a cousin <br/>
both to senior councilor Sakai Magohachiro, as well as assistant <br/>
senior councilor Hattori Hanzo (descendant of the famous ninja <br/>
leader). <br/>
<br/>
In 1868, following the battle of Toba-Fushimi, Sadaaki ordered <br/>
Teisaku, then 21 years old, to accompany fellow Kuwana retainer <br/>
Yamawaki Hayatarou to assassinate Yoshimura Gonzaemon, the senior <br/>
councilor who had taken residence in Kuwana's detached territory in <br/>
Echigo Province and had pledged loyalty to the Satsuma-Choshu army <br/>
which now called itself the Imperial Army and labeled their <br/>
opposition as enemies of the throne. <br/>
<br/>
The two men succeeded in their deadly goal, and then joined the <br/>
former Shogunate's Shouhoutai, heading northward to Aizu-Wakamatsu, <br/>
where they joined the remainder of the Kuwana force, which had <br/>
gathered there. Together with the Kuwana force, they fought their <br/>
northward, surrendering in Shomai. However, faced with reprisal at <br/>
the hands of the Yoshimura family were they to return to Kuwana, they <br/>
headed northward, where they joined Sadaaki in Hakodate. <br/>
<br/>
The two of them joined Shinsengumi there, and served under Hijikata <br/>
Toshizo. Therefore, Takagi Teisaku's story demonstrates how the <br/>
term "Shinsengumi" although specific to Kyoto, (note that the <br/>
Shinsengumi changed their name later) may encompass the KYoto period <br/>
and even up until 1869 Hakodate.<br/>
<br/>
Surviving the defeat, Teisaku was taken to Tokyo, where he was <br/>
imprisoned until 1872, however, in order to avoid responsibility for <br/>
the murder of Yoshimura, he again fled, this time to America. <br/>
Studying business in New York under William C. Whitney [1], he <br/>
returned in 1875. <br/>
<br/>
In a rather interesting turn of events, this man, a former assassin <br/>
and Shinsengumi officer, became a professor of business and economics <br/>
at Hitotsubashi University [2], which he helped to found. He was also <br/>
a colleague of Tsuda Sen [3], who was associated with former Aizu <br/>
retainers such as Yamakawa Kenjiro [4] and Takamine Hideo [5].<br/>
<br/>
Supplementary Info:<br/>
[1] William Cogswell Whitney (1825-1882) ideas were transplanted to <br/>
Japan via Takagi.  The following books illustrate Whitney's influence:<br/>

bookkeeping in Japan / Kojiro Nishikawa1959 English Book 17 p. (on <br/>

[2] Hitotsubashi University http://www.hit-<br/>
u.ac.jp/EnglishVersion/english/<br/>
<br/>
Hitotsubashi is also the name of the branch of the Tokugawa house <br/>
which Yoshinobu headed, and in order to differentiate him from other <br/>
branches of the Tokugawa house, he was often called "Hitotsubashi <br/>
Yoshinobu" or "Hitotsubashi Keiki".<br/>
<br/>
Hitotsubashi was an area in Tokyo which became a hub for education.  <br/>
Even Tokyo Women's Normal School was located in Hitotsubashi in the <br/>
1880s.  Many Meiji educators belonged to clubs and organizations, one <br/>
of which was called the "Hitotsubashi Group"<br/>
<br/>
The University went through a series of phases and names (like many <br/>
public and private schools in the Meiji era)  "Tokyo Shogyo Gakko <br/>
(Tokyo Commercial School) in 1884; as the Tokyo Koto Shogyo GAkko <br/>
(Tokyo Higher Commercial School) in 1885; as the Tokyo Shoka Daigaku <br/>
(Tokyo Commercial University) in 1920 and as Hitotsubashi University <br/>
in 1949." (Hall 256)  Ultimately, Mori Arinori, Meiji Japan's most <br/>
high profile Minister of Education is still looked upon "as the <br/>
original founder of [this] school." (Hall 256)<br/>
<br/>
[3] Tsuda Sen may best be known through his daughter, Tsuda Ume, a <br/>
influential female Christian educator during the Meiji Era.  She was <br/>
a lifelong friend of Aizu's Yamakawa Sutematsu (later known as the <br/>
Marchioness Oyama) and younger sister of Yamakawa Kenjiro.  Tsuda Ume <br/>
was also a friend and  co-worker, briefly, of Takamine Hideo who also <br/>
sent her to Oswego Normal School in New York State.<br/>
<br/>
[4] Yamakawa Kenjiro was the younger brother of Yamakawa Hiroshi.  <br/>
Kenjiro was a graduate of Yale University, physicist and President of <br/>
Tokyo Imperial University.  He was also a close friend of the Fujita <br/>
family and it was Kenjiro who left us anecdotal stories of Fujita <br/>
Goro.  Kenjiro also wrote Aizu Boshin Senshi an important work <br/>
addressing the domain's role in the Boshin war. <br/>
We first learned of this mysterious member of the Shinsengumi from a <br/>
fan page devoted to Yamakawa Kenjiro!  <br/>
http://fukushima.cool.ne.jp/ykcome/index.htm  <br/>
although it is not clear how Takagi Teisaku was connected to Yamakawa <br/>
Kenjiro.http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm<br/>
<br/>
[5] Takamine Hideo  http://www.TakamineHideo.net<br/>
Family friend and co-worker of both Mr. and Mrs. Fujita.  He was <br/>
Tokio's cousin.  Takamine was the director of the Tokyo Normal <br/>
School, Tokyo Women's Normal school which later became the Tokyo <br/>
Higher Women's Normal School.   Takamine and his close students had <br/>
many connections to the Hitotsubashi group and a related <br/>
publication.  As a very young man, he was the page of Matsudaira <br/>
Katamori, the daimyo of Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about<br/>
How does both Yamakawa Kenjiro and Takamine Hideo, both of whom knew <br/>
Fujita Goro's Shinsengumi career *not* mention yet another member of <br/>
the Shinsengumi, Takagi Teisaku, to their friend Goro<br/>
<br/>
Without understanding these complex Aizu connections with the Fujita <br/>
family we simply would not have found this fascinating member of the <br/>
Shinsengumi, Takagi Teisaku.<br/>

like the English language Wikipedia---anyone at any time may change the <br/>
information<br/>
<br/>
at this time I was unable to find nothing specific on Takagi Teisaku in <br/>
English languages texts---I was only able to find general information <br/>
on Hitotsubashi University (it's forerunner)<br/>
<br/>
there is a possibility that as such a prominent figure in the world of <br/>
business education he may be in the JAPAN YEAR BOOK (however, those <br/>
have been pulled for restoration/rebinding in my library)</div>
