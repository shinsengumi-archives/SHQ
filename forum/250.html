is an animated movie...I think &quot;stop-motion&quot; with paper<br/>
dolls?...Kodachiko Kureru&#39;s site has some pics of this unique<br/>
film...it&#39;s based on a manga by Hiroshi Kurogane.  I ordered this book<br/>
and it hasn&#39;t arrived yet.<br/>
<br/>
Kodachiko&#39;s site (there is a pic of paper doll Saitou too by the way)<br/>

<br/>
The thing that is driving me insane is <br/>
1) KON ICHIKAWA directed it!!! My fav films from him are THE KEY and<br/>
BURMESE HARP...Kon Ichikawa has a background in animation so this film<br/>
must&#39;ve been fabulous<br/>
<br/>
2) Kiichi Nakai does the voice of Hijikata Toshizo!<br/>
For those of you who haven&#39;t seen MIBUGISHIDEN...Kiichi Nakai is the<br/>
actor who portrays Yoshimura Kanichiro (I spelled the name wrong). <br/>
Maybe this actor is a closet Shinsengumi fan:)<br/>
<br/>
Why oh why is this film not available for purchase!!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946865560">When you click on the pics of each episode, is it going straight to <br/>
some kind of animation?  It&#39;s bringing up Real Player on my desktop <br/>
when I click on images, trying to connect, and the site owner says <br/>
something about being worried about the links actually showing the <br/>
film... am I reading that right?  My computer isn&#39;t always reliable <br/>
when it comes to loading various media and I&#39;m too sick right now to <br/>
fool with it, but I thought I&#39;d mention something...<br/>

media is all messed up so all we have are the screen caps<br/>
