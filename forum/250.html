<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695516561">"Shinsengumi" 2000 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400817/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400817/</a><br/>
is an animated movie...I think "stop-motion" with paper<br/>
dolls?...Kodachiko Kureru's site has some pics of this unique<br/>
film...it's based on a manga by Hiroshi Kurogane.  I ordered this book<br/>
and it hasn't arrived yet.<br/>
<br/>
Kodachiko's site (there is a pic of paper doll Saitou too by the way)<br/>

<br/>
The thing that is driving me insane is <br/>
1) KON ICHIKAWA directed it!!! My fav films from him are THE KEY and<br/>
BURMESE HARP...Kon Ichikawa has a background in animation so this film<br/>
must've been fabulous<br/>
<br/>
2) Kiichi Nakai does the voice of Hijikata Toshizo!<br/>
For those of you who haven't seen MIBUGISHIDEN...Kiichi Nakai is the<br/>
actor who portrays Yoshimura Kanichiro (I spelled the name wrong). <br/>
Maybe this actor is a closet Shinsengumi fan:)<br/>
<br/>
Why oh why is this film not available for purchase!!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946865560">When you click on the pics of each episode, is it going straight to <br/>
some kind of animation?  It's bringing up Real Player on my desktop <br/>
when I click on images, trying to connect, and the site owner says <br/>
something about being worried about the links actually showing the <br/>
film... am I reading that right?  My computer isn't always reliable <br/>
when it comes to loading various media and I'm too sick right now to <br/>
fool with it, but I thought I'd mention something...<br/>
