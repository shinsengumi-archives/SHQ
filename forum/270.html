<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597037316">A week ago I emailed the Ridgebackpress and I received a reply from<br/>
Mr. Hillsborough saying that the consensus is that the Mimawarigumi<br/>
killed Ryoma Sakamoto however many theories -still- abound. I emailed<br/>
a question knowing that answer in the back of my mind...I did so<br/>
because if theories are still out there then websites should state<br/>
that rather than saying X killed X and not mention that there could be<br/>
more than one possibility.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Tiffany, I am no expert at this, but I know how they come up with <br/>
another theory on who killed Ryoma Sakamoto. This is based on the <br/>
idea that if the any members of Mimawarigumi and Shinsengumi were <br/>
involved then it wouldn't have been a secret and just official police <br/>
business. There wouldn't be a reason to cover it up or be secret <br/>
about it. I just thought I would mention this...take it for whatever <br/>
it is worth...<br/>
<br/>
This is taken from Mitsuo Kure's Samurai book:<br/>
<br/>
"Who was responsible for the killing of Ryoma? Under the Kyoto<br/>
shugo there were two police organizations, the Shinsengumi and <br/>
Mimawarigumi. When Matsudaira Katamori, the lord of Aizu, was <br/>
appointed as shugo his soldiers were based at the Komyoji Temple. The <br/>
Mimawarigumi stayed at a branch temple of the Komyoji and executed <br/>
their duties around the temples of the city. Ryoma was regarded as a <br/>
criminal because he had killed one of the police raiders with his <br/>
revolver during the attack on him at the Teradaya inn; so it would <br/>
not be strange if he was a police target. According to the memoir of <br/>
Teshirogi Suguemon, an inspector of the Shinsengumi who served under <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori, it was Katamori who ordered Ryoma's <br/>
assassination, and Suguemon is a credible source. But if Ryoma was a <br/>
criminal why did the Mimawarigumi resort to assassination? Legitimate <br/>
police activity did not have to be kept secret. <br/>
<br/>
 If it was not a simple matter of police revenge, then who profited <br/>
most from Ryoma's death? The answer must be that the men who<br/>
wanted to unleash military violence against the bakufu broke from the <br/>
spell of the most influential voice speaking against the civil<br/>
war."<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Right, I think that is what that author I quoted was implying. That <br/>
it was either Satsuma or Choshu clan and any other person that wanted <br/>
to war against the Shogun. Ryoma seemed to be the person that was <br/>
preventing that. The movies I have about Ryoma tend to take this <br/>
theory, but that is fiction of course. I read someone talking about <br/>
the Peacemaker Manga on Ryoma's death, but I won't spoil that one. <br/>
I'll post something on this on the other board eventually. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
