<h3>Movie Review: Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage</h3>
by <i>chuckjharris</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-901663077">Konnichiwa!<br/>
<br/>
At the last anime con I attended, I stumbled across a movie called <br/>
Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage that mentioned the Shinsengumi.  I immediately <br/>
purchased the movie, and later found that it was not in the list at SHQ <br/>
(or in IMDB, for that matter).  After watching it, I think I know why, <br/>
but I will offer this review to save anyone else who might come across <br/>
it.  I will try to avoid revealing any spoilers (not that there is much <br/>
to reveal in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
The blurb from the back cover is more plot than you get in the movie <br/>
itself:  "During the Edo period of Japan, out of fear of losing <br/>
authority, the Tokugawa shogunate hires the Shinsengumi to bring down <br/>
the Imperial Court.  However, the Satsuma clan finds out about the <br/>
Tokugawa's scheme and sends the last five Kunoichi (female ninjas) of <br/>
Hiryu Ninja Clan to spy on the Shinsengumi.  Meanwhile, an evil skeletal <br/>
demon is brought to life to murder the Kunoichi ninjas and destroy the <br/>
world."<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing to this audience, I'm sure, is the Shinsengumi <br/>
content; I'll cover that first, as it won't take long.  The only <br/>
recognizable members are Hijikata and Okita.  Hijikata was played by <br/>
Hiroyuki Watanabe, who went with the tried-and-true heartless killer <br/>
approach to the character.  He actually was on the movie poster and DVD <br/>
cover (because he actually has a career; he was in Ringu and a variety <br/>
of rubber-suit monster movies), but he gets about two minutes of screen <br/>
time.  Okita was played by the standard young, cute, heart-throb type, <br/>
and manged to be even more wishy-washy than the Peacemaker Okita; <br/>
obviously he was still haunted by the death of Yamanami, which he talks <br/>
about over and over and over.   Every other member of the Shinsengumi <br/>
shown is a generic extra, all of whom are dumb, poor swordsmen, and <br/>
fated to die violently.<br/>
<br/>
The overall feel of the movie is amateurish; it looks like a class <br/>
project from a film school.  The fight choreographer obviously quit <br/>
after the first fight scene (which wasn't _horribly_ bad), because the <br/>
combat gets progressively worse as the movie runs.  I think the director <br/>
raided a kendo school for Shinsengumi extras, as most the extras seem to <br/>
know at least which end of the sword to hold.  The ninja and Okita, on <br/>
the other hand, look like they studied swordsmanship for about five <br/>
minutes before shooting started; my four-year-old niece can use a sword <br/>
more effectively and more convincingly than these people.  By the end of <br/>
the movie, the fight scenes were almost painful to watch.<br/>
<br/>
The special effects are perfect for anyone who has ever watched Dr. Who <br/>
and said "Those effects just look a little too convincing to me."  They <br/>
were poorly done on some PC graphics package (maybe the Paint program <br/>
that comes with Windows?); the edges of the overlays were poorly <br/>
trimmed, the CG effects didn't mesh at all with the live film, etc.  <br/>
Granted, this movie was made in 1997, but this was bad by 1980's BBC <br/>
standards.  The "skeletal demon" and his zombie sidekicks looked weak, <br/>
fought poorly, and barely moved.<br/>
<br/>
The writing probably took at least a half hour; there were plenty of <br/>
plot holes you could pilot the SDF-1 through.  The ninja's dialog seemed <br/>
to consist entirely of "You go on ahead, I'll hold them here as long as <br/>
I can" and determined-looking nods, while Okita whined his way through <br/>
all of his scenes.<br/>
<br/>
The costumes are the only decent thing about the movie.  The Shinsengumi <br/>
have their light blue jackets, the ninja are dressed 1980's style (full <br/>
black costumes (though the leader has a red vest), instead of the more <br/>
modern fishnet and miniskirt style, ala Ninja Scroll).  The sets look <br/>
convincingly Tokugawa-era.<br/>
<br/>
There is a little gratuitous nudity (top only).<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I have to say it's probably not the worst movie I've ever seen, <br/>
but none that are worse come immediately to mind.  I don't even think <br/>
it's worth renting; the only reason I'm keeping my copy is that it is <br/>
perfect fodder for a Mystery Science Theater make-over.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize about the length of the review; thanks to anyone who <br/>
actually read this far.<br/>

Thanks for the review!<br/>
<br/>
Are you seriously thinking of doing an MST3K on this one?  If so, would you <br/>
share it with us when it's done?<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
