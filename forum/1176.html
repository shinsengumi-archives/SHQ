<h3>Suzuki sword kanji</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078596563">Sorry to be late responding to your request, Jon.  I&#39;ve had no access to the internet all day (and it was torture to be away from you guys!)<br/>
 <br/>
Since I can&#39;t paste kanji into the yahoo mailer and get it to come out displayed correctly, the best I can do is guide you to where it is in the article.  If you use the translator that wounds alerted us to the other day (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate/">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate/</a> -- paste in the URL and in the drop-down menu underneath, choose the second option, then hit the button to the right of that), in the main text box (ignoring the top box which is the article title), it&#39;s in the seventh paragraph (Nifty gives you first the paragraph of kanji, then the English, then the next paragraph of kanji, etc.)  Since I don&#39;t read kanji at all, I couldn&#39;t tell you where it is... I just know the paragraph.<br/>
 <br/>
The URL for the text is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sara1.gotdns.com/~ark24/suzuki003.html">http://sara1.gotdns.com/~ark24/suzuki003.html</a> <br/>
 <br/>
For anyone interested in how Nifty translated it:<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Moreover, although it is said that the thief went into the Suzuki family in Meiji 44 on the New Year&#39;s Day The sword then put on the alcove (Saburo Miki has the Bizen Nagafune �S�� with fierce god Kunishige Maru) the direction of a fierce god circle -- &quot;-- turn off this sword well -- it prizes with ��&quot; and ���� is quite showy -- making -- coming out -- seemingly it was -- extracting -- &quot;-- get -- �� -- if it goes as &quot; -- a thief -- the force -- overwhelming -- having -- the way way -- it is said that it escaped by ���� &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As you can see, it deals with the sword a little differently than babelfish did.  Sec, you should run an article about Saitou&#39;s sword through and see if it translates it any differently...<br/>

About the sword,it says Miki had two swords; one was Bizen Osafune Sukesada <br/>
and the other was Kijin maru with showy vermilion-lacquerd scabbard.<br/>
Miki esteemed especially the latter one and used to say &quot;This sword cuts <br/>
really well&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852846949">I just used nifty<br/>
&quot;form of Ikeda fierce god Kunishige Maru&#39;s&quot;<br/>
http://www.3-hajime.com/aitou.html<br/>
<br/>
from demon&gt;&gt;&gt;fierce god which I know understand...demi-gods from<br/>
Hindu/Buddhist cosmology transferred to Japan were pretty fierce<br/>
looking...geez and I wrote like several paragraphs about how the<br/>
symbolism was connected to Nakajima N&#39;s work over at<br/>
http://www.shinsengumimb.com...<br/>
<br/>
I also niftied Miki&#39;s page Phil...Miki said &quot;this [sword] cuts<br/>
well&quot;...maybe that&#39;s what he said to the thief! And perhaps he<br/>
unsheathed the sword in a way which clearly indicated to them that he<br/>
would be happy to demonstrate...<br/>
<br/>
OT about Miki and raising poultry...my aunt had 2 Japanese chickens as<br/>
pets and they were very very adorable (this particular breed stayed<br/>
very small and their feather patterns were so peculiar)...I enjoyed<br/>
observing them until they got eaten by monitor lizards living in a<br/>
swamp nearby @_@<br/>
