Let me be frank...the translations are OK they are not scanlations<br/>
though...in burai it mentions that Saitou washes and IRONS his fundoshi:)<br/>
and burai makes a big deal about his stomache ache<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908532020">Hmmm... Makes me think twice if they make such a big deal of his <br/>
stomach ache... Not the Saitou I KNOW... About the fudonshi, yes I <br/>
remember the list talking about that around a month ago... Hilarious! <br/>
I wonder where she got all her info though? I wonder how faithful <br/>
Burai is to what is true about the real Saitou... Probably far huh? <br/>
<br/>
Well once I get paypal setup, I don't mind if they're just <br/>
transalations. I love collecting manga (eventhough I can't read them).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the info Tiffany.<br/>

<h3>Re: Burai Sequel (stomach ache)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-486295755">The stomach ache business was brought up when the Shinsengumi were<br/>
under the command of Serizawa Kamo.  Everyone went on a boat trip,<br/>
Saitou got sick they went to stay at an inn and called a doctor for<br/>
him and later the group got into a "scuffle" with sumo wrestlers. <br/>
However, I skimmed Burai, and the situation outlined was not the one I<br/>
just mentioned...the author used it as an excuse to have Okita spoil<br/>
him (not in -that- way you sickos)...at least I didn't catch anything<br/>
controversial:)  <br/>

you can search for Saitou by just using the EDIT button and type in<br/>
"Saitou" to find references to him on the pages<br/>
