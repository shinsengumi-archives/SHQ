<div id="ygrps-yiv-213201012">Did Yamazaki actually have a ninja background or is that entirely an invention of PMK?  I hear about him all the time, that he was highly respected within the Shinsengumi, but find I know *nothing* about him as a person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108232201">Yamazaki Susumu is discussed on many Japanese sites and many say the<br/>
same thing...he has basic medical knowledge...OR even that his father<br/>
was a traditional healer...ofcourse these sites do not cite books from<br/>
which this info came from.  I thought that back on MM list someone had<br/>
said that it would be hard to just "fake" that they had medical<br/>
knowledge because occupations were highly specialized back then.<br/>
<br/>
Serizawa Kamo, as always the most informative English site, discusses<br/>
him...keep reading:)<br/>

<br/>
The movie "I Want to Die a Samurai" depicts Yamazaki Susumu<br/>
*unfortunatly only bootlegs on ebay are available<br/>
<br/>
The whole ninja thing is interesting...there were ninja clans/families<br/>
etc mentioned in Japanese history. However many historians also<br/>
discuss samurai doing "ninja work" as well.  <br/>
<br/>
On a different note,when I started using babelfish to search Japanese<br/>
search engines there was a Shinsengumi site that mentions "Saito One<br/>
no sign ninja/shinobi" ... it was more of a fan site but still I think<br/>
what the webmaster was getting at was that he/she didn't think Saito<br/>
One was a ninja but obviously he could do spy work.  Perhaps Nanae<br/>
Chrono just recognized that information gathering was as "ninja" as<br/>
you can get and chose to portray him that way.<br/>
