<h3>ACK!! Babelfish and Names</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-791849489">Oh Miki you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Miki...  (Never imagined I'd ever have a reason for quoting that stupid song... )<br/>
 <br/>
You know, it's kind of hard to write a character when you can't even figure out what to call him.  HELP!  Looking at the names babelfish is supplying... Miki is shown in both surname and personal positions.  Is it just the way babelfish is translating or did he indeed use the name for either at various times?  And, am I correct in my always doubtful decipherment that during the Meiji he became "Miki Izumi" and if so, is Miki the surname or the personal name.  The urge is to switch it around with Izumi as the surname.<br/>
