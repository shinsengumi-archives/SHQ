<h3>SHQ webpage error</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960943774">3.26.2008 a SHQ member emailed me to inform the site is damaged.  I <br/>
visited it immediately and yep.<br/>
<br/>
All the content is gone.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully our hosting service will be able to restore the site via a <br/>
back up.<br/>
<br/>
As of yesterday the site was still working as a friend and I over <br/>
email looked on the site for some citation so I guess this must be a <br/>
sudden technical glitch.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways it has crossed my mind many times to just archive everything <br/>
into one file.  But the website will still stay online ofcourse.<br/>
<br/>
The file would be a not for profit e-book written collaboratively by <br/>
atleast 2-3 people but honestly we'd need more help than that! (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
The drawback to an e-book would be the increased likelihood of <br/>
plagiarism (whole chapters turned in as school assignments).  Our <br/>
most prolific contributor was plagiarized twice already (that we know <br/>
of).  <br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, if we were to create a pdf e-book it would still <br/>
be searchable.  Someone tell me if I'm wrong (I don't own the Adobe <br/>
software).<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free by helping to give us ideas or post other <br/>
interesting Shinsen-things you find online---because we need to put <br/>
together our heads and help each other by thinking out loud.<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, I've been quiet these past 3 months especially due <br/>
to a life change and I -no- longer have access to a fabulous <br/>
university research library (I used these libraries during 2004, <br/>
2005, 2006 and a bit in 2007 focusing later on the Meiji).  That's <br/>
why I don't have anything to contribute.<br/>
<br/>
But that's just me---there are dozens of people here scattered <br/>
throughout the country who can find an aspect of the Shinsengumi or <br/>
the era they like and study whatever they want.<br/>
<br/>
To give an example, a friend and I had found a very interesting book <br/>
which is the bio of, Yamakawa Futaba, a friend and co-worker of both <br/>
Saitou Hajime (Fujita Goro) and Takagi/Fujita Tokio. The book was <br/>
written at the very end of the Meiji Era and we'd love to read it to <br/>
find more "texture" and detail into the career of Futaba---which <br/>
completely overlapped with that of the Fujita husband and wife.  <br/>
Futaba's rank at the school was higher than that of the Fujitas.<br/>
<br/>
However I was very busy in December and it would not be possible for <br/>
me to order it through the university.  After losing my library <br/>
privileges due to a move I asked a city public library if they can <br/>
fulfill the request and get Futaba's bio and they said I would have <br/>
to pay for everything.  <br/>
<br/>
So that's why for a couple of years I was intensely focused on <br/>
history because I had a time limit and although I explained this to <br/>
some of my friends at the time it was not 100% clear to them why I <br/>
seemed to "favor" history over fiction. I had some practical reasons <br/>
which was why I was in a hurry to grab history stuff (^_^).  <br/>
<br/>
We all know manga, anime/dvds, all go through reprints and get picked <br/>
up by companies all the time -however- some books are rare, expensive <br/>
or go out of print. Similarly, academic articles (a handful of which <br/>
we've exploited extensively) are not -public-.  You can't go online <br/>
and download some of the journal articles we have used and also <br/>
provided here on this list.<br/>
<br/>
So now I guess all I have is fiction and I have to go with the flow <br/>
until I find an occupation which can take me back into an academic <br/>
setting of some sort (^_^).  Email me if you know of a university <br/>
which needs a floor sweeper---I'm game XD<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently trying to pass the time by writing fiction and I <br/>
usually post updates now and then at the <br/>

<h3>Re: SHQ webpage error</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979597559">I just wanted to update people who are here on the SHQ mailing list that <br/>
as of right now it is not 100% clear that the tech people with the hosting <br/>
people with the company can restore the site.  I will try to chat with <br/>
them on Monday.  Fortunately our moderator Barb had a back up of the <br/>
site and so if the tech people can't assist---we still have our data.<br/>
<br/>
So what will happen now?<br/>
<br/>
I will devote as much as possible to arrange the data into a draft for an <br/>
e-book and then work with another researcher who can oversee other <br/>
details.  The book will have many footnotes and the citations will be in <br/>
place to allow readers to do their own double checking if they desire.<br/>
<br/>
As we work on this new phase of the SHQ data I will post requests here <br/>
on the list to encourage contributions from members here.  <br/>
<br/>
The e-book will not incorporate details regarding the Shinsengumi in <br/>
fiction, with the exception of the filmography (written by Michael of the <br/>
Ninja Dojo) and more general mentions (such as popular manga/anime <br/>
which are already part of the Shinsengumi legacy).  Details regarding <br/>
minor fiction releases (like Shinsengumi trading cards or non-exported <br/>
vid games) will be posted on the site and also <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com">http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com</a> because there is new information <br/>
every month (I keep up with the new with the google alert system using <br/>
the keyword "shinsengumi").<br/>
<br/>
Thus, SHQ will provide data in the form of an e-book which can be <br/>
downloaded, however images (many of which are from the Kyoto <br/>
Museum book or other Japanese sites) cannot be part of the e-book---<br/>
we will continue to host those images on the site in such a way you can <br/>
match images chapter by chapter.<br/>
<br/>
We are currently researching copyright options---however if the cost is <br/>
simply too high or the legal matters too complex then we will go ahead <br/>
and risk being plagiarized because we do want to make the info <br/>
available.  Certain parts  of SHQ is not only derived work or "quoted <br/>
from such and such a book", there was also some pretty original <br/>
research and we still have so many leads we can't follow up on right <br/>
now.  I will take advantage of this opportunity (during the e-book <br/>
adaption) to include recommendations on how to further specific angles <br/>
(only on chapters I will assist in writing).<br/>
<br/>
So thank you for staying with this list for all these years and please feel <br/>
free to post your thoughts on the list or you can contact me or any one <br/>
else by sending emails (just click on the yahoo profile).</div>
