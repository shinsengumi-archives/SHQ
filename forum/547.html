<h3>OT: Dagger of Kamui</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-836996646">Ok, has anyone ever heard of this anime? It&#39;s supposed to be old. I <br/>
think it came out in 1985 or somewhere around there? The reason I was <br/>
wondering is I saw something that mentioned the Battle of Goryokaku <br/>
is shown near the end. I seriously doubt Hijikata is mentioned <br/>
anywhere in the film, but it might be interesting if there is <br/>
anything much about the Boshin War in it. Does anyone know?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Like I said before, I really doubt you would see Hijikata in it anywhere. It&#39;s the battle at Goryokaku that is supposed to be in it. They could have completely skipped over his part in all that easily. It&#39;s more about some ninja kid or the like. I just thought that if they did show anything of the war in Hokkaido it might be worth my while. That&#39;s what I&#39;m really trying to find out.<br/>
