<h3>{OT} [E-book Rec.] SAMURAI CAPTIVE</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-431057949">Author Barbara Sheridan will take reader's into an exotic world of<br/>
courtesan's and samurai in 19th century Japan where a helpless British<br/>
woman is held prisoner by a mysterious warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Ofcourse, if SAMURAI CAPTIVE was that simple, and the female<br/>
protagonist weepy and "helpless", I probably wouldn't bother the list<br/>
with this off-topic post.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai Captive is about perception, both cultural and physical, it's<br/>
deadly mixture with lust and a high stakes game involving the opium trade.<br/>
<br/>
This e-book opens with the Richardson Incident (The Namamugi Incident)<br/>
during which our feisty heroine Hannah is injured and later sold to<br/>
the Yoshiwara red-light district in Edo.  Hannah not only enters into<br/>
dangerous surroundings but also finds herself in the middle of an<br/>
unlikely love triangle between two samurai.  <br/>
<br/>
Let's just say the other man in the story is not too happy with his<br/>
lover's newly acquired "barbarian" pet.<br/>
<br/>
Overall this is a very strong work that is both romantic and thrilling<br/>
 at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I leave you with a quote from the ever hard to please Mrs. Giggles, a<br/>
well known reviewer of romance novels:<br/>
<br/>
Hannah's "free show leads to her being bought by one of the men in the<br/>
audience. ...Hannah is not a happy property and she bites too, not<br/>
that Katsu is too unhappy about that."<br/>

Tidbit:  The character of Katsu is supposed to look like major star<br/>
Hiroyuki Sanada (^_^)<br/>

<br/>
I know that e-books may be a bit new for some people but I always<br/>
found them to be very convenient when I had a borrowed laptop.  You<br/>
can always balance out computer work with a quick break by reading a<br/>
chapter or two in an e-book.  Loose-id is a great site with an easy to<br/>
use and secure shopping cart.  So if you've never bought an e-book<br/>
before then let Samurai Captive introduce you to this new medium for<br/>
literature.</div>
