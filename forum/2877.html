<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749064205">thank you very much to k kobayakawa and Hirotada Tokugawa for <br/>
translating that page about a possible other Fujita Family photo at <br/>
Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
I want to go off-topic just to explain to new members who haven&#39;t <br/>
had a chance to read some info. <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
[The Influence of 1868 on Toyohisa Matsue]<br/>
<br/>
COL. Toyohisa Matsue was the son of an Aizu samurai who was exiled <br/>
to Tonami after 1868.<br/>
<br/>
After Aizu was defeated in the Boshin war of 1868 many samurai <br/>
families were sent up north to survive on their own, amongst them <br/>
would be Yamaguchi Jiro (Ichinohe Denpachi or Shinsengumi Saitou <br/>
Hajime). (footnote) Some young samurai were sent to Edo/Tokyo and <br/>
remained in kinshin generally until 1871---so not all Aizu people <br/>
ended up in the icy wasteland.<br/>
<br/>
Matsue grew up listening to his father recount the extreme hardship <br/>
they suffered in Tonami. Therefore he was sympathetic to the German <br/>
officers (during WWI) under his charge. Matsue later became the <br/>
mayor of Wakamatsu (Fukushima Prefecture--which as basically <br/>
formerly Aizu-han)<br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
[Germans + Aizu Connection]<br/>
Now going back to 1868, Aizu *did have a German connection too!  The <br/>
Schnell brothers sold weapons to Aizu (Thomas Glover was the arms <br/>
dealer to Satsuma). We have a friend on this list who is reading an <br/>
article in German on the Schnell brothers and their activities <br/>
during the Boshin War.<br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
[Matsue&#39;s Organization Style]<br/>
Matsue ran the prison camp in a somewhat similar way to pre-1868 <br/>
hangakko (samurai schools for domains) which influenced Meiji era <br/>
dorms for men and women.  That style is translated roughly as &quot;self-<br/>
governance&quot; where the students (in this case prisoners) disciplined <br/>
themselves.  Self-governance was used in dorms connected to the <br/>
Women&#39;s Normal School (different variations on the name depending on <br/>
year) where Takagi/FUJITA Tokio worked.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, from this fascinating connection you can see how war <br/>
experiences affect more than one generation.<br/>
<br/>

period.  It was my interest in him that eventually led me to the <br/>
Shinsengumi (and this group).  Here are a couple of sites that have <br/>
some brief background on this Scot and his contributions.  Guns, <br/>
ships, flowers, and although it does not mention it at either site, <br/>
he also had trout imported and stocked into the Yugawa River.<br/>
