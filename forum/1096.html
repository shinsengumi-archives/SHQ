<h3>Sword Scars (why?)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-709527603">Does anyone know the point of purposefully (?) inflicting sword <br/>
scars on posts/furniture etc.  I understand if the interior of a <br/>
building gets damaged due to a fight but it seems that these sword <br/>
scars are everywhere, in temples etc too.  Were these ever done on <br/>
purpose?  I posted a link to a site which contains short videos to <br/>
tours of Shinsengumi related sites and in one segment the guide was <br/>
pointing out a damaged door/window (removed from the main structure) <br/>
but he seemed kind of enthusiastic not at all serious so it made me <br/>
wonder if guys just slashed at stuff for fun(?). The book from which <br/>
I scanned the full body chainmail also contains MORE sword scars <br/>
than those seen on websites...did our guys get a little too rowdy at <br/>
times?<br/>
