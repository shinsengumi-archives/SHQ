<div id="ygrps-yiv-583067705">[Announcement] I&#39;m trying to draft a Table of Contents <br/>
and &quot;intelligent&quot; dating and indexing system for the imaginary book <br/>
all Shinsengumi fans want...(note: this is just a proposal for what a <br/>
Shinsengumi book SHOULD look like---not a project which will happen <br/>
in the future or anything---unless I win the lotto...)<br/>
<br/>
it will have a whole chapter on:<br/>
1) A Propensity to Kill---ooops I mean A PROPENSITY TO BE CUTE: The <br/>
Biography of Okita<br/>
2) The Will to Power---no, no, I meant to say THE WILL TO GO TO <br/>
SHIMABARA: The Miburo and the Red-Light District<br/>
<br/>
::JUST KIDDING::<br/>
<br/>
if you have suggestions on what SHOULD be in a Shinsengumi book <br/>
(include also ideas on themes too or rumors/mysteries which should be <br/>
explored e.g. the assassination of Serizawa Kamo, the remains of <br/>
Kondou Isami), or how it should be formatted just email me at <br/>
secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com<br/>
<br/>
now for the reply<br/>

Thank you for bringing up this issue...now I have to update<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a><br/>
which does try to track signficant novels and publications such as <br/>
SHINSENGUMI TENMATSUKI which seemed to have spawned the Shinsengumi <br/>
craze of the 1970s<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
NOTE: that there is a Japanese and English view---I have not checked <br/>
the Japanese view to find the dates for when the book came out in <br/>
Japan<br/>
<br/>
the database above is available at many public libraries---totally <br/>
for free!<br/>
<br/>
use this database for other things like getting the Japanese names of <br/>
authors and so forth copy and paste into <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.co.jp">http://www.google.co.jp</a> and <br/>
you will find fansites which directly quote Shinsengumi books and <br/>
paste info onto their webpages---then insert info back into <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate</a> to get screwed up translations (and <br/>
there you have it the newby&#39;s guide to painful internet research).<br/>
