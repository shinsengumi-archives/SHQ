<h3>Other Animated Movies Featuring Swords & Samurai</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067847546">I had to specify Swords & Samurai because as you all know there are <br/>
other animated films out there with swords but not samurai (only magical <br/>
powers) -or- samurai but no fantasy "swordsmanship" which we all love.  <br/>
I have indicated if any films contain sexual content just so you know <br/>
ahead of time when to keep it from underage kids.<br/>
<br/>
1) Ninja Scroll...considered by many to be a classic IMHO only the <br/>
scene featuring the blind swordsman and the hero was memorable...the <br/>
rest is well...hard to say (contains sexual situations)<br/>
<br/>
2) Swords of/for Truth...some good lines here and there but in general <br/>
quiet forgettable (contains sexual situations)...animation quality is uneven<br/>
<br/>
3) Ninja Resurrection...features the "original" Christian Samurai rebellion <br/>
during the Tokugawa era...has some good scenes but 99% is a gorefest <br/>
and the story line may be very offensive to many (contains sexual <br/>
situations)...Miyamoto Musashi has a cameo role in this film...animation is <br/>
decent<br/>
<br/>
4) Kaidohmaru...the news isn't all bad because this one is a GEM, A+, <br/>
do whatever it takes to view this film, strong story, characterizations and <br/>
AMAZING animation (same level as RK OVAs).  I -highly- recommend <br/>
that you read the character profiles [first] because it seems to have been <br/>
based on a manga because the profiles contain info not mentioned <br/>
(clearly) in the movie.  PMK Maro fans (if there are any out there--scary <br/>
thought)...will find an equally twisted Ohni Hime in this film.  The film <br/>
implies sexual content. For those of us who *appreciate* gorgeous 2D <br/>
men, this film has 4 knights of the Defense Ministry which are <br/>
absolutely...GQ material...and they and the women in the film are all <br/>
drawn to look Asian.  The character design is really interesting because <br/>
it doesn't rely on what we are used to to distinguish different characters <br/>
(hair color etc). I'm pretty surprised this film is not more widely known <br/>
because it is ELEGANT and contains an intriguing plotline. FOUR <br/>
STARS!!!!!</div>

***some reviews are innaccurate, mostly because people didn't read the <br/>
character profiles (same situation as RK OVAs...you can't appreciate it <br/>
without knowing the background info)<br/>
