<h3>More Stuff Info from Japan</h3>

The language which corresponds to "headband" in the site was not found.<br/>
From the word of "wash" or "iron", I judge that it is this episode.<br/>
 <br/>
Saitou Hajime changed "shitaobi"(It is the same as fundoshi.=Classic<br/>
Japanese underpants) every day.<br/>
It was washed always pure white.<br/>
He struck it by hand and eliminated wrinkles. And it dried with a<br/>
solar light.<br/>
It was beautiful as it ironned.<br/>
 <br/>
This talk is the episode which shows that Saitou was very clean.<br/>
Samurai does not leave shame, after he dies. For them, the greatest<br/>
shame has an unsightly body.<br/>
Saitou is a really splendid samurai. <br/>
<br/>
Saitou is popular also in Japan.<br/>
I like him to the 2nd in the member of Shinsengumi.<br/>
By the way, did you see the "Mibugishiden" movie?<br/>
The actor who was playing Saitou on that movie is playing Serizawa<br/>
Kamo in this drama.<br/>
Similarly, the actor who was playing Okita on that movie is performing<br/>
Yamanami in this drama.<br/>
It is very interesting if the 4th story is seen in consideration of it.<br/>
 <br/>
Incidentally, the picture of Saitou of the top of the site is not him.<br/>
The picture makes Saitou's son (Fujita Tsutomu)'s photograph the model.<br/>
The picture is in Aizu's Byakkotai memorial hall.<br/>
The memorial hall wanted to decorate with Saitou's photograph there.<br/>
However, the photograph was not able to be got.<br/>
(It was not in the Fujita family which is Saitou's posterity, either. )<br/>
Then, Saitou's son's photograph was offered.<br/>
<br/>
****(secretarytocapt3)  momoiro-usagi is referring the pic seen<br/>
"everywhere" on the internet...this is NOT the group photo.  I read on<br/>
other Japanese sites that the photo/charcoal drawing was based on his<br/>
GRANDson...but momoiro-usagi knows his/her stuff</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526148703">Okay, I need to make sure I understand this because it looks like I have to go back and correct my history page... AGAIN!  :-D<br/>
 <br/>
The picture that everyone always sees as Saitou in police uniform (the charcoal drawing, NOT the woodcut) and has been debateable (debatable?) because the only connection of it to Saitou/Fujita was his name penciled in at the side...that infamous picture is actually his son, Tsutomu?  And it's in the memorial hall in Aizu because they couldn't find a picture of Saitou?  (And I suppose now that I go and change it, something new will come up, ne?)<br/>
 <br/>
Love the fundoshi story...  I wonder if he kept his equipment as clean (thinking of sec's comments about keeping kendo equipment clean).  Still, it certainly reminds me now of the old anecdotes about mother telling you to be sure you have on clean underwear in case something should happen...  Another one of those universal human traits?  (Actually, I can understand it on an evolutionary psychology basis, but I don't think you want me to get into that here...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232542786">momoiro-usagi was referring to pic#1 on 3-hajime.com which is this one<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.3-hajime.com/syouzou1.html">http://www.3-hajime.com/syouzou1.html</a><br/>
<br/>
well, I know it is frustrating to get bits and pieces of info...I'm<br/>
happy momoiro-usagi is so cool about spending time with translation<br/>
software...the trick is I used really simple sentences<br/>
<br/>
yep, it is his son<br/>
I'm sticking to momoiro-usagi because his/her translation software is<br/>
seems pretty good cuz in other places it says GRANDson<br/>
This fact must've been known for a long time as it is not even shown<br/>
in Shizuko Akama's book<br/>
<br/>
its in the White Tiger Memorial Hall (expressed in other places as<br/>
White Tiger Museum) in Aizu...must check for official English name<br/>
when I have a chance.  That's cool they wanted a pic of him to be in<br/>
the museum...<br/>
<br/>
[ANNOUNCEMENT] momoiro-usagi says that I can give his/her email to<br/>
people whom I trust...so anyone one here who knows Japanese and<br/>
understands basic sentence structure and would like to be our contact<br/>
with this patient person please contact me off-list we'll work out<br/>
details...just explain to momoiro that you got the contact info from<br/>
-me- because he/she is concerned about privacy and offered this option<br/>
in this 2nd message.  Ofcourse the messages to this person can be in<br/>
English but if you know Japanese then you'll know how to write your<br/>
sentences and use words which would be "clear" once the software<br/>
translates.  Kind of like the often used phrased in babelfish<br/>
translations of message posts which end with "impoliteness it is " or<br/>
"shank" (what is that supposed to mean?).<br/>

***can you tell us about your theory?...I wanna hear it...wouldn't it<br/>
be hilarious if Saitou clean his armor and set it aside and other guys<br/>
are like "I'm wearing his stuff---I can't stand using Harada's stuff<br/>
LOL" yeah I'm combining PMK universe with history... </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849881165">So the Saitou we think we've seen is not Saitou at all. Well that <br/>
certainly explains why the portrait and group photos look similar yet so <br/>
different.  Guess I'll be making some notations to the website asap on <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone but me have this impression of him kicking back in the <br/>
afterlife and watching with quite a bit of amusement as so many people <br/>
assume that the charcoal portrait is him? You just know he's smirking <br/>
and calling out "Ahous!"<br/>
<br/>
And does anyone else but me picture dear Tokio tossing went underwear <br/>
in  Saitou's face and saying , "If you want them so perfectly white and <br/>
wrinkleless then wash them yourself, buster!"<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506493279">I [always] imagine RK Saitou in Hist. Saitou's shoes<br/>
<br/>
[on adopting a 3rd son]<br/>
Fujita household filled with the sounds of the first two sons running<br/>
around.<br/>
Fujita Gorou trying to read a newspaper with cig in mouth over the<br/>
children's shouts and laughter (boys tend to be hellraisers I've noticed)<br/>
Tokio comes out of the kitchen "honey, I want another son and I have a<br/>
relative who needs to give up her child"<br/>
Fujita Gorou (cig drops out of mouth) and his eyes betray FEAR.<br/>

Fujita Gorou probably gave one too many speeches on the degrees of how<br/>
white a fundoshi should be, how much detergent to use and the right<br/>
and [wrong] way to hang it out in the sun...imagine him passing on<br/>
this habit to his sons...what a funny image...3 guys bonding through<br/>
washing their underwear... </span></blockquote></div>
