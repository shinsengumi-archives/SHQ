<h3>Oh, look a Shinsengumi Website</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096732680">whew! (takes off white gloves)<br/>
<br/>
This is my 'subdomain'<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/index.html">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/index.html</a><br/>
basically I set up a template and stuff...the links should work but no<br/>
content yet...it took me a long time to figure out how to reduce the<br/>
file size for the pics and I had to put filters on many because for<br/>
some reason the scanner I used just wasn't doing a great job...so the<br/>
pics on the right hand side look "artsy" even though I intended to use<br/>
the images in their original form.<br/>
<br/>
okay...I have scans from books I want to put up...now would it be<br/>
"safer" to keep uploading pics here in SHQ or put them on a public<br/>
website (but cite the book/author/isbn etc right on the pic)...I just<br/>
don't want to get sued :)  I purposefully used pics from Nobori<br/>
Nakajima because I figure that there is no copyright on them (at least<br/>
I hope not)...but I will put a disclaimer thing on the bottom of all<br/>
pages.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  I would be more than happy to combine this site with any other<br/>
Shinsengumi site out there (SHQ site or Shimazuryu's) mainly because I<br/>
believe in one super Shinsengumi headquarters which can address the<br/>
"needs" of this community.....once construction is done you change<br/>
your password to the account and I no longer have access...I did this<br/>
before for a non-profit org and it was a good arrangement.  I only<br/>
work with html/dreamweaver non of that fancy stuff so once I'm done<br/>
you can easily change/update content as need be...you have my email.</div>
