<h3>Oishi Kuwajiro</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031922415">You're saying "Who is THAT supposed to be?!", aren't you? Well, if <br/>
you've seen the Shinsengumi Keppuroku miniseries or if you've read up <br/>
on the Ito assassination over at www.christophermayo.com, then you'll <br/>
know this is the guy who actually bumped off Ito. (Some sites <br/>
mistakenly claim that Saito killed Ito, but all he actually did was <br/>
get the goods on him so Hijikata would be able to justify ordering <br/>
his death. (And BTW ladies, the guy who plays Kuwajiro for his five <br/>
seconds of fame in Shin Kepp is VERY drool-worthy!)<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY, I was just going over the Who's Who section of <br/>
www.tamahito.com and I found out a bit more about him. The translator <br/>
isn't very clear, but he seems to have been known as the "Sword <br/>
Ogre". (I would LOVE to know how he came by THAT name! Then again, it <br/>
probably involved lots of blood and gore...) He fought with the <br/>
Shinsengumi until the battle at Katsunuma on March 6th. After that, <br/>
he seems to have checked in one last time before going missing.<br/>
<br/>
Kuwajiro turned up again in 1870. The next part was very confusing. I <br/>
couldn't tell if Mitsui was a place or a person. As near as I can <br/>
tell, this was either someone from or a place in Satsuma. The long <br/>
and short of it is, Kuwajiro was recognized and captured. After being <br/>
interrogated under the suspicion that he was involved in Sakamoto <br/>
Ryoma's murder, he was finally executed. You'll recall of course that <br/>
Kondou was wrongly executed for the same reason.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought some of you might like to know how it went after the war <br/>
for some of the "regular joes" in the Shinsengumi.<br/>

Shinsengumi" liked to swap stories about the reactions their <br/>
nicknames caused...)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69371832">Saitou Hajime was also called "the ogre Saitou Hajime" on one of<br/>
1to5.net's files concerning the battles at Aizu...the webmaster says<br/>
something like "he seemed to have been called that" or something.<br/>
<br/>
In the manga Kaze Hikaru, Okita was called "son of the demon king" by<br/>
someone because he was able to "stop" his sword before cutting someone<br/>
(Okita was threatening someone)...and the guys says he must be the son<br/>
of the demon king to be able to do that<br/>
<br/>
There is a general Shinsengumi site in Japanese which calls Saitou<br/>
Hajime as possessing "one with" the "demon's hand" or something<br/>
<br/>
There was another "regular Joe" in the Shinsengumi who was called<br/>
"demolition man" (this name pops up in several places and it is<br/>
definitely a name) I guess he had a tendency to destroy things LOL!  <br/>
I ~imagine~ that he may be involved with manning cannons (Nakajima<br/>
Nobori did paint a portrait of a guy working a cannon)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways...in my Kyoto National Museum catalog (these pages are all in<br/>
Japanese so I didn't scan them for streamload as most of us can't read<br/>
it anyways) there are several pages with one paragraph biographies for<br/>
many members of the Shinsengumi (beyond the management level whom we<br/>
are all familiar)...I want to learn more about the other guys and<br/>
their lives after the revolution.  The Shinsengumi had such<br/>
fascinating demographics.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that you are a relative of one of these guys.  You travel to<br/>
Kyoto to visit let's say your beloved little brother...you get to<br/>
headquarters and say "I came here to visit XXXXX, my beloved little<br/>
brother" and the gatekeeper says "oh you mean the ogre demolition man<br/>
XXXX? Yeah, that's what we call him here" 0_O</div>
