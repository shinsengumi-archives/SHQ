<h3>Gintama to be picked up by Viz</h3>
by <i>onigiribeanie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888334274">Gintama - A Shounen jump title which features an AU Bakamatsu universe replete with Aliens has apparently been picked up by Viz, and will be released in English at a to be announced date.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I quite like the manga -- even though it probably is a bit irreverent in its treatment of history. I find the characterizations of the Shinsengumi and the Ishin to be inspired, although not exactly serious.  The names aren&#39;t quite the same, but you&#39;ll easily recognize Kondou, Hijikata, Okita, Yamazaki and from the Ishin: Sakamoto, Katsura and Takasugi.<br/>
<br/>
This is the only English fansite that I am aware of at the moment: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yorozuya.cjb.net/">http://www.yorozuya.cjb.net/</a> <br/>
<br/>
Yes there are (were) scanslations, but I suspect these will be yanked out of deference to Viz.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112108900">Class! I&#39;m partial to humour a la Gintama, and I&#39;m<br/>
glad to see that it&#39;s going out to a wider<br/>
(English-speaking) audience. Gin-san reminds me a bit<br/>
of Kenshin (both have dark pasts) but in my opinion,<br/>
he is much more fun (ducks flying objects from Kenshin<br/>
fans). <br/>
And Okita and Kagura are great characters. Y&#39;know if I<br/>
was a bit more obsessive, I&#39;d petition Sorachi to<br/>
introduce Saitou Hajime. <br/>
