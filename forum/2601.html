<h3>Gintama to be picked up by Viz</h3>
by <i>onigiribeanie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888334274">Gintama - A Shounen jump title which features an AU Bakamatsu universe replete with Aliens has apparently been picked up by Viz, and will be released in English at a to be announced date.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I quite like the manga -- even though it probably is a bit irreverent in its treatment of history. I find the characterizations of the Shinsengumi and the Ishin to be inspired, although not exactly serious.  The names aren't quite the same, but you'll easily recognize Kondou, Hijikata, Okita, Yamazaki and from the Ishin: Sakamoto, Katsura and Takasugi.<br/>
<br/>
This is the only English fansite that I am aware of at the moment: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yorozuya.cjb.net/">http://www.yorozuya.cjb.net/</a> <br/>
<br/>
Yes there are (were) scanslations, but I suspect these will be yanked out of deference to Viz.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112108900">Class! I'm partial to humour a la Gintama, and I'm<br/>
glad to see that it's going out to a wider<br/>
(English-speaking) audience. Gin-san reminds me a bit<br/>
of Kenshin (both have dark pasts) but in my opinion,<br/>
he is much more fun (ducks flying objects from Kenshin<br/>
fans). <br/>
And Okita and Kagura are great characters. Y'know if I<br/>
was a bit more obsessive, I'd petition Sorachi to<br/>
introduce Saitou Hajime. <br/>
