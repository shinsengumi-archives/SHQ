<h3>OT: Kamikaze pilots</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645710746">Some of you who have been involved in the discussion on kamikaze <br/>
pilots might be interested in this. The History Channel is having a <br/>
program on at 10p.m. ET called "Military Blunders" that will be going <br/>
over the Battle of Midway and the role of the kamikaze pilots during <br/>
the war. I wonder if they'll bring up anything about their attempting <br/>
to be like the samurai? It might be interesting to see what they have <br/>
to say on the matter anyway.<br/>
