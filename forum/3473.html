by Barbara Sheridan<br/>
a work of historical fiction published by Liquid Silver Books  <br/>
which will first be released in e-book format on Sept 28th.<br/>
<br/>
So keep an eye on this page: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liquidsilverbooks.com/">http://www.liquidsilverbooks.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Book trailer:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WgfyKgFA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WgfyKgFA</a><br/>
While the trailer doesn't show the Shinsengumi rest-assured the guys<br/>
are in the book.<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait for this book to come out in paperback format but I admit the e-book format is sooo affordable.  FALLING THROUGH GLASS is a classy mxf romance with the right balance of action and adventure.  I enjoyed reading the early drafts, under the title of Mirror, Mirror, of this work but the FINAL FORM in which this work has taken is FABULOUS FOLKS!<br/>
<br/>
:: SQUEEEEEEE ::<br/>
<br/>
So one of our very own SHQ members will be the first non-Japanese<br/>
to publish a work of historical fiction featuring the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for neglecting SHQ but I'm sorting adjusting<br/>
to stuff in real-life including a new sleep schedule.<br/>
I look forward to fulfilling my goals with SHQ but at the same<br/>
time I'm sorting being pulled in different directions too.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for not restoring the site yet and being quiet all these months.</div>

<h3>Fanfic Update</h3>
by <i>purplealienmio</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301425628">Hello hello, <br/>
<br/>
I don't know how much interest there might be but<br/>
I have finally, finally updated my fic "The Courtship of Lady Tokio".<br/>
Shameless plug: <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/28/The_Courtship_of_Lady_Tokio">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/28/The_Courtship_of_Lady_Tokio</a> <br/>
<br/>
This one and the next chapter features quite a bit of Itou in it. I'm sorry if people don't like my portrayal of his character. <br/>
Also, since I dedicated this story to Hakubaikou, I will be finishing it, hopefully by the end of the year. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, <br/>
Mio <br/>

I think you did a fine job of portraying Itou and how he was seen u others. <br/>
