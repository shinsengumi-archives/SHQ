<h3>Shiba Goro - Fujita Goro connection through Yamakawa Sec?</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952274806">Forgot until I glanced at the SHQ website that Yamakawa Hiroshi, one <br/>
of the go-betweens for Fujita Goro&#39;s marriage to Takagi Tokio, and <br/>
Yamakawa Okura were one and the same. Remembering Aizu talkes about <br/>
him mostly under the name Okura. Shiba Goro knew him as well, after <br/>
he left Shimokita and went to Tokyo. He stayed with Yamakawa a couple <br/>
of times when he had no where else to go, despite the fact that the <br/>
former domain elder was jobless and broke. Yamakawa and his mother <br/>
ended up borrowing 13 yen and 50 sen from Shiba in fact. You reminded <br/>
me of his Fujita connection, but not that he was in Remembering Aizu <br/>
the other day.<br/>
<br/>
And why didn&#39;t you remind me about that little scandal he was <br/>
involved in back in Shimokita? Where he was buying up all the dregs <br/>
from the tofu dealer and the samurai confronted him about it? HM? LOL<br/>
<br/>
Book specifically mentions his younger brother Kenjiro and Tokio&#39;s <br/>
cousin, Takamine Hideo, on pg 133. Didn&#39;t realize that. Was the part <br/>
about them being survivors of the Byakkotai.<br/>
<br/>
Now how I missed -this- I don&#39;t know...<br/>
Sagawa &quot;Ogre&quot; Kanbei fought in Kyoshu as the head of a plice unit <br/>
made up of 150 former Aizu samurai. (Knew that) To the end he refused <br/>
to use a modern weapon and was shot and killed at Mount Aso. ?!?! How <br/>
did I NOT see that before?! I&#39;m guessing this was in 1878 Sec?<br/>
<br/>
And does anyone know if Hirosawa Tomijiro (liaison for Aizu with the <br/>
Shinsengumi) and Hirosawa Yasuto (who had the first western-style <br/>
dairy farm) were one and the same? I recall seeing information from a <br/>
website that M translated for us that said Tomijiro was the owner of <br/>
this place. But Remembering Aizu mentions his first name is Yasuto? <br/>
Did he change his name or was the website mistaken?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654637013">There are connections EVERYWHERE....I thought people were following<br/>
along.  I did mention Shiba Goro on the updated Saitou Hajime<br/>
info-sheet.  What I will try to follow up it the Saga REbellion in<br/>
which Yamakawa Ookura/Taizo/Hiroshi acquitted himself very well and<br/>
was promoted in the army...Yamakawa Hiroshi later was chief of staff<br/>
in Seinan as you recall.  Thanks for summarizing everything<br/>
below....these Aizu folks sure stuck together.Don&#39;t forget how<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi wanted to investigate the can clamming business too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi, puts arm around Fujita Goro&#39;s shoulder &quot;Hey Goro,<br/>
let&#39;s say you and me go into the can clamming business---we&#39;ll make a<br/>
fortune!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Goro &quot;ummm I&#39;ll stick with the police work thank you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And about the clairvoyance testing...I&#39;m STILL pretty peeved at<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro about 1) messing up the experiment by forgetting to<br/>
insert the plate and 2) saying that no mistake occurred in an article<br/>
published at a later date...no doubt he was fascinated with the<br/>
research (otherwise he wouldn&#39;t risk his reputation by involving<br/>
himself with Dr. Fukuzawa) but clearly he was too busy covering up his<br/>
own error.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend people read both Shiba Goro&#39;s REMEMBERING AIZU and<br/>
the biography of Yamakawa Sutematsu....completes the &quot;picture&quot;<br/>
perfectly and both books are EXTREMELY affordable...I got the<br/>
Sutematsu book for under $5.000 the information is INCREDIBLE!!!!!<br/>

Ha! I know where I saw that now! It was from the Saito website. The one that <br/>
you have some translations of in the files? It says under Kanbei he &quot;achieved <br/>
a heroic death in 1878.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366343787">This appears to be a series of novels. If I&#39;ve read<br/>

The character image map from left to right: Kondou,<br/>
Yamanami, Iba, Harada (the shirtless one), Hijikata<br/>
(w/ the sword), and Okita.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the covers, it seems to focus mainly on Okita<br/>
and Hijikata. Shounen-ai/yaoi perhaps?<br/>
