<h3>Sonno Joi!!!! and Opium</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601967266">Many of us have had the chance to see black and white films or anime<br/>
showing ronin shouting "Sonno Joi" or "Tenchu" before 1) assassinating<br/>
some important person 2) fighting bakufu forces 3) killing a foreigner.<br/>
<br/>
The belief in Sonno Joi (revere the emperor and expel the barbarians)<br/>
{there are some slight variations on the translation} can be found in<br/>
the Imperialist and Shogunate side, however each side had political or<br/>
personal obligations which were factors which forced them to choose a<br/>
side.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, alot of guys, including some Shinsengumi, believed sonno<br/>
joi was the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Open any book on the history of Japan and the writer goes for the easy<br/>
reason and state "Japanese were xenophobic and this is expressed in<br/>
sonno joi" or something along those lines.  Usually there is a follow<br/>
up with how the Japanese are naturally paranoid about outsiders<br/>
because of the fact that they live on a series of islands.  Not only<br/>
is that the most "easy" explanation, it is incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
Ofourse, people regardless of era or race, were capable of rational<br/>
thought.  So did they all of sudden wake up one day and say "I hate<br/>
foreigners---kill them all!"  There was a cause for all things.<br/>
<br/>
Sonno joi was deeply influenced by China's (first) Opium War.<br/>
<br/>
The first half of these notes will explain it using the most reliable<br/>
texts I've found:<br/>

<br/>
The rest of the page will deal with opium in the Meiji Era, and<br/>
Japan's use of opium in her imperialist ventures.<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
[you can stop reading if you want the rest is just extra stuff]<br/>
<br/>
I felt that the right thing to do was omit one paragraph which was the<br/>
most intriguing.  <br/>
<br/>
The paragraph is basically this:  The weapons which funded the Ishin<br/>
Shishi (often on credit) were directly linked to the opium trade. <br/>
Also we know that the bakufu side had their arms dealer too, Schnell,<br/>
and perhaps he had a network of merchants (the truth is you will find<br/>
opium trade everywhere---it was the *NORM*).  Often merchants will<br/>
import in fancy western stuff but really the big money was in opium. <br/>
Opium was such a guaranteed high profit commodity that something<br/>
merchants "pawned" it to each other for money or weapons. You can say<br/>
"hey buddy give me a whole bunch of those guns, and I'll pay you later<br/>
cuz I got another buddy coming in with opium" and the person would<br/>
likely give the arms because opium was sure to yield the money to<br/>
cover the expense.  Opium didn't take up too much cargo space, it<br/>
pulled in the most profit, and it was one of those commodities which<br/>
could cover weapons trade (if the merchant was clever in the smuggling<br/>
method).<br/>
 <br/>
I first found shreds of this info because not only did merchants who<br/>
dealt with the Ishin Shishi but also diplomats ofcourse had another<br/>
"base" and that was British INdia.  There were financial transactions<br/>
between Japan and colony as well as your standard mundane paperwork.  <br/>
<br/>
What was the big deal with British India?  India was a corner of the<br/>
opium triangle.  British India's colonial administration was funded by<br/>
the opium trade.  More importantly the financial institutions which<br/>
stored the money for the British bureaucracy and her merchants (they<br/>
need not be British) was basically a storage for drug profits.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I didn't post this was because I did some extensive<br/>
reading here and there and it was something which can be extrapolated<br/>
from texts---but did I find some smoking gun by an author saying "this<br/>
is how the Boshin War was funded by drug money"...not exactly (but<br/>
pretty darn close).<br/>
<br/>
Remember, this is a study on a sordid trade (so authors were<br/>
cautious), there is a surprisingly amount of data, even ship logs<br/>
noting how much opium was entering which port and under which<br/>
merchant---but for the most part authors like to present the<br/>
information and draw the safest conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to state this...Thomas Glover is mostly associated with<br/>
Nagasaki (as were ***many merchants ofcourse).  Opium had few entries<br/>
into Japan, and Nagasaki was one of those trade hubs for this<br/>
contraband. The big trade firms were opium smugglers.  Keep in mind<br/>
that there was a great deal of denial over the opium problem in Japan<br/>
before and after 1868.  So if an author bought into the "Japanese<br/>
don't smoke opium" then he/she wouldn't look deeper.<br/>
<br/>
So I followed them and did not interpret beyond the very basic<br/>
possible conclusion. I didn't want to threaten the integrity of the<br/>
rest of the good information with my own "speculation".  but I wanted<br/>
to share this scenario with  you all anyways---just because I like to<br/>
blab.<br/>

<h3>Tetsu&#39;s other &quot;Brother&quot;</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-938758942">Thanks to PMK, we all know about Ichimura Tetsunosuke, Hijikata's page. <br/>
However, there is a second Shinsengumi member, close in age to Tetsu, who <br/>
also never left Hijikata's side: Nagashima Gorosaku.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.jp/ishin_kan/bekkan/nagasima.html">http://www.geocities.jp/ishin_kan/bekkan/nagasima.html</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/nagasima.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/nagasima.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
As drawn by Shinsengumi member and artist Nakajima Nobori. Nobori says in <br/>
the picture "Nagashima Gorosaku, killed at age 18. Originally from Awa, he <br/>
followed Hijikata from the Kyoto days on, going to Ezo. Meiji 2, from the <br/>
4th to the 5th month, he fought the enemy countless times at Futamata. 5th <br/>
month, 11th day, he was killed in battle." The site that the picture is <br/>
posted on adds: "Born Ka'ei 5, in Awa. In the 6th month of Keio 3, he joined <br/>
Shinsengumi. Fought at Toba-Fushimi, and escaped to Edo, then went to Aizu, <br/>
and escaped to Ezo via Sendai. Fought at the battle of Futamataguchi, but <br/>
because he was attached to Hijikata and not Shinsengumi at the time, this <br/>
cannot be credited to Shinsengumi. Killed in action in the defense of <br/>
Hakodate on 5/11/Meiji 2"<br/>
<br/>
So he was probably an older brother figure to Ichimura Tetsunosuke, <br/>
particularly in the last days. Unlike Tetsu, however, he stayed with <br/>
Hijikata, and paid the price.<br/>
<br/>
Such is war.<br/>
