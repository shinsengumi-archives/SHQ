<br/>
I also went through a HUGE 3 volume set of books about the evolution <br/>
of the Japanese police system "Keishicho shi" by Keishichoshi Hensan <br/>
(official history)...<br/>
there are drawings, and grainy photos from the Meiji era and photos <br/>
of every TMPD chief since Toshiyoshi/Toshinaga Kawaji.  Photos of <br/>
the fire and earthquake disasters in Tokyo and drawings of <br/>
uniforms,medals, hats and western style sabres.  Interestingly, <br/>
there seems to be a couple of drawings of what looked <br/>
like "Rokumeikan" scenes....hmmm I figure police officials attended <br/>
those dances as well.  As you guys know from my previous posts the <br/>
TMPD had guys in the Imperial Guard which escorted members of the <br/>
royal family from point A to point B.  There were plenty of <br/>
entourage photos.  Many of the drawings we've seen are 100% accurate <br/>
down to the uniforms of the security on horseback.  The book even <br/>
included a side by side comparison of hand drawings and photos.  The <br/>
drawings were able to show alot of detail compared to the grainy <br/>
photos. One interesting photo of a cop trying to hold back dozens of <br/>
rioters I think.  Lots of stuff on the different buildings and <br/>
headquarters.  Humorous drawing of a cop shining a light on a group <br/>
of people.  Some people were "evil", they had smirking animal-like <br/>
faces, while some were "good", they were 100% human.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>yh1-- Emperor Koumei's handwriting, conferring third court rank on <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori.<br/>
yh2-- wakizashi<br/>
yh3-- Various Kyoto-related papers from Genji 1, 7th month (circa Ikedaya <br/>
Incident time). Picture of Matsudaira Katamori taken on Bunkyu 3 (1863), 8th <br/>
month, 5th day-- right around the time he got the orders to go to Kyoto.<br/>
yh4-- Not sure-- a written memorial, perhaps? Far right, lower right hand <br/>
corner, says "Minamoto Katamori" (keep in mind the Tokugawa/Matsudaira <br/>
claimed Minamoto descent), and the far lower left-hand corner has Yamakawa's <br/>
name.<br/>
