<h3>[off-topic] Takagi Morinusuke</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734293281">I recalled reading a short comedy by a fan featuring Tokio and her <br/>
brother Goro (later known as Morinusuke).  <br/>
<br/>
For many years in both Japan's Shinsengumi fandom and here in the <br/>
west Takagi Goro (Morinusuke) is noted as a messenger for Aizu troops <br/>
during the siege in 1868 and he is even portrayed as one in the old <br/>
television miniseries BYAKKOTAI.  We know samurai woman Yamamoto <br/>
Yae taught many of the young men how to use guns and it was Yae who <br/>
told us Tokio cut her hair.  Other than those details from the Boshin War <br/>
we know Morinusuke was close to Fujita Goro who taught kenjutsu to <br/>
the former's sons.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in a new details (to us) about Morinusuke you can <br/>
read this post:<br/>

it tells of Yamamoto Yae and Takagi Goro providing enough suppressing <br/>
fire against the invading Imperial army to prevent their advance.<br/>
<br/>
You have to keep in mind that Takagi was fifteen years old.</div>
