<h3>Jo Odagiri Interview</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473307254">TV Navi magazine, July issue "special-edition "Shinsengumi!" men's DRAMATIC <br/>
STORY" <br/>
Odagiri Jo:Hajime Saito<br/>
<br/>
[What makes the charm of this drama for me is Mr. Mitani's scenario above <br/>
all]<br/>
<br/>
The most impressive episode for me is the first one, in which showing every <br/>
members gathered, then the drama went back to the past in order to show their <br/>
life in Edo. When I saw those members fully equipped for the first time, I've <br/>
got an idea about the group called Shinsengumi.<br/>
Although half a year has passed, I maintain a certain distance from the <br/>
personage of Hajime Saitou to portray him as he has somewhat mysterious image.<br/>
<br/>
Hajime Saitou has few historical record. I picked up as possible as I could, <br/>
an outline or a fragment of the man from these restricted information to <br/>
create my own image of him.<br/>
Of course Mr. Mitani has given me many suggestion about the role, though I <br/>
dare not tell about it as I'd like to respect the imagination of the audience.<br/>
<br/>
In Ikedaya incident, Saitou takes another action within Hijikata's unit <br/>
again, and he is slipping now in and now out of sight. Since he doesn't go along <br/>
with other members most of time(laugh). <br/>
After this incident, Saitou will go to the direction of his espionage <br/>
activity from now on. <br/>
Which side his real intention is, on Kondo or Kashitaro Itou? I want to play <br/>
with an ambiguous touch toward the so called "Aboura no Kouji incident". <br/>
Hajime Saito's keyword would be"the ambiguity". <br/>
<br/>
The attraction of Saitou's swordplay is its fierceness, and I think it's <br/>
better to don't mind about any specific sword style he would have. I think I can <br/>
do anything if he would be strong. I care about how I interpret the <br/>
choreography given by the sub-director of sword fight scenes.<br/>
As I know that historical Saitou excels in thrust, I asked the sub-director <br/>
to give me more sword fight with this technique.<br/>
<br/>
What makes the charm of this drama for me is Mr. Mitani's scenario above all.<br/>
I read his script each time with pleasure. Since it finally becomes about 50 <br/>
volumes. I'm glad only by thinking that 50 scripts of Mr. Mitani can be got.<br/>
