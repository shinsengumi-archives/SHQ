My own pet project which began a really long time ago (still <br/>
incomplete)<br/>

I still need to revise some stuff but now I have a general idea on <br/>
Meiji era law enforcement and insight into the careers of MIKI, and <br/>
Fujita Goro (some portions are still in "note" format)<br/>
<br/>
***from the info I documented you would feel that alot of the laws <br/>
were oppressive and pried into the daily lives of citizens...that's <br/>
true but according to the diary of Dr. Baelz up until 1879 he felt <br/>
that the laws in Japan compared to those in his native Germany were <br/>
not troubling...Dr. Baelz somehow managed to keep up with things <br/>
like censorship laws, the decreasing value of paper currency and <br/>
gold. I have to note that Toshiyoshi Kawaji died in 1879 and in the <br/>
1880s alot of changes will occur due to Yamagata Aritomo's increase <br/>
in political power.<br/>

50% done music vid (^_^) so the latter half has no footage and yes <br/>
it is primitive I don't have access to high end movie editing <br/>
programs...so it is a slide show and animated frame by frame (-_-)<br/>
