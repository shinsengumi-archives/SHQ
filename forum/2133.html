<h3>Police + Prison (need help on the prison part)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-624665162">I am making this dissertation by Naoyuki Umemura (University of <br/>
Chicago graduate now at Waseda Univ.) available to the group.   Just <br/>
so you know dissertations (their are at least dozens dealing with <br/>
every aspect of the Meiji Era) are available in PDF form via <br/>
dissertation databases (available at all college/university library <br/>
databases).<br/>
<br/>
I had this paper for several months now but I would like someone to <br/>
consider summarizing pages 159 to 206 which deals with the <br/>
Tokugawa "Benevolent Prisons" and Meiji Era prison system (there is <br/>
also a chapter at the end called Hokkaido as a space for exodus). <br/>
<br/>
Just like the police system many aspects of the Tokugawa era are <br/>
carried over into the "modern" period and I guarantee that you will <br/>
come across some very interesting information.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in junior high or high school *please DO NOT be <br/>
intimidated the reading is VERY VERY easy and this is your chance to <br/>
expose yourself to the kind of writing advanced students do.<br/>
<br/>
*as you guys know I am researching the Meiji Era police system just <br/>
because....I'm weird (and I find it to be a good "template" for <br/>
understanding the rise of the modern nation state for other <br/>
countries, I specialize in Thailand actually) oh and I think we can <br/>
actually follow the careers of Miki and Fujita G. in an organized <br/>
manner.<br/>

<br/>
and yes you can download it without actually summarizing the prison <br/>
part for us (-_-) I'm hoping someone will *volunteer* though (^_^).  <br/>
POOR Nagakura...he needs a loyal fangirl.<br/>

It's part of the Nissan Institute white paper series...  found it while researching Kawaji.<br/>

 I also have some info, somewhat anecdotal, on the Tokugawa prison system.... from Charles Dunn's text "EVeryday Life in Traditional Japan."   Unfortunately he doesn't provide references in the text.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839135631">Thanks! Sherlgirl I will download it and read it.<br/>
Yes, the koban system is very unique but it seems, according to the <br/>
texts I have read, to be undergoing major changes in terms of its <br/>
effectiveness.  And imagine the koban back in the Meiji Era!  The <br/>
koban system remains in modern times because of the narrow streets <br/>
and extremely densely populated areas.  It is more efficient <br/>
to "spread out" law enforcement rather than have one big police <br/>
station and dispatch personel.  Koban cops are often the first <br/>
responders in all situations.  Not surprisingly foreign students in <br/>
Japan are encouraged to find out where their local koban is located <br/>
should they need assistance.<br/>
some references to Kawaji are in the books/sources here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/NSNR/NOsleepNOrest_Bibliography.htm">http://1happyturtle.com/NSNR/NOsleepNOrest_Bibliography.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
alot of Kawaji's writings are quoted *slightly* out of context and <br/>
certain things like how Kawaji may have distorted information <br/>
regarding the French model to push some his own ideas. Not all of <br/>
Kawaji's writings have been translated into English.<br/>
<br/>
I have alot of ****interesting koban stories from western researchers <br/>
who shadowed koban officers.<br/>
<br/>
I think if the Shinsengumi are "modernized" in terms of fiction...you <br/>
do not get punished with KINSHIN...you get punished by being sent to <br/>
be a koban officer and have to spend your whole day babysitting lost <br/>
children, give directions and go door to door collecting information <br/>
from people in your jurisdiction.  Because all rookies have to work a <br/>
koban for a while.  Imagine chatty PMK Nagakura sent to a koban (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I have to double check Fujita Goro's timeline but since he held the <br/>
rank of sergeant at one point his job was actually to supervise koban <br/>
in his jurisdiction.  BAck in that era, criminals were picked up and <br/>
escorted to the big police stations by sergeants.  They had their <br/>
hands tied and the officer would hold one end of the rope (there is a <br/>
quick scene in the film LADY SNOW BLOOD the last episode of the <br/>
series).<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-934023702">Does anyone know the name of the prison on Hokkaido where Nagakura<br/>
Shinpachi (Sugimura Yoshitaro) was employed during the Meiji?<br/>
<br/>
If we can just get the name of the prison and a estimate of his years<br/>
there it shouldn't be too hard to piece together his daily life during<br/>
the Meiji (sort of like how the research on Takagi/Fujita Tokio was<br/>
conducted).<br/>
<br/>
For example, this is a description of a low security prison at Yezo<br/>
Hokkaido<br/>

<br/>
If anyone would like to research Nagakura in the Meiji by using his<br/>
career as a guide please try to get<br/>
Umemori, Naoyuki. "Modernization Through Colonial Mediations: The<br/>
Establishment of the Police and Prison System in Meiji Japan" DISS<br/>
University of Chicago 2002 <br/>
<br/>
if anyone is really serious about "adopting" Nagakura (^_^) please let<br/>
me know I think I can get a pdf copy of this dissertation, I have a<br/>
hardcopy which I'm using for the police research.<br/>
