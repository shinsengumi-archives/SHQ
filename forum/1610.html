you'll find a whole mess of images I've captured from the NHK drama, <br/>
Mibugishiden and a couple films starring some of the NHK actors, notably <br/>
Koichi Sato/Serizawa and Shosuke Tanihara/Itou.  Saizou the pig from PMK <br/>
snuck in there as did that freaky cat who was hanging around Maro...<br/>
<br/>
You will also find<br/>
<br/>
The great Hijikata singing clip, a ZIP file (named: 001.zip) that <br/>
contains some very nice NHK actor shots, and some NHK Ikedaya raid stuff <br/>
(commercial clips and a wallpaper (All courtesy of Tama--what would we <br/>
do without you Tama???)<br/>
<br/>
And a clip of the famed Mibugishiden "We're Shinsengumi,We Have Business <br/>
Here!"scene---courtesy of Alan (I believe this is also in our group <br/>
files section)<br/>
