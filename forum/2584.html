<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140238391">So here I am, new fan.  I love the Shinsengumi and have ever since I <br/>
first saw Rurouni Kenshin--any version of them is fine by me, but I <br/>
like Kaze Hikaru and the NHK Shinsengumi a lot . . . anyway, hi there <br/>
everyone!  Okita Souji is the best!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935877200">Welcome, and hello from Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
I am so incredibly tired after touring today, but I managed to get a good <br/>
amount of Shinsengumi stuff, including a banner and a figurine of Kondo <br/>
Isami.<br/>
<br/>
The Okita Soji lighters were really cool looking, but I didn&#39;t get one. <br/>
Maybe next time...<br/>
