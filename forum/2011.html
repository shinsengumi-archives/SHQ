<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-212937918">Was looking through old information I had saved from www.bakusin.com, and I <br/>
found this interesting tidbit: if I&#39;m understanding the Japanese correctly, <br/>
Nakano Takeko&#39;s haiku pen name was &quot;Kotake&quot;.<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-2011">&gt;</a> New Aizu information</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806268529">I have begun work on what I hope will be my senior thesis-- a biography of <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori. Discovered some details almost as soon as I began my <br/>
research this morning, so I thought I&#39;d share it with you all. It really <br/>
changed how I look at the whole situation.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just read in &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot; (history book) <br/>
that the whole<br/>
reason why Aizu was called to Kyoto (and why Shinsengumi and Mimawarigumi<br/>
were formed) was literally for riot control. The assassinations got SO bad<br/>
that the Shoshidai and the Machi-bugyosho (city magistrate, almost like the<br/>
police department) couldn&#39;t handle it. So the Shogunate got Aizu to go there<br/>
and restore order. Katamori-sama got the order in the 8th month of Bunkyu 2<br/>
(1862), and arrived in Kyoto in the 12th month, which translates to roughly<br/>
January 1863, I believe. They were able to restore order, but what really<br/>
helped Aizu was the Roushitai showing up in early 1863, and Kondou and co.<br/>
deciding they were going to stay and fight for the Shogunate. Hence the<br/>
rapid Aizu support.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s more, I think we should also keep in mind that Aizu regarded<br/>
Shinsengumi as sort of &quot;spare parts&quot;-- Katamori-sama wanted a way of taking<br/>
care of the dissident roushi (unemployed rebel samurai), so what he did was<br/>
fight fire with fire by using his OWN set of roushi, which was none other<br/>
than the Mibu-roushigumi (aka Shinsengumi).<br/>

&quot;The Kidotai: Mobile Task Force of Japan&quot;<br/>
by R.Y. Thornton THE POLICE CHIEF v 38 July 1971<br/>
<br/>
page 72<br/>
&quot;On occasion the Kidotai have used a single weak central force <br/>
(scarecrow battalion) which is assigned to guard a fixed installation <br/>
such as the United States Embassy or the Prime Minister&#39;s residence <br/>
as a holding unit, while keeping other units *out*of*sight* until <br/>
called to perform the pincers or enveloping forces.  This is <br/>
sometimes referred to as the Manaita or cutting board tactic.  In <br/>
essence this means that the defensive or holding unit is acting as <br/>
the cutting block to receive the brunt of the attack in front of the <br/>
installation, while the pincers forces, having much greater strength, <br/>
perform the decisive maneuver against the attacking force.  There has <br/>
been some difficulty in convincing the members of the defensive <br/>
manaita unit that they should be the force assigned to bear the brunt <br/>
of the vicious attack and even retreat in the face of overwhelming <br/>
attack by the rioters, and then have the glory go to the pincers or <br/>
flank attackers (kyogeki) who deliver the coup de grace.<br/>
<br/>
An important tactic is to capture as rapidly as possible the <br/>
leaders...Kidotai has learned through years of experience that the <br/>
strongest element of a riot group is the front line or point of the <br/>
group and that the weakest is the rear&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*I would also like to add that students also love to use distractions <br/>
such as attacking one building...and another group attacking the main <br/>
target (e.g. important building on a university campus)<br/>
<br/>
*like the Shinsengumi vs. Ishin...Kidotai are usually the same exact <br/>
age group as the students they suppress<br/>
<br/>
*kidotai do not carry guns which greatly reduce the number of <br/>
injuries on both sides of the conflict<br/>
<br/>
This is not entirely off-topic because<br/>
1) I read a really long time ago (using a translator ofcourse) of <br/>
Shinsengumi &quot;death squads&quot; which lured out the enemy, once their true <br/>
numbers are revealed then back up is called *if this is innaccurate <br/>
please correct me* ....I think that it would be to the advantage of <br/>
the Tokugawa to capture the brains of any meeting e.g. as seen in the <br/>
Raid on Ikedaya<br/>
<br/>
2) pincer movements used to give the enemy a false sense of <br/>
confidence and the subsequent trap has been used throughout history <br/>
in [many] conflicts...the Imperial troops in the Seinan War used this <br/>
tactic ALOT every text I read about the war will mention this fact<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m  interested in  riot police because in my city....we have really <br/>
huge Halloween parties with THOUSANDS of drunken students (from out <br/>
of state ofcourse) who hang out in the downtown area  who trash <br/>
stores and start huge bonfires and the police cannot deal with the <br/>
problem (these are not organized students)...our riot police is <br/>
basically 10-20 armored cops in a line who use tear gas RIGHT <br/>
AWAY....rioters are not afraid of cops on horses either...injuries <br/>
and complaints always follow this yearly *celebration*</div>
