<h3>Harada & Nagakura</h3>

<br/>
According to fictional sources at least, the great duo of the <br/>
Shinsengumi appears to have been Harada and Nagakura. Movies and manga <br/>
often shown in association with one another. Historically this is <br/>
slightly backed up by the fact they were both on the list of those <br/>
protesting against Kondo and by the fact that they both left the <br/>
Shinsengumi after a disagreement with their boss following the defeat <br/>
at Kofu.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is, what is your favorite portrayal of the two? What <br/>
was your least favorite protrayal? And of all those who have (or could) <br/>
play the roles of the 2nd and 10th captains, what actors would you most <br/>
like to see bringing this famous friendship to life?<br/>

&gt; Oooh... that&#39;s hard to say.  I would say PeaceMaker<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kurogane.  I mean, they really share a bond,<br/>
especially in Kurogane when Nakagura, Shinpatchi, and<br/>
Harada are known as the &#39;Comedic Trio&#39;.  Their<br/>
characters prefectly balance each other out.  The<br/>
short Nakagura is smart and seems to know what he&#39;s<br/>
talking about while Harada... is not.  LOL<br/>
