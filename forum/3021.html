<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893256457">I&#39;ve started writing the Todou article on Wikipedia. Here&#39;s the current version with <br/>
citations.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
Todo Heisuke (1844 - December 13, 1867) was the eighth unit captain of the <br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
==Background==<br/>
Todo was from Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo). Very little is known about his origin. <br/>
Although he was said to be an illegitimate child of a feudal lord, it is debatable. <br/>
(Yamamura, 179-180)<br/>
<br/>
Todo was a practitioner of the Hokushin Itto-ryu, trained at Chiba Shusaku Narimasa&#39;s <br/>
dojo. (Yamamura, 181) However, according to some sources, he was trained at Ito <br/>
Kashitar?&#39;s dojo instead. (Yamamura, 182)<br/>
<br/>
In around 1862, he started &quot;taking his meals&quot; at Kondou Isami&#39;s Shieikan.(Nagakura, 20<br/>
-21)<br/>
<br/>
==Shinsengumi Period==<br/>
In 1863, Todo joined the Roshigumi with Kondo and other members of the Shieikan. <br/>
(Yamamura, 185) After the Shinsengumi was formed, Todo first became a fukuchou jokin <br/>
(assistant vice commander) and then became the captain of the eighth unit in 1865. <br/>
(Yamamura, 186)<br/>
<br/>
Todo received a wound on his forehead during the Ikedaya Jiken on July 8, 1864. <br/>
(Yamamura, 177)<br/>
<br/>
==Death==<br/>
Todo was killed during the Aburakoji Affair on December 13, 1867.(Yamamura, 189)<br/>
<br/>
According to Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&quot;, Kondo had wished to spare <br/>
Todo&#39;s life. (Nagukura, 144) However, Todo was killed by a new member, Miura <br/>
Tsunesaburo, whom did not know the circumstances. (Nagakura, 145)<br/>
