Yamazaki Susumu's Record book was discovered a while back....RECORD <br/>
book...not secret *diary* ^_^<br/>
<br/>
again Tama took pity on us and gave a quick summary of *how this <br/>
valuable book was brought to light<br/>
<br/>
A man who's ancestor was a merchant in Osaka brought this. In this <br/>
family, tradition said that Kondo leave some pack to the family when <br/>
they left western region.<br/>
<br/>
And it said a journal was included in that package.<br/>
And a brother of that man brought that paper to Hino.<br/>
<br/>
that's all we know right now</div>
