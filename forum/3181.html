<div id="ygrps-yiv-811531398">Hello,<br/>
that was a site I created a long time ago.  All our info on Nakajima <br/>
Nobori is now here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/nakajimabio.html">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/nakajimabio.html</a><br/>
(images are offline because we are reorganizing the server right now) <br/>
but you can still read his bio just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I also made a tribute video to Nobori here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/shinsengumi/NAKAJIMA_0001.wmv">http://1happyturtle.com/shinsengumi/NAKAJIMA_0001.wmv</a><br/>
<br/>
This page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/nakajimastudio.html">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/nakajimastudio.html</a><br/>
has the rough translation of the image you are referring as well as <br/>
information on other paintings (Hirotada Tokugawa translated them). <br/>
However that page was pulled offline for reformatting (basically we <br/>
need to get the code a certain way to allow the database to pick up <br/>
keywords).  Sorry for the inconvenience everyone, but I have to take <br/>
my orders from the programmer, she does the sophisticated stuff and <br/>
do the grunt work.  I have asked her to keep pages online but she has <br/>
a different work style etc etc<br/>
<br/>
The painting is of Yamaguchi Jiro (we know him as SAitou Hajime).  <br/>
Yamaguchi Jiro led the Shinsengumi in the defense of Aizu.  Ofcourse <br/>
Hijikata Toshizo was the official leader, however due to a foot <br/>
injury Yamaguchi had to step up and take charge.  Later on after <br/>
Hijikata and many SHinsengumi had to depart, Yamaguchi Jiro and a <br/>
handful of Shinsengumi stayed behind.  Nakajima Nobori mentioned on <br/>
the painting that Yamaguchi Jiro had DIED in Aizu---this is ofcourse <br/>
innaccurate (^_^).  You see "Yama" (mountain) on his jacket.  <br/>
Yamaguchi Jiro later changes his name to Fujita Goro (his last name)<br/>
<br/>
Nakajima Nobori's art is also now a tattoo!<br/>
