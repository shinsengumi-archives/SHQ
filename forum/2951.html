<h3>Re: Kondou/Kondo and the Kobusho</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-757821704">Thank you to k kobayakawa and Seven regarding this detail about Kondo<br/>
and the Kobusho.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the Shinsengumi legacy was their very mixed demographics as<br/>
ronin/roshi, or non-samurai, and then their elevation in rank once<br/>
they were sanctioned in Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
I think that there is overwhelming evidence that during that era in<br/>
Japan, certain areas had a high degree of &quot;social blending&quot;. All the<br/>
facts to prove this comes from studies on rural peasant communities in<br/>
Edo---even more specifically TAma/Hino regions! (this may point to how<br/>
some of the top members of the Shinsengumi grew up with the<br/>
&quot;possibility&quot; that they too could be samurai).<br/>
<br/>
However in the &quot;formal&quot; or administrative world of the bakufu the same<br/>
strict protocol on social class was still observed. It was the<br/>
inflexibility of the bakufu in certain areas of its system which made<br/>
it weak. Note, the bakufu was making several changes during that era too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really interested in how the Shinsengumi and Kiheitai (Choshu)<br/>
shared something similar---[[[mixed social classes]]].<br/>
<br/>
Something which has bothered me about resaerch into this era is that<br/>
several books written by western writers say somthing along the lines<br/>
&quot;the Choshu Kiheitai {Takasugi&#39;s Strange/Surprise, Irregular or<br/>
extraordinary Corps} demonstrated that they were willing to admit<br/>
commoners into the military role of the samurai and their use of<br/>
western technology showed how forward thinking they were&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
During the Meiji Era, westerners who just entered into the now<br/>
enlightened Japan (according to their measurement of what was modern),<br/>
saw the Kiheitai as the exact opposite of the bakufu military force. <br/>
To the westerners, the Kiheitai were the essence of the revolution.  <br/>
<br/>
Simply, they were defined as being the common man who rose up against<br/>
the system.<br/>
<br/>
Without looking ***deeper they interpreted the detail as an attempt to<br/>
start an egalitarian military movement and the Kiheitai was viewed as<br/>
a precursor to universal conscription (thanks to fellow Choshu samurai<br/>
Yamagata Aritomo during the Meiji). Basically, the west wanted to see<br/>
in Japan the same values they treasured---universal ideals, however<br/>
they disregarded key details.<br/>
<br/>
They overlooked how the bakufu was already incorporating French<br/>
training into their ranks (since they measure progress/modernity with<br/>
who has better weapons of mass destruction).  <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, <br/>
<br/>
The Kiheitai commoners<br/>
1) had to dress differently<br/>
2) were treated differently (however they had to still act under<br/>
samurai rules)<br/>
3) their leaders were lower ranking samurai<br/>
4) only at most 40% (or even less than that) of the 292 Kiheitai<br/>
members as of 1864 were were actually peasants &quot;which makes it<br/>
difficult to call the Kiheitai a peasant unit&quot; (Hackett 26)<br/>
5) they were supported financially by the Choshu domain --however-- <br/>
&quot;merchants and farmers were also permitted to join---and used funds<br/>
supplied by merchants for part of its expense&quot; (Hackett 25)---in fact<br/>
Takasugji mentioned a wealthy merchant, Yamashita Shishinojo of Gofuku<br/>
village &quot;as a possible source of financial support&quot; (Hackett 25).<br/>
<br/>
-If- the Kiheitai *did not take money from commoners, would they still<br/>
feel obligated to take in those from the lower classes? Remember,<br/>
Kondo and Hijikata had rich elite peasants buddies (one was a sworn<br/>
brother of Kondo) who also gave them gifts too.  <br/>
See<br/>
The Farmers of Edo and the Warriors in Kyoto<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
So I guess, I meandered off topic to compare the Shinsengumi mixed<br/>
social classes with that of the Kiheitai.  <br/>
<br/>
I ask, if the researchers from the west see the Kiheitai as a sure<br/>
sign of &quot;social progress&quot; how come they never took the same idea and<br/>
looked at the bakufu&#39;s guys...namely the Shinsengumi. So they should<br/>
analyze the Shinsengumi the same way too, did they make members from<br/>
the low class dress different, act different and so forth?<br/>
<br/>
Or have they missed the obvious:  The bottom line---It wasn&#39;t about<br/>
&quot;equality&quot; it was about getting guys to fight/die for them.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever possible, higher ups had no problem with exploiting people<br/>
who bought into social stratification (remember 99.9% of people were<br/>
raised in the system) and wanted to climb the ladder to make a better<br/>
future for themselves.<br/>
