<h3>Nagakura and Harada&#39;s secession</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127559103">Thank you for your welcome messages!<br/>
<br/>
In only book I have now with me called &quot;Shinsengumi Jitsuroku&quot;(Authentic <br/>
records of Shinsengumi), author gives an interesting analys about Nagakura and <br/>
Harada&#39;s secession after retreat from Koshu.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a resume.<br/>
<br/>
*Nagakura and Harada understand that Kondo transfered them the right to <br/>
command  during the retreat. And Nagakura make a proposal to march toward Aizu with <br/>
current troop strength.<br/>
*Nagakura who considers Kondo always as his fellow, is offended to see Kondo, <br/>
now became a direct vassal of Shogun of 300 koku.<br/>
*Kondo probably thinks it would be better to recrute more solders and after <br/>
training, he&#39; ll go to Aizu with them as the Supreme Commander.<br/>
*So their discordant is due to different strategic point of view as well as <br/>
their sentimental confrict.<br/>
<br/>
I have no intenion to idealize Kondo, may be he became little bit haughty, <br/>
but it was a point of view of Nagakura&#39;s side.<br/>
As I know similer condition in the history, I guesse what might be happened <br/>
in a defeated army. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8395951">First of all, welcome, Tama-san ^^ Yoroshiku ^^ It&#39;s<br/>
great to see a Japanese on this list, as it will only<br/>
enrich more the discussion ^^<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty interesting, since in Nagakura&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&quot; he says explicitly that they<br/>
parted ways because Kondo wanted to accept Nagakura<br/>
and Harada&#39;s proposal if and only if he (Kondo) would<br/>
be the supreme commander and the others would have to<br/>
be his vassals (&quot;kerai&quot;), without mentioning anything<br/>
on this strategic point of view.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the Bunkyu Roshi Shimatsuki (don&#39;t<br/>
remember if this was the correct name...) to check<br/>
this info, though. The Tenmatsuki is just too<br/>
novelized for my liking to be considered a trustworthy<br/>
source of info. I prefer Shinsengumi Shimatsuki and<br/>
Ibun in this aspect.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps...<br/>
<br/>
btw, changing the subject:<br/>
<br/>
1) Sesshu (Setsutsu) sumi Ikeda Kijinmaru Kunishige:<br/>
Kunishige is the name of the swordsmith. Sesshu is the<br/>
name of the place. This is a sword forged in the Tenwa<br/>
Era and, as of 1986, it was worth about 50,000 US<br/>
dollars. <br/>
<br/>
It is a Shinto (newer than Koto and older than<br/>
Shin-Shinto), classified as Jo-josaku (2nd highest<br/>
class in the aesthetical aspect) and as a Wazamono<br/>
(4th highest class in the blade sharpness aspect).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
2) For those who like old anime, try finding an old<br/>
anime (from the 80&#39;s) called Haguregumo, produced by<br/>
Mad House. It features the Shinsengumi. I haven&#39;t<br/>
watched it, but I&#39;ve seen some screenshots of it and<br/>
it&#39;s gorgeous, mixing sumi-e and ukiyo-e to draw<br/>
scenes and background.<br/>
<br/>
3) Nagakura Shinpachi has lots of interesting tales...<br/>
the Kashiku pleasure woman thing, the murder of Haga<br/>
Gido (Yoshimichi?), the incident where he drank too<br/>
much with Saitou Hajime and Itou Kashitarou and was<br/>
almost condemned to death, the Ryubi no Ken incident<br/>
where he got wounded below the eye, the failed attempt<br/>
of murder of Kiyokawa Hachiro and others that were<br/>
already listed and/or discussed here, like the meeting<br/>
with Suzuki Mikisaburo. :)<br/>
<br/>
4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider<br/>
Saigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also<br/>
plenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo<br/>
Takamori, who could have understood the plea of<br/>
Yamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed in<br/>
Edo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were<br/>
good men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin side,<br/>
as well as bad men in both, IMHO :)<br/>

<br/>
And just possibly Saigou is an example of how a man could be both good AND bad... a human condition.  Unless you can give me some good evidence to the contrary (and you&#39;re probably one person who can), I will go on thinking he had a role in Sagara Souzou&#39;s demise.  And certainly there is no offense meant on my part... the times were incredibly difficult, confusing, and deeply emotional.  It&#39;s amazing to me just how much more deeply I feel about certain people and ideas during the bakumatsu and Restoration than I feel for my own country&#39;s revolution.  It&#39;s weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854550628">Sword gradings....so painfully complicated :)...<br/>
Anime from the 80s rarely get licensed in the U.S. :( but is sounds<br/>
really really good...this title and Kon Ichikawa&#39;s Shinsengumi should<br/>
be available to the public!<br/>
Saitou+Itou+Nagakura drinking...probably a perfect way to position<br/>
himself (Saitou) to get close to Itou before the Itou Affair...perhaps<br/>
Hijikata was aware of this too...and thought...Saitou is perfect for<br/>
this job since Itou trusts him...There was a Japanese post along time<br/>
ago and it was a question which babelfish translated as &quot;Fujita died a<br/>
drunkard?&quot; something along those lines<br/>
Phil, I bet Miki was there too...perhaps because he isn&#39;t an<br/>
&quot;important&quot; person he isn&#39;t mentioned...more reason for Miki to hate<br/>
Saitou...<br/>
<br/>
***don&#39;t we all wanna hear about the pleasure woman business LOL!<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
thinking about &quot;the last Shinsengumi&quot; and how he died in the<br/>
1930s...he was at Aizu...I wonder if wrote anything down or spoke to<br/>
people about his experiences...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516587362">From my own superficial research western scholars are sympathetic to <br/>
Saigo because what has been left behind, his poetry, and many images <br/>
of his son tugging at his clothes as he left for battle all of which <br/>
contribute to a very human image. <br/>
<br/>
In both books I skimmed through the writers were very touched by his <br/>
son&#39;s love---without recalling that thousands of men were in similar <br/>
positions of leaving families behind to fight this war.  <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the government has left behind paintings of Saigo <br/>
struggling in a hell-like environment and one painting was pretty <br/>
scary of a headless Saigo wielding a sword (his head flew threw the <br/>
air his eyes were red).  Thus, the government did its part in public <br/>
relations to demonize him.<br/>
<br/>
We all bring certain sensitivities to our study but people who have <br/>
published works forget a key element to the big picture---politics <br/>
is always a dirty game no matter how well-intentioned the person was <br/>
to start with and Saigo was involved with politics.  For example the <br/>
incident of the weapons seizure at Kagoshima as well as the build up <br/>
of potentially rebellious elements in the schools within the Satsuma <br/>
domain have been wildly interpreted...most opinions are extreme as <br/>
to whether it is fair to blame Saigo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447187223">So does anyone know where I can see screenshots of Haguregumo...a <br/>
good side effect of the commercialization of the Shinsengumi <br/>
could/should be the re-release of some of these obscure works.<br/>
I like old anime...I like the &quot;pre-computer&quot; feel of hand drawn <br/>
animation<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still angsting over the unreleased &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; animated film <br/>
by Kon Ichikawa (his best easy to find live action films are THE KEY <br/>
and BURMESE HARP)...and no its not a puppet show as mentioned <br/>
elsewhere on the internet he used paper &quot;dolls&quot; it seems and Kondo <br/>
looks just like historical Kondo!  And from the screenshots there <br/>
are beautiful shadows and stuff (not to mention that it shows the <br/>
Itou Affair).<br/>
