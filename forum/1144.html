<h3>Nagakura and Harada&#39;s secession</h3>
by <i>tamagot93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127559103">Thank you for your welcome messages!<br/>
<br/>
In only book I have now with me called "Shinsengumi Jitsuroku"(Authentic <br/>
records of Shinsengumi), author gives an interesting analys about Nagakura and <br/>
Harada's secession after retreat from Koshu.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a resume.<br/>
<br/>
*Nagakura and Harada understand that Kondo transfered them the right to <br/>
command  during the retreat. And Nagakura make a proposal to march toward Aizu with <br/>
current troop strength.<br/>
*Nagakura who considers Kondo always as his fellow, is offended to see Kondo, <br/>
now became a direct vassal of Shogun of 300 koku.<br/>
*Kondo probably thinks it would be better to recrute more solders and after <br/>
training, he' ll go to Aizu with them as the Supreme Commander.<br/>
*So their discordant is due to different strategic point of view as well as <br/>
their sentimental confrict.<br/>
<br/>
I have no intenion to idealize Kondo, may be he became little bit haughty, <br/>
but it was a point of view of Nagakura's side.<br/>
As I know similer condition in the history, I guesse what might be happened <br/>
in a defeated army. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8395951">First of all, welcome, Tama-san ^^ Yoroshiku ^^ It's<br/>
great to see a Japanese on this list, as it will only<br/>
enrich more the discussion ^^<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That's pretty interesting, since in Nagakura's<br/>
"Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki" he says explicitly that they<br/>
parted ways because Kondo wanted to accept Nagakura<br/>
and Harada's proposal if and only if he (Kondo) would<br/>
be the supreme commander and the others would have to<br/>
be his vassals ("kerai"), without mentioning anything<br/>
on this strategic point of view.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the Bunkyu Roshi Shimatsuki (don't<br/>
remember if this was the correct name...) to check<br/>
this info, though. The Tenmatsuki is just too<br/>
novelized for my liking to be considered a trustworthy<br/>
source of info. I prefer Shinsengumi Shimatsuki and<br/>
Ibun in this aspect.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps...<br/>
<br/>
btw, changing the subject:<br/>
<br/>
1) Sesshu (Setsutsu) sumi Ikeda Kijinmaru Kunishige:<br/>
Kunishige is the name of the swordsmith. Sesshu is the<br/>
name of the place. This is a sword forged in the Tenwa<br/>
Era and, as of 1986, it was worth about 50,000 US<br/>
dollars. <br/>
<br/>
It is a Shinto (newer than Koto and older than<br/>
Shin-Shinto), classified as Jo-josaku (2nd highest<br/>
class in the aesthetical aspect) and as a Wazamono<br/>
(4th highest class in the blade sharpness aspect).<br/>
<br/>
Source: "Touken Youran".<br/>
<br/>
2) For those who like old anime, try finding an old<br/>
anime (from the 80's) called Haguregumo, produced by<br/>
Mad House. It features the Shinsengumi. I haven't<br/>
watched it, but I've seen some screenshots of it and<br/>
it's gorgeous, mixing sumi-e and ukiyo-e to draw<br/>
scenes and background.<br/>
<br/>
3) Nagakura Shinpachi has lots of interesting tales...<br/>
the Kashiku pleasure woman thing, the murder of Haga<br/>
Gido (Yoshimichi?), the incident where he drank too<br/>
much with Saitou Hajime and Itou Kashitarou and was<br/>
almost condemned to death, the Ryubi no Ken incident<br/>
where he got wounded below the eye, the failed attempt<br/>
of murder of Kiyokawa Hachiro and others that were<br/>
already listed and/or discussed here, like the meeting<br/>
with Suzuki Mikisaburo. :)<br/>
<br/>
4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider<br/>
Saigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also<br/>
plenty of good and worthy man. Weren't for Saigo<br/>
Takamori, who could have understood the plea of<br/>
Yamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed in<br/>
Edo? That's just one example to show that there were<br/>
good men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin side,<br/>
as well as bad men in both, IMHO :)<br/>

You like cliffhangers, don't you, SK... :-D  Would you mind elaborating on that???  (And just where was the alcoholic little brother, I wonder...  was Suzuki already under the table (if that was even possible)?)<br/>

<br/>
And just possibly Saigou is an example of how a man could be both good AND bad... a human condition.  Unless you can give me some good evidence to the contrary (and you're probably one person who can), I will go on thinking he had a role in Sagara Souzou's demise.  And certainly there is no offense meant on my part... the times were incredibly difficult, confusing, and deeply emotional.  It's amazing to me just how much more deeply I feel about certain people and ideas during the bakumatsu and Restoration than I feel for my own country's revolution.  It's weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854550628">Sword gradings....so painfully complicated :)...<br/>
Anime from the 80s rarely get licensed in the U.S. :( but is sounds<br/>
really really good...this title and Kon Ichikawa's Shinsengumi should<br/>
be available to the public!<br/>
Saitou+Itou+Nagakura drinking...probably a perfect way to position<br/>
himself (Saitou) to get close to Itou before the Itou Affair...perhaps<br/>
Hijikata was aware of this too...and thought...Saitou is perfect for<br/>
this job since Itou trusts him...There was a Japanese post along time<br/>
ago and it was a question which babelfish translated as "Fujita died a<br/>
drunkard?" something along those lines<br/>
Phil, I bet Miki was there too...perhaps because he isn't an<br/>
"important" person he isn't mentioned...more reason for Miki to hate<br/>
Saitou...<br/>
<br/>
***don't we all wanna hear about the pleasure woman business LOL!<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
thinking about "the last Shinsengumi" and how he died in the<br/>
1930s...he was at Aizu...I wonder if wrote anything down or spoke to<br/>
people about his experiences...<br/>

<h3>Re: Nagakura and Harada&#39;s secession</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516587362">From my own superficial research western scholars are sympathetic to <br/>
Saigo because what has been left behind, his poetry, and many images <br/>
of his son tugging at his clothes as he left for battle all of which <br/>
contribute to a very human image. <br/>
<br/>
In both books I skimmed through the writers were very touched by his <br/>
son's love---without recalling that thousands of men were in similar <br/>
positions of leaving families behind to fight this war.  <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the government has left behind paintings of Saigo <br/>
struggling in a hell-like environment and one painting was pretty <br/>
scary of a headless Saigo wielding a sword (his head flew threw the <br/>
air his eyes were red).  Thus, the government did its part in public <br/>
relations to demonize him.<br/>
<br/>
We all bring certain sensitivities to our study but people who have <br/>
published works forget a key element to the big picture---politics <br/>
is always a dirty game no matter how well-intentioned the person was <br/>
to start with and Saigo was involved with politics.  For example the <br/>
incident of the weapons seizure at Kagoshima as well as the build up <br/>
of potentially rebellious elements in the schools within the Satsuma <br/>
domain have been wildly interpreted...most opinions are extreme as <br/>
to whether it is fair to blame Saigo.<br/>

here with me, but I recall that it was another Ishin<br/>
Shishi who ordered the attack on the Sekihoutai.<br/>

Serizawa Kamo<br/>
<br/>
And talking about songs...<br/>
<br/>
"Kamo no kawara ni chidori ga sawagu<br/>
Mata mo chi no ame namida ame<br/>
Bushi to iu na ni inochi wo kakete<br/>
Shinsengumi wa kyou mo iku"<br/>
<br/>
A VERY ROUGH translation:<br/>
"The birds are restless at the margins of the Kamo<br/>
river<br/>
Again, there is a rain of blood, a rain of tears<br/>
Betting their lives on the title of 'warrior'<br/>
the Shinsengumi goes today once again"<br/>
<br/>
(the only Shinsengumi song I've got so far, sung by<br/>
Mihachi Michiya)<br/>

<h3>Haguregumo</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447187223">So does anyone know where I can see screenshots of Haguregumo...a <br/>
good side effect of the commercialization of the Shinsengumi <br/>
could/should be the re-release of some of these obscure works.<br/>
I like old anime...I like the "pre-computer" feel of hand drawn <br/>
animation<br/>
<br/>
I'm still angsting over the unreleased "Shinsengumi" animated film <br/>
by Kon Ichikawa (his best easy to find live action films are THE KEY <br/>
and BURMESE HARP)...and no its not a puppet show as mentioned <br/>
elsewhere on the internet he used paper "dolls" it seems and Kondo <br/>
looks just like historical Kondo!  And from the screenshots there <br/>
are beautiful shadows and stuff (not to mention that it shows the <br/>
Itou Affair).<br/>
