<h3>Shinsengumi on film</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-431641729">I've started compiling a commentary section on the incarnations of the <br/>
Shinsengumi in movies and whatnot for the website (some of it is <br/>
up--link at end of message)<br/>
<br/>
So far it's just pictures and my personal take on how the characters are <br/>
their good points/flaws etc and if anyone has any comments to add please <br/>
send them to me here or offlist at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bsher213@...">bsher213@...</a><br/>

<h3>Shinsengumi on film</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902306371">Well okay so they weren't exactly portraying the Shinsengumi this time <br/>
around but if you get a chance  check out Battle Royale to see Tatsuya <br/>
Fujiwara and Tarou Yamamato, the actors who portray the NHK versions of <br/>
Okita and Harada and, as their sadistic teacher  Takeshi Kitano who was <br/>
the worst choice ever to play Hijikata (in Gohatto a/k/a/ Taboo).<br/>
<br/>
It's an interesting movie and once you get past the first sort of <br/>
introductory scene you really don't need the subtitles that much to know <br/>
what's going on.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend trying to get a hold of the sequel to The Ring/Ringu <br/>
featuring my personal favorite Koichi Sato. It's a bit bizarre but quite <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
I found those on eBay fairly cheaply.<br/>
<br/>
I'm considering that freaky sounding Bright Future film Tiffany <br/>
mentioned just to watch young Mr. Jo Odagiri (NHK Saitou). That movie <br/>
also features another Shinsengumi character --the one who was the Kano <br/>
kid's boyfriend in Gohatto.<br/>
