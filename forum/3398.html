Just finished a historical novel that I'd like to recommend to this site. The title is "The <br/>
Shogun's Gold" by Masayoshi Sato and is published by Kodansha. It is out of print but you can <br/>
pick up a used copy on Amazon for a really cheap price. The novel is set during the <br/>
Bakumatsu period and is about that period's exchange rate wars between the Bakufu and the <br/>
West. (I had read previously that according to many Japanese economist, it was the currency <br/>
war of this period that really underscored the end of  the Togugawa government)  What is <br/>
interesting is that the author chooses to tell the narrative through the eyes of Rutherford <br/>
Alcock, Britian's first counsel general to Japan. It is a most fascinating read. The novel is set <br/>
between the periods of March 1859 - December 1862. Two months later in February of <br/>
1863, Kiyokawa Hachiro left Edo for Kyoto with his 250 strong Roshi corp. And as we know, <br/>
while in Kyoto, 13 members of the Roshi broke rank with Kiyokawa and formed the <br/>
Shinsengumi. This historical novel provides a wonderful economic context to the political <br/>
intensity and  emotions that swirled in these times.<br/>
