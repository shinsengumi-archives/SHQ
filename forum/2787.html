<div id="ygrps-yiv-100846430">I just wanted to thank everyone for being there for me when I needed <br/>
information or just for someone to chat with. Everyone thats a member <br/>
on this group (I like to call it my clan) are loyal to each other just <br/>
like the orignal Shinsengumi were and in that way threw you guys I <br/>
have a lot of love for my clan. I&#39;m glad everyone liked my tattoo as <br/>
much as I do. I couldn&#39;t and maybe wouldn&#39;t have done it with out you <br/>
guys. Like I said I just wanted to take time out and thank you all for <br/>
your wisdom and help in the Shinsengumi world. May thier names never <br/>
be forgottan and may thier spirts live on. DOMO SHINSENGUMIhq <br/>
