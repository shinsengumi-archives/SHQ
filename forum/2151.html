<h3>Brats, cards, fanart, and what series is this?!</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-453643750">I recall seeing this a long time ago, but could never find it again <br/>
till tonight. Apparently there was a book or a series of some sort <br/>
about Hijikata when he was growing up in Ishida (about 15 years old) <br/>
called &quot;Baragaki&quot;. He was supposed to be a real brat in it. It must <br/>
have not gone over so well. Anyway, I finally found some reference to <br/>
the thing here:<br/>

<br/>
Also, it seems there must be (or there was) some sort of Shinsengumi <br/>
card game out there:<br/>

<br/>
This site had some pretty good fanart. Some of it was Takasugi and <br/>
I&#39;m not sure who the other guys were. The Hijikata pictures (# 3, 4, <br/>
and 7) were very well done. I think 3 edges the other two out a bit <br/>
though just from an emotional standpoint. Here&#39;s the url:<br/>

<br/>
And finally I came across reference to something called Hijikata <br/>
Toshizo: Shiru no Kiseki. Is this an anime or what?! One pic is <br/>
definitely Hijikata in Hakodate. There&#39;s no mistaking him:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565866829">About that last one, at least, it&#39;s an animated movie focusing on Hijikata. Apparently from the time he was a kid until Hakodate... it was also supposed to have some parts about the historical Ichimura Tetsunosuke IIRC. I first saw it in a post in the archives around here...<br/>

downloading trailers or most anything else with my lousy <br/>
connection... The name sounded familiar, but I&#39;ve never seen any <br/>
screenshots from it before that I recall. I&#39;m guessing the lttle boy <br/>
with the stick at the top is young Hijikata then?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The conversation is in French. <br/>
<br/>
I went through it and apparently, while talking about Studio 4C <br/>
latest production, someone mentionned &quot;Hijikata Toshizo : Shiru no <br/>
Kiseki&quot; saying that it is a a 32 minutes long OAV. He says that it <br/>
was made by Chie Uratani, a person who worked on : Kiki&#39;s Delivery <br/>
Service, Memories, Princess Arete and Animatrix.<br/>
<br/>
Then the person mentionned the official website <br/>
www.hijikatatoshizou.com saying that you can find a summary and <br/>
characters&#39;s descriptions there. Also, it is said that you can pre-<br/>
order the DVD via the website. I do not know if they took the <br/>
different zones into consideration when saying this...<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, the DVD comes with a bonus: &quot;Sore ike Kanesada-kun !&quot; <br/>
(25 minutes) and 10 minutes of other bonus.<br/>
<br/>
The first picture is the DVD cover, but there are no descriptions of <br/>
the following images.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the conversation shifts and &quot;Hijikata Toshizo : Shiru no <br/>
Kiseki&quot; is not mentionned again.<br/>
