<div id="ygrps-yiv-159053693">It was believed that Souji wrote this haiku--said to be the one and only he ever made in his life--on his deathbed:<br/>
   <br/>
  "Ugokaneba yami ni heda tsuya hana to mizu "<br/>
  ("If they don't move, they'll be parted by darkness: the flower and the water")<br/>
  <br/>
 <br/>
   ...which, quite curiously, compliments this haiku by another well-known member of the Shinsengumi:<br/>
   <br/>
  "Sashimukai kokoro wa kiyoi mizukagami" <br/>
  ("The heart facing mine is a clear reflecting pool")<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  Quizzie quizzie ^^ ...nope, not trying to insinuate anything XD just pointing out a popular observation.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-13024303">Kondou and Hijikata and a couple other Shinsengumi were poets however<br/>
finding their death poems is a bit difficult.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Hijikata, in <br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough, Romulus. Shinsengumi The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps.<br/>
Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 2005. <br/>
ISBN 0804836272 (there are used copies around you can buy, currently<br/>
this is the only book in English on the Shinsengumi)<br/>
<br/>
on page 173<br/>
<br/>
"Though my body may decay on the island of Ezo,<br/>
My spirit guards my lord in the east."<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough and others (Japanese websites) have stated that<br/>
"Hijikata's lord in the east was none other than the last shogun,<br/>
Tokugawa Yoshinobu" (Hillborough 173).<br/>
<br/>
you may want to try searching for other death poems (not yet<br/>
translated) by trying the major sites listed here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm</a><br/>
please use the online translators (which can only give you an "idea"<br/>
of the meaning) listed at the top of the page<br/>
<br/>
please feel free to share with us what you find too!  (^_^) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37083543">Kondou's death poem, transliterated:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kogun enketaete fushuu to nari<br/>
kun'on wo konen shite namida fururu<br/>
ippen no tansou yoku setsu ni junji<br/>
Shoyou wa senko korewaga chuu<br/>
hoka ni nabikite kyou mata nani wo ihamu<br/>
gi wo toriikiwo sutsuruwa waga toutobutokoro<br/>
kokoroyoi uku denkou sanjaku no ken<br/>
tada masa ni isshu wo motte kun'on ni mukimu<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All I have is the first two lines and the last two lines:<br/>
<br/>
"Encircled with [my] army, with no hope of rescue/<br/>
I look back on my lord's favor, and weep..."<br/>
<br/>
"...I will gladly welcome the lightning sword of three shaku/<br/>
but as long as I live, I swear to repay my lord's favor."<br/>
<br/>
Kondou was big on Chinese stories like "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms," <br/>
so that might be why he wrote such a long poem that seems more in the <br/>
Chinese style than in the Japanese style of a waka (Yes, most of the time <br/>
death poems were NOT haiku, they were waka...which have an additional 14 <br/>
syllables).<br/>
