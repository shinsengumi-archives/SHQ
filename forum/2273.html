<h3>Welcome New Members</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015466675">This post is an orientation to our lovely headquarters, please adhere<br/>
by  our rules and don't even ***think about stealing other people's<br/>
fundoshi just because you were too lazy to wash yours (this is<br/>
actually the Shinsengumi's secret unmentionable rule).  <br/>
<br/>
We are an open community so I am not writing to you NOT as the owner<br/>
of the list. EVERYONE is welcome (see no duels for admission) thus no<br/>
one exercises authority in rejecting posts or deem any questions to be<br/>
unimportant.  I just wanted to give an overview of our increasingly<br/>
VAST data warehouse.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  if you do no receive a reply to your question it is because<br/>
1) some of us are at work/school or both<br/>
2) we just don't know how to answer<br/>
3) we don't have access to the net...so never assume that because we<br/>
don't post right away we don't care --- that is not the case at all<br/>
DO however type in keywords to search the Messages<br/>
<br/>
This mailing list is specifically devoted to the Shinsengumi but many<br/>
other related topics can be discussed at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>
Examples of topics at the Messageboard (MB) are:  Aizu, the Meiji Era<br/>
and Movies.  We also encourage people who are knowledgeable about the<br/>
Shishi (Ishin shishi) to join us and share their knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
*those topics are all in one way or another related to the<br/>
Shinsengumi.  The Seinan War for instance was fought by the political<br/>
forces during the Boshin War and there was even a unit of soldiers<br/>
comprised of former members of the Shinsengumi (Fujita Goro was not in<br/>
this group).  The Aizu domain as a political entity was the direct<br/>
employer of the Shinsengumi and can become a basis for your own<br/>
understanding in appreciating how feudal domains *work.<br/>
<br/>
the MB is very flexible in terms of editing/deleting posts and<br/>
replies, more importantly you can quickly find posts by marking the<br/>
forum read or unread.  A makoto symbol will appear next to the forum<br/>
which has a new post since your last visit.  You must be a member to<br/>
post but you may browse the information as a guest.  You must also<br/>
LOGIN to use the mark forum read feature<br/>
<br/>
Over time many members have branched off into relate and relevant<br/>
fields such as the Sekihoutai (which comprised of former members of<br/>
the Shinsengumi)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/">http://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/</a><br/>
<br/>
The reason why we each gravitate to different topics is ofcourse due<br/>
to personal taste and the simple lack of English resources on the<br/>
Shinsengumi.  I myself have a university library at my disposal<br/>
however I have to work *AROUND* the topic to find info...and the info<br/>
is pretty interesting.  I don't know Japanese hence my strategy of<br/>
working with *side topics.  Many western scholars have neglected the<br/>
Bakumatsu and have preferred instead to focus on the Meiji Era.  Only<br/>
recently have researchers begun to study the Meiji Era critically.<br/>
<br/>
Those interested in the era leading up to the Bakumatsu should join<br/>
