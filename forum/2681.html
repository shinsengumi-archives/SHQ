<h3>Saitou/Tokio Updates & other stuff</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887671815"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>
look in the section "life as Saitou Hajime"<br/>
and there is a paragraph in blue which is linked to the new [chronology]<br/>
go to the year [1863] which concerns a document circulated amongst<br/>
Aizu officials--Hirotada Tokugawa translated this quote from Akama<br/>
Shizuko's book (all the citation stuff is on the page)<br/>
<br/>
what is a "metsuke"? and wasn't Tokio's daddy an O-metsuke?<br/>
to learn the difference please see the "career" chronology linked<br/>
right at the top of Saitou's chronology<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/NSNR.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/NSNR.htm</a><br/>
scroll down and look for Metsuke vs O-metsuke (they were not -always-<br/>
spies, for example during the Tokugawa mission to the USA, the metsuke<br/>
set curfews and hotel "lock downs" and were basically security guards,<br/>
they had many roles related to discipline)<br/>
<br/>
so many timelines!<br/>
yeah, see if I put SAitou's Meiji Chronology right on the page it<br/>
would look just as bad as Tokio's page<br/>
<br/>
what can we learn from the chronology? and can it be a background for<br/>
fiction?<br/>

see [1879] Goro and Tokio's 2nd son Tsuyoshi was born 4 days before<br/>
Goro received the Order of the Blue Paulownia and 100 yen for his<br/>
service during the Seinan War---thus those days were a bit "busy" for<br/>
the Fujitas<br/>
<br/>
look for the revolt of the IMperial Guard...this was a very important<br/>
and dangerous situation for the capital...again Fujita Goro would've<br/>
been totally aware of this...in 1887 people were banished from the<br/>
Tokyo---literally an order was sent for hundreds of people to GET OUT<br/>
OF TOKYO---you will see the Imperial Rescript (which totally affected<br/>
Tokio's sphere/career teachers did not ask for these laws--notice<br/>
again it is the military controlling all branches) <br/>
<br/>
similarly in the case of Tokio, her husband and brother were sent to<br/>
the Seinan War while she was a ***brand new mother---lots of stress there<br/>
<br/>

see the section on "EArly LIfe" with a paragraph translated by<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa---it shows that the Takagis have been O-metsuke for<br/>
GENERATIONS (*_*)----yet another fictional possibility---super spy<br/>
family LOL!!!<br/>

[Gohatto Trivia]<br/>
Can you identify all the characters in this pic?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/SakamotoRyuichi/ryuichigohatto.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/SakamotoRyuichi/ryuichigohatto.jpg</a><br/>
ofcourse you can pick out Hijikata Beat Takeshi<br/>
and Ryuhei Matsuda as Sozaburo Kano (the "wanted" man in the Shinsengumi)<br/>
the guy in the chair is the director Oshima Nagisa<br/>
<br/>
there seems to be some confusion about the guy to the left of the<br/>
director--he is not the photography/lighting guy---he composed the<br/>
weird soundtrack for GOHATTO his named is Sakamoto Ryuichi<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757098/">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757098/</a> <br/>
best known to anime fans as the guy who scored<br/>
<br/>
[anime] Mamoru Oshii's APPLESEED (2004)<br/>
[vid game] SEven Samurai <br/>
and [anime] Wings of Honneamise: Royal Space Force<br/>
<br/>
Gohatto is the second collaboration between Oshima, Beat Takeshi and<br/>
Sakamoto, there first was the film "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"</div>
