<h3>reference to shinsengumi & yakuza</h3>
by <i>persiphatta</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021868018">Hi, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading &quot;Yakuza Diary,&quot; by Christopher Seymour, and came across a <br/>
reference to the Shinsengumi.  Seymour was interviewing a yakuza who serves <br/>
as the historian for the Aizu Kotetsu, a clan in Kyoto.  Speaking of the <br/>
founder of the Aizu Kotetsu, Ubesaki Senkichi, and Senkichi&#39;s boss, Senhachi <br/>
(who was from another gang; apparently the yakuza gangs would occasionally <br/>
spawn offshoots, and the sub-gang remained loyal to the leader of the main <br/>
gang), the yakuza historian says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the years right before the 1868 Meiji Revolution, there was turbulance <br/>
in the samurai class.  There was also trouble among the lower ranks of <br/>
guardsmen.  They were losing their jobs protecting damiyo (sic), feudal <br/>
lords, residing in Kyoto.  A gang called Shinseigumi, headed by a man named <br/>
Isao Kondo, found itself unemployed.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Isao Kondo asked the gambling boss Senhachi for employment for the <br/>
redundant Shinseigumi men.  Though Senhachi accepted these men into his <br/>
organization, he decided to put his favorite understudy (Senkichi) in charge <br/>
of these newcomers.  Senkichi accepted the position and brought along three <br/>
friends from his youth to assist him.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This reorganized gang was now called Aizu Kotetsu-kai.  Aizu, for the <br/>
region where the gang originated, and Kotetsu, after Senhachi&#39;s favorite <br/>
brand of sword.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(p.72)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know how accurate this is, but thought I&#39;d throw it out there for <br/>
discussion or further research, if anyone is interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284751635">The fact that the Shinsengumi operated in the red-light district<br/>
implied that they had to deal with the yakuza.  Before the men who<br/>
would become the Shinsengumi entered Kyoto the yakuza probably ran<br/>
those infamous districts.  <br/>
[theory] deals were made and the yakuza was part of the info net-work<br/>

they&#39;d done this.<br/>
<br/>
On a completely different note, I noticed on the SHQ website, under the <br/>
picture of Saitou&#39;s son Tsuyoshi, there&#39;s a note saying he might have <br/>
emigrated to the U.S.  Does anyone know what the evidence is that suggest <br/>
this?  Are there Fujitas here who claim to be part of the family?<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-114508500">I have a couple of articles about Ninja and the origin of the term <br/>
Oniwaban, and they mention the origins of the Yakuza. I&#39;ll paste <br/>
both relevant parts, hoping to help clarifying the issue (Hijikata <br/>
fans: notice the term tekiya):<br/>
<br/>
NEW HEROES AND VILLAINS<br/>
<br/>
The Koga and Iga Ninja who remained at the capital were soon <br/>
promoted.<br/>
Some where assigned to an elite gun corps, others became personal <br/>
guards,<br/>
and some even joined the local police force. Some of the most <br/>
prominent<br/>
Ninja and Samurai became &quot;Hatamoto,&quot; or &quot;Direct vassals to the <br/>
Shogun.&quot;<br/>
These positions were fleeting. In all respects, they were unemployed,<br/>
forcing many of them to become &quot;Ronin,&quot; or &quot;Masterless warriors.&quot; <br/>
Many<br/>
became known as &quot;Kabuki-mono,&quot; which meant &quot;Crazy ones&quot;. These <br/>
eccentric<br/>
Ninja and Samurai took on colorful names, wore strange clothing, and <br/>
took<br/>
pleasure in terrorizing any who crossed their path. They were <br/>
extremely<br/>
loyal to one another, and in time, the Kabuki-mono numbered over <br/>
500,000,<br/>
many of whom wandered throughout Japan looting towns and villages. <br/>
However,<br/>
to every coin there are two sides. Another group emerged <br/>
simultaneously.<br/>
These people were called &quot;Machi-yakko,&quot; or &quot;Servants of the town,&quot; <br/>
and they<br/>
consisted of merchants, laborers, fishermen, renegade Ninja and <br/>
Ronin who<br/>
had become professional gamblers as a means of earning a living. <br/>
Everyone in<br/>
this group took up arms against the Kabuki-mono, serving as <br/>
protectors<br/>
against their tyranny. The Machi-yakko became heroes, praised by <br/>
town and<br/>
villages across the country for their bravery.<br/>
<br/>
ELITE NINJA<br/>
<br/>
In 1716 Tokugawa Yoshimune was named Shogun. When he assumed the <br/>
title, he<br/>
brought in many of his own people to run the government. Among those <br/>
in his<br/>
employ were Kishu-Ryu Ninja who were descendants of the Ninja who <br/>
fled to<br/>
the Kii province after the battle of Iga 135 years earlier. The <br/>
Shogun<br/>
organized the Kichu Ninja into a group called &quot;Oniwaban,&quot; which was <br/>
to be a<br/>
large scale intelligence unit that would serve as the countries <br/>
internal<br/>
security network. The agents in this network were called &quot;Metsuke,&quot; <br/>
which<br/>
literally meant &quot;Eyes.&quot; This new breed of Ninja was no longer <br/>
restricted to<br/>
the shadows. Their positions were very high profile and respectable. <br/>
The<br/>
Shogun assigned a Metsuke to serve a Daimyo in every province in the <br/>
land.<br/>
These agents were very polite, diplomatic and most importantly, <br/>
attentive to<br/>
the events of the province. This made it very difficult for any <br/>
Daimyo to<br/>
plot against the Shogun without the risk of being discovered. In <br/>
essence,<br/>
the Metsuke, because of their elite status, could openly map all the <br/>
details<br/>
of a castle in full view of everyone, noting its strengths and <br/>
weaknesses.<br/>
They could keep track of the number of Samurai employed by the <br/>
daimyo, and<br/>
they could investigate any issue that seemed suspicious to them. This<br/>
information would then be sent directly to the Shogun reference.<br/>
<br/>
A SECRET UNDERWORLD<br/>
<br/>
By the late 1700&#39;s the Machi-yakko (servants of the town) had <br/>
evolved into<br/>
a group known as Yakuza. This word, which roughly translated means<br/>
&quot;worthless&quot; comes from a card game called &quot;Hanafuda,&quot; or &quot;Flower <br/>
cards&quot;. The<br/>
goal of the game is to gather three cards that total 19 or under. <br/>
Anything<br/>
over 19 is a losing hand. The word YA meant 8, KU meant 9 and ZA <br/>
meant<br/>
three. This hand would total 20, which is a worthless hand, thus the <br/>
name<br/>
signifies someone who is an outsider of society. This group was <br/>
mostly made<br/>
up of the poor, landless misfits of society, which was perfect for <br/>
many<br/>
renegade Ninja and Ronin who could use their skills to attain high <br/>
positions<br/>
of power within the Yakuza hierarchy.<br/>
<br/>
The Yakuza families were based on a Father (oyabun) Child (kobun)<br/>
relationship. The leader of a Yakuza family was considered to be the <br/>
parent<br/>
to all those in his group. Initiation into a Yakuza family was a <br/>
very ornate<br/>
ritual. Unlike a classical martial tradition which required a blood <br/>
oath<br/>
written on a scroll in the applicants own blood and then burned at <br/>
an alter,<br/>
the Yakuza simply exchanged sake (rice wine) cups, filled to a level<br/>
consistent with their rank, to symbolize their Oyabun-Kobun <br/>
relationship.<br/>
This act was performed before a Shinto alter, which gave it religious<br/>
significance. The Kobun position, although always subservient to the <br/>
Oyabun,<br/>
consisted of many levels. These levels included; under-boss, <br/>
officers,<br/>
enlisted and apprentices. Again, this structure was not unlike the <br/>
hierarchy<br/>
used by the Ninja families of Iga and Koga.<br/>

The Yakuza Introduction <br/>
Italy has the La Cosa Nostra. America has the Mafia. The Irish and <br/>
Jews have their own crime organizations in America. Southeast Asia <br/>
has the Triads. China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have the Tong. Truly <br/>
well-known organized crime organizations indeed. <br/>
However, there is one organization that was not mentioned in the <br/>
above list, a group that has been around for over 300 years. A group <br/>
that has as much honor and principle as the Mafia, and is just as <br/>
strong, if not stronger. <br/>
The group is yakuza.Â <br/>
<br/>
History of the Yakuza --- Feudal Japan Kabuki-Mono <br/>
<br/>
The yakuza can trace its origins back to as early as 1612, when <br/>
people known as kabuki-mono (&quot;crazy ones&quot;), began to attract the <br/>
attention of local officials. Their odd clothing and haircuts and <br/>
behavior, along with carrying long swords at their sides, made them <br/>
quite noticeable. Kabuki-mono made a habit of antagonizing and <br/>
terrorizing anyone at their leisure, even to the point of cutting <br/>
one down just for sheer pleasure. <br/>
The kabuki-mono were eccentric samurai, taking outrageous names for <br/>
their bands and speaking heavily in slang. Their loyalty to one <br/>
another was remarkable. They would protect each other from any <br/>
threat, including against their own families. In fact, the kabuki-<br/>
mono were servants of the shogun, also taking the name of hatamoto-<br/>
yakko (&quot;Servants of the shogun&quot;). The groups were comprised of <br/>
nearly 500,000 samurai that were forced into unemployment during the <br/>
time of peace during the Tokugawa era, forcing them to become ronin <br/>
(&quot;Wave man,&quot; a master less samurai). Many had turned into bandits, <br/>
looting towns and villages as they wandered throughout Japan. <br/>
The hatamoto-yakko cannot truly be seen as the forebears of that <br/>
yakuza. Instead, the yakuza see the machi-yokko (&quot;Servants of the <br/>
town&quot;) as their ancestors. These people were the ones who took up <br/>
arms and defended the villages and towns from the hatamoto-yokko. <br/>
These people consisted of such occupations as clerks, shopkeepers, <br/>
innkeepers, laborers, homeless warriors and other ronin. Everyone <br/>
who was part of the machi-yakko was an adept gambler, which helped <br/>
them develop a closely-knit relationship with each other and their <br/>
leaders, much like today&#39;s yakuza. <br/>
The machi-yakko soon became folk heroes, praised by the townspeople <br/>
for their actions against the hatamoto-yakko, though they were, for <br/>
the most part, untrained and weaker than the hatamoto-yakko. They <br/>
were very similar to England&#39;s Robin Hood. Some of the machi-yakko <br/>
were even subjects of stories and plays. <br/>
The early yakuza did not surface until the middle to late 1700&#39;s. <br/>
These members include the bakuto (traditional gamblers) and the <br/>
tekiya (street peddlers). These terms are still used today to <br/>
describe yakuza members today, although a third group, gurentai <br/>
(hoodlums) has been added in the post World War II era. Everyone in <br/>
those groups came from the same background: poor, landless, <br/>
delinquents and misfits. The groups stuck closely in the same small <br/>
areas without problems, as the bakuto remained mostly along the <br/>
highways and towns, and the tekiya operated in the markets and fairs <br/>
of Japan. <br/>
The yakuza began organizing into families, adopting a relationship <br/>
known as oyabun-kobun (father-role/child-role). The oyabun was <br/>
the &quot;father,&quot; providing advice, protection and help; the kobun acted <br/>
as the &quot;child,&quot; swearing unswerving loyalty and service whenever the <br/>
oyabun needed it. The initiation ceremony for the yakuza also <br/>
developed in this period of time. Instead of the actual bloodletting <br/>
that was practiced by the Mafia and the Triads, the yakuza exchanged <br/>
sake cups to symbolize the entrance into the yakuza and the oyabun-<br/>
kobun relationship. The amounts of sake poured into each cup <br/>
depended upon one&#39;s status, whether the participants were father-<br/>
son, brother-brother, elder-younger, etc. The ceremony was usually <br/>
performed in front if a Shinto altar, giving it religious <br/>
significance.Â Tekiya <br/>
The tekiya&#39;s history is still widely debated. The most widely <br/>
accepted theory was that the tekiya came from yashi, an earlier word <br/>
meaning peddler. The yashi were travelling merchants of medicine, <br/>
much similar to the American West&#39;s snake oil merchants. Over time, <br/>
yashi became a catch-all for all merchants and peddlers. <br/>
They tekiya united with each other for protection and mutual <br/>
interest from the Tokugawa regime. They began to control the booths <br/>
at fairs and markets. Their reputation for shoddy merchandise was <br/>
well known and well-deserved. Their salesmanship was deceptive. They <br/>
lied about origins and quality of products. The would act drunk and <br/>
make a show of selling their wares cheaply, so it would appear that <br/>
they were unaware of what they were doing. They would delude the <br/>
customer. <br/>
The tekiya followed the usual yakuza organization: oyabun, <br/>
underboss, officers, enlisted and apprentices. The oyabun controlled <br/>
the kobun and the allocation of stalls along with the availability <br/>
of the goods. He also collected rents and protection money, and <br/>
would pocket the difference between the two. Everything they did was <br/>
legal work. In the middle 1700&#39;s, the feudal authorities recognised <br/>
and therefore increased the power of the tekiya. Oyabun were given <br/>
the authority of supervisor, now being able to have a surname and <br/>
carry two swords similar to samurai, in order to reduce the threat <br/>
of turf wars due to widespread fraud. However, the tekiya still <br/>
embraced some criminal traits, such as protection rackets, the <br/>
harboring of fugitives and known criminals, and brawling with other <br/>
tekiya and gangs. <br/>
<br/>
Bakuto --- the GamblersÂ <br/>
<br/>
The bakuto were first recognized during the Tokugawa era, when the <br/>
government hired them to gamble with contraction and irrigation <br/>
workers in order to regain a portion of the substantial wages the <br/>
workers received. <br/>
The bakuto contributed to Japan&#39;s tradition for gambling, as well as <br/>
the yakuza&#39;s traditional &quot;finger-cutting,&quot; and the origin of the <br/>
word &quot;yakuza.&quot; <br/>
The word comes from a hand in a card game called hanafuda (flower <br/>
cards), similar to blackjack. Three cards are dealt per player, and <br/>
the last digit of the total counts as the number of the hand. A hand <br/>
of 20, the worst score, gives the score of zero. One such losing <br/>
combination is 8-9-3, or ya-ku-sa, which began to be widely used to <br/>
denote something useless. This term began to be used about bakuto, <br/>
as they were, on the whole, useless to society. <br/>
Yubitsume, the custom of finger-cutting, was introduced by the <br/>
bakuto. The top joint of the little finger is ceremoniously severed, <br/>
signifying a weakening of the hand, which meant that the gambler <br/>
could not hold his sword as firmly. Yubitsume was performed was <br/>
usually performed as an act of apology to the oyabun. Further <br/>
infractions would either mean the severing of the next joint or the <br/>
top section of another finger. It is also used as a lasting <br/>
punishment just before expulsion. <br/>
The use of tattoos also came from the criminal aspect of the bakuto. <br/>
Criminals were usually tattooed with a black ring around an arm for <br/>
each offense he had committed. However, the tattoos soon became a <br/>
test of strength, as they were applied by undergoing 100 hours for a <br/>
complete back tattoo. The tattoo also marked a misfit, always <br/>
unwilling to adapt themselves to society.Â <br/>
<br/>
The Restoration Years <br/>
<br/>
The Meiji Restoration, starting in 1867, gave Japan a rebirth and <br/>
its first of many transformations into an industrial nation. <br/>
Political parties and a parliament were created, as well as a <br/>
powerful military. <br/>
The yakuza also began to modernize, keeping in pace with a rapidly <br/>
changing Japan. They recruited members from construction jobs and <br/>
dock workings. They even began to control the rickshaw business. <br/>
Gambling, however, had to be even more covert, as police were <br/>
cracking down on bakuto gangs. The tekiya, unlike the bakuto, <br/>
thrived and expanded, as their activities were not illegal, at least <br/>
not on the surface. <br/>
The yakuza began to dabble in politics, taking sides with certain <br/>
politicians and officials. They cooperated with the government so <br/>
they could get official sanction, or at least some freedom from <br/>
harassment. <br/>
The government did find a use for the yakuza --- as aid to ultra <br/>
nationalists, who took a militaristic role in Japan&#39;s adaption into <br/>
democracy. Various secret societies were created and trained <br/>
militarily, trained in languages, assassination, blackmail, etc. The <br/>
ultra nationalist reign of terror lasted into the 1930&#39;s, consisting <br/>
of several coups d&#39;etat, the assassination of two prime ministers <br/>
and two finance ministers, and repeated attacks on politicians and <br/>
industrialists. The yakuza provided muscle and men to the cause and <br/>
participated in &quot;land development&quot; programs in occupied Manchuria or <br/>
China. <br/>
Things changed, however, when Pearl Harbor was bombed. The <br/>
government no longer needed the ultra nationalists or the yakuza. <br/>
Members of these groups either worked with the government, put on a <br/>
uniform, or were put into jail. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is wonderful article. <br/>
I did not know about the relation between Ninja and Yakuza. <br/>
This is very interesting. <br/>
<br/>
The origins of Yakuza which I know are the wanderers generated at <br/>
Muromachi period. <br/>
People who wander about the inside of Japan freely existed in <br/>
Muromachi period and Sengoku period. <br/>
Please remember Miyamoto Musashi and Tsukahara Bokuden. <br/>
There were many people who wandered about with ambition like them. <br/>
Or there were the merchants and entertainers who travel in every <br/>
place. <br/>
Those people were mixed in the city and formed the group of the <br/>
outlaw who wore showy clothes. <br/>
These are Kabuki-mono. <br/>
Kabuki-mono is hooligans&#39; fashion. <br/>
Lower samurais with bad behavior copied this fashion. <br/>
When the Sengoku age was over and Japan became peaceful, those <br/>
outlaws lost ambition. <br/>
And the skirmish of a territorial fight started. <br/>
They were systematized for every territory and became the existence <br/>
called Machi-yakko. <br/>
And they were opposed to the lower samurais who oppress people. <br/>
Sengoku period was over and many samurais lost the hope of success <br/>
in life. <br/>
Lower samurais used the pent-up anger to oppress people of a status <br/>
lower than they. <br/>
These samurais are Hatamoto-yakko. <br/>
Machi-yakko and Hatamoto-yakko were opposed to each other, whenever <br/>
something happened. <br/>
This Machi-yakko is the origin of Yakuza. <br/>
<br/>
However, it is not strange to think that there were people who make <br/>
Ninja the origin in them. <br/>
Yakuza is the group made from various elements. <br/>
They are the outlaws generated to the Sengoku period mostly. <br/>
Moreover, the main duties of Ninjas were espionage. <br/>
They disguised themselves as the traveler or the merchant and <br/>
traveled in many districts. <br/>
If it is taken into consideration, Ninjas may be able to be called <br/>
wanderers&#39; same kind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yakuza was kind to people of their territory.<br/>
In the gambling house which they manage, people were important <br/>
customers. <br/>
In fact, many of incomes of Yakuza were gamble and a construction <br/>
worker&#39;s charge of an agency recommendation. <br/>
(Yakuza and construction work were already deeply related since the <br/>
Edo period.) <br/>
<br/>
Famous Yakuza of the name of Kunisada Chuuji existed. <br/>
When he was young, he was the bad man who committed crimes, such as <br/>
a burglar. <br/>
However, after he became the oyabun of Yakuza of an Akagi district, <br/>
he was going to be trusted by people and did much good behavior. <br/>
For farmers, he performed irrigation works. <br/>
At the time of famine, his family distributed rice to people. <br/>
He came to be trusted by people of a territory. <br/>
However, he was not able to cooperate with men of power. <br/>
His family had always caused the strife with the government <br/>
officials of an Akagi district. <br/>
They were cornered at last and hid out in the Akagi mountain. <br/>
Farmers climbed the mountain and sent food to them so that it might <br/>
not be found by government officials. <br/>
After Kunisada Chuuji was executed, a Confucian scholar&#39;s Hakura <br/>
Kandou wrote his biography. <br/>
The name of Kunisada was memorized by people as Yakuza hero. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, Yakuza hero is not only him. <br/>
Many Yakuzas protected people from the violence of men of power or <br/>
outlaws, and received praise. <br/>
They had the rule of not making trouble for people. <br/>
The enemies whom they fight were always men of power or other Yakuza <br/>
families. <br/>
To be sure, such Yakuzas existed till around 1960. <br/>
In Hiroshima after WW2, Yakuzas protected people from outlaws <br/>
instead of the police which stopped functioning. <br/>
However, such Yakuzas disappeared gradually. <br/>
Although I do not understand a detailed reason, I think that it is <br/>
because the outlaws generated after WW2 captured Yakuza society. <br/>
They do not have the tradition and the rule of Yakuzas. <br/>
They use violence on people and involve people in a crime. <br/>
They have also acquired a bad reputation in foreign countries. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, let&#39;s return subject. <br/>
Since I seldom know about Yakuza, I feel that it is impolite for me <br/>
to discuss the contents of this article. <br/>
However, I think that the origin of a word of Yakuza and explanation <br/>
of Tekiya are very exact by the limitation which I can understand. <br/>
The opinion of being the custom in which Yubitsume was introduced <br/>
from Bakuto is interesting. <br/>
In fact, I think that their finger is very important for gamblers. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, why does a Hijikata fans need to be careful about <br/>
Tekiya? <br/>
I worried for a while and have noticed. <br/>
Possibly, are you talking about the scene which Hijikata of Taiga <br/>
drama peddled? <br/>
Hijikata sold medicine at the sales talk deceitful to be sure at the <br/>
time of the beginning of that drama. <br/>
It resembled the excessive talk of Tekiya. <br/>
Moreover, he deceived some Dojyo and sold medicine. <br/>
However, it is a mistake supposing you are talking about those <br/>
scenes. <br/>
That is adaptation for Taiga drama. <br/>
Actual Hijikata had medicine and rounded customers. <br/>
This is medicinal peddlers&#39; ordinary style and is not related to <br/>
Tekiya. <br/>
Moreover, when Dojyo was seen, he entered there and sold medicine. <br/>
And he received instruction of the art of fencing from people of <br/>
Dojyo. <br/>
It is after WW2 that people got to know that there was no medicinal <br/>
effect in Ishida-sanyaku. <br/>
Hijikata believed that medicine was effective, and sold it, and <br/>
customers also believed and bought it. <br/>
The superintendent of HijikataToshizou-shiryokan which is the <br/>
relative of Hijikata is warning the people who came there &quot;Do not <br/>
believe Taidga drama.&quot; .<br/>
I sense that a sales method like a Taiga drama is interesting. <br/>
However, it will be provoking for the relatives of Hijikata that the <br/>
fraudulent practice of a fiction is misunderstood. <br/>
Incidentally, in many Mangas and dramas, Hijikata goes to sell <br/>
medicine alone. <br/>
However, he has having acted with the old man in many cases in <br/>
record. <br/>
In the portion, a Taiga drama is exact.<br/>
<br/>
Again, your article was very interesting. <br/>
Thank you very much. <br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-1796">&gt;</a> About Aizu Kotetsu (Comment of &quot;Yakuza Diary&quot;)</h3>
by <i>momomanjyuu2004</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-666528820">Their relation was not found although I searched some sites about <br/>
Aizu Kotetsu and Shinsengumi. <br/>
Therefore, although it becomes only my opinion, what I have noticed <br/>
is written. <br/>
<br/>
Although it seems that it is written to the book that Shinsengumi <br/>
lost its job before 1868, they have not lost their job. <br/>
Surely, when Tokugawa parted with political power, they lost the <br/>
work which patrols Kyoto. <br/>
However, they were already formally employed as vassals of Tokugawa <br/>
at the time. <br/>
Although Tokugawa went out of power, it had still huge territories <br/>
and many vassals. <br/>
Of course, the salary was regularly paid to them. <br/>
Moreover, Shinsengumi did not regard existence of self as unstable. <br/>
Toward the end of 1867, Tokugawa tended to disassemble Mimawarigumi <br/>
and Shinsengumi and tended to reorganize an army called Shin-<br/>
Yugekitai. <br/>
However, Kondou who was apprehensive about the influence of <br/>
Shinsengumi being lost refused this. <br/>
Moreover, between Satuma-Chosyu and Tokugawa, it was in the <br/>
situation where it is not known when war starts. <br/>
Does Kondou who has loyalty in Tokugawa ask for other employment at <br/>
the time? <br/>
<br/>
Although it seems that it is written to &quot;Yakuza Diary&quot; as &quot;A gang <br/>
called Shinseigumi&quot;, I have dissatisfaction in this text. <br/>
(Please do not have misunderstanding, Bonnie-san. I do not blame <br/>
you. Thank you for the interesting information.) <br/>
Well, Shinsengumi is the private police which was protecting the <br/>
peace of Kyoto in response to approval for the government of the <br/>
time. <br/>
It differs from an act which is called gang. <br/>
They received a bad reputation different from the fact after the <br/>
Meiji Restoration. <br/>
It is thought that Yakuza of this interview is the Emperor&#39;s <br/>
sympathizer. <br/>
The Emperors and Satsuma-Chosyu-related historians often do such <br/>
evaluation to Shinsengumi. <br/>
I respect the Emperor family. <br/>
Moreover, I do not have a feeling of dislike so much to Satsuma-<br/>
Chosyu. <br/>
However, I have a feeling of dislike in such historians truly. <br/>
<br/>
This is the incident which arose in the spring of this year. <br/>
The Dietman of a Yamagutchi (Chosyu) district denounced Shinsengumi <br/>
as the terrorist about the program of NHK. <br/>
Since NHK is a public broadcasting office, it is discussed in <br/>
Parliament about the program.<br/>
He says that the program which idealizes the terrorist who wounded <br/>
our ancestor is not allowed morally. <br/>
The minister who replied to it was the posterity of the samurai of <br/>
Satsuma. <br/>
Shinsengumi was the garrison whom the government of those days <br/>
accepted, and our ancestor&#39;s side was a terrorist. <br/>
The minister answered like this and he said that history changed <br/>
with positions. <br/>
This minister is the posterity of Okubo Toshimichi.<br/>
Since I was simple, I thought that a great man&#39;s posterity was <br/>
splendid. <br/>
Incidentally, I do not know whose posterity a Dietman is. lol<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aizu Kotetsu is the gambler who was related to the Aizu mansion in <br/>
Kyoto. <br/>
The residence of Daimyo was extraterritoriality at the time. <br/>
Since Bugyousyo (Police) could not be entered, lower samurais&#39; room <br/>
was often used for the gambling house. <br/>
He was the rowdy who wore the kimono of Aizu&#39;s mark. <br/>
Although his name was Uesaka Senkichi, his name was Tetsugorou when <br/>
younger. <br/>
And he was very short. <br/>
Therefore, people called him Aizu Kotetsu (Aizu&#39;s small Tetsu). <br/>
To be sure, he had Nagasone-Kotetsu. <br/>
However, in the name of Nagasone-Kotetsu and him, Kanji is <br/>
completely different. <br/>
<br/>
Aizu Kotetsu and Kobuns buried the Aizu samurais&#39; body to Komyo-ji <br/>
after Toba-Fushimi war. <br/>
Although it was the act forbidden to the Meiji government troops, he <br/>
buried those bodies with the determination to receive punishment, in <br/>
order to return Aizu&#39;s obligation. <br/>
And they made the cemetery for the Aizu samurais. <br/>
They kept protecting the cemetery, without yielding to persecution. <br/>
<br/>
The government troops forbade burying losers&#39; body at the time of <br/>
Boshin war. <br/>
What Yakuzas of each area buried those bodies for in opposition to <br/>
the government troops is an interesting fact. <br/>
When the ship of Tokugawa sank to the Suruga bay, Oyabun of famous <br/>
Yakuza called &quot;Shimizu no Jirochou&quot; collected and buried the bodies <br/>
of the samurais who drowned.<br/>
(He is Oyabun of Yakuza most famous for Japan. Furthermore, although <br/>
this is an unrelated talk, Yakuza called &quot;Kurokoma no Katsuzou&quot; <br/>
which appears as a rival in his biography exists. The Yakuza <br/>
participated in Sekihoutai together with 200 persons&#39; Kobuns.)<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Yanagawa Kumakichi which buried losers&#39; body after the <br/>
Hakodate war was Oyabun of Hakodate. <br/>
He is building Hekketsu-hi for the dead&#39;s repose of souls. <br/>
Their acts were the sympathy to a Tokugawa army, and rebounding to <br/>
the government troops. <br/>
And the life of people of their territory needed to be protected. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, the body of Hijikata has the opinion of being buried, <br/>
under Hekketsu-hi. <br/>
This is in the investigation report which Mr. Taira of Hijikata&#39;s <br/>
relative requested from the policeman of Hakodate at Meiji Era. <br/>
The policeman investigated Yanagawa Kumakichi.<br/>
Yanagawa answered like this to the policeman. <br/>
Although Hijikata was buried by subordinates in a certain village, <br/>
when building Hekketsu-hi, Yanagawa and Kobuns dug him up and buried <br/>
it in the place of Hekketsu-hi. <br/>
Hijikata&#39;s burial place has many opinions and the truth is not <br/>
known. <br/>
However, even if Yanagawa considers burying him under Hekketsu-hi, I <br/>
think that it is not strange. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Although it is about Aizu Kotetsu and Aizu Kotetsu-kai, these two do <br/>
not have relation. <br/>
The name of Aizu Kotetsu was finished when Uesaka&#39;s son died in <br/>
1935. <br/>
Yakuza which is completely unrelated to Uesaka began to use the name <br/>
of Aizu Kotetsu-kai from 1975. <br/>
Although I do not understand whether the relation between <br/>
Shinsengumi and Aizu Kotetsu was, Yakuza of the time and the present <br/>
Yakuza are completely different existences. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600783597">I wanted to add a bit more info on Tattoos and some differing opinions<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://horimono.net/">http://horimono.net/</a><br/>
[FAQ] &quot;3. Aren&#39;t tattoos in Japan the mark of yakuza organised <br/>
criminals? Unfortunately Hollywood, Western and Japanese writers and <br/>
the media have portrayed Japanese tattoos in a very negative light; <br/>
note how many so-called reference books and tattoo experts talk <br/>
about &#39;yakuza tattoos.&#39; Just because many yakuza are tattooed does <br/>
not mean those who are tattooed are yakuza - in most countries of the <br/>
world tattoos are common among the criminal element of society. In <br/>
America many crack whores and paedophiles have tattoos, however, <br/>
people do not call them &#39;crack whore tattoos&#39; or &#39;paedophile <br/>
tattoos.&#39; I believe the same applies to horimono. A visit to any <br/>
tattoo artist&#39;s studio in Japan should instantly dispel this <br/>
misconception.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Great Reading....<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.artelino.com/articles/japanese_tattoo_art.asp">http://www.artelino.com/articles/japanese_tattoo_art.asp</a><br/>

<br/>
Lastly an example of a tattoo from the film...TATTOOED LIFE (great <br/>
final fight scene!...the film is surprisingly NOT about gratuitous <br/>
violence/sex)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/TattooedLife.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/TattooedLife.jpg</a><br/>
the heroine in the film asks her man to strip because she found it <br/>
odd that even other men have not seen his body...the phrase &quot;bare <br/>
your shoulder&quot; is used in other places of the film as well...clearly <br/>
getting a tattoo is a bad idea if want to live on the right side of <br/>
the law usually (^_^)<br/>

by Sandi Fellman, D.M. Thomas (Introduction)<br/>
ISBN: 0896597989 <br/>
<br/>
*those who would like to research tattoos should try to find books <br/>
by Donald Richie who is an authority on the subject<br/>
<br/>
[NOTES]<br/>
<br/>
Ya ku za = 893 (from a card game...the combination of numbers <br/>
means &quot;worthless&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Yakuza is connected to the 17th century Banzuin Chobei a commoner <br/>
hero bandit<br/>
<br/>
[tattoos]<br/>
irezumi (ire-zumi) =insertion of ink or<br/>
horimoni (hori-moni)= a think &quot;carved&quot; or &quot;sculpted&quot; engraved  <br/>
is connected to the Chinese novel (with history mixed in) SUIKODEN <br/>
(Water Margin or All men are Brothers)...formally translated in <br/>
Japanese in 1805...by 1850s the story was glorified in the ukiyo-e <br/>
art from by various artists<br/>
<br/>
the word SHINOBU &quot;to hide oneself&quot; is a very loaded term for people <br/>
in the irezumi world who live in concealment (the author of the book <br/>
above emphasizes how people with tattoos are quiet normal and no <br/>
they aren&#39;t part of the criminal underworld...if anything they are <br/>
secretive due to the stereotype)<br/>
<br/>
in 1869 tattooing was outlawed temporarily and police raided the <br/>
homes of popular tattooists (horishi)<br/>
<br/>
Horicho (who was involved in a love suicide in 1900) practiced his <br/>
craft on KING GEORGE V and NICHOLAS 2 (last tsar of Russia)...both <br/>
men were involved in the navy and visited the artist on their days <br/>
off to get dragon tattoos<br/>
<br/>
the most famous artist right now is Mitusaki Ohwada (HORIKEN) he <br/>
father was an instructors at the Yokohama police academy...as a <br/>
youth he practiced on ham, sausage, daikon....at 20 he showed his <br/>
parents his own work on himself...they were horrified and his father <br/>
resigned from his position in the force (even though their son&#39;s <br/>
fascination was kept a secret)<br/>
<br/>
HORIKEN is also the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department&#39;s walking <br/>
database of tattoos (identify dead bodies etc)...as he can identify <br/>
the tattoo artist (based on unique styles)....therefore tattoo <br/>
artists can be more effective than a mere graphic database<br/>
<br/>
full body tattoos can sometimes be &quot;donated&quot; or sold upon the death <br/>
of the person to hospitals through a process called <br/>
decortication...the skin is basically removed from the <br/>
body...certain tattoos designs (river tattoo) was formulated for <br/>
removal after a person was flayed<br/>
<br/>
a favorite motiff of tattoos is BENTEN KOZO (portrayed in <br/>
kabuki)...a handsome thief who crossdresses as a woman and once <br/>
caught, revealed his full body tattoo<br/>

Yakuza: Japan&#39;s Criminal Underworld (expanded edition 2003)<br/>
By David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro<br/>
ISBN 0520215613<br/>
<br/>
Mitsuru Toyama (3rd son of a family with obscure samurai rank) was <br/>
from Fukuoka (KYUSHU)<br/>
<br/>
Toyama fought on the side of Satsuma during the Seinan War (1876-77)<br/>
<br/>
He served a 3 year jail sentence<br/>
<br/>
Organized KYOSHISHA (Pride and Patriotism Society)<br/>
<br/>
Became known as the emperor of the slums<br/>
<br/>
Founded Genyosha (Dark Ocean Society in 1881)<br/>
Motto &quot;revere the emperor, love and respect the nation, and defend <br/>
people&#39;s rights&quot;<br/>
Goal = colonize the islands separating Japan from Korea and China<br/>
Genyosha considered themselves the exact opposite of bakuto <br/>
(gamblers) and tekiya (peddlers)<br/>
Genyosha operated schools for ultranationalists, studied martial <br/>
arts, foreign languages and specialized in spying, they were also <br/>
bodyguards for government officials<br/>
Genyosha = the most sophisticated intelligence network in Japan prior <br/>
to WWII<br/>
Agents were sent to China, Korea and Manchuria<br/>
<br/>
GenyoshaÂthrew a bomb into the carriage of Foreign Minister Shigenobu <br/>
(he lost his leg)<br/>
Genyosha Stabbed the liberal politician Taisuke Itagaki<br/>
Genyosha Murdered Toshimichi Okubo<br/>
<br/>
[1892 in Kumamoto (Kyushu)] cooperated with conservatives in the <br/>
Meiji government, nearby gangs, and the local police (under the <br/>
orders of the minister of home affairs-I believe Yamagata Aritomo <br/>
held this position this year) to harass all *democratic and *liberal <br/>
organizations in the region<br/>
<br/>
Genyosha under the orders of the Minister of War in [1895] used their <br/>
squad of ninja to infiltrate the Korean Imperial Palace and murder <br/>
the queen (Japan would occupy Korea for the next 50 years)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888556277">Okay hopefully my post should wrap up the yakuza discussion (I <br/>
appreciate your patience)<br/>
*yahoo won&#39;t let me upload the file without &quot;timing out&quot; so I&#39;m <br/>
hosting these scans<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/yakuzadiary.pdf">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/yakuzadiary.pdf</a><br/>
I only scanned pages which deal directly with the Aizu-Kotetsu and <br/>
Isao Kondo and his Shinseigumi (these are the spellings from the book)<br/>
<br/>
I do realize that in AIm chats with SHQ members that I misquoted the <br/>
book saying that the Aizu-Kotetsu existed as far back as the <br/>
1830s...but in fact that is the decade in which the founder of the <br/>
gang was born...if you read the excerpt we are in fact dealing with <br/>
the Bakumatsu and our Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
[side notes]<br/>
from my post about the Genyosha hopefully you can see that the <br/>
definition of yakuza as simple lowly gamblers/peddlers is merely a <br/>
superficial assessment just as &quot;samurai&quot; is filled with minor sub-<br/>
classes<br/>
<br/>
modern day examples of yakuza and law enforcement exist and at times <br/>
it is certainly beneficial to the police and ofcourse at the same <br/>
time leads to corruption of the justice system...low level yakuza <br/>
have also entered the system.  Yes, background checks are standard <br/>
procedure however the force would much rather prefer a &quot;right&quot; <br/>
leaning person politically over a &quot;left&quot; leaning person.  This <br/>
attitude is right out of the Meiji era in which the police+yakuza <br/>
were used to crack down on liberal activists.  *Note left/liberal <br/>
labels do not match 100% our modern American definition but it does <br/>
come prettyclose.  Yakuza bosses also find it to be a good idea to <br/>
let go of their underlings into law enforcement careers should, in <br/>
the future, they have to deal with the police.  Yakuza poetry is <br/>
popular amongst cops and law enforcement publications are widely read <br/>
by the yakuza...speaking of media the yakuza not only have ties in <br/>
the entertainment business....they PRODUCE many films...the names of <br/>
oyabun appear right in the credits.  Toei has made over 200 yakuza <br/>
films many backed by the underworld...in fact one boss said that no <br/>
major actor during the golden era of Japanese cinema has not <br/>
somehow &quot;benefited&quot; from their influence.<br/>
<br/>
the low crime rates in Japan may in fact be partially due to not only <br/>
competant police...but also their tacit agreements with the <br/>
underworld...yakuza are part of the eyes and ears of the police as <br/>
they do tip off authorities when rogue criminals enter into their <br/>
turf...the yakuza way of seeing things is that they &quot;absorb&quot; rogue or <br/>
excessively violent criminals<br/>
<br/>
the book I mentioned in the previous post by David E. Kaplan and Alec <br/>
Dubro (Yakuza: Japan&#39;s Criminal Underworld) examine the yakuza during <br/>
feudal times when there was a 5 year period when oyabun (local <br/>
bosses/godfathers) were granted the right to wear 2 swords and a <br/>
surname.  Oyabun were also deputized by local police (which I&#39;m <br/>
assuming are like the guys you see in Hatchobori 7).<br/>
