<h3>NHK books</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105624619">The obsessed among you will be glad to know that you, too can buy the <br/>
NHK series official guide books for the Shinsengumi drama through Amazon <br/>
Japan which is nearly identical to the US version of Amazon.  They are <br/>
approximately $9 each I'm not sure what the economy shipping is but the <br/>
2-5 day express shipping is approximately $30<br/>
<br/>
Stop gasping in shock. I know Masayoshi got the first book in NYC <br/>
sometime ago and I think he said it was $20 so the cost kind of evens <br/>
out in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Here's some info on ordering courtesy of Tama:<br/>

If you have already an account on amazon.com it's available to all <br/>
amazon of the world,and the purchase step is same. About the language <br/>
problem, this site would be useful.<br/>

<br/>
FYI--the imaginatorium person does not clue you in  to the set up new <br/>
account box that reads "Furigana" apparently it means E-mail address <br/>
because it worked once I put that in since it seemed to match what was <br/>
asked for on the US site.<br/>
