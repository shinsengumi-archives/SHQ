<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608953225">Wow, I just imagined how they would look like, it would have the<br/>
signature jagged edge design...each package filled with<br/>
multicolored/flavored Shinsengummies, with complimentary temporary<br/>
makoto tattoos, and a contest to vote for the next Shinsengummy color<br/>
for Nagakura.<br/>
<br/>
PMK Saitou...since soba flavor may be a bit hard to replicate, I&#39;d<br/>
settle for seaweed flavor<br/>
<br/>
gummy RK Saitou would be an attractive neon blue color and therein<br/>
lies the trap...it would be Tylenol flavored<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata DEFINATELY black licorice<br/>

Kenshin...wild cherry<br/>

Blonde Ninja girl...bubblegum<br/>

it since you have the full URL for them.)<br/>

Just out of curiosity, what criteria did you use for including a <br/>

that involve Saitou.  Is it only when the story involves the <br/>
revolutionary time period or other members of the Shinsengumi?  <br/>
(uh... I think what I&#39;m trying to get at is &quot;Saitou other than just a <br/>

You should post a message over on SHQSD for newcomers to bump into if <br/>

stories...I chose some of the more popular ones and I&#39;ll add more when<br/>
time permits...I have to search Saito, Saitou, Saitoh, Fujita<br/>
Goro/Gorou, Shinsengumi etc yep there are too many and plenty of guest<br/>
appearances of S.H. in Aoshi stories too.  I think the database can<br/>
encompass Meiji Era as well because many &quot;flashback&quot; to the days of<br/>
the revolution.<br/>

I&#39;ve put it up in the database also. Oh, and for the record, only Hijikata was sake flavored. Saito was bumbleberry flavored.<br/>
<br/>
I have this one up in the database too, but I&#39;m going to sing its praises here. Nigihayami Haruko wrote a few poems dedicated to the Shinsengumi called To the Forgotten Dreams.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-293643788">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I know that so far Iï¿½ve been quite an inactive member, but yes, I did enjoy those first few days among you. I think that the two ML and the website are very nice ideas and that theyï¿½ll certainly help us, Shinsengumi fans, to easily access tons of information. Iï¿½m amaze by how fast everything is getting organised and I really appreciate reading all of those posts, even if sometimes, I wonder how Iï¿½m going to find the time to read them all. The ML have been quite busy, but thatï¿½s not a bad thing at all. (^-^)<br/>
<br/>
If I can, Iï¿½ll try, in the future, to add my little contribution. But Iï¿½m probably not as often on the Internet as some of youï¿½<br/>
<br/>
Tiffanyï¿½ Thanks for putting my fics in the database: it is very appreciated. (^-^)<br/>
<br/>
See you,<br/>
