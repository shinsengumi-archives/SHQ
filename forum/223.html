<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608953225">Wow, I just imagined how they would look like, it would have the<br/>
signature jagged edge design...each package filled with<br/>
multicolored/flavored Shinsengummies, with complimentary temporary<br/>
makoto tattoos, and a contest to vote for the next Shinsengummy color<br/>
for Nagakura.<br/>
<br/>
PMK Saitou...since soba flavor may be a bit hard to replicate, I&#39;d<br/>
settle for seaweed flavor<br/>
<br/>
gummy RK Saitou would be an attractive neon blue color and therein<br/>
lies the trap...it would be Tylenol flavored<br/>

Hijikata DEFINATELY black licorice<br/>

Kenshin...wild cherry<br/>

Blonde Ninja girl...bubblegum<br/>

it since you have the full URL for them.)<br/>

Just out of curiosity, what criteria did you use for including a <br/>

that involve Saitou.  Is it only when the story involves the <br/>
revolutionary time period or other members of the Shinsengumi?  <br/>

You should post a message over on SHQSD for newcomers to bump into if <br/>

I&#39;ve put it up in the database also. Oh, and for the record, only Hijikata was sake flavored. Saito was bumbleberry flavored.<br/>

I have this one up in the database too, but I&#39;m going to sing its praises here. Nigihayami Haruko wrote a few poems dedicated to the Shinsengumi called To the Forgotten Dreams.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293643788">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I know that so far I�ve been quite an inactive member, but yes, I did enjoy those first few days among you. I think that the two ML and the website are very nice ideas and that they�ll certainly help us, Shinsengumi fans, to easily access tons of information. I�m amaze by how fast everything is getting organised and I really appreciate reading all of those posts, even if sometimes, I wonder how I�m going to find the time to read them all. The ML have been quite busy, but that�s not a bad thing at all. (^-^)<br/>
