signature jagged edge design...each package filled with<br/>
multicolored/flavored Shinsengummies, with complimentary temporary<br/>
makoto tattoos, and a contest to vote for the next Shinsengummy color<br/>
for Nagakura.<br/>

PMK Saitou...since soba flavor may be a bit hard to replicate, I'd<br/>
settle for seaweed flavor<br/>
<br/>
gummy RK Saitou would be an attractive neon blue color and therein<br/>

<h3>Re: Shinsengumi fic on ff.net Database</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098934781">Way cool, Tiffany!  Wonder if there's a way to get it to create links <br/>
for the location ID so all one would have to do is click on it and <br/>
PRESTO (assuming ff.net isn't down at the time).  Probably not <br/>
just 'cause that would be too efficient.  :-)  I assume you were <br/>
hoping it would create links when you created the table?  (Looks like <br/>
it since you have the full URL for them.)<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity, what criteria did you use for including a <br/>
story in the database?  There must be hundreds (over a thousand?) <br/>
that involve Saitou.  Is it only when the story involves the <br/>
revolutionary time period or other members of the Shinsengumi?  <br/>
(uh... I think what I'm trying to get at is "Saitou other than just a <br/>
Meiji cop"?)<br/>
<br/>
You should post a message over on SHQSD for newcomers to bump into if <br/>
they read past messages so they'll know it's there.  I think so far <br/>
most people on SHQSD are on this list, too (which I'm really glad <br/>
of), but there are always exceptions.<br/>

something similar for the shinsengumihq.com seeing how its commanders<br/>

stories...I chose some of the more popular ones and I'll add more when<br/>
time permits...I have to search Saito, Saitou, Saitoh, Fujita<br/>
Goro/Gorou, Shinsengumi etc yep there are too many and plenty of guest<br/>
appearances of S.H. in Aoshi stories too.  I think the database can<br/>
encompass Meiji Era as well because many "flashback" to the days of<br/>
the revolution.<br/>

<br/>
I've put it up in the database also. Oh, and for the record, only Hijikata was sake flavored. Saito was bumbleberry flavored.<br/>
<br/>
I have this one up in the database too, but I'm going to sing its praises here. Nigihayami Haruko wrote a few poems dedicated to the Shinsengumi called To the Forgotten Dreams.<br/>

<h3>Hi everyone!</h3>
by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-293643788">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I know that so far I�ve been quite an inactive member, but yes, I did enjoy those first few days among you. I think that the two ML and the website are very nice ideas and that they�ll certainly help us, Shinsengumi fans, to easily access tons of information. I�m amaze by how fast everything is getting organised and I really appreciate reading all of those posts, even if sometimes, I wonder how I�m going to find the time to read them all. The ML have been quite busy, but that�s not a bad thing at all. (^-^)<br/>
<br/>
If I can, I�ll try, in the future, to add my little contribution. But I�m probably not as often on the Internet as some of you�<br/>
<br/>
Tiffany� Thanks for putting my fics in the database: it is very appreciated. (^-^)<br/>
<br/>
See you,<br/>
