<h3>Some kendo stuff</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523201232">My new experience in kendo...<br/>
I've watched a couple of classes, spoke to some students etc etc<br/>
skimmed a book...saw their drills and everything is pretty nice and<br/>
organized and funny when people "miss" their strikes etc <br/>
<br/>
and I spent a couple of sessions just going over the basic skills<br/>
<br/>
Okay so I attended kendo club today the only problem is the club is<br/>
way different from the class...<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who have seen Shinsengumi Kepporoku know that the doctor<br/>
tells Okita to get fresh air and rest (the dark stuffy dojo and dirty<br/>
gear is bad for him)...today I got to smell dirty gear...why did I get<br/>
the dirty men...I shudder to think how a bunch of -guys-, the<br/>
Shinsengumi kept their kendo gear clean (sorry guys I'm making a huge<br/>
generalization to drive a point home).  As soon as I put on the<br/>
tenugui and carefully tied on my men nice and tight (these 2 steps are<br/>
complicated to say the least) I felt like clawing my face mask and I<br/>
wanted to scream "get me outta hear it stinks and its hot and I can't<br/>
see! Aaaaaargh!"<br/>
<br/>
The whole bit about calloused hands...I look at my blistered palms <br/>
and I think "will bath & body works lotion cure this?"  Note you also<br/>
get calloused/blistered feet too...stupid sticky floors....I even<br/>
tried the recommended "caress the floor with your feet" technique.<br/>
<br/>
now technically one must spend "several" and not a couple of sessions<br/>
practicing strikes and learning how to walk---now I do the kendo glide<br/>
across my apartment at work and around campus LOL! But today one<br/>
person failed to come to the club meeting so I had the good fortune of<br/>
being the "dummy"...after a couple of drills (I can't remember all<br/>
their names)...I began to really feel the weight of the gear and the<br/>
shinai. To make things really fun the gym was around 70 degrees but<br/>
under the stuff you have to wear it felt like 90 degrees...<br/>
<br/>
Our teacher was very rigorous with all the drills and you really had<br/>
to concentrate to hear his advice over all the screaming and<br/>
yelling...I just nod to everything he says.  Because I'm a cautious<br/>
and considerate person it seemed that my training partner took this as<br/>
a que to be really dramatic when he started hitting me...I'm just<br/>
looking out for his safety but right when I got the nerve to hit him<br/>
REALLy hard we had to rotate partners...and this is interesting as I<br/>
mentioned at www.shinsengumimb.com about the importance of height etc<br/>
because in practice you had to constantly readjust to practice on<br/>
different partners and when you had a really tall guy you were almost<br/>
on tippy toes to hit him on the top of the head/men<br/>
<br/>
In a chat session I mentioned the unity of mind/body...so I'm<br/>
beginning to realize this (ofcourse atheletes/dancers and people who<br/>
concentrate really hard on their endeavours can relate)...but in the<br/>
case of martial arts you have to be very precise in how you are<br/>
hitting your opponent and your own posture and how your own hands/arms<br/>
end up and how fast you moved in on your opponent etc.<br/>
<br/>
I won't get to continue beyond 1 or 2 months for various reasons but<br/>
it is really fascinating to experience kendo...by the end of 2 1/2<br/>
hours I felt like curling up and saying "please please stop hitting<br/>
me..." LOL!  Now I have a taste what was meant in Shinsengumi<br/>
Kepporoku when during a practice session a guy had a bucket of water<br/>
thrown on him and the teacher says "this isn't your soft city<br/>
dojo"...I mean I'm with a university club practicing modern kendo and<br/>
the Shinsengumi were training to be effective as possible with their<br/>
varied lineages.</div>

Geez, you could write some of the most incredible behind-the-scenes Shinsengumi stuff, stuff that always gets left out or misinterpreted (by people like me) and is unique to the experience of groups like the Shinsengumi... and with the personalities those guys had, it could be so much fun!  That's a big part of what I loved so much about the film "Cruel Story," that we got to see them *living* and not just fighting to keep Kyoto safe.  I'm so *envious*!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634529631">Sounds like you had loads of fun! I guess the one drawback to starting kendo is having to use used bogu =/ I'd eventually like to take a bit of kendo to supplement my iaijutsu. I definately hear you on the hands and feet issue though. BTW, Did your knees/legs hurt from sitting in seiza for long periods of time on the wood floor? Although we have partner kata, we can't actually hit targets since most koryu kata don't utilize bogu (bokken kata). The height differences is something that I had to adjust to as well when I switched from my old iai school to my current one. With partner drills I found out really quick that small people are fast and big/tall people although slower have extremely long reach. I still find it hard to compensate for these differences at times, which is one of the reasons why I'd like to try kendo, since most of the curriculum is practiced with a partner. Good luck in your training and I hope you get the guy back the decided to go a bit extreme in hitting you ^_^ hehe.  <br/>

Thats cool, at least you're accustomed to sitting in that position. At least you don't have the repetitive sit-stand-sit-stand type of work in kendo. After a 4 hr sat class it hard to walk sometimes haha. Although i'm sure you feel that way anyways due to the intensity of your classes.    <br/>

Ahh that makes sense...the shinai bouncing off due to the say it's designed. I guess thats another difference in JSA, how in kendo you hit, and in iai you cut. It feels really weird to go through kata where I continuously cut through/into your opponent and then go to partner prractice where I have to stop short of hitting my partner. Course to hit or cut in reality it doesn't matter since as long as you reach your opponent with the weapon, thats all that matters in the end. Do you by chance have a training manequin(sp)? When I was at my former iai school that also happened to teach kendo, they used to bring out a sort of training dummy (vs each other) for cutting exercises for the new students.   <br/>

***reaching your opponent in an efficient and timely manner is really<br/>

enforced...your right foot pushing off with left foot in mind and your<br/>
trying to move fast is hard...but kendo "walking" best on smooth<br/>
wooden floors is not necessarily used in old kenjutsu lineages I<br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
***only the more advance students seem to understand the value of<br/>
"follow through" when they aren't practicing on an opponent because<br/>
e.g. how at the end of the motion your head tends to tilt slightly<br/>
forward and the teacher tries to keep correcting this error and there<br/>
is the whole issue of shinai's tip almost hitting the floor.  There<br/>
are definate advantages and disadvantages to practicing on an opponent<br/>
and on your own...the mirror is pretty cool to work with ^_^ so you<br/>
can check to see if the sword tip is pointed at your throat and your<br/>
feet are straight (without having to looke "down"---you have no idea<br/>
how funny when some of us are looking down at are feet and saying "are<br/>
my feet okay I don't want sore ankles")<br/>
<br/>
***we don't have mannequins I guess due to the small number of<br/>
students in the club but during the class (for credits) they use<br/>
volleyball net/poles wrapped with mats and I've seen students practice<br/>
on these.<br/>
<br/>
***all newbies such as myself are okay when we are practicing on our<br/>
own and the instructor says our posture is good...but when we practice<br/>
on each other we end up messing up on footwork and our left wrists<br/>
start rotating under the shinai hilt...which got me thinking that its<br/>
due to our lack of stamina and the length of practice in hot/humid<br/>
conditions as well as what I call the "sloth" factor--we get<br/>
lazy...now for samurai or any medieval warrior back in the day on the<br/>
battlefield how in the world did they take on multiple opponents and<br/>
conserve strength and maintain efficiency in movement is simply beyond<br/>
comprehension.</div>

wooden floors is not necessarily used in old kenjutsu lineages I<br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thats something I did notice when I watched the Kendo vids you sent me. Everytime they advanced it was with that type of step. And from what I understand, yes it's something not used in most koryu. Something I notice in my ryu and others.<br/>
<br/>
***only the more advance students seem to understand the value of<br/>
"follow through" when they aren't practicing on an opponent because<br/>
e.g. how at the end of the motion your head tends to tilt slightly<br/>
forward and the teacher tries to keep correcting this error and there<br/>
is the whole issue of shinai's tip almost hitting the floor.  There<br/>
are definate advantages and disadvantages to practicing on an opponent<br/>
and on your own...the mirror is pretty cool to work with ^_^ so you<br/>
can check to see if the sword tip is pointed at your throat and your<br/>
feet are straight (without having to looke "down"---you have no idea<br/>
how funny when some of us are looking down at are feet and saying "are<br/>
my feet okay I don't want sore ankles")<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, when you mean follow through do you mean cut big? Like cutting all the way like you're cutting tameshigiri? The mirror thing is pretty cool though, something I use often to check the angle of my sword. One of the reasons why the tip of the sword is pointed at the opponent's face/throat is that they cannot judge the length of your sword which gives you an advantage. This concept might help next time you work with the mirror to help where you place your sword. (if you can't see the length of your sword, then you're pretty much right on) Course this will vary depending on where your immaginary opponent is supposed to be distance wise. The angle will change depending on this distance.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***all newbies such as myself are okay when we are practicing on our<br/>
own and the instructor says our posture is good...but when we practice<br/>
on each other we end up messing up on footwork and our left wrists<br/>
start rotating under the shinai hilt...which got me thinking that its<br/>
due to our lack of stamina and the length of practice in hot/humid<br/>
conditions as well as what I call the "sloth" factor--we get<br/>
lazy...now for samurai or any medieval warrior back in the day on the<br/>
battlefield how in the world did they take on multiple opponents and<br/>
conserve strength and maintain efficiency in movement is simply beyond<br/>
comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder the same....I know battles waged on for hours on end. I can only image the amount of stamina warriors of the past had.  <br/>

<br/>
Haha, after reading your post and thinking about being new to martial arts I thought of the hakama, something that at times is a bit troublesome for beginners and advanced students. Even after doing iai for a few years, tonight I found myself tripping over my hakama on 1 kata where we move from seiza to standing while advancing forward. I think I tripped over my hakama about 3 times in a row (repeated the kata 2 more times cause I tripped the 1st time). Luckly I caught myself before I commited otherwise my sword would have smacked into the floor ^^;. Normally hakama sabaki (arranging it so it's neat and out of the way) isn't too hard, but sweat for a while and it changes things a bit in repeatedly sitting and standing. Have you gotten accustomed to sitting down and standing up while wearing the hakama without tripping over yourself or stepping on it? <br/>
<br/>
About the indigo hakama for starters, thats insane o_o; some of those hakama are $200+ quite a bit of cash to sink in for a beginner, not to mention they bleed like crazy for the first few washes and wears....which reminds me. Does your gi bleed? I know most indigo gi (even the inexpensive ones) are dyed traditionally and bleed like crazy (I turned a bucket and my washing machine blue with the one I got as well as looked like a smurf after every practice).  <br/>

Ahhh ok, now I know what you mean when you mentioned you were all the same color. It all depends on what material the hakama is made from. A lot of the lower end hakama, like the black one I have, is a polyester and tetron blend, so it tends to get a bit on the warm side, especially now since it's getting closer to summer. The 100% cotton ones definately breathe a lot better, but are a pain to care for in the pleat department, even if folded after practice. After 1 good practice, the pleats start to dissapear. Interestingly, in recent years new hakama which have the pleats sewn at the crease to keep them in, have started to become available. Having the pleats in makes it much easier to fold up into a square when not in use.  <br/>
