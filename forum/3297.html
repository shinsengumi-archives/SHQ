&quot;Yamakawa Kenjiro wrote a letter to Nagakura&#39;s son, &quot;The Issue <br/>
Concerning<br/>
Those Responsible for Sakamoto Ryoma&#39;s Murder&quot;-- and says that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
believe that it was Harada. (pp. 238-241)&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;However, Harada Sanosuke (Shinsengumi personnel) was not the man who <br/>
murdered [Ryoma]&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I [Yamakawa] was still young at the time, but I&#39;ve asked older <br/>
people, and they all say it was the work of former Aizu retainer <br/>
Sasaki Tadasaburo, who worked for the shogunate and was the leader of <br/>
Mimawarigumi.&quot;<br/>

Basically Yamakawa (Yamagawa) Kenjiro, Aizu retainer and good friend <br/>
of Fujita Goro (Saitou Hajime) was also in contact with Nagakura&#39;s <br/>
son as well.  So aside from being deeply involved in post 1868 Aizu <br/>
affairs, Yamakawa obviously concerned himself with Shinsengumi issues.<br/>
Yamakawa is the most famous Aizu samurai in the Meiji era (although <br/>
his sister was also very well known too)...his influence extends well <br/>
beyond academia because he was also an advisor to RIKEN Labs and was <br/>
even involved the negotiation between the Brits and Japanese Naval <br/>
agreement in the 20th century.  <br/>
I wrote an article about his other interests here:<br/>

M found some correspondences between Yamakawa and an American at the <br/>
New York Public Library and scanned his sig for us<br/>

<br/>
The New York Public Library does not allow for reproduction of their <br/>
material, therefore we had to put it on Megaupload so the link/image <br/>
expires in 7 days.<br/>
<br/>
We have alot of info on people like Yamakawa and soon <br/>
