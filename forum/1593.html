the Meiji Restoration."<br/>

<br/>
Matsuo Taseko's life was mixed with fact and fiction...what is<br/>
undeniable is that she was WAY ahead of her time and luckily had a<br/>
family who was pretty cool about it too.<br/>

Matsuo Taseko was a writer, poet and activist, mother of 10 children<br/>
(7 lived to adulthood)....and just a really really busy woman (0_0)<br/>
<br/>
She was from a rich peasant family..."In 1862, Matsuo Taseko, a<br/>
fifty-one year old peasant woman, travelled from her home in the<br/>
mountains of central Japan to Kyoto...people who know Japanese history<br/>
can grasp the daring of her journey."</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854956739">Anyone interested in women in the arts during the Meiji (and other periods), this site is a good place to start.  The arts were one area where women found some acceptance on a par with men.  Very interesting (and some very interesting personalities... reminds me a lot of Paris during the 19th century).<br/>
