<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-17369626">Either we are each logging on dozens of times a day or we have many<br/>
people who stop by our board and aren&#39;t biting the hook (even with the<br/>
historical looking banner as bait for possible academics).  As a board<br/>
admin.  there is no way for me to determine if it is members or if the<br/>
board is just counting &quot;views&quot;.  At the bottom of the page it says<br/>
Total Visits: 7968?<br/>
<br/>
I did designate mods/admin way back but for some reason the names<br/>
aren&#39;t listed in the columns.  Presently I have the time to patrol the<br/>
board but just so you all know:<br/>
Barbara=Moderator<br/>
Shimazuryu=Admin<br/>
Spiritus_Saitou=Moderator<br/>
May they be just in wielding their powers.<br/>
<br/>
I posted a link to our board at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hino-shinsengumi.com">http://www.hino-shinsengumi.com</a> which<br/>
seems to be one of -the- most active Shinsengumi branches in Japan.<br/>
3-hajime.com which has very friendly gals and they know we exist<br/>
(babelfish their comments)<br/>
and a couple of other sites I can&#39;t recall.<br/>
<br/>
If the GREAT fish allows I&#39;ll try to post on the official Fu-un<br/>
Shinsengumi site -if- I can figure out if they allow for advertising.<br/>
<br/>
I know from meeting with international students before that a majority<br/>
of younger Japanese have pretty darn good English comprehension<br/>
skills.  Many have studied English since elementary school 0_o and can<br/>
read/write basic English so that is the rational behind my objectives<br/>
 we need to reach out across to the Pacific to our brothers and sistas<br/>
who are -even- more serious about their Shinsengumi than we are:) We<br/>
also would like Japanese agents to give us a heads up on anything<br/>
Shinsengumi related in the media/manga etc.<br/>
<br/>
We need Pro-Ishin ShiShi folks....it&#39;s just not the same without<br/>
opponents...just feel so obsolete.  Remember, as an anime fan I have<br/>
no problem with more RK, PMK fans but we have to try to lure in other<br/>
folks too so we can -use- them errr learn from them to enrich<br/>
fanfiction I mean contribute to our understanding of the<br/>
history/politics of the time.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows about an upcoming convention with Shinsengumi<br/>
cosplaying team or something just invite them to join.  Or if anyone<br/>
knows someone on the &quot;inside&quot; of a convention which can get us some<br/>
free advertising lemme know too.  I think we did more than enough to<br/>
&quot;season&quot; the board with amazing threads and I bow deeply to everyone<br/>
who has taken the time to post...I just have the fate of<br/>
www.Saitou-hajime.com in the back of my mind.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-102705452">Moderators can edit/delete messages and move threads...the functions<br/>
for moving threads should show up at the bottom left hand corner. You<br/>
can edit another member&#39;s message (just look for functions beneath<br/>
their names).  Well, if there is something objectionable e.g. no<br/>
warnings on yaoi/hentai related fanfiction, bad words, racism (just<br/>
standard censoring/warning when offensive material turns up)  however<br/>
we all seem to have a tacit allowance for females harassing animated<br/>
men it seems.<br/>
We have such a small community anyways and we are all soooo well<br/>
behaved too:)<br/>
You don&#39;t have to keep track of anything at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982971519">Hmmm.... Well the board must be counting the times it is viewed... I <br/>
mean I usually spend quite a lot of time on the board... Re-reading <br/>
post, answering post (albeit not too intelligently), etc... The <br/>
30min to 1hr will go by with only 1 or 2 guest at most, oh sometimes <br/>
no guest so... It&#39;s improbable that we have THAT much traffic (don&#39;t <br/>
kill me). Plus I visit the board on average 2-3 times per day so we <br/>
only have 12 members and suppose we all visit 4 times a day... Well <br/>
still far for the 7K...<br/>
<br/>
Either way, just want to say thank you to the five of you for <br/>
putting the board up. I like it and I really think it&#39;s much better <br/>
than the yahoo mailing list (albeit no chat, database, files).<br/>
Oh... I&#39;m talking about the MBs navigation and ease of reading here, <br/>
not the content. Although the content is not bad at all on the <br/>
message board.<br/>
