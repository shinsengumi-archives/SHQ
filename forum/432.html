I think...they are happy to meet us...she didn&#39;t call me a<br/>
barbarian...I think she meant that it is funny that the Japanese in<br/>
the 19th century would consider me to be a barbarian (hey I&#39;m Asian<br/>
wait I wonder if they think of southeast asians as barbarians too) and<br/>
it is ironic that we barbarians take interest in the new selection<br/>
group.  I read an online newsarticle (posted waaaaay back) about how<br/>
Hijikata Toshizo read essays translated from English to Japanese and<br/>
one such essay mentioned the need for protein in one&#39;s diet (since<br/>
most Japanese had mostly vegetarian diets) and he encouraged his men<br/>
to consume more meat so he wasn&#39;t THAT close minded (note that<br/>
portrait of him).  I wonder what he would think if he knew us foreign<br/>
devils are his fans LOL.  He would be like o_0<br/>

off. I hope this doesn&#39;t end up posted twice...<br/>

What I was attempting to say was that I would love to see Hijikata&#39;s <br/>
reaction to being glomped by a horde of us foreign devils and that it <br/>
would be a Kodack moment for sure. I also wonder what he would think <br/>
of those of us -whistles innocently- who are slightly obsessed with <br/>
his fundoshi...<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I was wondering if there was another way to reach <br/>
Japanese Shinsengumi fans. I noted that on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://japanese.about.com/">http://japanese.about.com/</a> <br/>
they have a section for finding penpals. Is there anyway someone <br/>
(preferably who understands more of the language than me!) might <br/>
could use that to try and reach out to them?<br/>

or something but is there a way to search for Shinsengumi fans?  <br/>
Because in their profiles maybe they&#39;ll just leave off interests they <br/>
may assume are confined to Japan.  In the meantime I have emailed <br/>
some major Shinsengumi sites and one replied<br/>
&quot;sorry no English&quot;<br/>
and this was from a super fancy site!!!  No one on either side of the <br/>
world wants to use the goldfish it seems because I include the link <br/>
in all my messages and I structure my sentences very simply to have <br/>
it translate to Japanese &quot;Japanese language to English language <br/>

babelfish Japanese either :)</div>

not sure but I&#39;ve seen that name before? Maybe at www.saito-<br/>

Finally, aside from letting them know we are ALIVE ^_^ <br/>
Did you try asking the webmaster if he or most probably she, can add <br/>
the sites,groups, message boards to their site? Maybe they&#39;d know <br/>
more shinsengumi web rings english/japanese that we can put the sites <br/>
in....<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;foreigners&quot; QUITE OBSSESSED with these bishies, I think for <br/>
them that&#39;s really a cool thing. Birds of the same (or almost the <br/>

they know what you want.  When I bought the entire set of the <br/>

were like &quot;oh you mean Wandering Samurai&quot;.<br/>

At least the gals on 3-hajime.com are &quot;happy&quot; I think...<br/>
