<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039012957">Okay, shop talk.  I have tried to "reach out" to our sisters (why is<br/>
it that a majority of Shinsengumi fans are women?) in Japan.  I posted<br/>
shinsengumimb.com info on the 3-hajime.com board in English and<br/>
Japanese (via babelfish)...it doesn't hurt to give them some laughs...<br/>
here are their responses...<br/>

new selection group, concerning Saito one, the shank. Also Maggie,<br/>
seems that it manage the new selection group-related sight, but,<br/>
contents do not understand excessively well in unskillful me of<br/>
English, it is regrettable. Your period > Maggie, the foreign country<br/>

the fact that it can encounter the companion who exceeds the border,<br/>

I think...they are happy to meet us...she didn't call me a<br/>
barbarian...I think she meant that it is funny that the Japanese in<br/>
the 19th century would consider me to be a barbarian (hey I'm Asian<br/>
wait I wonder if they think of southeast asians as barbarians too) and<br/>
it is ironic that we barbarians take interest in the new selection<br/>
group.  I read an online newsarticle (posted waaaaay back) about how<br/>
Hijikata Toshizo read essays translated from English to Japanese and<br/>
one such essay mentioned the need for protein in one's diet (since<br/>
most Japanese had mostly vegetarian diets) and he encouraged his men<br/>
to consume more meat so he wasn't THAT close minded (note that<br/>
portrait of him).  I wonder what he would think if he knew us foreign<br/>
devils are his fans LOL.  He would be like o_0<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, so I tried to reply to this once before and my computer booted me <br/>
off. I hope this doesn't end up posted twice...<br/>
<br/>
What I was attempting to say was that I would love to see Hijikata's <br/>
reaction to being glomped by a horde of us foreign devils and that it <br/>
would be a Kodack moment for sure. I also wonder what he would think <br/>
of those of us -whistles innocently- who are slightly obsessed with <br/>
his fundoshi...<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I was wondering if there was another way to reach <br/>
Japanese Shinsengumi fans. I noted that on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://japanese.about.com/">http://japanese.about.com/</a> <br/>
they have a section for finding penpals. Is there anyway someone <br/>
(preferably who understands more of the language than me!) might <br/>
could use that to try and reach out to them?<br/>

as Hijikata-sama's Chamber Maid more effectively. He does not like it <br/>
when he finds his goldfish gatotsued...)</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'm not going to have time to look into this for maybe another month <br/>
or something but is there a way to search for Shinsengumi fans?  <br/>
Because in their profiles maybe they'll just leave off interests they <br/>
may assume are confined to Japan.  In the meantime I have emailed <br/>
some major Shinsengumi sites and one replied<br/>
"sorry no English"<br/>
and this was from a super fancy site!!!  No one on either side of the <br/>
world wants to use the goldfish it seems because I include the link <br/>
in all my messages and I structure my sentences very simply to have <br/>
it translate to Japanese "Japanese language to English language <br/>
http://babelfish.altavista.com"  -_- I guess they can't comprehend <br/>
babelfish Japanese either :)</div>

Hey... There was only one thing confusing me, who is "Maggie"? I'm <br/>
not sure but I've seen that name before? Maybe at www.saito-<br/>
hajime.com? Was that you?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, aside from letting them know we are ALIVE ^_^ <br/>
Did you try asking the webmaster if he or most probably she, can add <br/>
the sites,groups, message boards to their site? Maybe they'd know <br/>
more shinsengumi web rings english/japanese that we can put the sites <br/>
in....<br/>
<br/>
As for "foreigners" QUITE OBSSESSED with these bishies, I think for <br/>
them that's really a cool thing. Birds of the same (or almost the <br/>
same) feather flock together ne? ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Southeast Asian you are? I am too.. Glad to meet you... ^_^<br/>

yes I was on saitou-hajime.com before it went bye bye<br/>
<br/>
I'm Thai born in U.S. if I was in Thailand I could so get my hands <br/>
on all this manga/anime stuff the problem is the titles are all <br/>
weird and you would have to carry a pic or something of the anime so <br/>
they know what you want.  When I bought the entire set of the <br/>
official RK release I had to draw a cross shape on my cheek and they <br/>
were like "oh you mean Wandering Samurai".<br/>
<br/>
At least the gals on 3-hajime.com are "happy" I think...<br/>
<br/>
I did try to email the webmaster directly however she (from the tone <br/>
of the writing very empathetic to historical S.H.) I think it's <br/>
a "she"...never replies and chose to reply on the msg board <br/>

I'm originally from the Philippines now living in Chicago. Yeah I <br/>
know what you mean about getting your hands on all those things, I <br/>
tried them before. The only problem I saw was that sometimes I look <br/>
at the merchandise and some of them look really "fake". It's so hard <br/>
to muddle through whats legit and what's not...<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.... The owner of the site must be flooded by e-mails that is <br/>
probably why she (or he) choose not to respond that way. She probably <br/>
discourages that or maybe her e-mail is full. Who knows?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting them know we exist... :O)<br/>
