<h3>OT:  More thoughts on the war with Japan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898698924">I'm in agreement that it seems to have been more to scare the <br/>
Russians than to end the war that we used the bomb. It was pointless <br/>
and too many people knew it. Actually, I've been able to read a bit <br/>
further into that book's section on the bombing of Nagasaki and it <br/>
mentions the point about our leaders were trying to intimidate Stalin <br/>
too. The book is:<br/>

Weird History 101 by John Richard Stephens<br/>
Adams Media Corporation<br/>
ISBN# 1-55850-715-9<br/>

What really gets to me is some of these history programs want to  <br/>
condemn the kamikaze pilots and the Japanese soldiers who chose to <br/>
die fighting rather than surrender. They act as if they were part of <br/>
a lunatic cult or something. But when you get right down to it, how <br/>
is what they did any different from what the men who died defending <br/>
the Alamo chose to do? We read Tennyson's "Charge of the Light <br/>
Brigade" and call those people "brave men", so why are the Japanese <br/>
soldiers any different?  Sorry. I was REALLY disappointed in that <br/>
show I caught the other night...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And now for something completely different. Just in case everything <br/>
else failed, you should be glad to know the U.S. had one last ace up <br/>
it's sleeve to win the war. I found this in a book called What They <br/>
Don't Teach You About History by Tim Wood and Ian Dicks, Dorset <br/>
(1992), ISBN# 0-88029-964-9<br/>
<br/>
Here's a full quote about the great plan to eliminate our enemies:<br/>
<br/>
"In 1943, the US Army Air Corps rounded up approximately 30,000,000 <br/>
bats with the intention of developing a bat bomb. Each bat was to <br/>
have a device weighing one ounce that produced a flame on a delay <br/>
fuse. They planned to release these bats over enemy cities, where it <br/>
was hoped they would fly into attics and under eaves, and await <br/>
ignition. Two million dollars were invested in the project. It was <br/>
declared operational in 1945, but never used. The only time they went <br/>
into action was when some of the exploding bats were accidently <br/>
released. They zoomed fearlessly into action, destroying a general's <br/>
car and an aircraft hanger!"<br/>
<br/>
So, do you feel any safer? -_-<br/>
