<h3>Shinsengumi&Hollywood (What went Wrong/Right)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503264114">For the past weeks I was in contact with someone in a company which<br/>
expressed interest in a documentary topic concerning Japan.  In fact<br/>
Last SAmurai was the catalyst for the interest.  IRONICALLY, Last<br/>
Samurai was also part of the failure of this project (the film's box<br/>
office earnings was not "good" enough).<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that the company expressed interest first.  I involved a<br/>
respected authority figure in this attempt and the company has this<br/>
person's proposal and contact info.  <br/>
<br/>
A WEALTH of images, multimedia (movies, music vids), scans,  links etc<br/>
basically everything I have or WE have I should say was presented to<br/>
them on a silver platter.  Everything was tailored to their<br/>
convenience.  SHQ's site as well as pics/maps gathered by our members<br/>
were used to make the case.<br/>
<br/>
The authority submitted a proposal and I did as well but full of eye<br/>
catching imagery.  Things moved along quickly up the ladder.  Numerous<br/>
updates and what I would like to call "info feeds" were made to my<br/>
contact (on a DAILY basis 0_0), a VERY strong case of the Shinsengumi's<br/>
1) marketability<br/>
2) universal appeal...movies made for every generation with various<br/>
interpretations and forms<br/>
3) proof that NOW is the time to bring them to the USA but tailored a<br/>
bit to suit the tastes of the American audience<br/>
*successful in showing marketability* I used screenshots of<br/>
Shinsengumi movies from different "generations" to show that their<br/>
story did not just "die" or lose appeal<br/>
<br/>
yes, I said documentary so why am I mentioning the "reformulation" of<br/>
the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
The project shifted DRAMATICALLY to the fictional realm.<br/>
<br/>
Problems which killed the project<br/>
1) the lack of an Asian host/narrator who is <br/>
a) famous b) speaks English<br/>
2) overall fear of putting money on something risky HOWEVER...the idea<br/>
is OUT there and there is no stopping someone from the company to<br/>
pitch this idea elsewhere<br/>
<br/>
Strange stuff the company didn't pursue but SHOULD HAVE<br/>
the fact that Spielberg is working on Memoirs of a Geisha<br/>
Memoirs...has NOTHING to do with the Shinsengumi HOWEVER what is<br/>
important in the industry are "key" words<br/>
Samurai + Geisha<br/>
Memoirs can lead back to the topic of samurai and importing the<br/>
Shinsengumi at the right time may be successful<br/>
<br/>
An example of "key" words is this...When we discuss things about the<br/>
Shinsengumi...the WORD Shinsengumi is TOO hard for these people (these<br/>
people DO NOT know the difference between Emperor and Shogun, Japan<br/>
and China and overall know very little about the 19th century).  So<br/>
Shinsengumi had to be abandoned for Shogun's Swat Team or just "Swat<br/>
TEam" and finally "team".<br/>
<br/>
Why would a company be filled with ignorant people?  The specific<br/>
folks are the important people.  Details like history would be handled<br/>
by knowledgeable people later...the first step is just to sell the idea.<br/>
<br/>
I would have mentioned this project earlier but I refrained from doing<br/>
so only because it was not something definate.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, it totally took me away from my original<br/>
goals/projects.  Yes, it was a waste of time but it gave me incredible<br/>
insight into the business and why we have so many bad movies and poor<br/>
documentaries.  The people who control what we hear and see aren't<br/>
necessarily interested in doing something new and fresh.<br/>
<br/>
I assure you all that we pushed different aspects of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
Everything from the red-light district patrols, swords, martial arts<br/>
mayhem (ACTION!!!!), political intrigue, internal strife...everything<br/>
which as made the Shinsengumi a source of fascination.<br/>
<br/>
AS of this moment this project has been cast aside for good because<br/>
these people have moved onto bigger and better projects.<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
tired soooo tired.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that on a personal level I feel that the<br/>
Shinsengumi's story has "value" and would affect any viewer in many<br/>
ways...that was my sincere motivation for all of this work (sigh)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204545381">That's unfortunate to hear, but the sad truth.  The guys who fork <br/>
have the money usually know the least.  Probably explains why <br/>
everything is a remake or a sequel.  There are a couple problems <br/>
though.  I don't think the American public would warm up to the <br/>
Shinsengumi like the Japanese do.  It's a part of their society, and <br/>
what they feel are part of who they are.  The American audience, on <br/>
the other hand, view samurai only in the romantic/robotic <br/>
personality.  It's doubtful the mainstream will accept a "down-and-<br/>
dirty" fighting unit like the Shinsengumi, portrayed with an eye for <br/>
accuracy.  At least not pay to see it.<br/>

too bad it fell apart.  Have you considered something along the <br/>

be the type to jump all over something like this.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192957528">Hi Sec,<br/>
<br/>
So this is the project you were talking to me about! I commend you <br/>
for this more than A+ effort. You are right at least the idea is out <br/>
there and someone will definitely pick it up sooner or later. The <br/>
fact that you came SO CLOSE, is victory enough itself. Thank you!<br/>

Kondou, Hijikata, Okita, and Saitou are surely watching you. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Confusion of the Japanese culture by a Hollywood film and the China <br/>
culture is really severe. <br/>
(But since I cannot do distinction of the Europe culture, I cannot <br/>
blame Hollywood.)^^;;; <br/>
I think it very difficult that Shinsengumi is understood by many <br/>
people in countries other than Japan. <br/>
Therefore, I was truly surprised when SHQ was got to know.<br/>
I was very glad that people who love Shinsengumi like me were also <br/>
in overseas. <br/>
I appreciate your efforts. <br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-578518760">Actually, one of the more intelligent people wanted to basically <br/>
revise the Shinsengumi entirely to adjust to American tastes as I <br/>
mentioned even modernize them.  The setting would be changed but <br/>
political and internal conflict/story would be the same.  It would <br/>
be an alternate universe but not "fantasy".  And the cast would be <br/>
PC, multiethnic and have female captains.  They received screenshots <br/>
of Jin-Roh:The Wolf Brigade and picked up on the idea.  So really, <br/>
the basic idea of the Shinsengumi, and swords+martial arts was <br/>
appealing.  The financial resources was an issue and a strong <br/>
personality/host to draw an audience was a major obstacle.  As I <br/>
mentioned ideas are stolen all the time.  Many people have been <br/>
exposed to the Shinsengumi at the same time and not always in a <br/>
formal meeting setting...any one of these people can take the idea <br/>
to another company.<br/>
<br/>
The company specializes in documentaries and needed ideas to pitch <br/>
to a cable channel.  NOt the History channel but similar.  In fact <br/>
the idea of something to experiment with such as cutting tests with <br/>
swords was discussed.  They like Action+History under the mask of <br/>
education so to speak and this is why they were very open to the <br/>
idea in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
"the Wolves" were part of our list of key words but they warmed up <br/>
to swat team faster.  Whatever works for them.  To these folks "The <br/>
wolves of Mibu" would be too long...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Recommend Tamilyn Tomita.  Speaks excellent English, is Japanese, <br/>
> and HOT!!!  Kind of famous.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, there are many famous Japanese who can speak English just fine <br/>
the problem is the person has no "name recognition" with an American <br/>
audience.  This goes back to how there aren't many Asians in showbiz <br/>
to begin with.  The authoriy figure who submitted a formal proposal <br/>
would, to us, be a good host but there were certain reasons why the <br/>
company did not use this person or contact him back ASAP.<br/>
