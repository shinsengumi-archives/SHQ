<h3>intro/re-intro questions</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-435994976">1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever<br/>
<br/>
Barbara Sheridan a/k/a/ financier for the SHQ website<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
2) How did you “discover” the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
I fell madly in fangirl love the minute I saw Saitou Hajime in Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin. Searched online found he was a real person and an obsession was <br/>
born ^_^<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
<br/>
Saitou will always be near and dear to my heart since he was &quot;the first&quot; <br/>
but I like hearing more about Takeda Kanryuusai, Nagakura Shinpachi, <br/>
Todou Heisuke and those silk-loving boys form Hitachi--Suzuki Mikisaburo <br/>
and his big brother Itou Kashitaro<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
<br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane all of the anime and the current translated manga, <br/>
The entire NHK series, Shinsengumi Kepproku, When the Last Sword is <br/>
Drawn (Mibu Gishi Den) Taboo (Gohatto), Band of Assassins, Shinsengumi <br/>
Chronicles, Okita Souji (The Last Swordsman), Cruel Story at the end of <br/>
the Tokugawa Shogunate, the end of Sword of Doom and how can we forget <br/>
Kunoichi Deadly Mirage<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>
think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
What is not to love about Itou & Takeda in the NHK drama???? Nagakura <br/>
was good but too old.<br/>
<br/>
For Saitou it&#39;s a tie between NHK and Mibu Gishi Den both had that RK <br/>
bada$$ thing down to a &quot;T&quot; but I think I have to give the edge to NHK <br/>
because he was the perfect age.<br/>
<br/>
The Okita winner is a tie between Mibu Gishi Den&#39;s kicka$$, blood <br/>
spewing Okita and the all around excellent Shinsengumi Kepproku version<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata was best in Shinsengumi Kepproku followed closely by the man <br/>
you love to hate in NHK and we will forget that Taboo Hijikata ever existed<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>
particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what became of the Itou Dojo in Edo after Itou <br/>
left/died? Did he have a successor?<br/>
<br/>

That&#39;s okay.  Takeshi has ONE fangirl alive and kicking in this world.  :-D  (He was WAY too old for the role... no argument about that... but I liked the take on the torment inside the man.)  Now that I think about it, Gohatto was my TRUE introduction to the Shinsengumi... I saw the film long before RK... but I didn&#39;t make the connection until after I saw RK.  And it was Takeshi&#39;s performance that made me think of the film and how much I had liked it... enough for me to pick it up as a possible purchase one day and go &quot;WOW!!!  THAT WAS ABOUT THE SHINSENGUMI!&quot;  Of course, there was no question of me purchasing it then.  :-D  It was my first piece of Shinsengumi merchandise.<br/>

<br/><br/>

 <br/>
Kaneyoshi would be nice. K would even be better. :D<br/>
 <br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
2) How did you �discover� the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
Research. For the RPG I&#39;m in (isn&#39;t that fun?) and well, Rurouni Kenshin. I noticed that it&#39;s usually the precursor to most Shinsengumi fans, myself included, unless they have access to NHK (or were paying attention, at least ^^;;). We have NHK here but, regrettably, I wasn&#39;t watching closely enough to have seen the series coming... :&#39;(<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it quite obvious? :D I have an irrepressible flair for the dramatic. And as all fangirls go... *squee*! Kidding. I really don&#39;t know; maybe because I admire his strength and his genius. The ferocity that&#39;s hidden behind that amiable face. As I said, an &quot;irreressible flair for the dramatic&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
And Saitoh. He creeps the hell out of me. Sheer viciousness. He&#39;s not just your typical bad boy (don&#39;t we just love those?)<br/>
 <br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
<br/>
*sniff* Rurouni Kenshin... although I am planning on getting my hands on my own set of the Peacemaker series, and vowed to tune into NHK more frequently than I used to... And I&#39;ve been badgering the people at Power Books to look for novels/books/whathaveyous about them. Is &quot;Of Spirits Walking in the Red Shadow&quot; Shinsengumi-centric?<br/>
 <br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>
think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea... <br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>
particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... I&#39;ll get back to you on that... :D<br/>
 <br/>
