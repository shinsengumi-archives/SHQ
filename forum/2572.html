<h3>Essay Challenge W/ Prize</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-397563099">S "As for the role of the Shinsengumi in the deaths of Ito, Takeda and<br/>
Yamanami, I am not sure that fans of the taiga or anime depictions<br/>
will like what is presented here. It certainly isn't the noble version<br/>
of history that the taiga tries to portray."<br/>
<br/>
The Taiga drama is definately just an inspirational drama. I know what<br/>
S is talking about, "noble version of history" is really just a dream.<br/>
Perhaps that is the value of fiction, to allow people to define on<br/>
their own what is "good" which may be difficult if nearly impossible<br/>
to find in reality. So in the end perhaps we just internalize what is<br/>
heroism and look to ourselves for that ideal.<br/>
<br/>
First the prize:  Brand new copy of Romulus Hillsborough's book<br/>
shipped right to your door from Amazon. Or, one brand new Shinsengumi<br/>
related dvd. ***see bottom for other possible prize<br/>
<br/>
How to win: write the most awesome, compelling essay to justify the<br/>
pragmatics of attacking Aizu you have to be a 110% hardcore advocate<br/>
for the Imperialists. Nobody is going to shred your argument---however<br/>
they must be sound/logical/organized and backed up with atleast 5<br/>
textual sources (no websites/online encyclopedias).  Your essay will<br/>
be donated to shinsengumihq.com but will remain your property under<br/>
your name.  file will be posted as a adobe pdf.<br/>
<br/>
As it stands, the northern alliance was actually the last stronghold<br/>
for the bakufu.  Enomoto had other plans.  <br/>
<br/>
Reason:  The most ideal way of studying this era is to examine it in<br/>
"teams".  EAch team handles a domain such as Tosa, Satsuma, Choshu,<br/>
Aizu, Imperial FAmily, Shogunate and freeby foreign powers. EAch team<br/>
should be an advocate for his or her domain and use only the reasons<br/>
or "evidence" available to people at that time. Get in a room and<br/>
argue it out.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatley, we're just a bunch of fans---we don't have all day to<br/>
study all sides of the issue.  But we know that more than one side<br/>
needs to be studied.<br/>
<br/>
Hence, this contest is a "shortcut" for just compiling facts.  <br/>
<br/>
Length of paper---as long or short as you want.  We just want the<br/>
facts.  If your paper ends up being 50% the philosophical motivations<br/>
of the Imperialists then you need to look more carefully at the<br/>
historical details.  Short sentences are good.<br/>
<br/>
Note: you must be careful in citing your sources, use footnotes and a<br/>
bibliography using MLA format----paraphrasing someone else's words too<br/>
closely also constitutes plagiarism.<br/>
<br/>
Deadline NOvember 18<br/>
<br/>
If the essay is SO truly jaw-droppingly awesome to convert a<br/>
Shinsengumi fan to the side of the imperialists then you may win a<br/>
Shinsengumi haori made in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
This is an exercise in going to the "other side". <br/>

Wait a min... This part confused me a bit.   Do you<br/>
mean that this is this up (or will go up) on the<br/>
message boards for us to gather & share more info?  <br/>
It might just be me... but I just really didn't get<br/>
this part.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it's me.  (^_^) I'm sorry.<br/>
What I meant is---in an ideal situation, studying this era in teams<br/>
would be the best way to learn.  A book written by authors, each a<br/>
specialist in his or her field would be the ultimate book.  It is<br/>
simply too much for one academic to handle this ENTIRE CONFLICT alone.<br/>
<br/>
So that was just an idea.<br/>
<br/>
What will happen in such a learning setting is...<br/>
Loyalists "you, Aizu, don't you get it? The Shogun abdicated already<br/>
you lost now go bye bye."<br/>
Aizu "yes we know that but how come you are gathering forces to march<br/>
against us?  We are negotiating with you and also writing letters--can<br/>
you hold your troops back?"<br/>
<br/>
But such a dialogue can even be backed up with actual documents:<br/>
Matsudaira Katamori<br/>
"The recent...turn of events is ultimately due to my incompetence...I<br/>
have disgraced myself completely...while in Edo, I had hoped to take<br/>
immediate action that would redress the situation.  But the shogun was<br/>
occupied with his own affairs , and so I decided to return to Aizu for<br/>
the time being.  We have now been told that the government has ordered<br/>
several domains to punish Aizu with military force.  If their troops<br/>
advance to our borders, we have no choice but to make full<br/>
preparations for war." (p.40 Shiba Goro's REMEMBERING AIZU)<br/>
<br/>
Aizu here there and everywhere.  Hillsborough uses Nagakura's work<br/>
alot, so you will read of Nagakura and Harada wanting to head to<br/>
Aizu---however Kondou and Hijikata infected with the "germ of<br/>
self-importance" would not allow that unless the two submitted<br/>
themselves as vassals.<br/>
<br/>
What participants will realize and experience in a controlled<br/>
historical RPG are the passions and political reasonings behind each<br/>
side of the conflict. You will then understand why people gambled<br/>
their lives for their cause. However, RPGs are often taken<br/>
"personally" and learning may not occur.  RPGs also take a huge amount<br/>
of time.  A transcript of such a group effort may be a valuable source<br/>
for people who are not inclined to read the standard 2-5 pound texts<br/>
on the collapse of the Shogunate.<br/>
<br/>
We no longer have a messageboard.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumiMB.com">http://www.shinsengumiMB.com</a> points<br/>
to this mailing list.  We previously had a messageboard (at a cost)<br/>
however it is gone now.  Other fans can take the initiative and work<br/>
on this.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.red-bird.org">http://www.red-bird.org</a> kindly offered board space, and this<br/>
site is studying Choshu.<br/>
<br/>
Or people can build their own websites which are more professional<br/>
than what Hillsborough has offered in this groundbreaking book.  <br/>
He may have been reacting to the unrestrained glorification of the<br/>
Shinsengumi which was at its peak while he was writing this book. <br/>
Hence his sweeping label "the most notorious band of killers in<br/>
Japanese history." (Hillsborough 33). Wow, even if the Shinsengumi<br/>
[tried] they may not even been able to compete with the record of some<br/>
other groups of killers in more recent Japanese history.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a><br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
In constructing the narrative of Hijikata's move to Hakodate<br/>
Hillsborough does NOT use YOUNG JAPAN by Black (this book has been<br/>
used by nearly all major works on the Bakumatsu)<br/>
If you want to read about Ueno/Shogitai (Harada), Aizu, and Hakodate<br/>
download <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/YoungJapanEnomoto.pdf">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/YoungJapanEnomoto.pdf</a> <br/>
(1.35 mb)  You will then realize why no one wanted to be Enomoto's pen<br/>
pal XD<br/>

Click on "timeline", go to the year ***1906 and click on the link<br/>
which will take you to a description of the interior of the school and<br/>
dorm.<br/>
Tokyo was a "dorm mother" she would've been very familiar with the<br/>
structure described. <br/>
*Yes, Mr. Fujita Goro was still working at the school in 1906</div>
