<h3>Shinsengumi RPG - Lair of the Miburo</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-71824552">We&#39;re starting an RPG on the LiveJournal called Lair of the Miburo. <br/>
It will take a bit for the game to get started, because as of yet we <br/>
don&#39;t even have a background story or anything. We will be doing a <br/>
brief chat session on the message board around 9:00pm EST to try to <br/>
nail this down. Feel free to join in the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I need anyone interested to e-mail me, Barb, or phil and tell <br/>
us the character you want to be. You MUST contact one of us because <br/>
the membership into the RPG is restricted to invitation only in order <br/>
to prevent passers-by from making pointless entries.  Hurry, because <br/>
the main men will go fast. We also need people to play the Ishin <br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
So far taken characters are: Hijikata, Ito, Miki(Suzuki), Saito, and <br/>
Kondo. Right now the rest of the Shinsengumi are fair game, so chose <br/>
quickly!<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you confirm the character is still open before you register <br/>
with LiveJournal, since you&#39;ll want to do so under the character&#39;s <br/>
name. Once you&#39;re registered with the community, please refrain from <br/>
making posts until the game is officially underway. We will also have <br/>
a seperate mailing list for OOC discussions and questions on the RPG. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some slight corrections to the above posts. Send your e-mails to phil. It will be easier if one person is keeping track of everything.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I forgot that someone had already indicated they wanted to play Okita. It&#39;s not certain at this time they will join the game, but consider him claimed until we get confirmation one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s who&#39;s playing who so far:<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata - me<br/>
Ito - Barb<br/>
Suzuki - phil<br/>
Saito - Angrybee<br/>
Kondo - wounds<br/>
Okita - Aurus(?)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for any confusion. I&#39;m still confused myself!<br/>
