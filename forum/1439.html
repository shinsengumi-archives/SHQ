<h3>Shinsengumi RPG - Lair of the Miburo</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-71824552">We're starting an RPG on the LiveJournal called Lair of the Miburo. <br/>
It will take a bit for the game to get started, because as of yet we <br/>
don't even have a background story or anything. We will be doing a <br/>
brief chat session on the message board around 9:00pm EST to try to <br/>
nail this down. Feel free to join in the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I need anyone interested to e-mail me, Barb, or phil and tell <br/>
us the character you want to be. You MUST contact one of us because <br/>
the membership into the RPG is restricted to invitation only in order <br/>
to prevent passers-by from making pointless entries.  Hurry, because <br/>
the main men will go fast. We also need people to play the Ishin <br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
So far taken characters are: Hijikata, Ito, Miki(Suzuki), Saito, and <br/>
Kondo. Right now the rest of the Shinsengumi are fair game, so chose <br/>
quickly!<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you confirm the character is still open before you register <br/>
with LiveJournal, since you'll want to do so under the character's <br/>
name. Once you're registered with the community, please refrain from <br/>
making posts until the game is officially underway. We will also have <br/>
a seperate mailing list for OOC discussions and questions on the RPG. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some slight corrections to the above posts. Send your e-mails to phil. It will be easier if one person is keeping track of everything.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I forgot that someone had already indicated they wanted to play Okita. It's not certain at this time they will join the game, but consider him claimed until we get confirmation one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Here's who's playing who so far:<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata - me<br/>
Ito - Barb<br/>
Suzuki - phil<br/>
Saito - Angrybee<br/>
Kondo - wounds<br/>
Okita - Aurus(?)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for any confusion. I'm still confused myself!<br/>
