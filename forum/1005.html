<h3>Hellos and First Impressions.</h3>
by <i>Mirel</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-553686655">Konnichi wa minna-san!<br/>
I'm new here and I'm totally excited to finally get myself in this group (I <br/>
was having arguments with Yahoo about the existence of my account).  I am <br/>
really interested in learning all I can about the Shinsengumi and its <br/>
members, and I've heard this is THE PLACE to get and share info in English.<br/>
Just as an intro, I'll give a quick rundown of what I'm into, ne?  Let's <br/>
see, my fav. member is Saitou Hajime, although Peacemaker Kurogane has <br/>
gotten me quite curious about Harada Sanosuke as well.  As for anime, I've <br/>
seen Kenshin and PMK and I am digging for more.  In manga, I've read a <br/>
bunch of PMK and I have a bunch of scanlations sitting on my computer <br/>
waiting for attention.  As for live action stuff, this is where I am <br/>
horribly deficient, but I hope to fix that soon!<br/>
I've also taken two years of Japanese and would be going into my 3rd year <br/>
if it weren't for the fact that I'm going to Tanzania this fall.  I love <br/>
learning about other aspects Japanese history outside of the Shinsengumi <br/>
and the areas I'm most interested in include the Sengoku jidai (age of <br/>
civil wars), the Edo period, and the Meiji Restoration.<br/>
Also, I'm currently working on a full Shinsengumi uniform (minus the armor, <br/>
because that would be really hard to make) to wear to this year's Otakon in <br/>
Baltimore, so any tips on such would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Well that's about it!<br/>
I look forward to many more e-mails wrought with Shinsengumi goodness!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295042438">Hey!  Someone I recognize from the LJ!!  (Not that there's anything <br/>
going on over there at the moment.)  Glad you got things straightened <br/>
out with Yahoo... I *know* how long THAT can take.   <br/>
<br/>
We've gots lots of Saitou fans and some PMK Harada fans.  I'll let <br/>
past messages from Barb introduce you to the stylish-fundoshi version <br/>
of Harada from the live-action drama from NHK.  :-D  I'm just about <br/>
to get started watching some of that series.  Lots of references to <br/>
film and television series featuring the Shinsengumi & the times... <br/>
unfortunatly buried in messages right now (unless someone has <br/>
compiled a film/tv list and posted it to Files?).  If you get <br/>
confused like I do keeping them all straight, don't hesitate to ask <br/>
questions.  Oh, and if you haven't already, consider signing up on <br/>
miburo so you can access the files that are over there.  It's mostly <br/>
acting as storage space and full of info.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/miburo">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/miburo</a> .<br/>
<br/>
So... Japanese language skills, eh?  (very wicked grin, rubbing <br/>
hands... and not just me)  Two years or three, you HAVE to be better <br/>
than babelfish...  :-D<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to have any translation skills to be welcome.  We're <br/>
always glad to have more miburo fans to join the fun.<br/>

action/chambara films you'll get there. TRUST ME.... Hmm what else? <br/>
Oh let me introduce myself to you, I'm wounds the MOST LOYAL fan of <br/>
Saitou-sama. I'm fond of the big three too, most specially Kondou but <br/>
with the new info I'm hearing that might change. *sigh*<br/>
