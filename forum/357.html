<div id="ygrps-yiv-912955653"><<I understand the PMK Nagakura version is very cute but the site I<br/>
went to was obviously referring to the historic people because (many<br/>
references to historic S.H.) although the women were attracted to<br/>
Hijikata they were kind of "afraid" of him.>><br/>
<br/>
Maybe many of those folks have had the opportunity to read the book he <br/>
wrote. Perhaps he speaks of himself and those he came in contact with in <br/>
such a way that he comes across as a general "nice guy".<br/>
<br/>
I know that I would certainly LOVE to learn more about the Shinsengumi <br/>
members not only during their time in Kyoto but also before and after. <br/>
Maybe, just maybe the Hillsborough book will give us that. I was able to <br/>
get his Samurai Sketches through the library and I thought it was very <br/>
well done, it's a definite "have to buy" book on my list.<br/>
