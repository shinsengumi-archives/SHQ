<h3>SHQ.com UPDATES</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959657583">Hello,<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa (M) added a fact sheet about Matsudaira Katamori<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/katamorifacts1.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/katamorifacts1.htm</a><br/>
please check it out....if there are any comments/corrections and <br/>
suggestions about anything please contact shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------<br/>
[Off-Topic] *for new members who have never read one of my film <br/>
rants before*<br/>
I highly recommend the Christmas movie TOKYO GODFATHERS (on dvd <br/>
available at Blockbuster) from the same diretor of PERFECT BLUE and <br/>
***MILLENIUM ACTRESS*** (contains Shinsengumi cameo AND the 2nd disk <br/>
shows a Shinsengumi cosplayer they used as a model AND starring RK <br/>
Saitou's voice actor Hiroaki Suzuoki AND animates Boshin War art).<br/>
<br/>
***MILLENIUM ACTRESS*** basically takes you on a tour of Japanese <br/>
history via film...and plenty of inside jokes for people who love <br/>
chambara....film made me cry...<br/>
<br/>
yes I know from the title TOKYO GODFATHERS it doesn't sound like a <br/>
Christmas movie...but trust me it IS a great film for the holidays <br/>
and deserves alot of attention...all 3 OUTSTANDING films by the <br/>
director Satoshi Kon...please do yourself a favor and view these <br/>
great works<br/>
<br/>
lastly<br/>
if you haven't already seen this...<br/>

<h3>OST Millenium Actress (Sennen Joyu)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457271324">Many years back there was discussion on the internet about how the film <br/>
possibly contained a cameo of Rurouni Kenshin in the animated feature <br/>
Millenium Actress.  Essentially someone saw a red headress in the Boshin <br/>
War painting (it's an exact copy of a famous ukiyo-e) and they thought it <br/>
was the manga/anime character.  It's an honest mistake (^_^) still <br/>
perhaps floating on a fan messageboard.<br/>
<br/>
I still encourage people who have exhausted the live-action Shinsengumi <br/>
films to rent this film---now available widely in vid stores across the USA.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Recently I had to thank someone for finding me a rare work of music so I <br/>
had to extract the entire OST of M.A. as a trade---and I wanted to share it <br/>
here as well.<br/>
<br/>
Basic info:<br/>

<br/>
Millenium Actress is a film .. about films, namely the golden era of <br/>
Japanese cinema paralleled with the history of Japan from ancient to <br/>
modern times (including wars).  The art and writing of this work is top <br/>
notch.  If you watch the film and keep in mind that Chiyoko the main <br/>
character -is- Japan you get a very good interpretation because her <br/>
maturity during various periods in history is very fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all tracks are instrumental with a bit of vocals.  However the last <br/>
song is entirely in Japanese and you can preview it here:  <br/>

<br/>
the rest of the OST has a very interesting spiritual, adventure and <br/>
technology mix to it (because the tracks are based on the movies the main <br/>
character, an actress, performs in).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! <br/>

from Japan---the CD comes with a music vid)<br/>
<br/>
do not attempt to download this OST from torrent/anime sites as their <br/>
tracks are incomplete or damaged</div>
