<h3>Scanned images from 1943 Sagara biography</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714006475">If I live to be 100, it still wouldn&#39;t be enough time to properly thank Sec for, first, getting hold of this book, and, second, doing scanning.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Sagara Souzou to sono doushi&quot; is 600+ pages that took Hasegawa Shin ten years to research.  It has to be *the* source for information on him and all its secrets are locked away from me until I learn to read Japanese.  As if I needed more motivation... Saitou-san was enough.<br/>
 <br/>
The 1943 edition (which may be the first it was published) has several pages of plates, which appear to be missing from subsequent editions.  (Tama... this is what is missing from your edition that I asked you about.)  I have no idea what they&#39;re all about other than image 2 to the right has to be an early picture of the main stone memorial at the Sakigaki-zuka/Sagara-zuka in Shimosuwa that the Meiji govt. allowed Ochiai Akira to set up in Meiji 3/1870  (and is that Suzuki&#39;s fan to the left or someone else&#39;s?) and the man in image 9 is Saitou Nobuyuki.  Would love to know who the sour-looking man in image 8 is... *please* don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s *HIM*.  :-D<br/>
 <br/>
The images are HUGE, so be patient in allowing the pages to upload AND (especially) if they become temporarily unavailable (they&#39;ll reappear within the hour... just these images eats up over 7MB... they&#39;re stored in their own space).  I was too anxious to make them available to immediately work on resizing or any other space saving tricks.  There are 15 images spread over 2 pages.  Anyone willing to translate captions, I&#39;d love to include those with the images.  (I do have zooms of some of the captions if they&#39;re unreadable, but they seem pretty clear... good job, Sec).  The pages are linked to each other, but the separate URLs are:<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128860452">I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s Sagara-san who&#39;s responsible.  He wants us to know his story.  Maybe even especially us &quot;barbarians.&quot;  (Okay, so he chose a bunch of Shinsengumi fans to get it done... he&#39;s got the connections.)<br/>
 <br/>
As soon as I can get the thing uploaded into some usable space, I&#39;ll post a URL for the whole page so the caption can be read/translated.  The book itself is not easy to translate --- Tama and another man in Japan are both having difficulty reading the text as it&#39;s in such an old form.  I know the little boy is Kawajirou, Sagara&#39;s son, and I&#39;m betting that one of the ladies (probably the one seated) is Kimura Hama, Sagara&#39;s sister.  (At least, I hope it is.)  The man standing next to the monument in an image I uploaded yesterday is the grandson, Kimura Kametarou, when he was 28 --- just a year or two shy of his grandfather&#39;s age when he was executed --- and I think M managed to piece out that the picture was taken in April of Taisho 5.  Both his mother and father were Kojima, so I expect he probably favors the family.  I wish we could see the mon on his sleeve.  It&#39;s probably too much to think he might&#39;ve worn a Kojima or Sagara mon in honor of being at the monument in April.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, a comment about the fan that&#39;s in that previous image... that&#39;s Sagara&#39;s handwriting on the fan and it&#39;s a poem.  The fan and Sagara&#39;s bloody topknot were sent to Kawajirou, who kept them hidden away.  Not sure *who* sent the items to the boy, but it was either at Sagara&#39;s request or the government sent them.  A very generous gentleman in Japan not associated with this list (at least I don&#39;t think he is) is going to be contacting the Folklore Museum in Shimosuwa to see if they can provide him with the text on the fan.  I&#39;m deeply touched he would do that.<br/>
 <br/>
To say I am extremely emotional after this is an understatement, but to everyone who has been helping in this quest --- you&#39;re the greatest!!<br/>

I know spiritus saitou was just kidding....but as of this evening <br/>
after scanning the book and photocopying every page I just realized <br/>
that I was able to get the book due to strange circumstances<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3 brings out Tadanobu Asano, Koichi SAto plushies and <br/>
JO Odagiri pillow and places right hand over these 3 *sacred* fangirl <br/>
objects.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I now take the oath of honesty and complete sincerity in relating <br/>
the following series of incidents......<br/>
<br/>
around 3 weeks ago I put in the interlibrary loan request for this <br/>
specific edition of the book, even after knowing that another SHQ <br/>
member here made a similar attempt and could not acquire the book <br/>
from the LIbrary of Congress for some reason.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to check at the circulation desk almost every other day due to <br/>
the fact that I need books for my formal research (not Japan <br/>
related).  I got the Sagara book 2 days ago and commenced scanning <br/>
and photocopying etc.  I returned the book to the circulation desk <br/>
and reclaimed by driver&#39;s license and went online to check my library <br/>
account to see if my other requests have been processed....then<br/>
<br/>
my account says my request for the Sagara book &quot;HAS BEEN DECLINED&quot;<br/>
dated **** 7 days before I actually had the book in hand ****<br/>
<br/>
now it was weird that it took like 3 weeks to get the book (because <br/>
the turn around time is usually VERY FAST like 7-10 days)...but <br/>
clearly I got the book due to an ERROR.  <br/>
<br/>
I assume someone at the library of congress will be like <br/>
clerk 1 &quot;so shouldn&#39;t we put that Sagara book in the preservation or <br/>
TO BE REPAIRED DEPT&quot;<br/>
<br/>
clerk 2 &quot;I just mailed it out to the out of state university&quot;<br/>
<br/>
clerk 1 &quot;Nooooo, we rejectd that request&quot;<br/>
<br/>
clerk 2 &quot;oh, SH*T&quot;<br/>
<br/>
so my friends this is yet another interesting coincedences to add to <br/>
the list....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If spiritus Saitou recalls I emailed her well before getting the book <br/>
to whine that my request is taking like 3 weeks to go through, and M <br/>
mentioned that he was unable to acquire the book....so I have <br/>
witnesses....<br/>

M & I run into strange coincidences like this all the time when it comes to Sagara info.  It is really, *really* weird.  It&#39;s just that it&#39;s become so commonplace that it is almost like a joke to me.  This story of yours, though, takes the prize.  It&#39;s an anecdote worth keeping.  Thanks for sharing it.<br/>
