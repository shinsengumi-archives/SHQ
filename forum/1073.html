<h3>OT: Just another article of a Nipon hater...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401570880">I was looking for some good Japanese textbooks to help in my study of <br/>
Nihonggo when I came across this article. I was almost tempted to <br/>
send the guy a dispute but thought better of it since it would be a <br/>
waste of my time to convince him otherwise. However I am posting it <br/>
here just to show how narrow minded some people are and to alleviate <br/>
the pounding in my head...<br/>

Here's the link if anyone is interested...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385112700">Grace I think its a joke...I found it too a long time ago and posted a<br/>
link at the miburo list...read the end of the article..the most<br/>
devoted students of Japanese at the univ. where I got my undergrad<br/>
degree were passing it around and even wrote the link on the board<br/>
(one of my class sessions was held in a foreign language<br/>
building)...anyways those students thought it was a riot and they<br/>
majored in Japanese.  Don't worry about it ^_^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466133087">At the very bottom, it says:<br/>
<br/>
Author's Note:This whole essay, although sprinkled with truisms here and <br/>
there, is a joke and should be taken like one. I'm actually a Japanese major <br/>
myself, and even if I've given it a bit of a hard time, I love the Japanese <br/>
language, and I think everyone should give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
You should just be ready for a whole lot of pain.<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY LANGUAGE LEARNING!<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
Even so, my initial reaction was "Oh shut up." And this ass calls himself a <br/>
Japanese major. Such blatant disrespect...<br/>
