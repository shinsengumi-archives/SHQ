<h3>Compiled Maps [relevant to Meiji E. ~ Fujita Family]</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576963733">2 of the 3 maps in the file are directly relevant to the Fujita <br/>
family during the Meiji<br/>
<br/>
1890s map from Higuchi Ichiyo (Meiji Era novelist who was a neighbor <br/>
to the Fujita Family) according to Tama, a member here on the list, <br/>
Higuchi even mentions Mr. Fujita in relation to her father (who <br/>
worked in the TMPD-Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept) in one of her <br/>
diaries (not yet fully translated into English).  It is not strange <br/>
if neighbors who worked in the same  field new each other very <br/>
well.  I have discussed this connection already on <br/>

<br/>
***please note that the Fujita family lived in Hongo..but <br/>
specifically in the BUNKYO WARD which bordered with Koishikawa a <br/>
more upscale neighborhood<br/>
<br/>
The other map &quot;1910&quot; is the MOST IMPORTANT<br/>
<br/>
1) look for the HIGHER NORMAL SCHOOL FOR GIRLS this was Tokio/Goro&#39;s <br/>
place of employment (don&#39;t confuse it with the brand new schools---<br/>
most of which were also connected to the HNSfor Girls)<br/>
<br/>
2) Look for Kano&#39;s dojo (note the term jiujitsu used---actually JUDO <br/>
is used in most texts to seperate it from the older schools)<br/>
I mentioned recently the intriguing connection between Kano Jigoro <br/>
(Pres. of the Normal School for men), and Aizu. Note it is right in <br/>
the Koishikawa area<br/>
<br/>
3) Koishikawa and why is it important in regards to the Fujita family<br/>
a) Koishikawa was the birthplace of Matsudaira Tsuneo (son of <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori) so we know that the Matsudaira mansion was <br/>
right there in Koishikawa<br/>
b) atleast 2 of the Fujita family friends lived right there in <br/>
Koishikawa too, the Takamine and Yamakawa (both discussed on <br/>
Saitou&#39;s page)<br/>
<br/>
[conclusion] we have &quot;Little Aizu&quot; in Tokyo, this is why Mr. and <br/>
Mrs. Fujita had visitors such as the young daughters of Takamine <br/>
