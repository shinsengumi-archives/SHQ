<h3>Timeline</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120637214">Hard at work on the Aizu chronology that is the preliminary element of my <br/>
senior thesis...have gotten ahold of the school&#39;s copy of Conrad Totman&#39;s <br/>
magnum opus &quot;Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;...my timeline is now to 7 <br/>
pages and runs from Ieyasu&#39;s victory at Sekigahara in 1600 all the way <br/>
through to the reconstruction of Aizu Castle in the 1950s, with the bulk of <br/>
the timeline being the 1860s and thereabouts.<br/>
<br/>
Geez,  I thought Bakufu politics was complicated...it is MUCH, MUCH  more <br/>
screwed up than I thought...Katamori got appointed to the Bakufu as an <br/>
advisor (san&#39;yo), and got Matsudaira Shungaku of Fukui appointed...and <br/>
Shungaku screwed things up in a lot of ways, but helped in other ways-- a <br/>
HUGE difference being that Shungaku didn&#39;t know when to watch his mouth, <br/>
whereas Katamori knew tact and patience. Shungaku essentially used the <br/>
oldest trick in the book-- the &quot;I have a headache, I&#39;m going home&quot; excuse to <br/>
twist the Shogunate&#39;s arm into doing whatever he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Ouch. Ow. Some headache, all right...<br/>
