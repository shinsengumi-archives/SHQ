<h3>Aizu/Nagaoka/Shonai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873133109">Since we now have 2 lists, and not everyone is in the new one yet, I'm going <br/>
to post to both...<br/>
<br/>
I found an article about the Echigo War last night-- the prelude to the <br/>
Battle of Aizu. Aizu was deeply involved in this war, and caused a lot of <br/>
damage to the "Imperial" side-- apparently, at one point, out of seven <br/>
engagements, the "Imperials" only won one. The most crushing victory for the <br/>
northern domains was the Battle of Enoki Pass in early July.<br/>
<br/>
If some of you will recall, I mentioned in a translated document a while ago <br/>
that Matsudaira Katamori "shouted" at Hijikata to run to Shonai and get <br/>
reinforcements. Apparently, Shonai, Aizu, and Yonezawa were the 3 major <br/>
domains surrounding Echigo, and also the leading domains in the 10 or so <br/>
which formed the "Northern Confederacy".<br/>
<br/>
The most incredible story from the Echigo War is that of Nagaoka Castle. It <br/>
sounds like a harbinger of Aizu every time I read about it-- ALL the people <br/>
of the domain stood up together against the Satsuma and Choshuu invaders. <br/>
Nagaoka fielded 1,500 men. 317 people were killed in action, 266 wounded. <br/>
Over 3,000 of its houses were destroyed, its castle was totally wiped off <br/>
the face of the earth, and the domain was reduced from a 74,000 koku-sized <br/>
territory to one of 24,000.<br/>
<br/>
What the "Imperials" did makes me sick...<br/>
