<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701889104">I know there are some other fans of Alexander the Great here and fans of history in general, so I thought I'd pass along this info since I just alerted my Hephaistion list.  I accidentally stumbled upon it when RealPlayer opened so I could play a CD while I work.  Such a nice surprise, but what a wait I have!<br/>
 <br/>
Release of Oliver Stone's Alexander film (there are two coming out... the other by the director of "Moulin Rouge") is set for November 5, 2004.  There's a trailer available on the official site:<br/>
