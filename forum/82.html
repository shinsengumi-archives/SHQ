<h3>Suggestion about posting files to SHQ</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-808222695">I want to stress that this is just a SUGGESTION. We're not going to <br/>
play dictator with you or anything! <br/>
<br/>
As you all know, we want the files to remain strictly text files. <br/>
That generally means that they're some sort of wordprocessor file. <br/>
The trouble I've run into with those is that they can occasionally be <br/>
hard to open. Also, they can involve extra work when it comes time to <br/>
transfer the info to the website.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion we would like to make is that if you have the "publish <br/>
to html" feature on your computer, please convert your files to this <br/>
first. This will make it easy to open and hopefully save Barb some <br/>
trouble transferring it later on. If you do not have this feature (I <br/>
think both MSword and WordPerfect shoud have it somewhere under File) <br/>
then feel free to send the info to me or another moderator who has <br/>
the feature. We can convert it and post it for you or send it back to <br/>
you via e-mail attachment so you can post it yourself. Whichever you <br/>
specify. <br/>
<br/>
Again, we're not trying to pressure anyone. We're not going to start <br/>
deleteing any file that's not html or anything. It is merely a <br/>
suggestion. We simply want this to be as enjoyable and easy on <br/>
everyone involved as we can make it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311784094">It's real simple on MSWord.  "Save as web page" under File or in the drop down menu if you use "Save as."  If you need to correct something once it's been saved as a web page, you just choose "Edit with MSWord" (or somesuch) under File in the open document.<br/>
