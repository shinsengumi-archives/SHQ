<h3>Retrieved almost all Shinsengumi Portraits</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-573303686">I asked a google specialist and managed to retrieve most of the<br/>
paintings by Nakajima N. using <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.archive.org/.">http://www.archive.org/.</a>  The keyword<br/>
is &quot;most&quot; of the paintings.<br/>
<br/>
So I placed all the pics on this temporary page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NN2.html">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NN2.html</a><br/>
my goal is to fix it up and then it will be moved into its permanent<br/>
home at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Okay, now I know Nakajima N. totally went all out with his work...we<br/>
have 26 of his paintings and there were 3-4 archive.org could not<br/>
retrieve making the possibility that he painted a total of 40! very<br/>
high...he must&#39;ve had some serious time on his hands. I mentioned that<br/>
there was a seminar planned to show all of his work and his descendant<br/>
was going to give a lecture...one of the Japanese sites said the<br/>
lecture was cancelled and it was going to be a full house too...all<br/>
possible seats were taken.<br/>
<br/>
[PLEASE please HELP----problem]<br/>
1) I made thumbnails of the portraits and made it so that a new window<br/>
pops up with an enlarged version of the image...I must&#39;ve messed up<br/>
the javascript or something because the homepage ALSO pops up...I&#39;m<br/>
~really~ tired...if anyone understands code please help I thought I<br/>
typed everything correctly.  Just visit the site and click on<br/>
thumbnails you&#39;ll know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
I know just a couple of you can read Japanese and if you are<br/>
interested I did get the Japanese which came with the<br/>
portraits...however the webmaster didn&#39;t include text for every single<br/>
image...oh and for those of you to ~afraid~ to deal with the fish I<br/>
did prebabel text for you too...you can download the file at<br/>

file name:NakajimaN (SMALL files on word~fast download 362kb)<br/>
password:makoto<br/>
<br/>
***there is a high possibility that somewhere along the lines I may<br/>
have switched someone&#39;s name...it is because I&#39;ve been working on this<br/>
for 2 days...during work 15-20 min breaks...so it was tough</div>

 </span></blockquote>I have a book from that series!! I read some others, too. It ROCKS!! Plus, <br/>
with the timeframe the author is operating in, her character might be around <br/>
for the vendetta of the 47 ronin (aka Chushingura, chushin gishi, etc.)!!<br/>
<br/>
One of her books, &quot;The Samurai&#39;s Wife&quot;, is actually set in Kyoto.<br/>
