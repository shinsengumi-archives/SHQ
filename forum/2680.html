Karasugumi, the "Crow Unit," was a military unit of the Sendai domain in the <br/>
Boshin War. Commanded by this man-- <br/>

Juudayuu. Sendai has had a crow problem for over 2 centuries, so the name <br/>
"Crow Unit" is appropriate, in my opinion. At any rate, as the <br/>
southwesterners were coming up into northern Japan, the Crow Unit was <br/>
active, and while I have yet to prove this, they were probably escorts for <br/>
Hijikata and his men, when they boarded Enomoto's ships at Sabusawa-jima in <br/>
Matsushima Bay.<br/>
<br/>
Their banner was a flying black crow on a white background-- and Hosoya's <br/>
jinbaori (armor surcoat) was black, with a black yatagarasu (mythical <br/>
three-legged crow) on a red circle on the back.<br/>
