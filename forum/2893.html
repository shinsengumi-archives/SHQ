<h3>PAID Shinsengumihq LJ Acct Maintiner (Shinsengumi job opening)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-828566493">PAID Shinsengumihq LJ Acct<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com/">http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com/</a>  <br/>
(look at that design!  it needs help!)<br/>
<br/>
Goal of the LJ acct:<br/>
1)to link to LJ Shinsengumi related members so they show up on the <br/>
friends page (with their permission)<br/>
2)to alert the LJ Shinsengumi community to updates at the main <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> site<br/>
3)to gather information regarding the Shinsengumi in pop-culture <br/>
(this includes, original fanwork of all kinds, universe based <br/>
fanfic/2D/3Dart/media, and commercial pop-culture aka "professional" <br/>
releases as well as RPG alerts)<br/>
4)Basically this blog is the "to-do list" of the pop culture updates <br/>
which will eventually show up on the main website here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm</a><br/>
5)To seek and collect "mutual friends" which means you email those <br/>
community leaders and request mutual friending---if they are not <br/>
interested then don't add them to your friends list (this is all <br/>
voluntary)<br/>
<br/>
Opening Position(s) for maintainer<br/>
1)you either have a good grasp of the Livejournal interface or you <br/>
are willing to learn very quickly<br/>
2)you are willing to devote a reasonable amount of time in the <br/>
initial stages to develop a sleek look for the blog<br/>
3)you are organized and your posts are so easy to understand the <br/>
inept webmaster of the website can glance at the blog and just know <br/>
exactly how to update the webpage<br/>
4)you will notify the owner of the blog or volunteers at <br/>
shinsengumihq.com when you will be no longer able to fulfill your <br/>
duties or when you need a substitute<br/>
5)Payment:  you will get virtual hugsno just kiddingafter 3 weeks <br/>
of service, you will be gifted with 1 year paid membership on LJ for <br/>
whatever personal blog you have or paid membership to Deviantart<br/>
6)The maintainer and some members will all have access to the <br/>
account should there be an emergency of some sort<br/>
<br/>
The Blog is ***not..<br/>
1)a personal rant space for the volunteer maintainer to discuss his <br/>
or her personal life<br/>
2)a place to answer detailed shinsengumi questions unless those <br/>
questions may be answered somewhat accurately (for example a simple <br/>
question "what year was Saitou Hajime born?" vs a hard <br/>
question "give me the entire Hijikata Toshizofamily tree")---<br/>
questions should generally be directed to the mailing list <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/</a> where several dozen people may be <br/>
able to help<br/>
if someone asks "where is the best LJ PMK community" then the <br/>
maintainer may direct him or her to that community thus at times you <br/>
are also an "info desk" person<br/>
3)a place to post negative commentary on other websites or review <br/>
fanwork (for example  do not say "that fanfic is too OOC for me") <br/>
your job is simply to highlight fanwork, not appraise it<br/>
<br/>
Three Mandatory Posts which will remain "frozen" at the top of the <br/>
journal<br/>
1)Pop-culture<br/>
2)Shinsengumihq.com updates (this will be maintained by the <br/>
volunteer webmaster of the main website)---basically a public list <br/>
of "work in progress" or tech notes for the main website---a public <br/>
check list if you will<br/>
<br/>
3)Information/link post which lists Shinsengumihq.com long time <br/>
affiliates/supporters such as:<br/>

At this point some history related updates are the entries w/ <br/>

If you friend the blog--the blog will friend you back...aka the blog <br/>

Again its not a community only because there are many really active <br/>
