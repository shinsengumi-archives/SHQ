<h3>New Harada info+Getsumei Seiki 7</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-284557846">Just got Getsumei Seiki vol. 7 while in New York. Will scan soon, but all I <br/>
have to say is WOW.<br/>
<br/>
Kondou- Ferocious, muscular, young but not too young...utterly cool in <br/>
armor.<br/>
Hijikata- A lot like Kondou but more handsome in his own way.<br/>
Okita- NOT a pretty boy, for once, though he is kinda childlike.<br/>
Harada- HUGE guy with a HUGE sword and a HUGE spear.<br/>
Matsubara- Usually nonexistent in other depictions, this time you see him in <br/>
action with his naginata.<br/>
Inoue- Kinda weird-looking, but he's important.<br/>
Yamazaki- NOT a ninja, for once! Seems to like playing "go" with Shimada.<br/>
Shimada- Like Harada, a HUGE guy with a HUGE sword. The ending of the <br/>
Ikedaya attack is at the start of the manga, and maaaaaan...<br/>
Nagakura- Perpetually smoking a Japanese-style metal pipe, even when he <br/>
fights! Really cool sideburns, too...and he's not an uber-chibi short guy!<br/>
Saitou- Dark, brooding type with a scar on his left cheek.<br/>
Yamanami- Looks like he's about to cry most of the time, but still rather <br/>
handsome.<br/>
Sasaki Tadasaburo and the Mimawarigumi-- These guys make me think we were <br/>
right in our guess...a turf war is a HUGE factor in this volume. Oh, and why <br/>
do all the Mimawarigumi guys look alike, I wonder?<br/>
There's also an Aizu retainer named "Shiba" something...<br/>
<br/>
Each volume's cover features a key member of the Shinsengumi-- this one had <br/>
Harada, and inside the jacket flap, has a mini-bio. Turns out his father's <br/>
name was Nagatsugu...all this time I'd guessed it'd be "Sa-" something, like <br/>
"Saemon," which would be in keeping with sons taking characters from their <br/>
fathers' names...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I'm looking forward to getting ahold of more of that and Kaze <br/>
Hikaru when I finalyl make it to Japan in a couple weeks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201489991">Now I'm new to Shinsegumi and I would like your opinion on what movies to get. I'm going to get the movie and look for the TV series even samurai x and peace maker, but on the web site I saw the filmogrphy and saw a long list and i don't think that I'll be buying all of those movies. Can you tell me which ones are best to get? Also where in New York do get your movies from? I'm from New York myself.<br/>
Domo for your reply on your outfit that was very creative. Now is Getsumei Seiki the TV series or is it something different. Please get back to me I get payed on Thursday and would like to buy the important stuff to me started. Domo once again and have a safe trip to Japan. I'll be going soon myself. <br/>

<h3>Buying Shinsengumi films/which films to buy</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095435877">I don't know where in NY is a good place to shop since I'm a few hundred <br/>
miles away in Western PA , but I've gotten all my movies through ebay. <br/>
I've had multiple purchases from and had no problems with sellers- <br/>
cannibal-king/markymarkgv/stiller66aol<br/>
<br/>
For which films to get I think "Must haves" are the RUROUNI KENSHIN <br/>
episodes with the Saitou/Kyoto backstory. It's been so long since I've <br/>
watched it I may have the episode numbers wrong but I believe it's <br/>
episodes 28--31. Or you could get the RK/Samurai X Trust & Betrayal , <br/>
but I personally prefer the saitou tv episodes.<br/>
<br/>
PEACEMAKER KUROGANE is also a must have in my book<br/>
<br/>
For live action films I say do try to get hold of the NHK Taiga Drama <br/>
Shinsengumi! This can be had free or very inexpensively if you know <br/>
where to look (email me off list to buy a clue)<br/>
<br/>
MIBUGISHIDEN a/k/a/ WHEN THE LAST SWORD IS DRAWN top film for me<br/>
<br/>
SHINSENGUMI KEPPUROKU--actually this is a tv series and can be had from <br/>
the same sources as the NHK series (again email off list to buy a clue)<br/>
<br/>
GOHATTO/TABOO a bit odd with VERY bad casting for Hijikata/Kodou but an <br/>
interesting little movie nonetheless<br/>
<br/>
CRUEL STORY Different, dark and interesting<br/>
<br/>
OKITA SOUJI the LAST SWORDSMAN Not the best but pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my favorites you'll probably get other recommendations<br/>
<br/>
I also have Band of Assassins and Shinsengumi Chronicles both of which <br/>
are very good but not my favorites and yes the weird Kuniochi thing...<br/>
