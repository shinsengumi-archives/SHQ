<h3>New Harada info+Getsumei Seiki 7</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-284557846">Just got Getsumei Seiki vol. 7 while in New York. Will scan soon, but all I <br/>
have to say is WOW.<br/>
<br/>
Kondou- Ferocious, muscular, young but not too young...utterly cool in <br/>
armor.<br/>
Hijikata- A lot like Kondou but more handsome in his own way.<br/>
Okita- NOT a pretty boy, for once, though he is kinda childlike.<br/>
Harada- HUGE guy with a HUGE sword and a HUGE spear.<br/>
Matsubara- Usually nonexistent in other depictions, this time you see him in <br/>
action with his naginata.<br/>
Inoue- Kinda weird-looking, but he&#39;s important.<br/>
Yamazaki- NOT a ninja, for once! Seems to like playing &quot;go&quot; with Shimada.<br/>
Shimada- Like Harada, a HUGE guy with a HUGE sword. The ending of the <br/>
Ikedaya attack is at the start of the manga, and maaaaaan...<br/>
Nagakura- Perpetually smoking a Japanese-style metal pipe, even when he <br/>
fights! Really cool sideburns, too...and he&#39;s not an uber-chibi short guy!<br/>
Saitou- Dark, brooding type with a scar on his left cheek.<br/>
Yamanami- Looks like he&#39;s about to cry most of the time, but still rather <br/>
handsome.<br/>
Sasaki Tadasaburo and the Mimawarigumi-- These guys make me think we were <br/>
right in our guess...a turf war is a HUGE factor in this volume. Oh, and why <br/>
do all the Mimawarigumi guys look alike, I wonder?<br/>
There&#39;s also an Aizu retainer named &quot;Shiba&quot; something...<br/>
<br/>
Each volume&#39;s cover features a key member of the Shinsengumi-- this one had <br/>
Harada, and inside the jacket flap, has a mini-bio. Turns out his father&#39;s <br/>
name was Nagatsugu...all this time I&#39;d guessed it&#39;d be &quot;Sa-&quot; something, like <br/>
&quot;Saemon,&quot; which would be in keeping with sons taking characters from their <br/>
fathers&#39; names...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I&#39;m looking forward to getting ahold of more of that and Kaze <br/>
Hikaru when I finalyl make it to Japan in a couple weeks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201489991">Now I&#39;m new to Shinsegumi and I would like your opinion on what movies to get. I&#39;m going to get the movie and look for the TV series even samurai x and peace maker, but on the web site I saw the filmogrphy and saw a long list and i don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll be buying all of those movies. Can you tell me which ones are best to get? Also where in New York do get your movies from? I&#39;m from New York myself.<br/>
Domo for your reply on your outfit that was very creative. Now is Getsumei Seiki the TV series or is it something different. Please get back to me I get payed on Thursday and would like to buy the important stuff to me started. Domo once again and have a safe trip to Japan. I&#39;ll be going soon myself. <br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-2518">&gt;</a> Buying Shinsengumi films/which films to buy</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095435877">I don&#39;t know where in NY is a good place to shop since I&#39;m a few hundred <br/>
miles away in Western PA , but I&#39;ve gotten all my movies through ebay. <br/>
I&#39;ve had multiple purchases from and had no problems with sellers- <br/>
cannibal-king/markymarkgv/stiller66aol<br/>
<br/>
For which films to get I think &quot;Must haves&quot; are the RUROUNI KENSHIN <br/>
episodes with the Saitou/Kyoto backstory. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve <br/>
watched it I may have the episode numbers wrong but I believe it&#39;s <br/>
episodes 28--31. Or you could get the RK/Samurai X Trust & Betrayal , <br/>
but I personally prefer the saitou tv episodes.<br/>
<br/>
PEACEMAKER KUROGANE is also a must have in my book<br/>
<br/>
For live action films I say do try to get hold of the NHK Taiga Drama <br/>
Shinsengumi! This can be had free or very inexpensively if you know <br/>
where to look (email me off list to buy a clue)<br/>
<br/>
MIBUGISHIDEN a/k/a/ WHEN THE LAST SWORD IS DRAWN top film for me<br/>
<br/>
SHINSENGUMI KEPPUROKU--actually this is a tv series and can be had from <br/>
the same sources as the NHK series (again email off list to buy a clue)<br/>
<br/>
GOHATTO/TABOO a bit odd with VERY bad casting for Hijikata/Kodou but an <br/>
interesting little movie nonetheless<br/>
<br/>
CRUEL STORY Different, dark and interesting<br/>
<br/>
OKITA SOUJI the LAST SWORDSMAN Not the best but pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my favorites you&#39;ll probably get other recommendations<br/>
<br/>
I also have Band of Assassins and Shinsengumi Chronicles both of which <br/>
are very good but not my favorites and yes the weird Kuniochi thing...<br/>
