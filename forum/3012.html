<h3>Of Guns and Makoto: Shinsengumi in the Post-Ikedaya World</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-594013695">In the months following the action at Ikedaya, Shinsengumi had intentions <br/>
for development and expansion. To this day, they languish under the common <br/>
misconception people have about them-- that they supposedly hated firearms <br/>
and had a near-myth-worthy ideal of chivalry. Romulus Hillsborough's recent <br/>
work is a prime example of such a belief. However, the reality was <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
On or around (by the Gregorian calendar) October 4, 1864, Kondou Isami, <br/>
Nagakura Shinpachi, Takeda Kanryuusai, and Ogata Shuntarou departed Kyoto by <br/>
fast palanquins for Edo. They took the palanquins until Kuwana, then crossed <br/>
the Bay of Ise by boat, and landed at Atsuta in the Tokaido region, and <br/>
continued eastward by fast palanquins once more until they reached Edo on <br/>
the 8th of October. On the following day, Kondou and his ensemble went to <br/>
the Aizu offices in Edo and reported in, then they proceeded to the Matsumae <br/>
clan mansion to see then-roju (shogunate senior councilor) Matsumae <br/>
Takahiro, and submit a formal petition asking for the shogun to be sent to <br/>
Kyoto once more.<br/>
<br/>
While Kondou was still in Edo, recruiting new men for the Shinsengumi, <br/>
Hijikata sent him and Sato Hikogoro-- Shinsengumi's "corporate" sponsor from <br/>
Tama-- a letter regarding gunnery. In this letter, dated November 7th, 1864, <br/>
Hijikata says:<br/>
<br/>
"The entire corps trains in Western-style gunnery every day. Training is <br/>
improving every day, and we are preparing to serve in the upcoming attack on <br/>
Nagato Province."<br/>
<br/>
Nagato Province was the place where the Choshu domain and its branch domains <br/>
were located.<br/>
<br/>
[For those interested, I have drawn this information from pages 138 to 139 <br/>
of the text "Shinsengumi," by Oishi Manabu (Tokyo: Chuko-shinsho, 2004. ISBN <br/>
4-12-101773-0)]<br/>
<br/>
By considering this information, we can see that the myth of Shinsengumi as <br/>
men who entirely, exclusively "lived by the sword" is false. The Shinsengumi <br/>
were men who, at best, lived by the ways of war. As time went by, they <br/>
acquired new technology and put it to good use-- namely, that of the new <br/>
firearms imported from the West. It is indeed true that some members of the <br/>
Shinsengumi may not have liked firearms or found them dishonorable; however, <br/>
as Hijikata, in his role as acting commander in Kondou's absence, was <br/>
writing about "daily training" and preparation for the Choshu expedition, we <br/>
can see that the *unit's* policy was one of Western-style weapons training, <br/>
alongside more traditional sword, spear, and horsemanship (et cetera) <br/>
training. The weapons training in gunnery also suggests that Shinsengumi may <br/>
have been called upon to perhaps be a spearhead for the Choshu expedition-- <br/>
which confirms the assertion of historian Harold Bolitho that Matsudaira <br/>
Katamori, the lord of Aizu, had more than an incidental role in the <br/>
expeditions.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line: Shinsengumi was not impervious to change. Just as the <br/>
Ishin-shishi adapted their philosophy of "sonno-joi" in order to accomodate <br/>
their desire to acquire foreign support; so too the Shinsengumi made use of <br/>
foreign weapons and tactics to improve their effectiveness. It's a rule of <br/>
warfare: those who don't adapt lose quicker. Yes, Shinsengumi lost in the <br/>
end, but that was in 1869-- after a good five years of training in <br/>
Western-style tactics and gunnery, and that history most definitely counts <br/>
for something.<br/>
