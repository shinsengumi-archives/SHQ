<h3>SHQ Members Attend Obon Festival in L.A.</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-580693732">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is having a great summer.  This Sunday a friend who is<br/>
also a member here on SHQ dragged me out of the monotony of my daily<br/>
life to attend Obon (Bon) at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nishihongwanji-la.org/.">http://www.nishihongwanji-la.org/.</a><br/>
<br/>
You can get a general idea of Bon from reading this article:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obon</a><br/>
<br/>
People who are familiar with the Day of the Dead or the Chinese feast<br/>
for ghosts will find a similar sentiment in Bon.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a collage of a few photos we took:<br/>

(can you find a familiar kamon, family crest?)<br/>
<br/>
The temple has been part of the Japanese-American community in LA for<br/>
many decades.  I found some of the innovations inside the table to be<br/>
very fascinating!  Notice the pews in the main worship hall.  The<br/>
apsaras or devadas (heavenly beings/maidens) which are part of the<br/>
ornamentation above the main alter have wings which make them look<br/>
like cherubs or western angels, whereas in traditional Japanese (or<br/>
generally E. Asian art) they would never have birdlike wings.<br/>
<br/>
During the service for the souls of the deceased, the reverend<br/>
presiding over the ceremony emphasized how at one point, many<br/>
generations back we were all relatives of one another and therefore we<br/>
are still presently connected.<br/>
<br/>
Like other Bon ceremonies everyone was asked to dance in a circle. <br/>
The center is also the central axis in which the lanterns with the<br/>
names of the deceased written on them are united.  The dancers move<br/>
around the axis to the tune of various music however I noted that the<br/>
first dance resembled the movements of a fish.  People press their<br/>
hands together in front of them and assume the swimming gesture as if<br/>
to swim through the sea/river of life around a center.<br/>
<br/>
The symbolism may be connected with the movement of people through a<br/>
mandala to reach the center, which is also related to Buddhist<br/>
cosmology where the center is Mt. Meru which is also the object people<br/>
circumambulate (Buddhists are big on circumambulating temples,<br/>
stupas/chedis etc).  Unlike the living, the dead can traverse from the<br/>
center to the outermost realms as they "hang" above us (the lanterns).<br/>
<br/>
I was really happy, if not completely shocked to meet this individual<br/>
who shares an interest in Fujita-sama.  We both prayed for his<br/>
happiness at this ceremony and hoped that his comrades are also at<br/>
rest.  It was really great to be able to make a small contribution to<br/>
the temple on behalf of these long dead figures who have become<br/>
outstanding teachers to us not only in studying history but other<br/>
aspects of our lives too.<br/>
<br/>
Changing topics, the upcoming Shinsengumi e-book written by and for<br/>
fans or the general public will be completed on a laptop contributed<br/>
by this person.  I also learned that fellow Shinsengumi enthusiasts<br/>
will also feed another (thank you, you saw through my lie about being<br/>
on a diet and all that).<br/>
<br/>
Here is a pic of the donated laptop and router (it's on the floor due<br/>
to some reorganizing I had to do):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/KCCat/CatandLaptop.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/KCCat/CatandLaptop.jpg</a><br/>
The cat has inspected it and certified that it is safe to use after<br/>
sleeping and "guarding" over it for a day now.<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like we have to get moving on that first draft!<br/>
<br/>
Take care everybody,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451396371">Oh what fun! Bon dance.  I have fond memories of when I was just knee<br/>
high my dad dressed me up in my little kimono, obi and geta, and turned<br/>
me loose to dance the circle. Yes!<br/>
