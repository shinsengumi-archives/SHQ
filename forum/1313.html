<h3>Mothers of the Shinsengumi (humor?)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521343137">In reality many boys probably felt much more close to their &quot;dojo<br/>
families&quot; than their real families.<br/>
Phil started this I just want to continue it ~ here goes...<br/>
<br/>
weird situation (if all the mothers of the Shinsengumi had a get together)<br/>
<br/>
RK Saitou&#39;s mom &quot;he was such a picky eater, the only food he would eat<br/>
was soba&quot;<br/>
(I also recall a humorous fanfic where baby RK Saitou bit people! LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura&#39;s mom &quot;he started talking at 3 months! and never stopped&quot;<br/>
(I&#39;ve been wondering how old Nagakura was when he wrote his book and<br/>
if he dictated it to someone?  if he dictated some parts then he may<br/>
have been a chatterbox as we all assume him to have been :P)<br/>
<br/>
NHK Harada&#39;s mom &quot;I was frying some spring rolls, my hands were a bit<br/>
oily but I had to pick him up---and accidently dropped him&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NHK Hijikata&#39;s mom &quot;the neighbors, for some odd reason brought him<br/>
home early from the play date and said to never let my son within 100<br/>
yards of their daughter&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089420999">NHK Nagakura&#39;s mom----&quot;He&#39;s always seemed so much _more mature_ that <br/>
other children his age....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NHK Heisuke Todo&#39;s mom--&quot;Yes he is a pathetic little geek but we love <br/>
him...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NHK Hijikata and Yamanami&#39;s mom&#39;s---&quot;Look at those two, you&#39;d think they <br/>
were scheming and plotting behind the little Serizawa boy&#39;s back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Father of Mibugishiden&#39;s Saitou to his wife---&quot;Care to tell me why &quot;our&quot; <br/>
son looks so much like that Serizawa boy over there???&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526668716">NHK Nagakura&#39;s mom -- &quot;He&#39;s a great son. People come up to me and <br/>
say &#39;Such a cute face only a mother could love&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SK Okita -- As a mother I need to get this frail boy into a dojo. <br/>
That way he&#39;ll grow up to be strong just like his father...<br/>
<br/>
PMK Hijikata -- He&#39;s such a talented boy. I usually slip in to his <br/>
room at night to get that haiku of his. The ladies and I always have <br/>
a blast reading that. <br/>
<br/>
NHK Kondou -- I don&#39;t know him anymore. I used to be his mother but <br/>
ever since his father called him &quot;Samurai&quot;, I don&#39;t know him <br/>
anymore...<br/>
<br/>
RK Saitou -- I SWEAR! That boy is stubborn everytime he plays AKU <br/>
SOKU ZAN with his friends. I don&#39;t know what to do with him, I keep <br/>
telling him it&#39;s just play, a make believe but the boy still goes <br/>
after his playmates shouting &quot;gatotsu&quot; and pricking them with his <br/>
bokken. I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t have friends anymore after this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550408234">Nakajima Nobori&#39;s mom &quot;My son is sooo talented (brings out stacks <br/>
and stacks of papers) see he drew all of his siblings, the entire <br/>
family, all of his playmates, the entire village etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
PMK Yamazaki&#39;s mom &quot;he always loved to play dress up with Ayunee...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hist. Yamazaki &quot;he was an extremely shy boy and whenever guests came <br/>
to visit he would observe them from various hiding places...but I&#39;m <br/>
so proud that he learned to write so fast! He just had so much fun <br/>
taking down notes on all of our visitors.  If he really likes a <br/>
guest he may even ask them questions like &#39;where are you <br/>
from&#39;&#39;what&#39;s your REAL name&#39; and so forth but he tended to get <br/>
impatient when they didn&#39;t take his questions seriously.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hist. Saitou&#39;s mom &quot;all the kids want to play &#39;house&#39; but he always <br/>
insists that they play &#39;guard the castle&#39;&quot;</div>

 </span></blockquote>Historical Hijikata&#39;s mom: &quot;None of the neighborhood kids liked to play games with little Toshizo. He was such a stickler for the rules!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Historical Kondo&#39;s mom: &quot;Everytime we turned around a group of the neighborhood kid&#39;s was coming to his father complaining about his &#39;haughty attitude&#39;!&quot;<br/>
