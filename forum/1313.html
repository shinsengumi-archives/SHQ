<h3>Mothers of the Shinsengumi (humor?)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521343137">In reality many boys probably felt much more close to their "dojo<br/>
families" than their real families.<br/>
Phil started this I just want to continue it ~ here goes...<br/>
<br/>
weird situation (if all the mothers of the Shinsengumi had a get together)<br/>
<br/>
RK Saitou's mom "he was such a picky eater, the only food he would eat<br/>
was soba"<br/>
(I also recall a humorous fanfic where baby RK Saitou bit people! LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura's mom "he started talking at 3 months! and never stopped"<br/>
(I've been wondering how old Nagakura was when he wrote his book and<br/>
if he dictated it to someone?  if he dictated some parts then he may<br/>
have been a chatterbox as we all assume him to have been :P)<br/>
<br/>
NHK Harada's mom "I was frying some spring rolls, my hands were a bit<br/>
oily but I had to pick him up---and accidently dropped him"<br/>
<br/>
NHK Hijikata's mom "the neighbors, for some odd reason brought him<br/>
home early from the play date and said to never let my son within 100<br/>
yards of their daughter"</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089420999">NHK Nagakura's mom----"He's always seemed so much _more mature_ that <br/>
other children his age...."<br/>
<br/>
NHK Heisuke Todo's mom--"Yes he is a pathetic little geek but we love <br/>
him..."<br/>
<br/>
NHK Hijikata and Yamanami's mom's---"Look at those two, you'd think they <br/>
were scheming and plotting behind the little Serizawa boy's back."<br/>
<br/>
Father of Mibugishiden's Saitou to his wife---"Care to tell me why "our" <br/>
son looks so much like that Serizawa boy over there???"<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526668716">NHK Nagakura's mom -- "He's a great son. People come up to me and <br/>
say 'Such a cute face only a mother could love'."<br/>
<br/>
SK Okita -- As a mother I need to get this frail boy into a dojo. <br/>
That way he'll grow up to be strong just like his father...<br/>
<br/>
PMK Hijikata -- He's such a talented boy. I usually slip in to his <br/>
room at night to get that haiku of his. The ladies and I always have <br/>
a blast reading that. <br/>
<br/>
NHK Kondou -- I don't know him anymore. I used to be his mother but <br/>
ever since his father called him "Samurai", I don't know him <br/>
anymore...<br/>
<br/>
RK Saitou -- I SWEAR! That boy is stubborn everytime he plays AKU <br/>
SOKU ZAN with his friends. I don't know what to do with him, I keep <br/>
telling him it's just play, a make believe but the boy still goes <br/>
after his playmates shouting "gatotsu" and pricking them with his <br/>
bokken. I'm afraid he won't have friends anymore after this.<br/>

Historical Kondo's mom: "Everytime we turned around a group of the neighborhood kid's was coming to his father complaining about his 'haughty attitude'!"<br/>
