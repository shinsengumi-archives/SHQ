<h3>English Shinsengumi book</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519847021">Ok so I'm too lazy to check this by going through past messages but I <br/>
found out last night that the upcoming book by Romulus Hillsborough on <br/>
the Shinsengumi is being published by Tuttle Publishing not Ridgeback <br/>
Press as his other books were.<br/>
<br/>
 I know the book was mentioned on list before and I thought Ridgeback <br/>
was mentioned in conjunction but I'm not sure so if you've seen this <br/>
publisher info before  we'll just it blame it on "the fish".<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115621108">That would make sense for it to be published by<br/>
Tuttle. I talked with the guy from Ridgeback Press<br/>
sometime back and he told me that it wouldn't be<br/>
published by them, but by a bigger publisher.<br/>

my query on publishing date and if they were taking advance orders. I <br/>
