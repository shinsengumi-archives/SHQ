<h3>English Shinsengumi book</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519847021">Ok so I&#39;m too lazy to check this by going through past messages but I <br/>
found out last night that the upcoming book by Romulus Hillsborough on <br/>
the Shinsengumi is being published by Tuttle Publishing not Ridgeback <br/>
Press as his other books were.<br/>
<br/>
 I know the book was mentioned on list before and I thought Ridgeback <br/>
was mentioned in conjunction but I&#39;m not sure so if you&#39;ve seen this <br/>
publisher info before  we&#39;ll just it blame it on &quot;the fish&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115621108">That would make sense for it to be published by<br/>
Tuttle. I talked with the guy from Ridgeback Press<br/>
sometime back and he told me that it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
published by them, but by a bigger publisher.<br/>

my query on publishing date and if they were taking advance orders. I <br/>
didn&#39;t notice anything on the website for Tuttle though.<br/>
