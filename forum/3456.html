<h3>SHinsengumi: a bond?</h3>
by <i>melianeth</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209599403">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for those who might have had or have access to<br/>
Japanese sources (for example the Nagakura memoirs found in 1998<br/>
however accurate they may be) and may shed light for me:<br/>
 <br/>
it may sound foolish but is it anywhere mentioned that despite being<br/>
what they were and the circonstances the Shinsengumi formed a kind of<br/>
family? At least for some of them? I mean a strong bond where you feel<br/>
you belong, maybe a feeling of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks foranyhelp,<br/>

It's not a foolish question at all. And while I can't speak specifically for the Shinsengumi  guys who are close in a military or police environment often form a bond with the other guys they work with since basically their lives depend on that bond as they need to "watch one another's back" in dangerous situations.<br/>

Dear Aki,<br/>
<br/>
I think that's a fascinating question and thanks for posting! (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
In terms of historical text -explicitly- stating a "family" bond--that<br/>
would be tough to find because the era and style of writing of the<br/>
time would probably not specify those exact words.  However, all<br/>
members of the Shinsengumi were humans and therefore fans and<br/>
researchers alike are welcome to draw their own personal conclusions<br/>
about what personal relationships may have arose.<br/>
<br/>
These are things I think:<br/>
1) age---most of the guys were very young, away from home and in a big<br/>
city---it's normal for them to become buddies<br/>
<br/>
2) The Shinsengumi were one of a handful of law enforcement units in<br/>
Kyoto (Mimawarigumi, Shinchogumi and doshingumi forgot the exact<br/>
spelling).  These other groups often had men derived from the "upper"<br/>
class (especially the Mimawari) in other words real "hereditary"<br/>
samurai while in contrast the Shinsengumi had men from a varied<br/>
background.  There was no doubt the Shinsengumi operated with a chip<br/>
on their shoulders and grasped that they were the new kids on the<br/>
block.  It's not a stretch for the Tama group in the Shinsengumi to<br/>
stick amongst themselves because of their common background and to a<br/>
greater extent all the guys from the Edo region to form a group.  <br/>
<br/>
3) modern day military and police units such as the riot polie in<br/>
Japan who do live together (sort of like firemen here in the US) do<br/>
form strong bonds.  One can imagine that the Shinsengumi which shared<br/>
barracks also had these strong bonds.  Furthermore the length of time<br/>
during which the Shinsengumi were active since the early Bakumatsu era<br/>
to the end in 1868 (Aizu) and 69 (Hokkaido) suggest many were comrades<br/>
for YEARS---longer or as long than many modern day wars (or low<br/>
burning political conflicts).</div>
