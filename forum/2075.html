<h3>Aizu</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-868962879">In the footnotes to "Remembering Aizu," I found some things that I really <br/>
didn't think of before-- namely, that the Aizu domain took the job of <br/>
security in Kyoto so seriously that it FINANCIALLY RUINED ITSELF. Also that <br/>
Katamori was a far more aggressive figure than Yoshinobu, and that both <br/>
Choshuu expeditions are seen as Katamori's personal vendetta against <br/>
Choshuu-- which would explain the "Imperial" army's particular enmity at <br/>
Aizu. Also remember that Katamori's brother Tokugawa Yoshikatsu was the <br/>
nominal commander of the Choshuu expedition.<br/>

It was the same night the "suspicious fire" broke out in Edo Castle and <br/>
destroyed the women's quarters. (Doesn't have the exact date listed here.) Someone <br/>
then fired a shot at the Edo villa of Shonai domain, a close shogunal ally. <br/>
The men of that domain gave chase and the assailants fled to Satsuma villa. It <br/>
was the enraged officials of Edo, ticked off from weeks of brigandage <br/>
attributed to the Satsuma-led ronin, who attacked and burned the Shimazu villa <br/>
(Satsuma's Lord's home) and killed several men.<br/>
<br/>
This was all attributed to Saigo, via his orders to Sagara.  Information from <br/>
Mark Ravina's The Last Samurai: the Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori.<br/>

<h3>Aizu</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-194133017">Just thought I'd let everyone know that my fall research project--<br/>
"The Role of the Aizu Domain in Japan's Bakumatsu Period," (for when<br/>
I'm in Japan) has pretty much been approved (awaiting official<br/>
confirmation) and that I'll be sure to visit Kondou, Hijikata, and<br/>
Saitou's graves when I'm in Aizu. And of course, there will be lots<br/>
and lots and lots of pictures and other things!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this paper will include the Shinsengumi. They're important,<br/>
and they represent a greater movement on both sides of the war to open<br/>
up "warrior-hood" to people not born into the samurai class. After<br/>
all, the more I read, the more I realize they weren't operating<br/>
alone-- they were pretty much integrated into Aizu's fighting force in<br/>
Kyoto...<br/>

<h3>networking again</h3>
by <i>sherlinelee</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586538494">I was wondering, other than Masayoshi (and Phil?),  how many of you on this list are doing targeted research on particular regions/hans during the end of the Edo era?   <br/>
<br/>
Also, for those of you who lurk -- what are you dying to get your hands on that you think other Shinsengumi fans on this list are interested in?  I have insane cultural refs - like hairstyle books for the era, a 400 page book on wagashi, Kyoto historical landmarks refs,  Shinsengumi manga galore, but no idea how to prioritize what to tackle next (other than what I must return to the library by such and such time) and then how to extract and distribute content.    <br/>
<br/>
Although, I am currently committed to finishing up some work on Katsura Kogoro's influences (yes, the 'other side') that might take me through the summer, I do have other things that I am willing to try to push along if any of you doing your own work can benefit extensively from it. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I might as well just say that with Tama's help -- I managed to get copies of the  Burai manga in duplicate. (As well as a few other lesser known Shinsengumi manga.)   I would be more than happy to work with someone reliable and work and getting the contents scanned if someone is willing to do the raw translations.    If any of you have any contacts or are very interested yourself, please let me know.   <br/>

While there are many connections to the Shinsengumi in terms of mutual memberships in groups and a lot of philosophical ideas, my research won't be reported here on the list since Sagara wasn't a miburo.  *Always* in a state of correction, editing, and constant growth, it now spans over several journals pointing back to the main journal, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sagara_sozo">http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sagara_sozo</a> .<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take advantage of people like this *any* chance you get!  ^_^  It is absolutely amazing the things they can track down and find out!  Without others offering to help me find out obscure things, my research would be so far behind what it is now.  Thanks to them, I'm actually able to do much more on my own and coming to understand better who the people I'm interested in really were by learning about the environment they lived and fought in.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't be shy and don't be afraid... just let loose with those questions that have been nagging you, but you thought were stupid or meaningless or don't have a chance of being answered.  You'd be surprised at how many answers really are out there once there are people happily digging away.  And you just never know when someone else who's been lurking might've already found it!  If it has to do with the late Tokugawa/bakumatsu, then it has relevance to the Shinsengumi.  They surely didn't just sit around in a temple collecting paychecks, slash a few unknown/unimportant people at night, and do nothing else.  ^_^  I think we've seen interest, too, in what became of those who survived to live on into the Meiji... men whose lives didn't just end when the glory days were over... as well as the families of those who didn't.  It's all interconnected, and for those involved in fiction writing (fanfic or original), this list is a fantastic resource for information to help with plots and<br/>
 atmosphere.<br/>

<h3>Re: networking again</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900432360">I'd like to comment on Katsura Kogoro's blog---I mean multi volume <br/>
diary, it contains valuable references to the destitute Aizu men in <br/>
Toko after Boshin. Yes, it's Katsura, yes he is on the "other side" <br/>
as Sherl put it (^_^) but the man is just fascinating and <br/>
compassionate and boy he can write.  So when  you guys do research <br/>
for fun -do not- expect to walk into the library and <br/>
find "Shinsengumi" instead look at the other sources.  He also dealt <br/>
with Toshiyoshi Kawaji during Seinan.<br/>
<br/>
I'm with M, I really enjoy studying Aizu (Byakkotai, Joushitai and <br/>
Aizu women in the Meiji in general like the awesome YAMAMOTO YAEKO + <br/>
Jo Neesima).<br/>
<br/>
We don't know a whole lot about the Fujita family, except what is <br/>
written in Japanese however I'm very happy with what I have found in <br/>
their relationship to Aizu's Yamakawa family...so I research the <br/>
Yamakawa family (plenty of shreds of info in ENGLISH).<br/>
Don't know about Fujita Goro the man, but I have learned alot by <br/>
studying his -job- the history of the TMPD, Toshiyoshi Kawaji etc.  <br/>
Same with Tokio, her job at Tokyo Women's Normal School aka (Women's <br/>
Normal School, Teacher's College for Women and sometimes footnoted <br/>
at Ochanomizu) is just amazing...she had to keep with the changing <br/>
times I use keynames like Takamine Hideo (her cousin),  Tsuda Umeko<br/>
(her own school can be a -template- for how women's schools were <br/>
run), women's dorm life, alumni of Tokyo Women's normal school YASUI <br/>
TETSU (same generation as Fujita MIdori) who taught in Siam and <br/>
utitilized TWNS' model there too!  So basically I'm happy to learn <br/>
about the "sphere" in which our beloved historical figures lived and <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
I look up various keywords like "Yasui Bank" to learn about the <br/>
significance of Tokio opening a bank account...for example<br/>
http://www1.kinjo-<br/>
u.ac.jp/~nakata/Nakata/Data/Sectors/2Sector/EYasuda.htm<br/>
<br/>
I believe that there are more hard records in Aizu about Tokio <br/>
because she retained a leadership role due to her past employment <br/>
with Teruhime and ofcourse she did collect money to build a memorial <br/>
for those killed in Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
Also found some valuable stuff on two of Kondo's buddies back home <br/>
in Tama during the Bakumatsu and what they did in the Meiji (let's <br/>
just say the farmers of Tama weren't all that -simple-).<br/>
<br/>
So Sherl, whatever you can dig up is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I love SCANDAL...the  ROKUMEIKAN kind ::hehehe:: <br/>
someone should totally write a fantasy Shinsengumi fanfic putting <br/>
them in the Deer Cry Pavilion.  For the new people please see the <br/>
Meiji thread at shinsengumimb.com</div>

Right now am lurking for the basic, first by Shisengumi and now am at lurking for Hijikata and Sauji.The first one well am been impress for what I had seen am not discarting checking out for his hometown and key places. Um, I was wondering what do you study?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh. Thanks for asking :) .  In terms of what I study -- I'd probably say I generally focus in on meta-issues like culture and politics.  <br/>
<br/>
My interest in the more political and historical side of Japan probably was fueled by a lot of Sec's posts here. :)  Since Sec and others on this list have focused on the Shinsengumi and due to the availability of materials in English in various libraries, I elected to pursue materials on the Choshu han who was influential in shaping the Meiji era.  I see this as a complementary approach to better understanding the environment that shaped much of the Bakumatsu.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of research style, I tend to work from book to book and abstract things that I find randomly interesting or that I remember that others have a passion for.   At the moment, I am still working on dealing with materials on Katsura Kogoro/Kido Koin-Takayoshi, although I became sidetracked by a biography on Yoshida Shoin, who was both a mentor to Katsura, as well as a personal headache to him.   :-D<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I'm much slower than the others on this list in finding stuff and then in redistributing it. I have still yet to finish reading the diaries, but am posting various snippets of things I dig up at my website (http://red-bird.org).  Sec recently added a link from the SHQ webpage for the curious.  At the moment, I only have the beginnings of Katsura and Shoin stuff.  (Hopefully *cough* I can goad someone into putting up the Takasugi materials in short order.) <br/>
<br/>
In terms of your original interests - remind me to scan the covers and special images from the Pichi manga line featuring Hijikata and Souji .  Aside from the history stuff, I have a not-so-secret weakness for manga and fanart. -_-;<br/>
