<h3>I hit the information jackpot!</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-142043831">Ok, I have lots of new info to share with you! One of you with <br/>
translation skills should really have a look at this and try to <br/>
clarify a few points for us! Especially the last site I'm going to <br/>
list!<br/>
<br/>
The first place I'm going to draw your attention to is one some of <br/>
you may have found before. Not a lot of info, but there's a map on <br/>
one of the pages of the inside of the Yagi residence, where the <br/>
Shinsengumi stayed for some time. If you click on the arrows, the <br/>
picture below it changes to offer different views of the interior of <br/>
the building. The site is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mibu-yagike.jp/">http://www.mibu-yagike.jp/</a><br/>
<br/>
Also, you might want to have a peek at this site. There is some <br/>
random bits of info attached to the different pictures. One is a <br/>
picture of the monument in Hokkaido that is located on the spot where <br/>
Hijikata is rumored to have been killed. Beside it it says:<br/>
"A fierce attack of the new government force was started to wait for <br/>
a thaw of spring. Hijikata whom I asked conduct to go to rescue of <br/>
wife of chief zen-priest Daiba by a box building all-out attack of <br/>
May 11 hit a bullet in 1869 (1869) and was killed in action. Enomoto <br/>
force surrendered soon, and the Boshin War was over." <br/>
<br/>
That was the gist translation. The Babelfish says:<br/>
"In order to wait for the thawing of snow of the spring, onslaught of <br/>
the new government troop was started. That 1869 (1869) with box <br/>
mansion all out attack May 11th, it probably will face to the rescue <br/>
of the Sarasvati stand place, the manuel laborer who takes direction <br/>
died in battle, hitting against the gun circle. Promptly, the Enomoto <br/>
troop surrendering ended (?) War."<br/>
<br/>
I take it that the "wife of chief zen-priest Daiba" was some sort of <br/>
temple? The site in question is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.city.hino.tokyo.jp/museum/sinsengumi/top/sinsengumi_top_non">http://www.city.hino.tokyo.jp/museum/sinsengumi/top/sinsengumi_top_non</a><br/>
flash.html  It's the Hinocity Furusato Museum. And no, "sinsengumi" <br/>
is not a mistake. That's how they spelled it.<br/>
<br/>
The next site is more or less one page of info. I have no idea where <br/>
they got this from. It's something I've never heard before, so I'm <br/>
asking for confirmation of the details. It states that during the <br/>
fight Nagakura's sword broke and his left thumb was cut off?! The <br/>
reference to Toudou's injury I've found on the other two sites, but <br/>
if they mention that Nagakura lost his thumb it's been lost in <br/>
translation. The site in question is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://geocities.com/koyochinbutai/1864.html">http://geocities.com/koyochinbutai/1864.html</a><br/>
<br/>
You can change the year number to get to other pages. Most have <br/>
little more than the major events of the year listed, resulting in <br/>
pages with no more than two lines on them. And the injury that Toudou <br/>
received in PMK? The cut to the forehead? That appears to have been <br/>
the injury he suffered in the real battle. <br/>
<br/>
Now we're getting to the REAL info! I found the next two sites by <br/>
accident. Again one was hidden by an unusual spelling of Nagakura's <br/>
first name. They called him "Sinpachi". The site isn't extensive. <br/>
Some of the listed areas have no inforomation at all, so it might be <br/>
a new site under development. The main point of interest is what it <br/>
has to say about Shinpachi's (or "Sinpachi's") role in the Ikeda-ya <br/>
affair. It also gives a brief bio of his life, which mentions among <br/>
other things the quarrel with Kondo! Apparently Nagakura was <br/>
given "good behavior disposal" for two months over the incident. No <br/>
word on whether anyone else was given similar penalties. However, I <br/>
would assume this was the case. Later it refers to his meeting up <br/>
with a "geisha" he had been involved with before the war and meeting <br/>
his daughter, apparently for the first time! The site is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bushinavi.com/~sinpachi/sinpachi.htm">http://www.bushinavi.com/~sinpachi/sinpachi.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The jackpot however was this final site. It lists info about EVERY <br/>
ONE of the Captains!!! Of course some to this we've heard before, but <br/>
some is very new (at least to me)! Here's a small sampler of the more <br/>
outrageous info I discovered. [I had to use a translator other than <br/>
Babelfish. That one wouldn't work for me.]<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata:<br/>
-The person he fooled around with in the shop when he was 17 was <br/>
a "maid of a shop".<br/>
-He went to Edo to appeal for a rescue of Kondo, using the <br/>
name "Hayato Naito".<br/>
Okita:<br/>
-If I'm reading  this right, he had a short-temper when teaching <br/>
kendo and many were more afraid of him than Kondo at such times!<br/>
Saito: <br/>
-Apparently the Shin Kepp miniseries wasn't wrong about him dropping <br/>
out of the Shinsengumi! He parted company from Kondo and Hijikata at <br/>
the same time Nagakura and Harada did! It looks like he headed off to <br/>
Aizu on his own. But as we all know, he met up with Hijikata once <br/>
again before the war was over and ended up leading the Shinsengumi <br/>
for him while he was wounded.<br/>
-This site says he entered the "police superintendent station" in <br/>
1872.<br/>
Matsubara Tadaji (4th Captain and someone I've never seen anything <br/>
on!):<br/>
-Seems to have killed someone from Anzai when he was coming back from <br/>
Gion, due to the fact he was drunk. <br/>
-He finds out that the man had a wife and an ill child and "from <br/>
sympathy" begins to take care of them. I think it's saying that he <br/>
couldn't bring himself to tell the wife he was the one who killed <br/>
him. He also fell in love with the wife!!!<br/>
-Hijikata doesn't seem to have liked the situation one bit. Somehow <br/>
Matsubara comes to try to commit seppuku. What actually happened to <br/>
him doesn't appear to be clear. His first attempt may have failed, <br/>
but the wound didn't heal properly and eventually led to his death. <br/>
There is also the story he and the wife committed suicide together or <br/>
that he was made to kill himself for some other reason.<br/>
There is something on the Captain of the Seventh Unit, Tani <br/>
Sanjuurou. I think it's implying Saito might have killed him, but I <br/>
can't make real heads or tails of it. His death is listed as "sudden <br/>
illness".<br/>
Suzuki Mikisaburou (9th Captain. How could I possibly leave this guy <br/>
out?! phil would hurt me!):<br/>
-It says that he "belong to the Satsuma armed forces by a fight of <br/>
Fushimi, Toba, and I join a red report corps, but I return to Tokyo, <br/>
and I am imprisoned after having left it. The release back goes to <br/>
the front of sergeant or Aizu, but, for the end of the war, returns <br/>
to Tokyo."<br/>
-You might want to sit down for this one phil! It says later that he <br/>
met "Nagakura new 8 in Kyoto in 1869 and I try a surprise attack, but <br/>
end in an attempt." So he DID try one last time for some revenge!!!<br/>
Harada Sanosuke (10th Captain):<br/>
-Seems like he died of a gunshot wound to the back two days after the <br/>
battle at Uneo in the house of Honjo Sarue-cho.<br/>
Shimada Kai:<br/>
-He was around six feet tall and had a sweet tooth, but "can't drink <br/>
a liquor drop."<br/>
-He not only ran a dojo later in life, but at one point after the war <br/>
he worked as a saleclerk of a Buddhist altar fittings shop! Is anyone <br/>
else thinking "Monk Anji"?!<br/>
-Forget Saito secretary! Sounds like Shimada was the handy one to <br/>
have around for those tough situations! Poor Nagakura couldn't jump <br/>
an earthen wall at Toba-Fushimi and he had to help him. Then later on <br/>
he carried Hijikata off the field on his back when the Vice-Commander <br/>
was wounded in the foot at Shirakawa!<br/>
The last person mentioned is Shinohara  Tainoshin (though they list <br/>
his name as Shinohara Taisuke). He was in investigations and was <br/>
another follower of Itou's and appears to have also joined the <br/>
Sekihoutai. Like Miki, he survived the war and lived to the ripe old <br/>
age of 84, passing away on June 13, 1911. It says that in later years <br/>
he "became a pious Christian."<br/>

And to think I discovered all this by accident!!!<br/>

Translate that Seinan War newspaper article on 3-hajime/1to5.net<br/>
please....<br/>

Hajime in the Shinsengumi)<br/>
does it REALLY say that Nakajima Nobori grew orchids?  Or is it his<br/>
wife's name or something...it is in the same sentence talking about<br/>
his firearms shop.  This detail interests me because orchids are very<br/>
hard to cultivate ^_^ you really have to have a green thumb to have<br/>
them grow successfully.<br/>
All of this info really makes things even more intriguing ... because<br/>
you may have already read that Saitou was -sent- to Aizu with a couple<br/>
of guys ahead of time...because there were battles at Aizu with many<br/>
members of the Shinsengumi (Nakajima Nobori included) we have<br/>
rosters...there was another Japanese site that said Shimada Kai was<br/>
thick necked this no doubt means that he was "buff".  It is<br/>
unfortunate, but people can change for better or worst...in the case<br/>
of Kondo, his story was a true rags to riches/power scenario and this<br/>
probably resulted in the clash with other managment level guys.  The<br/>
situation was so critical and stress levels must've been<br/>
high...dissent is normal when it comes to important tactical decisions.<br/>
<br/>
I also posted a question in English to a member of the 3-hajime.com<br/>
board, his/her name is "Passenger", about the whole business with the<br/>
towel.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I wonder if Miki tracked down Nagakura...what made them stop<br/>
fighting...<br/>
<br/>
I'm impressed with Shimada Kai...have you guys seen how fancy Japanese<br/>
Buddhist altars can get?  Some altars are HUGE...I'm happy that he had<br/>
a nice and peaceful job.</div>

Actually, what Nakajima Nobori grew was aspidistra! It's a type of a greenery <br/>
that is actually fairly hardy once it gets to going good. At least, that's <br/>
how the system I'm using translates the name.<br/>
<br/>
The other Saito is the guy who was adopted (if I'm reading this right). He <br/>
was apparently some sort of priest or in a priest's family to begin with. He <br/>
took part in the Koshu-Katsunuma fight, but left the remaining Shinsengumi in <br/>
Sendai. He later founded a private elementary school in Tama and remained devoted <br/>
to education-related business until he died in 1874 at 61 years of age. It <br/>
seems doubtful that he was ever part of the group before the beginning of the <br/>
Boshin War.<br/>
<br/>
As for what the translator I use says about Saito's activities? It's not much <br/>
better than the Babelfish, but here it goes:<br/>
<br/>
"...and I utter Morizaki at the third morning, and I many soldiers reach full <br/>
Ichio, too and halve a police superintendent second-rate platoon and I lead a <br/>
half captain Goro Fujita half platoon and put soldiers of the army together <br/>
and I lead progress, a squad long Masato Yusa half platoon and put right ways <br/>
together with army soldier and go over a secret path day flat peak and attack <br/>
it and I outrun and enemy's fortress of Tsuruwa mountain pass and (?) and climb <br/>
Yamagami of an above-ground house. (?) than this and lead a soldier of the <br/>
Goro Fujita right wing and go over Fukuhara Pass and shoot a final phase, an <br/>
enemy's fortress in (?), and, in addition, omission pushes forward a soldier to <br/>
an above-ground house, and (?) bombards this promptly and carries a this time <br/>
Goro Fujita gunshot wound equal to this on my back..."<br/>
<br/>
So it doesn't make much more sense this way than it did the other. That's why <br/>
I like to cross-reference between translators as much as possible. Even then, <br/>
some things remain confusing to me.<br/>
