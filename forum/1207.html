nifty once again delivers!  if you nifty this page you will see how<br/>
the police troops were split up again and again into smaller units for<br/>
maneuvering...the article mentions hills and if you look at a relief<br/>
map of where Seinan War battles occur there are plenty of hills...now<br/>
what is so hard about learning more about these battles? <br/>
NOTHING...there are plenty of names (with Lt. ranks) in the mentioned<br/>
article which undoubtedly show up in the huge Japanese books which do<br/>
a play by play of every battle in the SEinan WAr (sec is ALWAYS hopeful).<br/>
<br/>
it seems that Fujita G. wasn&#39;t the only one shot in the back...<br/>
&quot;soldier of 23 is shot dead from back, escape å»ã is å°¾æ&#39;(ed) from<br/>
it, and è³å¡ of right-and-left wings is hit Moreover, a ããè³ soldier=<br/>
<br/>
also attacks the Imperial army&quot;</div>
