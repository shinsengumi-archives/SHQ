<h3>Feminist?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-898278377">I was reading Clamp School Detectives and read the part where the 3 boys <br/>
where feminist. The next day at work, having nothing to do decide to analyze this <br/>
which lead to wondering which characters in Kenshin were feminist. Kenshin <br/>
obviously is a feminist but Saitou? I'm having trouble with him. At times I think <br/>
yeah he's a feminist but then again I doubt it. So is Saitou a feminist or <br/>
not?<br/>

<br/>
Good question.<br/>
<br/>
1) he believes in old school chivalry I think...a bit protective and a<br/>
perfect gentleman<br/>
<br/>
2) HOWEVER behind Tokio's back he acknowledges her to be a capable woman<br/>
<br/>
so no, not a feminist in a modern sense however he sensitive of the<br/>
feelings women have for men otherwise why did he ask Kenshin if<br/>
Kenshin had said goodbye to Kaoru?  (in manga...the scene at night<br/>
after Kenshin gives Kaoru the goodbye hug).</div>
