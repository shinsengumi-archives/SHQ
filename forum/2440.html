<br/>
Dr. Willis is -always- quoted in texts covering the seige and fall <br/>
of Aizu however he was also at Toba and Fushimi, where he treated <br/>
Aizu samurai, while accompanying Mitford.  Those texts, <br/>
understandably, had to paraphrase his words and I'll tell you right <br/>
now that nothing tops the detailed original.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Willis was employed by the British Legation.  The British at <br/>
this point had already chosen to support Satsuma thus Dr. Willis had <br/>
more than just a passing acquaintance with SAIGO TAKAMORI and OYAMA <br/>
IWAO (Saigo's cousin and future husband of Aizu's Yamakawa <br/>
Sutematsu). The biographer stated that he was VERY CLOSE to Saigo <br/>
however no detailed conversations or anecdotal stories have survived <br/>
in print.<br/>
Willis, after Boshin, lived in Kagoshima for many years and left in <br/>
1877 at the beginning of the SAtsuma Rebellion.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the Boshin War--He pleaded with Satsuma atleast twice that <br/>
injured prisoners of war should be spared execution.  It is not 100% <br/>
clear whether or not they were able to implement his ideas in a <br/>
uniform manner---it is implied that they tried.  <br/>
<br/>
Initially he *LOOKED* for enemy prisoners and did not find <br/>
any...alive.  He promised to tell the world that the Japanese <br/>
conducted warfare "humanely" should they try their best to look <br/>
after their prisoners. It was common practice for -both- sides to <br/>
behead the injured enemy they came across. This was not just simply <br/>
being cruel but almost out of necessity.  There were no such things <br/>
as well equipped medic teams ready to treat scores of injured <br/>
soldiers.  Dr. Willis himself, working alongside Japanese physicians <br/>
noticed that due to the extremely high number of patients, doctors <br/>
sometimes failed to locate and extract bullets or bone fragments in <br/>
the wound and just simply sew up the patient.  Thus the injured not <br/>
only died of infection, but also very likely of the bullet(s) doing <br/>
further damage in the body.  Most of the wounds he treated were the <br/>
result of bullets, *not* sword or spear wounds.<br/>
<br/>
He also taught Japanese doctors the use of chloroform to knock out <br/>
the patient however in one case he extracted a bullet from a boy's <br/>
neck without using chloroform.  <br/>
<br/>
Thus, in a situation where you cannot save the life of your own <br/>
comrade/friend---it may have been easier to just put a prisoner out <br/>
of his misery.  This reflects upon the suicides in Aizu---the people <br/>
there not only understood this widespread practice in war they also <br/>
heard true accounts from the battle front of <br/>
executions/rape/brutality thus rather than die by the sword of the <br/>
invaders they chose self destruction.<br/>
<br/>
His description of travelling to beseiged Aizu, with the invading <br/>
Imperial army is graphic complete with looting and plundering on <br/>
both sides due to the lack of supplies. Thus, what he heard and saw <br/>
first hand corroborated the information Katura Kogoro (Kido) noted <br/>
in his diary. One sentence here and there on what he saw firsthand <br/>
was very illustrative.  He asked to be recompensated for the money <br/>
he had to pay out of pocket to feed Aizu people huddling in the snow <br/>
(November 1868) with just a blanket for cover. <br/>
<br/>
True, he did not explicitly meet nor mention Shinsengumi, that we <br/>
know of, however he did see the wretched state of prisoners after <br/>
the war, one of whom was Yamaguchi Jiro (Saitou) and recorded <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori escorted out of his domain. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot stress the importance of this text enough it needs to be <br/>
read along with Shiba Goro's Remembering Aizu and Akiko Kunos <br/>
Unexpected Destinations, keep in mind that Dr. Willis was very <br/>
very "pro" Satsuma what he wrote did not grow out of a *bias* for <br/>
Aizu in any way.<br/>
