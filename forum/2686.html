Appalled doesn't even come close to describing my reaction to this. Sec<br/>
has always graciously shared her great finds with those on this list and<br/>
willingly gave access to her university webspace for the benefit of all<br/>
and now some little bastard has had the fucking nerve to root around in<br/>
the section with her school files and STEAL THEM!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you're very proud of yourself and happy with your "finds" which<br/>
apparently are of no use to anyone but Sec.<br/>
<br/>
I've advised Sec not to share anything again with the group at large as<br/>
a result. If she chooses to share something in the future I've offered<br/>
to place it on  megaupload where only the item in question can be had.<br/>
<br/>
Don't be surprised though if anything new regarding the Shinsengumi or<br/>
their times is only passed between a limited circle of friends leaving<br/>
the majority of you screwed and in the dark due to the  unconscionable<br/>
behavior of  others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218609497">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Let's all slow down a little and not get everyone involved. First I <br/>
will apologize to the list for this debacle. Second I will apologize <br/>
to SecretarytoCapt3 for downloading the stuff. I will explain, I use <br/>
a download manager that spiders ftps, file server and whole <br/>
websites. I was at work and yes was doing this on the side so I let <br/>
it run automatically instead of downloading the links provided one <br/>
by one. I have not taken an in-depth look at the files provided and <br/>
when I get to work will delete them. Yes this whole thing was Â–my- <br/>
fault and no I did not mean to steal anyone's files nor bandwidth <br/>
but this is what happens when a person does not pay enough <br/>
attention. My apologies.<br/>
<br/>
To the list, I'm sorry you guys got involved in my stupidity. I hope <br/>
that SHQ will remain to serve the community that visits it and not <br/>
be stuck in this one event. I will now excuse myself from this list <br/>
so as to prevent events of this kind and so that the list can <br/>
conduct its activities in a confident manner. I implore you to <br/>
conduct your fandom as usual and put this incident behind you.<br/>
<br/>
To the Mods and SecretarytoCapt3 if you have further inquiries let <br/>
me know via e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
~Kizu<br/>

<h3>Admin--APOLOGY to Kizu/end of discussion</h3>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I already contacted Kizu off list and offered my apologies. She's been <br/>
part of this list from the beginning and I know she would never do <br/>
anything intentionally wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression (and I'm sure Sec was too) that someone had <br/>
to manually search through her university space to retrieve her files.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize also to you all for the public bitchiness, but I'm sure you <br/>
can understand how this struck me the wrong way. I equated it to someone <br/>
reading a book excerpt on my web site then finding a way to access the <br/>
unpublished things I occasionally store and claiming it as their own.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I apologize to Kizu and I hope she'll stay with us. And I ask <br/>
everyone to drop the subject once they see this and not to respond to <br/>
any  posts that get through on the topic in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</div>
