*this point about he Yamakawa brothers has always interested me<br/>
because either the older or younger brother was in fact Fujita Goro's<br/>
friend...(-both- are listed on 3-hajime.com on the page which lists<br/>
his friends and family)<br/>
<br/>
*a long time ago I mentioned a Japanese messageboard post in which<br/>
someone was pretty surprised Fujita Goro would know the Yamakawas (who<br/>
were natives of Aizu by the way)...they were impressed it seems<br/>
because these men were from pretty different backgrounds but shared<br/>
the common experience of defending Aizu<br/>
<br/>
Hiroshi Yamakawa (-the older brother- was a close attendant to<br/>
Matsudaira and like Fujita Goro served in the Seinan War) he later<br/>
held other important political (it seems) and military positions [just<br/>
nifty the page for details]<br/>
<br/>
Kenjiro Yamakawa (-the younger brother- I always knew this man was a<br/>
scientist but this is the first time Yale University shows up...<br/>
