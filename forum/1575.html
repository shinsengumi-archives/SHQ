Either way a sequel to Fuun Shinsengumi was announced by Genki for <br/>
release in Japan this winter 2004.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the first one was where you can play as one of the <br/>
Shinsengumi to guard the bakufu against some tenchu ninja's whose <br/>
sole purpose in life is to assasinate... <br/>
<br/>
This one is a little different the roles are reversed, you get to <br/>
play as samurais out to assasinate the bakufu and you'll be pitted <br/>
against the "our" guys and some others pro shogunate. Ishin lovers <br/>
will fight with Ryoma and Takasugi...<br/>
<br/>
What are the improvements? Well better graphics and now it actually <br/>
has voices.. Also you are not restricted to just Kyoto anymore...</div>
