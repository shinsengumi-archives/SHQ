<h3>what about Inoue Taisuke</h3>
by <i>shenlong71328</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-520382486">I was searching through the net and was amazed to find absolutly NOTHING about this young man/boy.   So what do we know about Kondou Isami page?   How old was he when he joined the Shinsengumi?   When did he join?   What happened to him?   Did he die during the many battles of the Restoration or did he live to a ripe old age during the Meji era?<br/>

It just so happens that I am in the midst of compiling some data about this <br/>
elusive figure. Off the top of my head I can tell you for sure that he was <br/>
the son of Inoue Matsugoro, who was the brother of Inoue Genzaburo. Taisuke, <br/>
if I recall correctly, was at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and claims to have <br/>
seen his uncle&#39;s death; however, recent scholarship by Kikuchi Akira has <br/>
suggested that this may be incorrect due to the overly idealistic nature of <br/>
Taisuke&#39;s narrative (having the time to take his uncle&#39;s head *and* sword <br/>
and rather conveniently along the way drop them off at a temple), and the <br/>
fact that a Bakufu soldier left a testimony that offers a different <br/>
perspective on the death of a &quot;Shinsengumi soldier manning a cannon&quot; who may <br/>
very well have been Genzaburo. Stay tuned, I should be able to post a few <br/>
more things soon.<br/>
