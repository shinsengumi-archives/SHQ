<h3>New Shinsengumi Enthusiast</h3>
by <i>moeru_h12</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108627257">Hello to everyone! I'm glad that this ML is alive and still very <br/>
active. I'm a recent fan of the Shinsengumi and was instantly <br/>
enamored b/c of NHK's Shinsengumi! series. I'm mostly interested in <br/>
Yamanami Keisuke's character but all in all, I like them all <br/>
especially Kondou Isami and Saitou Hajime.<br/>
<br/>
But first and foremost, Yamanami intrigues me the most. There aren't <br/>
any photos of him and not much sources about him as well. In <br/>
Hillsborough's book, he was mentioned but not much information was <br/>
given. I was told that since he wasn't present during the Ikedaya <br/>
Jiken (when the Shinsengumi's 'fame' started) and b/c he didn't live <br/>
that long to be recognized, not much information is available about <br/>
him. <br/>
<br/>
Since this group is filled with Shinsengumi fans, I hope I can get a <br/>
few things about Yamanami (and about other Shinsengumi members too). <br/>
And at the same time, share something of worth in this ML. That's <br/>
for a brief introduction. Yoroshiku onegai shimasu!:P<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-103793642">I've written most of the Yamanami article at Wikipedia and this reply is basically an edited <br/>
version of what I've written so far. <br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
Yamanami Keisuke (1833 - March 20, 1865)  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Background<br/>
<br/>
Though the details of his origin are unclear, he was said to be the son of a kenjutsu <br/>
instructor originated from the Sendai domain.<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami was trained under Chiba Shusaku Narimasa, the founder of the Hokushin Itto-<br/>
ryu, and attained Menkyo Kaiden (license of total transmission) sometime before 1860.<br/>
<br/>
In 1860, after Yamanami was defeated by Kondo Isami in a match, he was enrolled at the <br/>
Tennen Rishin Ryu's Shieikan dojo in Edo (which was run by Kondo from 1861.) Yamanami <br/>
was particularly educated in literary and military arts, with a gentle personality and a kind <br/>
heart. He was very much admired by the Head Teacher (Jukutou) at the Shieikan, Okita <br/>
Soujirou (the later Okita Souji), who called him a big brother. In 1863, Yamanami. Kondo <br/>
and other members of the Shieikan joined the Roshigumi, the military unit being sent to <br/>
Kyoto by the Tokugawa Shogunate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Period<br/>
<br/>
In Kyoto, Kondo and his "faction" stayed in Kyoto while the rest of the Roshigumi returned <br/>
to Edo. Soon, the Mibu Roshigumi (which would eventually become known as the <br/>
Shinsengumi) was formed. Yamanami served as a vice-commander, alongside Hijikata <br/>
Toshizo and Niimi Nishiki (after Niimi's demotion due to the fight with wrestlers.)<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami was said to be one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo <br/>
assassination in 1863. After the purge of the Serizawa faction, Yamanami and Hijikata <br/>
became the two vice-commanders.<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami did not take part in the famed Ikedaya Jiken in 1864, instead he guarded the <br/>
Shinsengumi's headquarters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Death<br/>
<br/>
Some time after the Ikedaya Jiken he tried to escape the Shinsengumi. As a result, he <br/>
committed seppuku with Okita as his second on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23), <br/>
1865. There are several speculations on Yamanami's reason to escape, including a theory <br/>
that Yamanami committed suicide without ever leaving Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
The most accepted theory is that Yamanami fled to Otsu while Kondo sent Okita to retrieve <br/>
him. After Yamanami returned to Mibu, he was ordered to commit seppuku. He asked <br/>
Okita to serve as his second. There is also a theory that Kondo asked Okita to serve as <br/>
Yamanami's second out of respect for Yamanami. (The second was usually a closest friend <br/>
or family member whenever possible.) <br/>
<br/>
Yamanami was buried at the Koen Temple in Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Trivia<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami owned a sword named Sekishin Okikou.<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami was also known as Sannan (the alternate reading of his family name).<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami was said to be small-statured and pale-skinned.<br/>
<br/>
During his time in Edo, neighborhood children were very fond of Yamanami.<br/>
<br/>
Although some believe Akesato to be fictional, Yamanami did in fact have a mistress <br/>
named Akesato in Kyoto.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-522736192">With regards to the name on Yamanami's sword, I looked it up on the Japanese <br/>
Wikipedia and got the following: "Banshu-juunin Sekishin Okimitsu". Those <br/>
kanji are not read "Okikou"-- as can be evidenced here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontoantiques.com/g83.htm">http://www.nihontoantiques.com/g83.htm</a> (Different swordsmith but the same <br/>
kanji for the name in question.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, Seven, I've been curious for some time-- why do you translate the <br/>
names of your Japanese resources? It certainly isn't standard reference <br/>
procedure to do so, and makes the job of someone who might try to look up <br/>
the same sources (after looking at your work) more difficult. For instance, <br/>
if someone read my work on Aizu and I had stated Yamakawa Hiroshi's book <br/>
"Kyoto Shugoshoku Shimatsu" as "Kyoto Commissioner Management," would <br/>
someone (with presumed Japanese skill) have been able to track it down? Yes, <br/>
I know, I'd have the author's name, but it makes the job of the reader/peer <br/>
editor much easier if you give the title of a foreign language book in the <br/>
language that it was written. At any rate, I'm not trying to criticise you, <br/>
I have a sincere interest in trying to understand why you do so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The names of my Japanese resources are translated on my receipts. I've translated a few <br/>
ones into English in order to organize my references.  Though, I've also thought about the <br/>
problem you've highlighted.  Now I sometimes use translated titles (and sometimes don't.) <br/>
It's not really the solution and I'll figure something out eventually.<br/>

see in both cases you only translate the title after writing it out <br/>

Thanks.  That's indeed the perfect solution.  <br/>
Translating the publishers?  My agent hasn't done that (and neither have I.)  In PHP's case, <br/>
PHP's official English name is PHP INTERFACE.  It's printed in the books. <br/>
