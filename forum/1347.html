Ofcourse if Tokio shows up she'll collar the wolf and drag him home!<br/>

I posted a question at 3-hajime.com as to whether the stage play and<br/>
the novel are related and the webmaster answered that they are<br/>
independent of one another.  So basically we have Fujita Goro in a<br/>
play and in a novel.  Furthermore if you nifty<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/bbs_06.cgi">http://www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/bbs_06.cgi</a> and check out the reply<br/>
to my post the name NAGAKURA SHINPACHI shows up very clearly in her<br/>
reply. Although the translation isn't clear (is it EVER?) it means<br/>
that the writer of either the play [or] novel had the 2 meet ^_^<br/>
awesome fanfiction we can't read.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading some more Seinan War stuff and found that the soldiers<br/>
had 2 major complaints.  Keep in mind that much of the hard fighting<br/>
will occur after the month of February and southern Japan supposedly<br/>
has hot/humid conditions AND often these guys had to climb<br/>
hills/mountains.<br/>
1) uniforms were too hot<br/>
2) leather boots/shoes extremely uncomfortable and finally the<br/>
officials allowed their guys to go back and wear good old straw sandals...<br/>
*if you examine the pic <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.3-hajime.com/syouzou2.html">http://www.3-hajime.com/syouzou2.html</a><br/>
the sitting next to Fujita Goro was wearing straw sandals <br/>
<br/>
War coverage<br/>
There was a strong desire by the government to cover the war in<br/>
detail, hence the newspaper article we have which mentions F.G. not<br/>
surprisingly the articles may not be 100% accurate, because the gov.<br/>
wanted people in the cities to stay optimistic (people were wondering<br/>
why it was taking soo long to supress the rebellion---reasons will<br/>
appear in my write up).  While the war was going on in the south,<br/>
Tokyo was experiencing a series of mysterious fires and arson was<br/>
suspected.  Basically people in the city had very good reason to fear<br/>
that rebel sympathizers were retaliating.  Furthermore, before the<br/>
Siege of Kumamoto castle/garrison (in February) there was an earlier<br/>
night attack on the same garrison where 300 policeman were killed (I<br/>
believe the number includes injuries? 300 is a very high number the<br/>
number of rebels is not clear)...regardless of how many were killed<br/>
what is clear is that many bodies were found still in bed which<br/>
reveals the true nature of the attack...it was an inside job AND some<br/>
officers, it is BELIEVED by  writers, let the rebels inside the<br/>
garrison. Kumamoto had policemen who were natives of Satsuma as well.<br/>
  This news once it entered the major cities started a whirlwind of<br/>
rumors amongst the population. In the month of March the gov.<br/>
attempted to implement "western/modern" strategies which were<br/>
ineffective or incompatible to the rough terrain.</div>
