<h3>GONIN + Shinsengumi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310020137">At first I rented Gonin to see Koichi Sato but now I realized that<br/>
many of you will WANT TO SEE THIS FILM.<br/>
1) eye candy value don't believe me? Koichi Sato (Mibugishiden Saitou)<br/>
is Bandai the young, rich and famous club owner who is in ALOT of<br/>
trouble...<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/gonin.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/gonin.jpg</a><br/>
Koichi Sato is OUTSTANDING (Pssst fangirls there is an onscreen kiss<br/>
too hehehe but it may not be what you expect, oh and he tries to speak<br/>
English)<br/>
2) Phil, Beat Takeshi (Gohatto Hijikata) is in it...with a supporting<br/>
role...I guess this film will inform him for the yaoish role in Gohatto<br/>
3) Naoto Takenaka (Mibugishiden TV Series Saitou...the dancing guy in<br/>
SHALL WE DANCE) is also in this movie...he is a dynamic actor...he<br/>
also dances in Gonin but for a completely different reason... <br/>
*see this post is not so off topic eh?<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who want great cinematography and story this movie is<br/>
totally awesome...the film is like a Quentin Tarantino movie that<br/>
makes sense and done with good taste thus you can expect violence but<br/>
not merely for the shock value. I have to mention something else in<br/>
the movie, a female character named "Nammy" is supposed to be Thai, in<br/>
fact the actress does say a couple of sentences in Thai but the<br/>
subtitles messed up the translations (they seemed to shuffle up the<br/>
order of the sentences)...the bit with passports is common knowledge<br/>
for people who study the sex industry basically women who travel<br/>
abroad for this business usually have their passports and all other<br/>
identification confiscated by their pimps/yakuza. Finally a gangster<br/>
film which doesn't insult your intelligence (please watch it<br/>
CAREFULLY)...I am thoroughly impressed with the A+ caste and top notch<br/>
story!!!!! Flawless....<br/>
<br/>
*I also rented GONIN 2...but this time its about a bunch of<br/>
women...unlike GONIN, GONIN 2 has minor flaws in terms of its<br/>
pace...slick action/dialogue suddenly degenerates into stagnant<br/>
meditation on human suffering</div>
