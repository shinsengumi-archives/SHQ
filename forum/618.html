<h3>PMK licensed by ADV?</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271986696">You probably already know.. But for those who do not..<br/>
<br/>
Well I was just over at animenewsnetwork forum and was I surprised! <br/>
Geez go away for some weeks and miss out on things... ^_^*<br/>
<br/>
ADV has announced that it will license 1000 volumes (not titles) of <br/>
manga, so far 37 had gone through and this includes Peacemaker <br/>
Kurogane. I could not find reference to whether they will be <br/>
translating the prequel SIMP but translation of the second part PMK <br/>
is ongoing. <br/>
<br/>
About the Anime, ADV (at least from what I know right now) has not <br/>
announced ownership of the Anime but there are rumors that they are <br/>
or very soon will be dubbing the series... Wow that was fast. If <br/>
this is true then I'm glad I got the fansub version first. Unless <br/>
ADV announces they officially licensed PMK Anime then I guess the <br/>
distribution of fansubs by fansubbers won't stop till then. So glad <br/>
though that someone is picking up the manga because that means the <br/>
DVDs will be out soon, probably on or after fall this year. <br/>
WAI!!! :O)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762128272">Bittorrent would be a good place to start... You'll have to download <br/>
a bittorrent client... The groups who I think subbed it... SEICHI <br/>
and AnimeForever and Anime Keep.... The best place to find <br/>
bittorrent links would be www.animesuki.com. Here's the link direct <br/>
to the PMK page in Animesuki... <br/>

<br/>
Got to hurry though since once ADV announces they've licensed the <br/>
anime, fansubs links for download will disappear. That's how <br/>
fansubbers show support and respect to licensers.<br/>
