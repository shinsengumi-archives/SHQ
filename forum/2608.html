<h3>Okita TB, 19th Century Romanticism and more</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-50467580">I was reflecting on the comments at SHQ SPY DIVISION concerning<br/>
tuberculosis:<br/>

<br/>
someone mentioned that people knew way before the 20th century that TB<br/>
was contagious<br/>
<br/>
this really was not the case in most of the population---simply<br/>
because there was a great deal of *conflict and CONFUSION in the<br/>
medical community over whether or not TB was part of a spectrum of<br/>
infections, or hereditary (women with TB were divorced immediately for<br/>
fear that their children would get TB not through the<br/>
sputum/phlegm/coughing---but by blood too)<br/>
<br/>
only people with the money could afford isolated care in an ideal<br/>
environment<br/>
<br/>
this book will also mention doctors, trying to study TB actually dying<br/>
of it because they were not sure how it was transmitted.  I mentioned<br/>
in my post at the SHQ SPY DIVISION of scientists, husband and wife who<br/>
had TB, still caring for their own children (not out of necessity as<br/>
they had friends and relatives)<br/>
<br/>
in 1882 Dr. Robert Koch discovered tubercle bacillus the aerobic<br/>
bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)---doctors around the world did<br/>
not believe him and there was a "delay" in adjusting their<br/>
methodologies and treatments---because it still made sense to many<br/>
that it was inherited (as of 1901 medical journals still printed<br/>
articles proving how it ran in the family).  Koch's failed attempt of<br/>
developing a cure, tuberculin, also didn't help his cause.<br/>
<br/>
So I skimmed<br/>
The Modern Epidemic: A history of tuberculosis in Japan<br/>
By William Johnston. 432 pp. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University<br/>
Press, 1995. $45. ISBN 0-674-57912-7<br/>
<br/>
[New England Journal of Medicine Review<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/334/11/739%5d">http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/334/11/739%5d</a><br/>
<br/>
yeah you can't really buy this book at that price---so see if your<br/>
library has it (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, let's get the Okita issues out of the way.  <br/>
The superstitions and stigma associated with the symptoms/pollution<br/>
(blood) of tuberculosis have been mentioned on this list before---this<br/>
book will not only go into incredible detail it will also mention real<br/>
life examples (from the 20th century) illustrating how these people<br/>
were banished from society.  <br/>
<br/>
The book approaches the topic from a medical point of view and how<br/>
this illness is not confined to just the respiratory system --- but<br/>
can affect your spine, stomach, intestines etc.  Members here who<br/>
study science and want to combine study w/ Shinsengumi interests will<br/>
really enjoy this book.  It was a disfiguring disease associated with<br/>
bad karma--hence the secrecy of OKita's health was not simply for<br/>
reasons concerning group morale.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot recall the exact Japanese website but there is talk that<br/>
Okita was a "clean child" or celibate or even a virgin (all of this is<br/>
JUST a rumor).  During his lifetime it was believed that excessive<br/>
sexual activity will lead to TB---thus if he was rumored to be a clean<br/>
child it makes sense that it was part of the medical advice to abstain<br/>
from sex.<br/>
<br/>
Okita's constant smiling.  During his lifetime melancholia was<br/>
associated with TB---hence keep your spirits up and you will not catch it!<br/>
<br/>
Okita as "feminine" --- the book does a stellar job of examining TB in<br/>
Meiji era literature (there was an entire GENRE devoted to it). <br/>
Usually the illness is associated with young frail, beautiful women. <br/>
Interestingly, many girls after their first menses WERE likely to get<br/>
TB, especially if they had a lower intake of protein (note many<br/>
Japanese had a vegetarian and fish diet that time).    We know that<br/>
the Shinsengumi were the subject of folktales and even the novel<br/>
Nakazato Kaizan's DAIBOSATSU-TOGE [the film SWORD OF DOOM] (although<br/>
Okita was not feminine or childlike in this work) it is easy to see<br/>
how a doomed swordsman with TB all of sudden takes on female qualities<br/>
which would solidify him as a perpetually tragic figure in fiction.<br/>
<br/>
the book will mention some familiar names:<br/>
[Matsumoto Ryojun] physician who accompanied shogunate troops as far<br/>
as Hakodate and later along with Nagakura and SAitou built a memorial<br/>
<br/>
[Dr. Willis] (at Toba & Fushimi and Aizu during Boshin War,<br/>
Kumamoto/Kyushu until Seinan War, later laid the foundation of Siriraj<br/>
Medical School and Hospital in Bangkok)<br/>
<br/>
[Dr. Baelz] German who was the personal physician to royality and<br/>
governmental VIPS --- his sticking to cellular *rather* than<br/>
bacteriology pathology in Tokyo University School of Medicine<br/>
inhibited alternate modes of approaching the illness (we now know<br/>
bacteriology was the right way to go)<br/>
<br/>
***and for the one person out there who loves Dutch studies*** yes<br/>
Dutch medicine is discussed<br/>
<br/>
To learn more about the romanticism connected to TB please read<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~mfukuda/english.html">http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~mfukuda/english.html</a><br/>
novelist/doctor/bureaucrat MORI OGAI is mentioned on this page.  <br/>
Mori Ogai, Higuchi Ichiyo and several of the most famoust writers of<br/>
the Meiji Era suffered from and died of TB.  Note how Mori Ogai kept<br/>
his condition a secret.<br/>
<br/>
The book also provides euphemisms doctors will use in diagnosing a<br/>
patient.  Doctors who diagnose patients with TB were themselves<br/>
subject to negative public reaction!<br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Footnotes]<br/>
The biggest obstacle to medical education was the abhorrance of<br/>
dissection and association with uncleanliness see:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/message/107">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/message/107</a><br/>
in the late 1890s-early 20th century the only women's medical academy<br/>
(born from the founder's desire to have women treat women infected<br/>
with sexually transmitted diseases) was ridiculed for unladylike<br/>
manners in dissecting cadavers...<br/>
<br/>
Takamine Hideo spent alot of time studying protozoa under a<br/>
microcope---the discovery of tubercle bacillus would have been of<br/>
great interest to him as well since his own brother died of TB in 1883<br/>
<br/>
The novel mentioned throughout the book HOTOTOGISU (bestseller later<br/>
translated into English as NAMIKO: A REALISTIC NOVEL)<br/>
was about Yamakawa Oyama Sutematsu<br/>

<h3>Re: About Nagakura Shinpachi (wife search)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891694838">Here is a better idea<br/>
<br/>
set your browser to view Japanese fonts<br/>
<br/>
character for WIFE 螯ｻ<br/>
<br/>
insert that character next to 豌ｸ蛟画眠蜈ｫ Nagakura SHinpachi<br/>
<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoo.co.jp">http://www.yahoo.co.jp</a><br/>

so you will get only sites which has the info you want<br/>

[footnote: where did I get the character for wife?  I remember that<br/>
the site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.1to5.net/saito/family/family.html">http://www.1to5.net/saito/family/family.html</a> has the word<br/>

<h3>Re: Okita TB, 19th Century Romanticism and more</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-516753156">Below are some quotes which may be helpful in understanding "OKITA as<br/>
the TB PATIENT"<br/>
<br/>
Sparer M.D., Phineas J.   PERSONALITY STRESS AND TUBERCULOSIS<br/>
New York: International Universities Press, Inc 1956.<br/>
<br/>
To add some balance to the information below I'd like to mention right<br/>
away that:<br/>
Dr. Lawrason Brown, a pioneer in TB treatment stated that "The<br/>
tuberculosis patient is described as anything between an insane<br/>
criminal and a saint too ethereal for this mundane sphere." (Calden,<br/>
Lews, Thurston 275)<br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
Calden PhD, Lewis M.D., Thurston PhD "The Patient Looks at<br/>
Tuberculosis" (275-299)<br/>
"The belief that there is a specific `tuberculous personality'<br/>
characterized by undue cheerfulness (spes Phthisica)and marked<br/>
intellectual productivity has gained wide support." (Calden 275)<br/>
<br/>
Due to the patient's dependence on others during their illness, the<br/>
researchers chose representative quotes from the 570 subjects they used.<br/>
One said "I feel like a baby again" (Calden 288)<br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
Wittkower M.D., Eric D. "Psychological Aspects" pages 153-174<br/>
Wittkower Associate Prof of Psychiatry McGill University, Montreal CA<br/>
<br/>
Toxemia due to the Tubercle bacillus is also believed to cause<br/>
dramatic changes in emotions, however at the time of this publication<br/>
the results of those studies are inconclusive and possibly exaggerated.<br/>
<br/>
[Reaction to Illness]<br/>
"Let us assume that the patients have passed beyond the unavoidable<br/>
breaking-in period and have settled down to being ill and to being ill<br/>
with tuberculosis.  Afterwards a variety of mental changes may take<br/>
place which time and again have puzzled observers.  It has been said<br/>
that tuberculous patients are predominantly sensitive, neurotic,<br/>
depressed, optimistic, elated, euphoric, easily suggestible,<br/>
whimsical, CHILDISH, selfish, self-centered, capriciousMost patients<br/>
with tuberculosis are in a mood of mild overt or concealed depression<br/>
and anxiety, which are normal and adequate reaction to indisious<br/>
dieaseOffsprings of these reactions and defenses against them are<br/>
defiance, ULTRA-CHEERFULNESS." (Wittkower 164)<br/>
<br/>
[the following applies to people who live in TB sanatoriums or have<br/>
other illnesses which require isolationlike cholera]<br/>
"infant-like egocentricism" is caused by<br/>
removal of stimuli from their environment<br/>
absence of responsibility<br/>
unrealistic long-term perspective (such as setting far off goals in life)<br/>
<br/>
[Tuberculosis and Genius]<br/>
"Much has been written on the subject of tuberculosis and genius[list<br/>
of geniuses].  The truth of the matter seems to be that tuberculosis<br/>
is a common disease, and therefore also occurs in men and women of<br/>
geniustuberculosis for a variety of reasons favors fantasy<br/>
productionand the dreaded limitation of their span of life stimulates<br/>
their productivity." (Wittkower 155-6)<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
Dunbar M.D. Med.Sc.D., Ph.D, Flanders. "Anxiety, Stress and<br/>
Respiratory Diseases Especially Tuberculosis" (208-232)<br/>
<br/>
Part of a discussion how TB patients manipulate the people around them <br/>
"Tuberculous patients behave like deprived children." (Dunbar 226)</div>
