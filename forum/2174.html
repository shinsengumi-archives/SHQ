<h3>Shizuko Akama Mini Bio</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045835003">Anyone who has surfed the Japanese sites will always find Shizuko <br/>
Akama's work mentioned here and there.  Like many Shinsengumi <br/>
researchers she obviously went through a HIjikata "phase" and wrote a <br/>
book on him in the 1970s.  She is most well known ofcourse for her <br/>
books on Saitou Hajime.  Most recently she mentioned that she would <br/>
like to continue writing on Fujita Goro and...TAKEDA.  She seems to <br/>
be pretty cool and if anyone out there, besides the usual <br/>
translators, would like to try to translate this piece please do <br/>
help.  She even interacts with fans, owns Fujita Goro's haori and <br/>
frankly without her dedication many mysteries surrounding Saitou and <br/>
his later career would have never been explored.  Personally, I wish <br/>
I knew Japanese so that I could interview her and have her explain <br/>
her own personal interpretations on things. But the most important <br/>
question is..."of all the fascinating members of the <br/>
Shinsengumi...why Saitou?"  Because Okita and Hijikata and Nagakura <br/>
(due to his memoirs) have always been the more popular figures, so I <br/>
wonder why she picked Saitou.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to burden our usual volunteers so someone please please <br/>
help (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
She is an elderly lady...this is a very old picture<br/>
