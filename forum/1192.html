<h3>Bakumatsu Junjoden</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257858413">I&#39;ve just wached a film called ,&quot;Bakumatsu Junjoden&quot;, broadcasted on Japanese <br/>
satellite TV tonight.<br/>
I put an extract of plot sammary from Imdb,<br/>
&quot;In the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, there was a cute warrior, Souji <br/>
Okita, who belonged to the armed police of the shogunate in Kyoto. Very few <br/>
knew that Souji was not a boy, but a woman. Souji loved the vice-leader of the <br/>
armed police, Toshizou Hijikata....&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Originally written as a stageplay by Kouhei Tsuka, this film casts also Ken <br/>
Watanabe in the role of Ryoma who fell in love with Soji.<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen this film until now for some reasons, but finaly I&#39;m getting <br/>
to like it.<br/>
Although the story is slapstick, it shows symbolically some historical <br/>
aspects, I think.<br/>
Actors are good and we can see fangirls screaming to Okita, Hijikata writing <br/>
his famous love poetry, sharpnesse of Kotetsu giving satisfaction to Kondo,and <br/>
an interesting charactor of Izo Okada etc...<br/>
If you have a chance to get this film, I can recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the cover of DVD and some photos here,<br/>

<br/>
For a second I thought that was real historical fact...DON&#39;T scare me like that! I was about to say...::gasp:: Okita-sama was a girl? Whew...that was a close one...heheh, it&#39;s just fiction saying he&#39;s a girl...I&#39;m relieved...<br/>
<br/>
That nearly gave me a heart attack! And if it WAS true and my friends found out, they would tease me till the day I died.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it might be the same one, &quot;Okita was a B-cup&quot; was the sales message for <br/>
the film.<br/>
Anyway,this Girl Okita is really strong, and it&#39;s very funny to see Okita <br/>
beating down Hijikata.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okita was jealous of Miyuki whom Hijikata took care of, and got anger to him <br/>
who didn&#39;t understand her feeling. So they started a terrible fight with <br/>
swords in front of Kondo and other ex-Shieikan members.<br/>
<br/>
May be, there is always another woman when a girl want to beat down Hijikata. <br/>
