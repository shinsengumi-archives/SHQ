<h3>Bakumatsu Junjoden</h3>
by <i>tamagot93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257858413">I've just wached a film called ,"Bakumatsu Junjoden", broadcasted on Japanese <br/>
satellite TV tonight.<br/>
I put an extract of plot sammary from Imdb,<br/>
"In the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, there was a cute warrior, Souji <br/>
Okita, who belonged to the armed police of the shogunate in Kyoto. Very few <br/>
knew that Souji was not a boy, but a woman. Souji loved the vice-leader of the <br/>
armed police, Toshizou Hijikata...."<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101403/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101403/</a><br/>
<br/>
Originally written as a stageplay by Kouhei Tsuka, this film casts also Ken <br/>
Watanabe in the role of Ryoma who fell in love with Soji.<br/>
I've never seen this film until now for some reasons, but finaly I'm getting <br/>
to like it.<br/>
Although the story is slapstick, it shows symbolically some historical <br/>
aspects, I think.<br/>
Actors are good and we can see fangirls screaming to Okita, Hijikata writing <br/>
his famous love poetry, sharpnesse of Kotetsu giving satisfaction to Kondo,and <br/>
an interesting charactor of Izo Okada etc...<br/>
If you have a chance to get this film, I can recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the cover of DVD and some photos here,<br/>

<br/>
For a second I thought that was real historical fact...DON'T scare me like that! I was about to say...::gasp:: Okita-sama was a girl? Whew...that was a close one...heheh, it's just fiction saying he's a girl...I'm relieved...<br/>
<br/>
That nearly gave me a heart attack! And if it WAS true and my friends found out, they would tease me till the day I died.<br/>

the film.<br/>
Anyway,this Girl Okita is really strong, and it's very funny to see Okita <br/>
beating down Hijikata.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okita was jealous of Miyuki whom Hijikata took care of, and got anger to him <br/>
who didn't understand her feeling. So they started a terrible fight with <br/>
swords in front of Kondo and other ex-Shieikan members.<br/>
<br/>
May be, there is always another woman when a girl want to beat down Hijikata. <br/>
