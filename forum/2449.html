<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805434167">Hi, i saw in the web of shinsengumi headquarters a photo of okita<br/>
souji, that i had also seen in another page related to this web called<br/>
'bakumatsu'i think. I'm very interested in how accurate this picture<br/>
is and how it was found.... if anyone can give me any information, i<br/>
would be thankful. I have been gathering information of this guy for<br/>
many years and it really surprised me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881853698">When I was looking up information on him, I ran into a number of sites that claimed that the photo isn't him (one site claimed it was a Kabuki actor of about the same time dressed up as him).   Appearently, those photos have no way of being proven that it was Okita.   As far as I've read, there is no knowledge that Okita ever did pose for a photograph (itwould be good if someone could answer this for me).<br/>
 <br/>
Thats not to say the photo isn't him... its more like I'm in the same boat as you are and have no clue whether that really was him or not.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202298156">Damn I only wish the creation of a time machine for cases like this. I hate to have pics of me taken is a torture so I would not blame him. Maybe he used to think that the flash was something like a soul absorber or energy or something of that natyre or whatever he thought. WHo knows if it is him or not, but the fact remains Ojikata Souji still is a mistery in someway and it helps to the creation of legends,fables and myths. People like him and the rest of shisengumi where real but we only have only small things about each of the ppl in it as individuals but as a group... there reputation still presided them. <br/>
Anyone wants to contribute,lol!<br/>
