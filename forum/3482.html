<h3>Shinsengumi Book Excerpt</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-540047501">Just wanted to let you guys know that FALLING THROUGH GLASS is now on<br/>
sale at Liquid Silver Books. The story features Japanese American<br/>
college student Emmi Maeda who falls back to 1864 Kyoto and gets on the<br/>
wrong side of Hijikata in her quest to find her way back home.  The<br/>
scene below does't feature Hijikata-san but it does feature Yamanami and<br/>
everybody's favorite miburo Saitou. Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
"But, I'm afraid," Emmi said as the harsh truth sunk it. She<br/>
was a prisoner.<br/>
<br/>
"It's only for tonight," Kaemon said. "I'll come<br/>
back for you tomorrow."<br/>
<br/>
Emmi sniffled and nodded. He almost seemed to care."What about my<br/>
mirror?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yamanami-san will see that it's secure."<br/>
<br/>
She nodded again and lowered her gaze, determined not to cry in front of<br/>
this guy.<br/>
She looked up when he spoke again, his tone much softer than it had been<br/>
all night.<br/>
<br/>
"Yamanami-san, could you assign a guard to her for the night?"<br/>
<br/>
"Of course."<br/>
<br/>
"Could you choose someone totally trustworthy? Someone who would<br/>
never think to<br/>
take advantage of the situation."<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami placed his hand on Kaemon's shoulder. "I've been<br/>
having difficulty<br/>
sleeping lately. Let me lock her mirror away, and then I'll go stay<br/>
with her."<br/>
<br/>
Kaemon bowed deeply. "I am in your debt, Yamanami-san."<br/>
<br/>
When the older man left, Kaemon looked at Emmi a long time, and she<br/>
tried to<br/>
figure out what was going on behind those piercing, dark eyes of his.<br/>
For the first time,<br/>
she took a long look at her "rescuer." He was young; she doubted<br/>
he was much older than<br/>
she was.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, he was awfully good looking.<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami returned from his room, and Kaemon left without saying another<br/>
word or<br/>
even looking back.<br/>
<br/>
"I won't lie to you, Maeda-dono," Yamanami said as they<br/>
walked towards a small Lshaped<br/>
building at the far end of the compound. "The men we have detained<br/>
are typical<br/>
dogs, and even though we rearranged them to place empty cells adjacent<br/>
to yours, they'll<br/>
still be able to glimpse you coming in, so don't be surprised if<br/>
they say things you might<br/>
not be used to hearing said to a lady."<br/>
<br/>
Unnerved at the thought of being stuck in an actual jail with violent<br/>
criminals, Emmi<br/>
stumbled.<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami placed a steadying hand on her arm. "It will be all right.<br/>
I'll see to it that<br/>
you're not alone in there."<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you."<br/>
<br/>
As predicted, the prisoners began calling out when she stepped inside<br/>
the jail. Emmi<br/>
was glad they spoke so quickly; she couldn't process it all, but even<br/>
the gist of their<br/>
words made her want to throw up.<br/>
<br/>
"Silence!" Yamanami yelled in a voice infinitely more commanding<br/>
than his<br/>
measured speaking tone.<br/>
<br/>
Emmi kept her eyes focused on her feet. She followed the vice-commander<br/>
to the<br/>
middle of the three small cells that formed the shorter portion of the<br/>
L. Blankets had been<br/>
hung on the sides as makeshift walls. Yamanami picked up the clean<br/>
chamber pot from<br/>
the floor outside and placed it in the right corner behind a small<br/>
bamboo screen.<br/>
<br/>
"It isn't the privacy you're used to, but I think you'll<br/>
be comfortable enough."<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you," Emmi said stepping inside. Though she wanted to<br/>
scream when<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami shut the door and placed a large iron lock through the wooden<br/>
bars, she kept<br/>
silent.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm going to check on that food tray, and then I'll be<br/>
back."<br/>
<br/>
"All right."<br/>
<br/>
When he left, Emmi unrolled the thin futon mat and curled up in the<br/>
center. She<br/>
prayed that this was all a nightmare, that she'd wake up and find it<br/>
had all been a bad<br/>
dream. That wish fell apart quickly once the male prisoners began<br/>
calling out to her a few<br/>
minutes later.<br/>
<br/>
"They bring you to entertain us?"<br/>
<br/>
"You smell sweet."<br/>
<br/>
"I get the first taste."<br/>
<br/>
Emmi covered her ears and hoped Yamanami would return soon. When the<br/>
outer<br/>
door to the jail slid open, she crawled to the front bars and looked<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
She could make out Yamanami in the dim lantern light. He was carrying a<br/>
dinner<br/>
tray. Behind him was another man who veered off towards the<br/>
prisoners' cells.<br/>
Emmi gasped when she heard scuffling and what could only be the sound of<br/>
men<br/>
being beaten. A man's voice issued threats and orders of silence.<br/>
<br/>
"Pay it no mind, child," Yamanami said, as he set the tray down<br/>
then unlocked the<br/>
door.<br/>
<br/>
"But"<br/>
<br/>
"They savaged and murdered a woman who was gathering information for<br/>
the<br/>
Shogunate. They don't deserve your mercy."<br/>
<br/>
He slipped the open lock through one of the door crossbars, then picked<br/>
up the tray,<br/>
and set it on the floor beside the futon. Emmi's empty stomach<br/>
rumbled at the smell of<br/>
the soup, steaming tea, and flat bread. She noticed that there was<br/>
enough for two.<br/>
<br/>
"If you don't mind, I thought I'd sit here with you."<br/>
<br/>
"Well"<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami smiled a rather sad smile. "It's quite safe, I promise<br/>
you."<br/>
<br/>
"Yamanami-san," a man said.<br/>
<br/>
Emmi looked up at the man who had accompanied the vice-commander inside.<br/>
He<br/>
was dressed in a dark kimono, his black hair pulled back into a high<br/>
ponytail.<br/>
<br/>
"Forgive the interruption. I don't think you'll have any<br/>
further trouble tonight from<br/>
that scum."<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami sighed, and Emmi had the distinct impression that he didn't<br/>
have much of<br/>
a stomach for this part of the job.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, Saitou-san." He turned back to me. "Maeda-dono,<br/>
this is Saitou Hajime,<br/>
Captain of the third unit."<br/>
<br/>
Emmi managed to stop herself from saying "I know." Saitou had<br/>
been portrayed<br/>
quite often in anime and manga. The drawn versions didn't come close<br/>
to grabbing the<br/>
intensity of the real man.<br/>
<br/>
Saitou bowed to her then addressed his commander once more. "I will<br/>
be making<br/>
rounds through the compound tonight if you need anything."<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you."<br/>
<br/>
The fierce samurai headed to the door, pausing long enough to order the<br/>
prisoners to<br/>
cease their groaning and sniveling else he'd "make them<br/>
stop".<br/>
<br/>
"I think he's more frightening than Hijikata."<br/>
<br/>
"You might be right." Yamanami removed the cover from the food<br/>
dishes. "We'd<br/>
better eat this before it gets cold."<br/>

I read the young adult version of the manuscript and then the draft where the romance was kicked up a notch and I can guarantee that readers of mxf will LOVE this story.<br/>
