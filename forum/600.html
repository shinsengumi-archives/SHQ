<h3>SHQ banner+Rkdreams</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-668740075">I made a banner for SHQ.com to use in my sig at rkdreams...the<br/>
screencap  of the flag is from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jag.cx/Kenshin/">http://www.jag.cx/Kenshin/</a> (I emailed<br/>
the owner of the site to inform him/her)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shqbutton.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shqbutton.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
So if any of you are joining rkdreams in the future you can add this<br/>
to your sig:<br/>
[img]<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shqbutton.jpg%5b">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shqbutton.jpg%5b</a>/img][img]<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/1mbbutton.jpg%5b">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/1mbbutton.jpg%5b</a>/img]<br/>
the banners look better with the Shinsengumihq.com banner on the left<br/>
and the Shinsengumimb.com banner on the right so the images kind of<br/>
sandwich the webaddresses<br/>
<br/>
If any of you become part of the rkdreams community I highly recommend<br/>
that you conduct patrols in groups and arm yourself to the<br/>
teeth...from the background color of the site (skillfully set to<br/>
replicate the Battousai's hair) we can draw logical conclusions on<br/>
their political stance.  I noticed that many threads discuss fanfic<br/>
which has become part of our canon so writers who feel<br/>
underappreciated will be able to eavesdrop on fans there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831932362">Hi Tiffany,<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably join rkdreams... Wouldn't it be great, people will <br/>
immediately know we belong to the same group just by the flag... <br/>
Excellent idea...<br/>
<br/>
By the way... I hope this doesn't just apply to rkdreams... Would it <br/>
be okay if I used this also in other forums that I frequent? It would <br/>
be good exposure to the group. I'm a member of several anime, <br/>
streamload, pocketpc and tech forums.<br/>
<br/>
I tried it on one site already the first banner is working but the <br/>
one for the Shinsengumi Message board is not... Do you have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Oh if you want me to take it off. Let me know... :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555896872">Ezboard did post a message today about some technical problems do to<br/>
their server upgrade...basically the html for the logout page is<br/>
messed up, the thread settings such as moving new posts up to the top<br/>
isn't working so I have to go through the forums and do some double<br/>
checking.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the links on the bottom of the page are all broken sometimes<br/>
they work...I took the time to compile those links in the footer so<br/>
people can surf those references simultaneously while browsing the board.<br/>
<br/>
don't you just love technology?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284642565">Grace, I saw Barbara's sig at RKdreams and noticed the link had "br"<br/>

<br/>
***I had to say put the SHQ banner on the left and SHQMB on the right<br/>
because rkdreams has dimension guidelines for signatures because they<br/>
may take up too much space...but if you put them right next to each<br/>
other everything is perfect :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638897297">Yup! Got it working now (not in RK dreams though)... By the way maybe <br/>
it would be better if the banners were "clickable" so that they can <br/>
go directly to the sites... I'm kind of in a hurry but if you can do <br/>
that, it would be great.... Thanks Tiffany!</div>
