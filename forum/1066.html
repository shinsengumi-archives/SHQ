<br/>
Based on Momoiro&#39;s post about Grampa Nagakura...<br/>
If you were grandson/daughter who would you choose to spend your<br/>
Sundays with<br/>
<br/>
a) Grampa Nagakura Shinpachi...every now and then during the movie<br/>
he&#39;ll ask you what the heck is going on in the plot (his memory/vision<br/>
aren&#39;t so good anymore)...its either the same movie over and over<br/>
again or the same story about the Shinsengumi over and over<br/>
again...you choose your own form of torture ^_^<br/>
<br/>
b) Grampa Nakajima Nobori (who died young so he probably didn&#39;t even<br/>
see his grandkids)...who will have you repotting/fertilizing his<br/>
beloved plant collection [or] look after his firearms store (it&#39;s<br/>
never too early to have kids learn how to run an arms business)...on<br/>
the bright side you may get drawing lessons...be prepared to use lots<br/>
of red paint<br/>
<br/>
c) Grampa Saitou...after a cup/saucer of sake maybe he&#39;ll tell you how<br/>
to deal with criminals who don&#39;t &quot;cooperate&quot;...and neat little tricks<br/>
for covert operations/espionage missions...heck if Grandmother Tokio<br/>
isn&#39;t around maybe you&#39;ll get a special tour of the museum after hours<br/>
using the special set of keys he duplicated so long ago...but without<br/>
the sake he just does the laundry and doesn&#39;t say much...<br/>
<br/>
d) Grampa Miki who will instill in you a deep hatred for surviving<br/>
members of the Shinsengumi *especially* for that Nagakura who got away<br/>
(grrrrr) Nagakura probably said &quot;go after Saitou or should I say<br/>
Fujita Goro&quot;...then you&#39;ll have to put up with his -alternate- history<br/>
involving Sagara<br/>
<br/>
e) or how about the guy who converted to Christianity...church church<br/>
and Sunday school (he probably won&#39;t get any votes)<br/>
<br/>
f) Grampa Shimada Kai...frequent trips to the candy store ^_^<br/>
<br/>
In the series Hatchobori 7...the officers use a neat little weapon<br/>
which is shaped like a &quot;U&quot; but with one leg of the &quot;U&quot; much longer<br/>
than the other...it basically looks like a weird fish hook with a red<br/>
tassle.  I&#39;ve seen much bigger versions as a Chinese weapon...the<br/>
officers use it to catch/hook swords and slash at criminals so I&#39;m<br/>
assuming it was designed to be non-lethal as Aoyama keeps saying to<br/>
catch criminals alive...the officers carry it in their waistband like<br/>
a sword.  It is a pretty small weapon too as the officers have to get<br/>
very very close to their opponents.<br/>

Hahaha, did he really do that?<br/>

As for the weapon I think it&#39;s a jutte you&#39;re talking about. <br/>

Most i&#39;ve seen are blunt so they can&#39;t cause too much harm save for blunt trauma, but I don&#39;t doubt that they had ones that were sharp. <br/>

<br/>
See Miss B&#39;s message [987] where she uses her magical software to find<br/>
tons of new info...Shimada Kai had a sweet tooth but couldn&#39;t drink a<br/>
drop of liquor...so all bets were probably against him should he be in<br/>
a drinking contest against Saitou<br/>
<br/>
well for the jutte, the officers were slashing folks left and right<br/>
especially in the face...I guess that&#39;s what you have to do if you<br/>
don&#39;t have pepper spray /tazers...oh wait a second there was a part in<br/>
the series where they fill empty egg shells with pepper powder...and<br/>
they threw them at criminals</div>

<br/>
I posted a reply to momoiro&#39;s info on Nagakura and how he watched the<br/>
same movies with his grandson...she said Nagakura and Fujita G. knew<br/>
that the other was alive and hopefully she would clarify this<br/>
statement...I think they would probably write each other once in a<br/>
while...Nagakura&#39;s letter to Saitou &quot;Hey Fujita, if Miki ever stops by<br/>
to visit...I assure you that I didn&#39;t give him any info which would<br/>
make him shift his target from me to you *promise*&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(from Momoiro&#39;s post at the messageboard)<br/>
Ikeda Shichisaburou is called &quot;Saigo no Shinsengumi&quot;(The last<br/>
Shinsengumi) to Shinsengumi fans in Japan.<br/>
However, Nakajima Nobori thought that Ikeda died from Aizu together<br/>
with Saitou Hajime.&quot;Saigo no Shinsengumi&quot; is in &quot;Senyuusugatae&quot;.<br/>
died in 1938!!!!!!!! He lived well into the era of the radio/airplanes<br/>
and more advanced weaponry...perhaps his great grandkids would tell<br/>
him about submarines and stuff...then he&#39;d say &quot;kids these days and<br/>
their new ways of killing each other sheesh&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure that none of the surviving miburo knew of Nakajima&#39;s<br/>
portraits...but if they did they would shake their heads &quot;That Nobori<br/>
sure was talented...but his info is way off---good thing he didn&#39;t<br/>
work for Yamazaki LOL!&quot;...seeing how a couple of them outlived<br/>
Nakajima N.!<br/>
