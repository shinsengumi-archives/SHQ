there are no cool extras or anything (I think it is based on the<br/>

very unflattering portrayal.  Kev's pdf file which has the excerpt<br/>
from the novel reveals that a tiny but significant part was cut from<br/>
the movie involving Hijikata.  You just have to compare the 2 versions. <br/>
<br/>
Based on Momoiro's post about Grampa Nagakura...<br/>
If you were grandson/daughter who would you choose to spend your<br/>
Sundays with<br/>
<br/>
a) Grampa Nagakura Shinpachi...every now and then during the movie<br/>
he'll ask you what the heck is going on in the plot (his memory/vision<br/>
aren't so good anymore)...its either the same movie over and over<br/>
again or the same story about the Shinsengumi over and over<br/>
again...you choose your own form of torture ^_^<br/>
<br/>
b) Grampa Nakajima Nobori (who died young so he probably didn't even<br/>
see his grandkids)...who will have you repotting/fertilizing his<br/>
beloved plant collection [or] look after his firearms store (it's<br/>
never too early to have kids learn how to run an arms business)...on<br/>
the bright side you may get drawing lessons...be prepared to use lots<br/>
of red paint<br/>
<br/>
c) Grampa Saitou...after a cup/saucer of sake maybe he'll tell you how<br/>
to deal with criminals who don't "cooperate"...and neat little tricks<br/>
for covert operations/espionage missions...heck if Grandmother Tokio<br/>
isn't around maybe you'll get a special tour of the museum after hours<br/>
using the special set of keys he duplicated so long ago...but without<br/>
the sake he just does the laundry and doesn't say much...<br/>
<br/>
d) Grampa Miki who will instill in you a deep hatred for surviving<br/>
members of the Shinsengumi *especially* for that Nagakura who got away<br/>
(grrrrr) Nagakura probably said "go after Saitou or should I say<br/>
Fujita Goro"...then you'll have to put up with his -alternate- history<br/>
involving Sagara<br/>
<br/>
e) or how about the guy who converted to Christianity...church church<br/>
and Sunday school (he probably won't get any votes)<br/>
<br/>
f) Grampa Shimada Kai...frequent trips to the candy store ^_^<br/>
<br/>
In the series Hatchobori 7...the officers use a neat little weapon<br/>
which is shaped like a "U" but with one leg of the "U" much longer<br/>
than the other...it basically looks like a weird fish hook with a red<br/>
tassle.  I've seen much bigger versions as a Chinese weapon...the<br/>
officers use it to catch/hook swords and slash at criminals so I'm<br/>
assuming it was designed to be non-lethal as Aoyama keeps saying to<br/>
catch criminals alive...the officers carry it in their waistband like<br/>
a sword.  It is a pretty small weapon too as the officers have to get<br/>
very very close to their opponents.<br/>

As for the weapon I think it's a jutte you're talking about. <br/>

Most i've seen are blunt so they can't cause too much harm save for blunt trauma, but I don't doubt that they had ones that were sharp. <br/>

<br/>
See Miss B's message [987] where she uses her magical software to find<br/>
tons of new info...Shimada Kai had a sweet tooth but couldn't drink a<br/>
drop of liquor...so all bets were probably against him should he be in<br/>
a drinking contest against Saitou<br/>
<br/>
well for the jutte, the officers were slashing folks left and right<br/>
especially in the face...I guess that's what you have to do if you<br/>
don't have pepper spray /tazers...oh wait a second there was a part in<br/>
the series where they fill empty egg shells with pepper powder...and<br/>
they threw them at criminals</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41137730">More like collecting their souls!<br/>
<br/>
I posted a reply to momoiro's info on Nagakura and how he watched the<br/>
same movies with his grandson...she said Nagakura and Fujita G. knew<br/>
that the other was alive and hopefully she would clarify this<br/>
statement...I think they would probably write each other once in a<br/>
while...Nagakura's letter to Saitou "Hey Fujita, if Miki ever stops by<br/>
to visit...I assure you that I didn't give him any info which would<br/>
make him shift his target from me to you *promise*"<br/>
<br/>
(from Momoiro's post at the messageboard)<br/>
Ikeda Shichisaburou is called "Saigo no Shinsengumi"(The last<br/>
Shinsengumi) to Shinsengumi fans in Japan.<br/>
However, Nakajima Nobori thought that Ikeda died from Aizu together<br/>
with Saitou Hajime."Saigo no Shinsengumi" is in "Senyuusugatae".<br/>
died in 1938!!!!!!!! He lived well into the era of the radio/airplanes<br/>
and more advanced weaponry...perhaps his great grandkids would tell<br/>
him about submarines and stuff...then he'd say "kids these days and<br/>
their new ways of killing each other sheesh"<br/>

<br/>
I'm sure that none of the surviving miburo knew of Nakajima's<br/>
portraits...but if they did they would shake their heads "That Nobori<br/>
sure was talented...but his info is way off---good thing he didn't<br/>
work for Yamazaki LOL!"...seeing how a couple of them outlived<br/>
Nakajima N.!<br/>
