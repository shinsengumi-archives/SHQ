<h3>Nakajima Nobori in the world of doujinshi and fiction</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-933296992">Nakajima Nobori has never been featured in any popular anime that we<br/>
know of and that is very ironic since---technically he was the first<br/>
to produce Shinsengumi fanart...<br/>
<br/>
ghost of Nobori &quot;IT IS IRONIC!  I&#39;m a member of the Shinsengumi AND<br/>
and artist and I&#39;m not even MENTIONED in manga!  I can so be a samurai<br/>
spokesman for the NRA too!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
sec &quot;shush, let me continue&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I was at http://www.hajimenokizu.com and found this:<br/>
http://hajimenokizu.com/doujinshi/album22/shinsen_3<br/>
<br/>
which is based on Nakajima Nobori&#39;s &quot;portrait&quot; of Hijikata:<br/>

[click on image for full size version]<br/>
<br/>
but wait there is more, according to a post at a Japanese messageboard<br/>
there was a novel featuring Nakajima Nobori <br/>
(so I went to our handy dandy<br/>
http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiNames.htm and grabbed his name<br/>
and stuck it in http://www.google.co.jp)<br/>
<br/>
and so I found (the book at the top is about Nobori, the book right<br/>
under it is about Okita):<br/>
http://www.jidai-show.net/jdre0202.html<br/>
<br/>
[summary] Nobori dishes out some generous servings of whoop @ss and<br/>
for some weird reason there is an [AIZU] connection?  ::shrugs:: I can<br/>
only guess at the true meaning of the summary (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
ghost of Nobori &quot;just because I paint and enjoy gardening doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
I&#39;m a wimp&quot;<br/>
sec &quot;yes, sure whatever you say&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone finds a shrine to Nobori as they surf Shinsengumi sites<br/>
please let me know (^_^)<br/>
