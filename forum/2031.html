<div id="ygrps-yiv-35479331">This question is for anyone ...<br/>
What was Fujita Goro&#39;s *rank as inspector<br/>
&quot;inspector&quot; was divided into levels or degrees, he was &quot;appointed&quot; <br/>
inspector a couple of times according to his translated timeline (See <br/>
the &quot;files&quot; section and look for the 3-hajime translations)...these <br/>
were promotions because he did end up [chief inspector]<br/>
either the translation was incorrect or my sources are not detailed <br/>
enough because the rank of chief inspector is not a rank I can <br/>
actually find<br/>
<br/>
*my resources have also given me the evolution of &quot;labels&quot; used <br/>
shortly after the seizure of Edo castle and the implementation of <br/>
transitional law enforcment in that city so my sources are pretty <br/>
decent and go step by step how the modern police system was <br/>
established almost TOO detailed 0_0 <br/>
<br/>
Will include the VERY interesting details about law enforcement <br/>
during the Bakumatsu in Yokohama...due the number of foreigners there <br/>
the patrols were very eclectic...you&#39;ll just have to wait and read <br/>
all the details...<br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
I have a few books on the Education system in the Meiji Era and they <br/>
revealed a different dimension to the riots (which did result in the <br/>
use of the sword bearing police)*... people were not only expressing <br/>
their desire for more &quot;liberal&quot; reforms, they were protesting the <br/>
public education system which they felt was connected to the <br/>
conscription system...and amongst other things the new solar calendar<br/>
<br/>
*I will discuss the sword bearing police in my write up ... they had <br/>
a pretty difficult role (keep in mind that the sword prohibition act <br/>
wasn&#39;t enforced very well nor widespread in its implementation) <br/>
rioters -did- have firearms (leaders of these movements were almost <br/>
all former samurai)...but the rioters were all peasants <br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
*I uploaded a file the other night with info about Ryoma Sakamoto&#39;s <br/>
affiliation with the CHIBA Dojo....to clarify he studied under Chiba <br/>
Sadakichi (brother to Shunsaku)<br/>
<br/>
when &quot;CHIBA Dojo&quot; is used people automatically think of Chiba Shusaku <br/>
who was extremely famous (and Toshiyoshi Kawaji&#39;s teacher when the <br/>
leader of the TMPD was in his 30s)<br/>

<br/>
page 177<br/>
&quot;There is also a punishment known as &#39;kinshin&#39; which means putting <br/>
the delinquent in a state of respectful attentio or introspection.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*this book also connects the Aizu Byakkotai with modern <br/>
clubs/associations for boys (as it builds camaraderie)...for some <br/>
reason these writers came across the Byakkotai while compiling the <br/>
book<br/>
<br/>
during the Meiji there were local and national associations for boys <br/>
which prepared them for conscription (and served as back up <br/>
information gathering for the government)<br/>
<br/>
you will note the printing date of 1937....I find that the older the <br/>
book the BETTER the information!<br/>
<br/>
for example more modern books on Toshiyoshi Kawaji will eliminate <br/>
details on how he may have slightly altered his information about <br/>
Western police models so that he can implement his goals and <br/>
interpretations...and not print his entire speeches...by the way he <br/>
was a good speaker from the translations I have...he gave some very <br/>
good arguments...also from the paintings of him he was a very <br/>
forceful speaker as well in one painting of all the major &quot;players&quot; <br/>
during the Seinan War he was shown in a kimono yelling and shaking <br/>
his fist...as Saigo&#39;s former PROTEGE, Kawaji&#39;s stance in the SEinan <br/>
War made things very complicated to say the least</div>

boys at Nisshinkan had. It was usual to group the boys<br/>
in small &quot;teams&quot; (kind of) called &quot;Juu&quot;. The famous<br/>
&quot;naranu koto wa naranu mono desu&quot; comes from the<br/>
&quot;Agreement of the Juu&quot; (&quot;Juu no okite&quot;).<br/>
