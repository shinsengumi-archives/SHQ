<h3>Kondou humor and Saitou Family tree (English) Uploaded</h3>

<br/>
I have uploaded my translation of Saitou's family tree to <br/>
the "Photos" section! Of course, there are some names missing, but <br/>
those are the only ones that I wasn't able to read the kanji of <br/>
(since they were a bit difficult to decipher).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've uploaded "The Many Moods of Kondou Isami" into the Humor <br/>
section of "Photos". Check it out! (hehe...)<br/>
