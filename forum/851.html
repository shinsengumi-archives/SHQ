<br/>
I have uploaded my translation of Saitou&#39;s family tree to <br/>
the &quot;Photos&quot; section! Of course, there are some names missing, but <br/>
those are the only ones that I wasn&#39;t able to read the kanji of <br/>
(since they were a bit difficult to decipher).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve uploaded &quot;The Many Moods of Kondou Isami&quot; into the Humor <br/>
section of &quot;Photos&quot;. Check it out! (hehe...)<br/>
