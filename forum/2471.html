<h3>Going to Japan</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392575610">Alright, everyone, I thought I'd make the announcement official-- come <br/>
September 5, I'm heading to Japan until December. I'll be in the <br/>
northern part of the country, roughly around Sendai and Aizu, so look <br/>
forward to lots of pictures of Shinsengumi-related sites! (bear in mind <br/>
that Hijikata Toshizo himself stayed in Sendai on his way to <br/>
Hokkaido/Hakodate) Plus, I might (emphasis on might) be in Kyoto later <br/>
on, so I'll do my best to get to the Yagi estate (old Shinsengumi HQ).<br/>
<br/>
This is not a pleasure trip-- it's part of my college education-- but <br/>
even so, I'm going to try and get new pictures and information that <br/>
will help us all get a better idea of these people.<br/>
<br/>
Aratamete yoroshiku onegaishimasu! (again, please regard me well!)<br/>
