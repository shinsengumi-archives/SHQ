I'm wondering if this is even a permanent thing though. They never showed the <br/>
Kyoto arc but once. Maybe they intend to move it around later? Include it in <br/>
the Adult Swim line-up at some point? They do that sort of thing all the time <br/>
with their other anime. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see it turn up again <br/>
soon anyway. I finally gave up on them myself. I'm slowing gather<br/>

let them know there are people out here interested in it.  (And <br/>
eventually, they *will* decide to quit showing it... )  And I think <br/>
it can't hurt to bring up PMK in association with it.  May fall on <br/>
completely deaf ears, but stranger things have happened.  :-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882762491">I saw all the episodes from the beginning to the end of the kyoto arc, but <br/>
no more than that.<br/>
I was somewhat hoping they'd re-show those episodes, so I could tape the <br/>
ones were Saitou shows his cute butt (*laughs*) for the first time, but they <br/>
stopped and it pissed me off....<br/>
I filed in a complaint, too. ^^<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I'm new here to this group. Sorry for dropping in the middle of <br/>
a discussion without a proper introduction.<br/>
So I go by the name Miser Bellatrix, but you can call me whatever you want. <br/>
I have yet to look through all the information here, but I'm certainly very <br/>
interested. The Shinsengumi caught my interest when I first fell in love <br/>
with *cough* Saitou, and ever since I've been obsessed.<br/>
<br/>
...So I don't social much, so what?<br/>
<br/>
Hehehe, anyway, I'm lacking in brains, but I do have an artistic talent. So <br/>
I'll probably be sending little gifts for the members of this group once in <br/>
a while. Hopefully that'll make up for probably never being able to help <br/>
with information gathering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504829885">Ah okay! I'm very glad you told me. ^_^<br/>
I do have a story in progress, actually. ^^ It's In Your Shadow I Walk, a <br/>
SAISA pairing story.<br/>
But I also have another one which is called Moonlit Destiny, it's also with <br/>
the SAISA pairing, but a cross over with my yaoi manga Demonic Obsessions. <br/>
^^<br/>
And then there's another story, called In Eternity and Forever, which I <br/>
finished and has been submitted to Nekkie's Ratnest for the fanfiction <br/>
challenge, it's also a crossover with Demonic Obsessions...not a bad one, <br/>
I'd say.<br/>
<br/>
And thank you for complimenting my artwork. I'm very glad you think I draw <br/>
well. I can honestly draw much, much better than the ones you've seen thus <br/>
far. It's just sometimes I can do things that look awesome, and then I have <br/>
days were nothing will look right.<br/>
