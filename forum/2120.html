<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476238983">They've made a mistake with labeling--  "L.The late Edo era<br/>
The Osuberakashi style." is actually the Rokumeikan style, and  "N.The <br/>
Rokumeikan period in Meiji era<br/>
The Western style" is actually the late Edo era style.<br/>

****again even the webmaster at 1to5.net is a bit unsure of the <br/>
account but if you think about it the haircut may have been <br/>
perfectly acceptable for an upper middleclass woman who worked at a <br/>
prestigious woman's school...and a woman who was LITERATE and could <br/>
appreciate all the popular magazines for women at the time <br/>
period...what is pretty clear was that Tokio's hair was different <br/>
enough for this person to REMEMBER<br/>
<br/>
We have discussed in the past all the interesting laws passed during <br/>
the Meiji era, namely why it was ILLEGAL for women to cut their hair <br/>
short?  why? why? why?<br/>
<br/>
I have seen photos of all the famous women's rights activists during <br/>
the Meiji Era, perhaps the photos were taken when they were young <br/>
but even they had long hair restrained in a bun.  I have also seen <br/>
dozens of pics of girls in schools, with long hair, and factory <br/>
workers all with long hair in a bun too.<br/>
<br/>
Tokio may have harbored a mild interest [or] simply adopted the <br/>
fashion of progressive women.  As soon as I can find a really really <br/>
good quote on women and bank accounts (the amount in the bank accout <br/>
is *insignificant)...the opening of bank accounts in their name was <br/>
also considered to be RADICAL. Keep in mind that Aizu women in <br/>
general were pretty active in various societies e.g. mentored by <br/>
Yamakawa Sutematsu (who was very much restrained by her marriage to <br/>
Iwao Oyama). Literate women wrote poems and discussed literature <br/>
(specifically in the Bunkyo area, residential areas near Tokyo <br/>
University from my readings on Higuchi Ichiyo).  Keep in mind that <br/>
Tokio, from a samurai family, shared the harsh experience of many <br/>
Aizu people in the north...she worked until her hands became rough <br/>
and callous so she may have agreed with the progressive movement.<br/>
<br/>
see pic of mentioned *radical* hair cut  (^_^)<br/>

***read this book if you want to learn about the female anarchist <br/>
Kanno Suga who planned to assasinate the Meiji Emperor...she was <br/>
hanged<br/>
<br/>
page 14-15<br/>
"But as more and more Japanese men adopted short hairstyles, <br/>
indicating their desire to join the country's march to progress, <br/>
some women decided to join them, by bobbing their hair.  An <br/>
association advocating shorter and more practical hairstyles for <br/>
women was organized in 1871, in support of the kinds of changes in <br/>
the government was advocating for the male population.  The <br/>
government's response to this uninvited and spontaneous development <br/>
was immediate.  At first it merely called for an end to the new <br/>
custom of bobbed hair among women, but in 1872 it made short hair <br/>
for women illegal.  Even older women who for health reasons had to <br/>
wear a shorter hairstyle were required under the 1872 order to <br/>
obtain a license from the Meiji government before they could have <br/>
their hair cut.  Informally, the government explained that it <br/>
favored an end to the blackened teeth and shaved eyebrows married <br/>
women had adopted from an earlier age, but that hairstyles should <br/>
not be changed.  The Meiji Empress made a public appearance in 1873, <br/>
deomonstrating the correct "look": long hair, with natural-looking <br/>
eyebrows and teeth.  Still, the government's effort to keep Meiji <br/>
women from abandoning the elaborate hairstyles symbolic of the <br/>
geisha could not be enforced.  Women could always cut their hair at <br/>
home, and a number of women active in the struggle for women's <br/>
rights did just that....women cutting their hair can be viewed as a <br/>
real, if spontaneous, attempt to join the progressive forces trying <br/>
to create a new Japan, the government's denial of their right to do <br/>
so was also a denial of their right to participate and contribute <br/>
actively to that change."<br/>

Fujita Goro and Tokio (head covered by a wrap/hood) stop by the <br/>
Bunkyo Ward police station.  Mr. Fujita looking pretty serious.<br/>
<br/>
Koga Tanji (F.G.'s friend of many years) ::GASP:: "Hey, Goro, I know <br/>
you two fight sometimes but throwing Tokio in jail is a bit harsh <br/>
don't you think?"<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro "Nope, she needs a license for ---this"<br/>
<br/>
Tokio ::smiling:: dramatically removes the hood showing off her <br/>
short hair<br/>
<br/>
Koga Tanji "I'll start on the paper work right away!"<br/>
