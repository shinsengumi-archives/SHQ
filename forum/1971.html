<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190555697">People who have read Chinese or Japanese myths and folklore will <br/>
frequently come across these shape shifting, mischievous <br/>
seductresses...and I believe the topic of fox spirits has been <br/>
mentioned here in the past or has even showed up in FANFIC (^_^) so <br/>
here is a bit more info<br/>
<br/>
[book, no ISBN# or anything]<br/>

"Inari, offices and titles: Vixen Goddess, Associated Places: Japan, <br/>
Kyoto<br/>
<br/>
INari the Fox Goddess is associated wiht the fire and smithcraft.  <br/>
When referring to her, Chamerlain writes of 'the assistance rendered <br/>
by that deity to the famous swordsmith Kojaki, for whom she blew the <br/>
bellows while he was forgina sword for an ancient Mikado.'  <br/>
<br/>
The worship of Inari is mentioned by Chamberlain in his description <br/>
of the places of pilgrimages in Japan;  he states that the "great <br/>
Kyoto temple of the fox-deity Inari has a branch in almost every <br/>
village'.  This animal is considered in Japan to be of great magical <br/>
importance.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese women, according to Harrison's account, attach great <br/>
importance to foxes 'and take great pains to be on the....side of the <br/>
goddess Inari.'  The same author also states that 'Geisha dn women of <br/>
pleasure are sometimes colloquially spoken of as kitsune (i.e. <br/>
foxes)'.<br/>
<br/>
Among the greater festivals of the Japanese Calendar, Chamberlain <br/>
includes the first day of the Horse (Hatsu-uma) in February, a <br/>
moveable feast, holy 'to the Fox-Goddess Inari'.  Again on November <br/>
the 8th, the Festival of the Goddess of the Kitchen Range fires are <br/>
lighted in honour of Inari and other deities.<br/>
<br/>
This goddess may have some connexion with the vixen, Aunt Piety, of <br/>
China."<br/>
<br/>
I found the above mentioned info on Inari because I was checking info <br/>
on MARISHITEN...you can read more about her here<br/>
