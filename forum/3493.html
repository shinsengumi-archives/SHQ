 </span></blockquote>-- Do dig up some info onthat. And the awardwinning book they talked about<br/>
in the next paragraph sounds pretty awesome:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Her award-winning work, &quot;Hyosa no Utau,&quot; is a sophisticated historical<br/>
novel depicting a pathetic former samurai who induces customers in a<br/>
red-light district in Tokyo&#39;s downtown Nezu after finding himself unable to<br/>
catch up with the tide of the Meiji Restoration.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s not to love about a down on his luck samurai rounding up customers<br/>
for the local house of ill repute. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all literary and not what<br/>
I&#39;d really like to see but the premise is cool.<br/>
