Anyways if the title below looks promising I'll post some infos:<br/>
<br/>
"Kiuchi, also a Tokyo native, entered a publishing company upon graduating from Chuo University. After quitting the publisher and working as a free-lance editor for some time, she debuted as a writer with her work "Shinsengumi Bakumatsu no Seiran" in 2004. She was awarded Waseda University's Tsubouchi Shoyo Taisho Shoreisho prize in 2009."<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-- Do dig up some info onthat. And the awardwinning book they talked about<br/>
in the next paragraph sounds pretty awesome:<br/>
<br/>
"Her award-winning work, "Hyosa no Utau," is a sophisticated historical<br/>
novel depicting a pathetic former samurai who induces customers in a<br/>
red-light district in Tokyo's downtown Nezu after finding himself unable to<br/>
catch up with the tide of the Meiji Restoration."<br/>
<br/>
What's not to love about a down on his luck samurai rounding up customers<br/>
for the local house of ill repute. I'm sure it's all literary and not what<br/>
I'd really like to see but the premise is cool.<br/>
