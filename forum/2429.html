[for people interested in TAKAGI TOKIO]<br/>
Well, she didn&#39;t leave a diary...but during the exact same years she <br/>
worked at Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School (the name of the school <br/>

dressed like this...<br/>

pic#1 is of the first graduating class (which means Fujita Midori -<br/>
daughter in law to Tokio+Goro is in the pic)<br/>
Pic #2 + #3 are of students in uniform, they are NOT Japanese they <br/>
are in fact Thai/Siamese girls sent to study at the school for 6 <br/>
years!<br/>
Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School was a model or template for teacher and <br/>
women&#39;s education.  It was overseen by Takamine Hideo a very <br/>
progressive reformer and Tokio&#39;s cousin.<br/>
