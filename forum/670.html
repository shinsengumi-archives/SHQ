<h3>PMK OST</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702936955">I was just wondering if anyone in the group knows about the release <br/>
of the OST for PMK? What do you think of it? A singaporean friend <br/>
sent me a some songs and my favorite one (aside from the <br/>
opening/closing) is either Sorezore no Hisou or Asamoya no Naka de <br/>
(can't decide yet). I think both though was played during episodes <br/>
18-19 the time of Ayu-nee's capture and death. I'm no fan of <br/>
instrumentals (aside from some of the Kenshin ones), but I think <br/>
it's a good change.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm... I decided to upload a sampling of the album for evaluation <br/>
purposes only. Here's the link. Any comments? I'd love to hear from <br/>
you.. The original album said something like Nipponsei... It has 32 <br/>
songs... All instrumental except for the opening/ending song... Each <br/>
lasting 2-3 minutes...<br/>
