<h3>The Silver Drum</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683876651">Author: Chichibu no Miya Setsuko, 1909-  <br/>
Uniform Title: Gin no bonboni¯eru. English <br/>
Title: The silver drum : a Japanese imperial memoir / by Setsuko, <br/>
Princess Chichibu ; [translated by Dorothy Britton]. <br/>
Publisher: Folkestone, Kent : Global Oriental, ; 1966. <br/>
Description: xxvii, 210 p., [8] p. of plates : ill. ; 23 cm. <br/>
  <br/>
Notes: Includes index. <br/>
ISBN: 1860340040 <br/>
<br/>
the book above is a bio of Princess chichibu and the only connection <br/>
to the Shinsengumi is minor.<br/>
<br/>
one of the wedding presents was a short sword, wakizashi, formerly <br/>
owned by Fujita Goro.  The Matsudaira family &quot;traded&quot; with Fujita <br/>
Tsutomu.  the wedding occured in the 1920s, so well after Takagi <br/>
Tokio had died.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, Setsuko (Princess Chichibu) represented Aizu. <br/>
The book has chapters like &quot;the Aizu Clan&quot;, &quot;the Aizu Spirit&quot; and <br/>
I&#39;ll be reading the book to see if there is anymore details.<br/>
<br/>
Tip for students.<br/>
I would also like to mention that many books which have been printed <br/>
in more than one language really messes up library databases.  I was <br/>
able to track down this book in my library by using the ISBN #.  When <br/>
I typed in Silver Drum, my database could not find it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890416838">reading all 200 pages was worth it<br/>
especially since more details of the Matsudaira family was<br/>
revealed...and yes the heirloom sword by Kunitoshi Rai in a brocade<br/>
bag was mentioned on page 94 of the book...wakizashi courtesy of the<br/>
Fujita family.<br/>
<br/>
I tried my best to record ALL the details about the reaction from<br/>
Aizu&#39;s natives...when the book says &quot;tears of joy&quot; it was literal<br/>
<br/>
the two people which stood out to me the most in the book are:<br/>
Matsudaira Tsuneo (Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s son)<br/>
his personality, and direct parenting basically does not fit the<br/>
textbook definition of the Japanese family structure of an &quot;aloof&quot;<br/>
father.  So the biography illustrates how dangerous it is to make<br/>
cultural generalizations.  I did my best to arrange his bio in my<br/>
&quot;SILVERDRUM&quot; notes in the FILES section but be warned I may have left<br/>
out some of his jobs (he held many posts).  His life demonstrated that<br/>
the ideals of the &quot;revolutionaries&quot; were shared by the pro-shogunate<br/>
people as well.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Taka&quot; (the nanny from Aizu)<br/>
well, lots of fanfic, and even in our private Aim chats we try to<br/>
&quot;recreate&quot; or formulate the personality of Aizu women.  We draw upon<br/>
the legacy of the Joshitai, the writings of Shiba Goro and even the<br/>
later model provided by Yamakawa/Oyama Sutematsu.  Taka, is very very<br/>
strong willed and if you check out my notes she was a major figure in<br/>
the family and played a critical role during the wedding.  I love her.<br/>
 Oh, before I forget---Taka was connected to Yamakawa Sutematsu (who<br/>
was also Princess Chichibu&#39;s heroine).  Taka&#39;s diary was important in<br/>
this biography.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s easy to remember dates now<br/>
Fujita Goro died on Sept 18 1915<br/>
<br/>
wedding ceremony, officially restored the honor of Aizu, and in which<br/>
a former possession Fujita Goro became an important gift occurred on<br/>
Sept 18 1928<br/>
<br/>
The book is an &quot;official&quot; memoir and the Princess was restricted when<br/>
it came to writing about the royalty during WW2.  In fact the second<br/>
half of the book right after her husband succumbed to TB and she<br/>
assumed his role/duties...the book turned into a &quot;list&quot; of activities.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to scan pics tomorrow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345450960">Thanks for sharing this. There are some great snippets of info there. I <br/>
especially LOVE the bit about Komei sending a secret message as a &quot;mere <br/>
poem&quot; in Classical Chinese.<br/>
<br/>
One could put quite the fictional spin on the poem given to my man Itou <br/>
that the Suzuki family has kept.<br/>
<br/>
And the bit about the earthquake and the Matsudairas having to stay in a <br/>
sewer pipe of all things.  That really brings home the meaning of the <br/>
phrase &quot;how the mighty have fallen&quot;.<br/>

family pic has Matsudaira Tsuneo<br/>
oddly the wedding photos are not in the book...only a formal picture <br/>
from the 1930s remain...in the captions of the photos is the <br/>
word &quot;Gotemba&quot; that is a place name where the prince+princess had to <br/>
live</div>
