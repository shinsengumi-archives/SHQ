<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417420459">I was curius about the age among the shinsengumi, also about the time<br/>
they were named Roshigumi if I make no mistake. Everywhere I read that<br/>
 Todou,Heisuke and Okita, Souji were the youngest but most times it<br/>
was said they were the youngest among the Shieikan not the<br/>
Shinsengumi. SO might that be true? Could they really have been the<br/>
youngest? What about the normal samurai among them , not a squad<br/>
captain? Among the hundreds(s) there surely was someone?! And what<br/>
exactly is the meaning  "shieikan".</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801629782">To the best of my knowledge, the youngest Shinsengumi was Tamura Ginnosuke, <br/>
originally from the Iwakidaira domain near Aizu who joined up later on with <br/>
his two brothers and fought in the Boshin War. He joined Shinsengumi in 1867 <br/>
at age 12, and died on August 20, 1924. Those who can read Japanese may make <br/>

<br/>
"Shieikan" is written with the characters "Test[ing]", "defense", and <br/>
"mansion" (which in the case of a martial arts school has more of the <br/>
connotation of "hall," as in the modern-day "Bujinkan"). My translation of <br/>
it would be "Defense-Testing Hall".<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-270387719">Tamura Ginnosuke merits some further commentary. He was in the thick<br/>
of action during the Boshin War, and his testimony on the war is vital<br/>
for anyone who wants an eyewitness account of some of the most ignored<br/>
parts of the war. For instance, Tamura comments on the fighting men of<br/>
the Sendai domain, who played an important part in the war in the<br/>
north, but who are largely ignored by most Japanese and by pretty much<br/>
all western scholars.<br/>
<br/>
All of this testimony, some of which is quoted in some of the better<br/>
Japanese-language history websites, is made even more poignant by the<br/>
fact that he was a child of 12-13 years at the time...<br/>

This blog entry quotes some of Tamura's testimony, which appears in<br/>
"Shidankai Sokkiroku". There is a library near me which has "Shidankai<br/>
Sokkiroku"-- which is a gigantic series of transcribed oral testimony,<br/>
written in the mid to late Meiji era, from eyewitnesses to the great<br/>
events of the Bakumatsu. Each volume is around 300-400 pages, and<br/>
there are about 10 or more volumes, I believe. I will try to get ahold<br/>
of Tamura's testimony, along with other Shinsengumi references (such<br/>
as data on Yoshimura Kan'ichiro of "Mibugishiden" fame) which appears<br/>
within. I had some references from it previously, which were lost due<br/>
to circumstances beyond my control, so I'm anxious to recover that and<br/>
add to it.<br/>

However, Taisuke's job was carrying Kondou's sword (which shows how <br/>
high-ranking Kondou was becoming), and apart from having witnessed his <br/>
uncle's death (he says), his only real action was at Toba-Fushimi, and the <br/>
records I have seen do not suggest that he fought. The Wikipedia article <br/>
says that he went home to the Inoue family and relayed the news of his <br/>
uncle's death. Tamura, two/three years older than him, stayed in Shinsengumi <br/>
and saw further action.<br/>

**************************************************<br/>
<br/>
If someone is skimming these messages they may wonder what nlf7 and <br/>
kitsuno are speaking of in regards to<br/>
<br/>
*primary sources<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
*secondary sources<br/>
<br/>
Generally sources can be defined in this way:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source</a><br/>
<br/>
If we speak of the Shinsengumi here are just some primary sources <br/>
which we know exist:<br/>
- Shimada Kai's record<br/>
- Numerous letters from Kondou and Hijikata and Okita to various <br/>
friends and relatives<br/>
- Yamazaki Susumu's record book<br/>
- Nakajima Nobori's basic record<br/>
- Nagakura's accountrecorded a bit laterand we know there were <br/>
actually (2) versions, one more accurate than the otherand ofcourse <br/>
what the newspaper printed over time from his account is an edited <br/>
version<br/>
- Numerous correspondences from the aforementioned three to Aizu <br/>
officials (these must exist if they have not been destroyed by <br/>
time). Ofcourse there should be the "reverse" that is Aizu official <br/>
records on the Shinsengumi as well.<br/>
- Aizu accounts by Yamakawa Hiroshi and Yamakawa Kenjiro (whose book <br/>
does mention the shinsengumi---no shock there both brothers knew <br/>
Saitou)---yet both books would have a MULTITUDE of informants, <br/>
endless voices but edited and compiled into one book with no clear <br/>
label who told them what and when<br/>
<br/>
In all the items listed above there will be first hand accounts and <br/>
also second hand accounts actually mixed in.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is an example:  Kondou in a letter said that it seems that <br/>
homosexual activities are being practiced amongst his men.  Did he <br/>
hear or see this first hand?  Or did someone tell him?<br/>
<br/>
For example Yamazaki may have heard of something and noted it in his <br/>
book---but what did he SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES? But it is still a <br/>
*primary resource if you follow the definition that it is a "source <br/>
of information that was created at or near the time being <br/>
studied"[wiki article].  <br/>
<br/>
Thus what is important is evaluating sources.  Off the bat it is <br/>
difficult at times to even to ***categorize sources---we just know <br/>
to exercise caution.  We don't know who is more correct than the <br/>
other we should however track who is saying what, to whom and when <br/>
and if they have a personal interest in saying certain things.  <br/>
<br/>
As Nlf7 and Kitsuno foundthere will be conflicting info.<br/>
<br/>
However a book with a few errors may not be *entirely* innaccurate.<br/>
For instance if you open any book on the Meiji era...it will likely <br/>
say that it was during the Meiji era when paper money was issued.  <br/>
That is absolutely wrong.  However the book may have other pertinant <br/>
facts.<br/>
<br/>
Don't toss the incorrect information yetjust note it all.  <br/>
For example you can say<br/>
Samurai Z was born this year (in resource A)<br/>
However (resource B) says otherwise and (resource C) gives even more <br/>
different information.<br/>
<br/>
I have found in my own studies that over time you will figure out <br/>
*why there are errors.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of this page are some words of wisdom from a really <br/>
stellar resaercher who has "seen it all" in regards to Meiji Era <br/>
revisionism which has negatively affected the study of the Bakumatsu<br/>
