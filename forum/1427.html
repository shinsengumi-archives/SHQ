<h3>More confused than usual!!!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591824107">It took me awhile to get around to reading this recent translation Sec <br/>
posted on the Fujita family history and I'm wondering if anyone else is <br/>
taking this they way I am. Obviously I'm missed some important list <br/>
posts or totally misread them  until now if this has been clarified from <br/>
the original idea that Tatsuo was adopted into the family...----<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although he was born as the third son of Fujita Goroo and Tokio, there <br/>
was no description in the family record.-<br/>
<br/>
*** So this means that Tatsuo was in act Tokio's and Hajime's natural child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***The thing that has me totally crazy is the following--<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<<The reason for this is that he was adopted from Numazawa Kohachiroo <br/>
and Kuni immediately after his birth.>> Followed by this--><<Since there <br/>
was no child between Kohachiroo and Kuni, Numazawa family was in danger <br/>
of extinction.  They had asked Fujita Goroo and Tokio to adopt their <br/>
child if it was a boy.  They had asked them even when Tatsuo was not <br/>
born yet.<br/>
<br/>
Fujita family accepted this, and soon after the birth of boy, Numazawa <br/>
family adopted him out.>><br/>
<br/>
*** To me this says----The Numazawas had no children and were on the <br/>
verge of becoming extinct as a family therefore they adopted the third <br/>
Fujita son they didn't have him then turn him over to Tokio and Hajime....<br/>
