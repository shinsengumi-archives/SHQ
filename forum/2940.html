<h3>Site hacked, and Saitou saves a man shot in the butt</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858816452">SHQ was hacked, and we hope the site will be normal soon.<br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile, here's some new data that I've translated, from the <br/>
amazing compendium "Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete".<br/>
<br/>
So, as historians know, the Battle of Bonari Pass was the beginning of the <br/>
action that culminated in the Sat-cho army reaching the walls of <br/>
Aizu-Wakamatsu. Northern forces put up stiff resistance there but were <br/>
eventually routed. One of the unit commanders was Oshima Torao, who was shot <br/>
in the rear end (buttocks) as he retreated. Just as Oshima resigned himself <br/>
to death, Saitou and the Shinsengumi appeared, and covered the retreat of <br/>
Oshima's unit with small-arms fire.<br/>
<br/>
(source: p. 194 of "Saitou Hajime Kanren Jinbutsu Jiten", by Todo Toshihisa, <br/>
in "Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete")<br/>
<br/>
Here's an example of someone who encountered Saitou in the Meiji era without <br/>
initially knowing who he was:<br/>
<br/>
Imada Katsuyori was the son of the last armorer of the Aizu domain. In Meiji <br/>
27, Katsuyori became a live-in student at the Yamakawa household (former <br/>
senior Aizu retainers) in Tokyo. Thus, occasionally he would be there when a <br/>
fat, red-faced, sharp old man would come and tell tales of the Shinsengumi. <br/>
When Katsuyori asked Yamakawa who this man was, he was told "He was Saitou <br/>
Hajime."<br/>
<br/>
(source: same as above)<br/>
<br/>
These little anecdotes really serve to show just how much even in 19th <br/>
century Japan, "it's a small world after all"<br/>
