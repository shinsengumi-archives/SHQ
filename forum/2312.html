<h3>Bad information</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-753424516">I am lamenting it very much. <br/>
The series of PMK manga was stopped with Vol.5. <br/>
The author was hardly able to advance a story in a slump for one <br/>
year. <br/>
And it declared the stop of publishing formally by Vol.5. <br/>
The story is the halfway portion of &quot;Aburanokoji no hen&quot;.<br/>
It is very unfinished. <br/>
It is not known whether it is serialized again. <br/>
However, I think that production of the second season of PMK anime <br/>
became impossible. <br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi manga which I expect is only &quot;Getsumeiseiki&quot;.(cry) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, has &quot;SHOJO BEAT&quot; MAGAZINE already become the center of <br/>
attention here?<br/>
It is the Shojo manga magazine which BIZ will publish in July, this <br/>
year. <br/>
The series of Kaze Hikaru is determined by the magazine. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I do not understand this text. However, I cannot release <br/>
the manga in a network. I do not have skill and I am a Japanese. The <br/>
act is a crime certainly by a law of Japan^^;;;<br/>
It is possible if it is that I explain a story. <br/>

Shinsengumi manga idea after all.  <br/>
<br/>
Burai was stopped by command of the chief editor of a magazine. The <br/>
magazine which Burai serialized took the plan which eliminates <br/>
History manga. Since it was a Shinsengumi boom last year, Burai <br/>
announced some short stories with the magazine different from it. <br/>
Burai is the good work with which the story is built well. <br/>
Therefore, judgment of this chief editor is very regrettable.<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi mangas are unpopular and there are many works which are <br/>
stopped. Ordinary manga readers are not interested in Bakumatsu. And <br/>
they sense the complicated social situation of Bakumatsu <br/>
troublesome, and do not read those mangas.<br/>
<br/>
PMK was very popular rare Shinsengumi manga. I think that about <br/>
400,000 people are disappointed in Japan because this work was <br/>
stopped. <br/>
<br/>
I also want to see Shinsengumi manga which Watsuki-sensei draws^_^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145472137">PMK was stopped?  Thats a new to me.   I don&#39;t know how popular it is in the U.S. but I certainly enjoy it very much.   Thats a real shame that they cut short a series just because your not intrested in the history and conflict behind it.   Thanks for sharing this kind of info. with us, Momo-san.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036602839">Thank you for that information. I am very sorry- I had enjoyed this<br/>
series immensely and it inspired me to learn about the Shinsengumi.<br/>
Perhaps the author can find a new publisher and finish her story.<br/>
