<h3>What happened to the SHQ MessageBoard?</h3>
by <i>niwashi_1</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110372277">I found the Shinsengumi Headquarters message board<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://p076.ezboard.com/bshinsengumiheadquarters">http://p076.ezboard.com/bshinsengumiheadquarters</a><br/>
not too long ago - just long enough to see that it had a bunch of <br/>
interesting stuff posted there.  Unfortunately, before I had time to <br/>
go through and read all that interesting stuff, it started <br/>
disappearing.  At first it was just some of the posts missing, then <br/>
all of the posts and many of the forums disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on???  And is it going to get fixed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a marginally related note, I recently bought the first volume of <br/>
each of several different Shinsengumi manga.  I was thinking of <br/>
writing up a little first-impression mini-review of each of them and <br/>
posting it on the messageboard (if it were still there).  I guess I'll <br/>
post to the Yahoo group instead (although I generally like message <br/>
boards better than e-mail lists).  Is the SHQ group or the <br/>
SHQ_Spy_Division group the better one to send reviews to?<br/>

Cool idea with the reviews.  Best place to send them is to this list, SHQ.  The Spy Division is more for member and other fan fiction and art.  ^_^<br/>

<br/>
I have skimmed the Shinsengumi related pages and enjoyed the <br/>
webmaster's generalizations of "multiracial Shinsengumi fans" and <br/>
the various erroneous opinions they harbor (^_^).  Through this list <br/>
I have met several people who have a very realistic view of the <br/>
Shinsengumi and they also enjoy their fictional spin-offs.  What I <br/>
found to be very interesting about the site is the mixture of some <br/>
sound facts and plenty of opinions.  I could not find the author's <br/>
list of textual sources (maybe there is a list---I just can't find <br/>
it).  Since most of us can't time travel or do not know Japanese it <br/>
is necessary to look for books/articles written by those who know <br/>
more than we do.  This is why I have tried to be thorough and <br/>
careful in citing my sources so if you wish you can double check my <br/>
own work, you CAN---establish a paper trail and giving credit where <br/>
it is due.  For example the webmaster at one point said Nakajima <br/>
Nobori was enthusiastic about photography---as a Nakajima Nobori fan <br/>
I'd like to know where he got this detail. So these sites are useful <br/>
in gauging people's changing views but they may not be as helpful in <br/>
the long run if you want to dig deeper into the history.<br/>
<br/>
His/her discussion in Shinsengumi opinions on foreigners is also <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
[side note:  Fujita Goro was assigned, at one point,  to work the <br/>
Azabu area in Tokyo.  Azabu was where many foreign missionaries <br/>
lived.  The area during the Meiji Era was described in extreme terms <br/>
as very "good" due to the foreigners and also very "bad" due to the <br/>
high number of poor people (the missionaries proselytized and setup <br/>
orphanages and schools for the poor).  Basically, later in life <br/>
Fujita Goro *had* to encounter foreigners through his work in Azabu, <br/>
at the Education Museum and later Tokyo Womens Normal School.  It <br/>
would be interesting to learn how former Shinsengumi may have felt <br/>
about foreigners as time past.<br/>

<br/>
What happened to ShinsengumiMB.com?   <br/>
<br/>
As Spiritus Saitou mentioned, the board was severely damaged due to <br/>
someone hacking into ezboard.com.  They were only able to restore <br/>
the earliest posts which consisted of the QUESTIONS.  The board <br/>
shows and "evolution" of question, answer, speculation, more <br/>
speculation and puddles of fangirl drool over Shinsengumi eye <br/>
candy.  Valuable info lost included the VERY BEST links to Japanese <br/>
sites, cosplay advice from our very own Okita as well as photo close <br/>
ups of sword damage (you can't really find many good pics online) <br/>
and valuable information from momomanjyuu2004  (some of her info is <br/>
on this list simply "search").  Ezboard completed the restoral <br/>
process which resulted in the NUMBER of messages coming back mostly <br/>
with the notice "unable to restore" (*_*).  <br/>
<br/>
Popular threads such as the love lives of the Shinsengumi, ghost <br/>
stories and other "rumors" can be recalled from memory---so please <br/>
post questions here.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a>  gets many hits so I decided to use the <br/>
domain as a portal to this mailing list. <br/>
<br/>
Please please contribute anything such as articles, fanart or your <br/>
own wisdom on topics like cosplay or movie reviews.SHQ.com is a <br/>
crossroads for many Shinsengumi "fields"you may also contact <br/>
SHQ.com by emailing shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
So *niwashi_1* we would be very happy to post your manga reviews to <br/>

Researchable historical detail/possibility which needs to be <br/>
*confirmed* is  that the famous photographer FELIX BEATO took the <br/>
photos of Kondou Isami, Hijikata, the purported image of Okita.  <br/>
FELIX BEATO photographs have been published all over the place.  <br/>

Trivia <br/>
<br/>
Question---Why did Meiji era cops wear white gloves?<br/>
<br/>
Answer---So they could take them off with their teeth and drive the <br/>
ladies wild? Recall the TV series Rurouni Kenshin's Saitou in the <br/>
other title sequence<br/>
<br/>
.....Not exactly.....  <br/>
<br/>
The answer lies in the development of the Japanese police.  From the <br/>
1870s to 1879 (Toshiyoshi Kawaji dies) the French model was <br/>
adopted.  In the 1880s onward led by Yamagata Aritomo the German <br/>
police model was implemented.  The gloves come from France's Eugène <br/>
François Vidocq   who was a career criminal who later became a super <br/>
spy for the police (his criminal ways later led to his downfall).  <br/>
Vidocq had a team of former criminals who worked with him.  The <br/>
public saw the police as criminals in uniform.  The police in turn <br/>
wore white gloves because gloves prevented them from picking <br/>
pockets.  Bare hands are needed to determine if the victim is <br/>
carrying valuables.  Bare hands (skin) provides the traction needed <br/>
to remove those valuables.</div>

I had wandered off to do a little field work and when I came back I <br/>
could not find my way back into the site.  It is going to take <br/>
forever to get caught up on the posts(sigh).  However, I have found <br/>
the time to post a few screen captures from the NHK drama at the 'Spy <br/>

that will please several of the members.<br/>
