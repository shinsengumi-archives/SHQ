<h3><a href="#msg-2614">&gt;</a> For those of you who may have wanted information on Okita&#39;s family...</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007900381">All the information you&#39;d ever want about Okita Soji&#39;s family, and then <br/>
some. From the Okita family record, as quoted in &quot;101 Mysteries of the <br/>
Shinsengumi,&quot; by Kikuchi Akira. pp 24-25<br/>
<br/>
Chicago-style reference:<br/>
<br/>
Kikuchi Akira, Shinsengumi 101 no Nazo (Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 2000)<br/>
<br/>
And now, without further ado, the information:<br/>
<br/>
Soji&#39;s sisters:<br/>
<br/>
-Mitsu was born on Tenpo 4, April 8 (May 20, 1833 by the Western calendar).<br/>
-Kin was born on Tenpo 7, April 11 (May 25, 1836 by the Western calendar).<br/>
<br/>
Marriage:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-In Koka 3 (1846), at age 14, Mitsu married Inoue Rintaro, younger brother <br/>
of Inoue Sozo, who was related to Inoue Genzaburo.<br/>
<br/>
-Inoue Rintaro, by marrying into the Okita family as an adopted heir, became <br/>
(full name) Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune. Later became a captain in <br/>
the Shinchogumi.<br/>
<br/>
-Kin, according to the family record, married Tatebayashi senior councilor <br/>
Nakano Den&#39;emon Yoshihide. However, in reality, she married Mineyama <br/>
retainer Nakano Dennojo Yoshihide (stipend-- 23 hyo, 3 retainer allotments).<br/>
<br/>
Children:<br/>
<br/>
-In Man&#39;ei 6 Jan. 26 (Western style- 1853 April 5), their first son <br/>
Yoshijiro was born.<br/>
-Ansei 2 Jul. 17 (Western style- 1855 August 29), 1st daughter Ishi was <br/>
born.<br/>
-Genji 1, Oct. 26 (Western style- 1864 Nov. 25), 2nd daughter Kuma born.<br/>
-Meiji 11 (1878) Jul. 12, 2nd son Sugukichi ���g born (not sure of the name <br/>
reading).<br/>
<br/>
Residence:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-In 1863, Mitsu and Rintaro moved to Yotsuya Tenmacho Itchome.<br/>
<br/>
-In 1863, Rintaro joined the Roshigumi, which went to Kyoto, came back, and <br/>
became Shinchogumi, under the sponsorship of the Shonai domain. At that <br/>
point, they moved to a kumi-yashikiat the former site of the mansion of <br/>
Tanuma Harushige. They lived there until the Boshin War.<br/>
<br/>
-Keio 4, Feb. 26 (March 19, 1868 in the Western style), the family left Edo <br/>
at the orders of Shonai.<br/>
<br/>
-Meiji 5, they returned to Tokyo, lived in a place called the &quot;Ume-yashiki&quot; <br/>
(Plum Mansion) in Sumida-Mukaijima. Rintaro died on Feb. 13, Meiji 16 (1883) <br/>
at age 58.<br/>
<br/>
-Mitsu then lived in Shiogama in the former Sendai domain.<br/>
-On Jan. 26, Meiji 28 (1895), Mitsu returned to Hino, lived with Inoue <br/>
Kyuzaburo.<br/>
<br/>
-Soon after, Ishi married, and then Sugukichi went to Manchuria. Mitsu <br/>
followed him there in Meiji 39, dying there on Nov. 2, Meiji 40 (1907), at <br/>
around 10 in the morning, without returning home.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Even though the story about Harada Sanosuke escaping to Manchuria is <br/>
probably fake, it&#39;s very easy to imagine him checking in on Mitsu now and <br/>
then. Might be good material for a fanfic!<br/>
<br/>
-Kin died April 2, Meiji 41 (1908). According to her son Nakano Kanzaburo, <br/>
she died around the same time of the morning as Mitsu did-- 10 AM.</div>

<h3><a href="#msg-2615">&gt;</a> Okita, Part 2</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-977059643">More information on Okita.<br/>
<br/>
-M.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Kikuchi Akira, &quot;Shinsengumi 101 no Nazo,&quot; p. 26-27<br/>
<br/>
Okita Souji is listed in the death records at the family temple<br/>
as being the &quot;2nd son of<br/>
Okita Rintaro&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ancestors (earliest to most recent)<br/>
<br/>
1. Great-grandfather- Kan&#39;emon- died Bunsei 2 (1819)<br/>
2. Grandfather- Sanshiro- died Tenpo 4 (1833)<br/>
3. Father- Katsujiro- Koka 2 (1845)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not doubted that Katsujiro was his real father, but there&#39;s still the <br/>
record of &quot;2nd son of Okita Rintaro&quot; to deal with. The Hino Sato family <br/>
(Hijikata Toshizo&#39;s brother in law Hikogoro) also records Soji as being <br/>
Okita Rintaro Mototsune&#39;s youngest son. According to the &quot;Okita-ke Bunsho&quot; <br/>
(Okita Family Record), however, lists Rintaro Mototsune as being Mitsu&#39;s <br/>
husband, so it&#39;s impossible that he was Soji&#39;s father.<br/>
<br/>
However, if the death record is correct, then we must conclude that Soji&#39;s <br/>
father was *another* Rintaro. But that complicates things. After all, <br/>
Rintaro was adopted as the successor, and thus became Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;son&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In May of Bunkyu 3 (1863), when Rintaro entered Shinchogumi, he denoted his <br/>
father as &quot;the late Okita Katsujiro, retainer of Lord Abe Noto no Kami,&quot; and <br/>
again, describing himself in Keio 1 (1865), as &quot;son of Okita Katsujiro, <br/>
retainer of Lord Abe Noto no Kami&quot; and again, in official documents of Meiji <br/>
4 and 5, before the prefectures were organized into their present form, as <br/>
&quot;Eldest son of Okita Rintaro, former samurai of Nihonmatsu Prefecture, in <br/>
Oushuu.&quot; That being the case, it is impossible that Rintaro was Soji&#39;s real <br/>
father. At the same time of Rintaro&#39;s last description of himself (the Meiji <br/>
4/5 one), Mitsu was listed in the same document as &quot;Eldest daughter of <br/>
Kondou Shuusuke of Tokyo&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In Meiji 7, the Okita family records list her the same way. Her son <br/>
Yoshijiro mentions her the same way-- &quot;Eldest daughter of Kondou Touzou of <br/>
North Tama county, Ozawa Village.&quot; Mitsu&#39;s true origin as a daughter of <br/>
Okita Katsujiro and her even having been born into the Okita family are thus <br/>
hidden. Why is that?<br/>
<br/>
The reason is: A man by the name of Chiba Yaichiro entered Shinchogumi in <br/>
Keio 2 (1866). In his record, &quot;Shinchogumi to Shonai-han&quot; (Shinchogumi and <br/>
the Shonai domain), he lists Rintaro as &quot;the birth brother of Okita Soji.&quot; <br/>
Rintaro, it seems, told everyone he was Soji&#39;s blood brother, and in order <br/>
to hide this, he listed Mitsu as the daughter of the Kondou family. With her <br/>
origin thus concealed, even her son Yoshijiro didn&#39;t know her true origin.<br/>
<br/>
THUS, with Rintaro selling himself as Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;eldest son,&quot; that makes <br/>
Soji the &quot;second son&quot; of Katsujiro. With such confusion with the family <br/>
records, whoever took down the listing for Soji&#39;s lineage in the death <br/>
record was obviously confused, and ended up making Soji the &quot;2nd son of <br/>
Okita Rintaro&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In Tenpo 2 (1831), Katsujiro is listed in Shirakawa-Abe clan documents:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stipend of 22 hyo and 2 retainer allotments. Succeeded on Tenpo 2, July 22. <br/>
Samurai of Tomobe Jiemon&#39;s unit, Okita Katsujiro.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People who drew such low stipends, also amongst the Tokugawa shogunate&#39;s <br/>
gokenin (lower retainers), were &quot;common.&quot; As a result, Rintaro and Soji, in <br/>
the Shinchogumi and Shinsengumi respectively, coming from such a background, <br/>
were truly &#39;creating a new heaven and earth&#39;.</div>

few at a time.  Why would Rintaro be adopted into the Okita family? <br/>
If Katsujiro died in 1845, and Rintaro married in 1846, was this <br/>
arranged in advance by Katsujiro - or someone else?  If Katsujiro <br/>
was ill and knew he was going to die, would it have been the normal <br/>
thing to do in adopting an heir because Souji was so young?  Did <br/>
that make Rintaro head of the Okita family?  What if Souji had not<br/>

where does &quot;Fujiwara&quot; in Rintaro&#39;s adopted name come from?  Perhaps <br/>
someone wouldn&#39;t mind giving a quick history lesson on adopting <br/>
heirs?<br/>
<br/>
And...about the adoption situation presented in NHK with Shuhei - If <br/>
Kondo was going to name Souji his successor as the Tennen Rishin<br/>
master, why wouldn&#39;t he also make him the Kondo family heir?  I had <br/>
assumed it was because he was already the Okita family heir. Is this <br/>
a case of mixing historical accuracy and taking historical liberties?<br/>
<br/>
I hope I made at least a little sense.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922562912"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have *so* many questions right now, but I&#39;ll keep it to just a<br/>
&gt;few at a time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t worry, history is my job-- I live for these questions. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Why would Rintaro be adopted into the Okita family?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because Souji was too young and being trained in kenjutsu-- and if Kondo <br/>
later had the intention to adopt him, this all makes sense-- Kondo would <br/>
have probably had that intention when Souji entered the school. With Souji <br/>
essentially &quot;out&quot; of the Okita family (or such a discussion taking place <br/>
when Katsujiro was still alive), the only alternative would have been for an <br/>
heir to be adopted.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If Katsujiro died in 1845, and Rintaro married in 1846, was this<br/>
&gt;arranged in advance by Katsujiro - or someone else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They would have probably been engaged before Katsujiro died. My guess would <br/>
be that they waited an appropriate time. In Asian cultures (I speak from <br/>
experience) engagement can come anywhere from one year to three before the <br/>
actual marriage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If Katsujiro<br/>
&gt;was ill and knew he was going to die, would it have been the normal<br/>
&gt;thing to do in adopting an heir because Souji was so young?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Amongst Shogunal officials it was weirder-- sometimes one could be dead <br/>
for several days and then they&#39;d set his body up behind a screen and have a <br/>
retainer read something that the deceased supposedly wrote-- &quot;Due to my <br/>
illness, I hereby adopt so-and-so as my heir...&quot; Because, you see, no heir <br/>
means the family not only ends, but the surviving relatives (especially <br/>
women) have pretty much their entire estate/source of livelihood taken away <br/>
by government order (I think it&#39;s called &#39;toritsubushi&#39; in some cases).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Did<br/>
&gt;that make Rintaro head of the Okita family?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very much so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What if Souji had not<br/>
&gt;died so young? Could an adopted heir displace a blood heir?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes-- happened sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And,<br/>
&gt;where does &quot;Fujiwara&quot; in Rintaro&#39;s adopted name come from?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fujiwara are one of the three big Heian-era clans that everyone liked to <br/>
claim descent from. The other two were Minamoto (Genji) and Taira <br/>
(Heike/Heishi). Fujiwara were court nobles, the other two were princely <br/>
families that became warrior clans. So when someone gave their full name, <br/>
they&#39;d also name who they (ostensibly) descended from, even if it was a <br/>
somewhat tenuous claim *cough*Lord Ieyasu*cough*<br/>
<br/>
Hence, Okita Souji&#39;s full name was first &quot;Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no <br/>
Harumasa&quot; and later &quot;Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, in some dealings with the Imperial Court, if Souji had, say, received <br/>
a summons from the Emperor or a Prince or other noble, he would have been <br/>
summoned-- not as Okita Souji, but as &quot;Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot;-- kind of like <br/>
how Matsudaira Katamori *was* summoned as &quot;Minamoto Katamori&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Perhaps<br/>
&gt;someone wouldn&#39;t mind giving a quick history lesson on adopting<br/>
&gt;heirs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s sort of tricky...but I&#39;ll try to figure a general description out and <br/>
post it before long.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And...about the adoption situation presented in NHK with Shuhei - If<br/>
&gt;Kondo was going to name Souji his successor as the Tennen Rishin<br/>
&gt;master, why wouldn&#39;t he also make him the Kondo family heir?  I had<br/>
&gt;assumed it was because he was already the Okita family heir. Is this<br/>
&gt;a case of mixing historical accuracy and taking historical liberties?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes...sorta. Inheriting the tradition doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you <br/>
inherit the master&#39;s family. Tennen Rishin Ryu today is an example of that-- <br/>
the Kondo and Miyagawa families alternate headship, if I recall correctly, <br/>
but the present master is......Sono Seigo? Not sure...the last Kondo to be <br/>
head of the school was Kondo Isuke, who I believe died in the early 1990s.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before, Okita was probably not the family heir, even from the <br/>
very beginning.<br/>
<br/>
If Kondo was going to name Okita his heir for both school and family, he <br/>
probably would have followed how Kondo Shuusuke did it for *him*-- train him <br/>
first, then when he was about to take over, have him change his name and <br/>
then succeed to the family *and* dojo headship.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, family/succession issues in Edo-era Japan are incredibly weird. <br/>
Which is why Kondo naming Tani Masatake as his heir (Kondo Shuuhei) is <br/>
interesting-- he would have been prepping Souji for years, BUT, since Tani <br/>
Mantaro and Sanjuro, two brothers who ran the Tani spear dojo (Taneda Hozoin <br/>
Ryu) joined Shinsengumi, Kondo would have done what was natural in a <br/>
&quot;business deal&quot; like that-- adopted their brother in order to seal the deal <br/>
by &quot;family&quot; ties. Incidentally, the Tani dojo was where Harada Sanosuke <br/>
learned how to use the spear.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>

Hello, I belong to a group called the Yamato Yagyu Kai<br/>
which happens to be under a man named Sono Seigo<br/>
(Walter Sensei calls him Seigo, the letter he wrote to<br/>
Manogue Sensei he spells his name Seiko).  This Sono<br/>
that you mention wouldn&#39;t happen to be the Sono Seigo<br/>
who lives in Osaka would it?  Sono Sensei is the 17th<br/>
head of Edo Yagyu Shinkage Ryu.  I think our group is<br/>
or was connected to a dojo that teaches Buikukai<br/>
Aikido.  The instructor there, a man named Yoshida<br/>
(I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know his first name, but he is the<br/>
Aikido instructor to my Kenjutsu instructor Paul<br/>
Manogue) is a shihan of Tennen Rishin Ryu.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928599899">OK, so you&#39;ve encountered the group in Japan eh?  I<br/>
haven&#39;t had the pleasure of meeting Sono Sensei yet,<br/>
but our group is heading out there early next year.  <br/>
I&#39;m also trying to church up on my Japanese so I can<br/>
speak with Yoshida Sensei on my own.  From what I&#39;ve<br/>
been told the man knows volumes about the Shinsengumi<br/>
and regardless, seeing Tennen Rishin Ryu in person<br/>
would be pretty exciting (even for a humble Shinkage<br/>
Ryu fencer like me :-D).<br/>

But if you really do live for these questions - I will ask more often!<br/>
