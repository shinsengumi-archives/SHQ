<h3>OT: A New Pinnacle of Frustration</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410828842">So my professor and I had an argument today about kabuki, and why I<br/>
think it was wise of the Tokugawa to control it. Finally, I conceded<br/>
defeat (I still want to pass this course). In response, I spent the<br/>
next 20 minutes writing this poem, titled simply, &quot;Samurai&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
SAMURAI<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
You see murder,<br/>
I see power.<br/>
You see filth,<br/>
I see loyalty.<br/>
Giri- the sense of duty.<br/>
Makoto- total devotion.<br/>
Do you know<br/>
the pain they felt?<br/>
Do you know<br/>
how the people<br/>
in Aizu and Nagaoka<br/>
stood their ground?<br/>
Do you see<br/>
anything beyond war?<br/>
Can you see<br/>
Musashi, his swords to one side,<br/>
sculpting?<br/>
Do you hear<br/>
the komuso warriors<br/>
playing mournful tunes<br/>
on the shakuhachi flute?<br/>
Do you see<br/>
the arrangement of flowers<br/>
before the mounted suit of armor?<br/>
Do you hear<br/>
the poems<br/>
being composed under<br/>
falling blossoms?<br/>
Do you see<br/>
the daimyo<br/>
visiting the teashops<br/>
in Edo?<br/>
Do you hear<br/>
the laughter and<br/>
vitality?<br/>
Do you see<br/>
Tokugawa Yoshimune<br/>
reading the complaints<br/>
from his suggestions box? (Author&#39;s note: Real historical fact)<br/>
Do you realize<br/>
that the country was at peace?<br/>
<br/>
You see a sword<br/>
and smell murder.<br/>
<br/>
I see a sword<br/>
and see the extension of a soul.<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;samurai&quot;<br/>
means &quot;one who serves&quot;.<br/>
They lived with war<br/>
so others wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
They lived in harmony<br/>
with nature.<br/>
Whatever was taken from<br/>
the earth in those daysd<br/>
was returned to it.<br/>
In the days of the shoguns<br/>
the water<br/>
from the Sumida River<br/>
in Edo was clean enough<br/>
to brew tea with.<br/>
Not any more!<br/>
Are the samurai so bad,<br/>
so vile and vicious?<br/>
<br/>
You see a murderer,<br/>
I see a protector.<br/>
<br/>
You smell blood,<br/>
I see falling cherry blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu<br/>
brought the nation<br/>
out of centuries of war.<br/>
Do you think he&#39;s evil for that?<br/>
Granted, the Tokugawa<br/>
ruled with an iron fist--<br/>
but would it have been better<br/>
for the country to have<br/>
stayed in perpetual strife?<br/>
<br/>
You smell blood<br/>
I smell toil.<br/>
<br/>
You see a sword<br/>
I see a code.<br/>
<br/>
Are they so evil?<br/>
Are they so cruel and heartless?<br/>
You speak of haiku--<br/>
do you so easily forget<br/>
that Matsuo Basho himself<br/>
was a samurai of Iga province?<br/>
Are the 47 loyal retainers<br/>
evil for avenging their lord?<br/>
You say that their period, the Genroku era,<br/>
was the high point of Edo culture.<br/>
Was that not also<br/>
the most corrupt part<br/>
of the Tokugawa era?<br/>
<br/>
You see a sword<br/>
I see a spirit.<br/>
<br/>
You see murder<br/>
I see fidelity in revenge.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ofcourse in our day and age we believe in free speech and the <br/>
representation from all sides.  Now, I don&#39;t know enough about kabuki, <br/>
but weren&#39;t there other forms of entertainment that the masses could <br/>
view...all of which could be well beyond the control of the Tokugawa?  I <br/>
bring this up because I study Thailand and although theatre/poetry that <br/>
has been recorded and handed down is supposed to be &quot;court&quot; <br/>
entertainment however there is more than enough evidence suggesting <br/>
that whatever was popular amongst the &quot;lower&quot; class soon became <br/>
popular in the courts as well.  And yes ofcourse the upper class didn&#39;t <br/>
enjoy seeing themselves mocked/parodied but they couldn&#39;t REALLY <br/>
stop it.  So the issue may be &quot;how effective was the Tokugawa was in <br/>
controlling kabuki?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Feudalism=bondage/vassal system there is no denying this...similarly so <br/>
was the monarchical system in Thailand before 1932 however many <br/>
ancient poems I read convey the need for the leader to be sure that the <br/>
people were well fed and that the leader be just (to the point of people <br/>
summoning the leader with a bell to preside over major conflicts).  Note <br/>
the people could call upon the leader.  Thus, there is a very CLEAR <br/>
understanding that an unjust leader will be overthrown...mismanagement <br/>
of the government will result in challenges.  My point is <br/>
that &quot;mainstream&quot; history is based on generalizations and that cannot be <br/>
avoided because people have to start &quot;somewhere&quot; before mastering a <br/>
body of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Try to be respectful when addressing your professor and understand that <br/>
it is very healthy to see things from many points of view...it is not <br/>
innappropriate to type a short and sincere apology:)  It is odd that your <br/>
instructor seems to disregard the fact that the samurai ideal can be <br/>
found in all social classes and in the case of Aizu amongst women and <br/>
peasants as well...they weren&#39;t -just- defending their lord but their <br/>
homes/families and basically the only world they have ever known <br/>
(seeing how people rarely travelled beyond their domain).  Ofcourse the <br/>
ideal, like religion, has been at times manipulated and its followers <br/>
exploited but alongside these cases people like your professor must <br/>
acknowledge that there are those who have interpreted the samurai <br/>
ideals in a noble way as well.</div>
