<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159386451">Go to Files find the folder "Dai-bosatsu Toge"<br/>
known to us via the film, SWORD OF DOOM, and the more high profile <br/>
film portraying the Shinsengumi<br/>
check out the scans (from the BOOK) of Ryunosuke vs thief...these <br/>
are rare images....my copy is from 1929 and its falling apart...<br/>
<br/>
Dai-bosatsu Toge is a really famous novel and the story is not just <br/>
about a psychopathic swordsman...but about morality (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I also scanned the photo of the mountain pass where the story <br/>
began...</div>
