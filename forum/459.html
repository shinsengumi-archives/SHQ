<h3>About Saito&#39;s Towel</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-892734372">Hey, I&#39;ve been thinking about the towel and I recalled something that <br/>
sounds very similar to that. This book I have on Japanese language <br/>
and culture mentions something called a haramaki, which is basically <br/>
a waistband or healthband (whichever you prefer). The point of this <br/>
is to keep the abdomen warm, even in hot weather, because it&#39;s <br/>
supposed to keep the wearer healthy. Maybe Saito wore the towel <br/>
around his neck for a similar reason?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588789434">I think we may have gotten confused with the towel wound upon the neck<br/>
because in the account of his death it mentions cotton around the<br/>
neck/throat...but below is all of the description we have from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.3-hajime.com/seikatu.html">http://www.3-hajime.com/seikatu.html</a><br/>
<br/>
When the &#20854; one what kind of being hot, under any condition the &#12426;<br/>
which is the one skin sewing, the towel was not wound in the neck.<br/>
When two footwears of the &#20854; are worn, wearing securely, the &#12387;<br/>
applying dragging in the foot finger and never there was no thing<br/>
which walks. The &#20854; three at the place where it sits down, gathering<br/>
the knee, you sat straight, did not scratch the cross-legged fashion,<br/>
the side &#12378; &#12431; &#12426; and the like did not do. Everyday you exchanged four<br/>
lower bands of the &#20854;, those which were washed, washing that in true<br/>
&#12387; white, you applied the paste, putting hit well with both palms,<br/>
stretched the wrinkle and to dry in the sun, you used kind of those<br/>
which you applied quite even with the iron. The &#20854; five usually, it<br/>
was very taciturn. Liking six liquor of the &#20854;, always drinking,<br/>
Takagi Morinosuke of the brother-in-law and Kenzirou etc. Yamakawa<br/>
and, doing the story of the &#25098; &#36784;, resenting and lamenting. In &#22857; job,<br/>
the work like the campus management was done in seven woman high<br/>
teacher schools of the &#20854;, but the day and the like when the rain<br/>
falls traffic control the rickshaw.</div>
