<h3>The irony of looking up images</h3>
by <i>sou_ryu_sen14</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-853465034">This is something I found interesting when I was web-serfing for <br/>
pictures. <br/>
When I typed in "Satsuma" in a search engine I got  pictures that <br/>
contained mostly oranges and vases. When I typed in "Choshu" I got <br/>
pictures of big guys that looked like wrestlers.  But when I typed <br/>
in "Shinsengumi" I got pages and pages of our favorite swordsmen <br/>
group....It looks like that even though the Ishin Shishi won the war, <br/>
it's the Shinsengumi that would be remembered, despite the belief <br/>
that "the victors write the history". Talk about ironic...The <br/>
Shinsengumi at least won the media war.<br/>
