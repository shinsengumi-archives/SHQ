<h3>Saitou mention in new manga book</h3>

<br/>
<br/>
Saitou is actually part of the "Antiheroes" section.  There's two <br/>
pictures from the RK manga and a quick summary of the time period.<br/>
<br/>
The basics: McCarthy says that Watsuki makes it hard to decide if <br/>
Saitou is a scoundrel or a just a man doing the best he can during <br/>
difficult times.  Saitou's interactions with Kenshin shows him to <br/>
be callous, but his fondness for Okita and Tokio show another side.<br/>
She also calls him a tragic figure - he remains the same while the<br/>
world is changing around him.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting little book for manga fans.<br/>
