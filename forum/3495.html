<h3>Moeyo Ken... the 1970 drama</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906173039">On the heels of information about novels, for those of you who do any <br/>
torrenting, the 1970 television dramatization (tv asahi; was NET back then) of <br/>
"Moeyo Ken" (aka "Burn, O Sword") has been uploaded today over on d-addicts.  <br/>
It's 26 episodes, no subtitles, and I have no idea what the overall quality is <br/>
like.  If you have any interest, I wouldn't wait very long with the batch file <br/>
being 9+GB.<br/>
<br/>
h ttp://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php  I can't take you directly to the <br/>
announcement page, but it's currently on the first page.  If it's not on the <br/>
front, just search for it in the search box.<br/>
<br/>
For those not familiar with "Moeyo Ken," it's Shiba Ryotaro's novelization of <br/>
the life of Hijikata.<br/>
