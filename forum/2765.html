<h3>Fans in Japan Updates</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-121269684">There are always fun activities going on in Japan in relation to the <br/>
Shinsengumi and it is totally necessary to watch their messageboards <br/>
and blogs because frequently they will post things you will not find <br/>
even if you buy every single book on the Shinsengumi.  Often these <br/>
fans will network extensively and speak to people who work at museums <br/>
or with local Shinsengumi &quot;officials&quot; (fans who&#39;ve spent years <br/>
specializing in certain fields).<br/>
<br/>
A list is here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
If you nifty their boards/blogs you&#39;ll get alot of neat info...however <br/>
not all info can be verified...you have to ask yourself...so where did <br/>
they hear this or what book is this from, who did they speak to and so <br/>
forth. If they don&#39;t mention a book or page number, there information <br/>
is not repeated on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a>  ... only a few of us <br/>
knows Japanese or have access to reliable human translators, if we <br/>
post everything we find without double checking chances are we are <br/>
hurting Shinsengumi research in the long run.  <br/>

[KONDOU&#39;s &quot;GRAVE&quot; IN AIZU]<br/>

message 4/25 (anniversary of Kondou&#39;s execution)<br/>
***there is alot of confusion over the remains of Kondou Isami<br/>
for example, was his head buried there? or was just his hair? and so <br/>
on and so forth<br/>
In the post, the origins of Kondou&#39;s grave is discussed, and how it at <br/>
one point faced TAMA (Kondou&#39;s birthplace/hometown).  <br/>
The grave was moved a couple of times and it has been at the current <br/>
location for 39 years.<br/>

In connection to this website, fans have mentioned that Hijikata&#39;s <br/>
pistol is on display there (Hijikata&#39;s name is to the left):<br/>

[THE AIZU CONNECTION]<br/>
This is the messageboard for the Aizu Shinsengumi Club, as you can <br/>
imagine they are pretty interested in Saitou Hajime.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aizukanko.com/cgi/spict/smallpict.cgi">http://www.aizukanko.com/cgi/spict/smallpict.cgi</a><br/>
<br/>
On the page you will find<br/>
1) discussion of the number of war dead buried at Amida Temple (Fujita <br/>
Goro and Tokio&#39;s ashes are interred at this temple) and how it was <br/>
very sad that the bodies were exposed to the elements before the <br/>
Imperial Army allowed locals to bury them all<br/>
2) the possible location of Shinoda Yaso&#39;s family&#39;s mansion in Aizu<br/>
Shinoda Yaso was Saitou Hajime&#39;s first wife<br/>

excited about this mural)<br/>

This is pretty neat...<br/>

<br/>
I swear that looks like a gigantic portrait of the director of the <br/>
hino-shinsengumi club...<br/>

[SHQ NEEDS HELP]<br/>
Is there anyone here who is fluent in FRENCH who can translate these <br/>
paragraphs?  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Infosheettrans.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Infosheettrans.htm</a><br/>
Ang again, there should be tons of info on the French involvement in <br/>
the Bakumatsu which would be totally relevant in the Hakodate theatre--<br/>
-which means Hijikata&#39;s last stand in Hokkaido.<br/>
<br/>
We always take contributions of fanart, cosplay pics and whatever you <br/>
have to offer.  Fanart can be 3 dimensional...just take pics from <br/>
different angles.</div>
