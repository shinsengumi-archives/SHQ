Mibugishiden...now for the bad news...no translator...S. California is<br/>
home to a huge population of Japanese Americans not to mention major<br/>
universities with Japanese language dept.  if you are upset then so am<br/>
I!!! I have PERSONALLY encouraged JAL to hire a translator for Mr.<br/>
Asada because as a native of CA I know that many anime fansubs are<br/>
from these universities.  So I was outraged that JAL would send Mr.<br/>
Asada here without a translator.  The lady on the line said that she<br/>
will speak to her superiors about getting a translator for Mr. Asada<br/>
<br/>
For the S. CA (Torrance) lecture you can only pay with personal check<br/>
or money order over the phone and tickets will be mailed to you ASAP...<br/>
...furthermore there will be a second lecture again by Jiro Asada in<br/>
San Francisco on Sept 10 call (415) 765-8545 at the Palo Alto Hotel<br/>
but the focus will be more on the Bakumatsu.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130318864">Yes tickets are $10, if you have JAL mileage its $5.00...<br/>
Torrance lecture concentrates on the Shinsengumi.  San Francisco one <br/>
is more Bakumatsu...I share your concerns Alan...I was on the phone, <br/>
the lady asked if I had seen the TV ad?  So I'm assuming that this <br/>
event will attract alot of attention in the Japanese community.<br/>
<br/>
*yes, NHK's Shinsengumi does not advertise itself to be historically <br/>
accurate...it's just entertainment...I agree that NHK should be very <br/>
clear with some issues...perhaps the books sold concerning the <br/>
series points out what is history, rumors/folktales, or fiction...at <br/>
least I would hope that they feel some responsibility<br/>
<br/>
*I hope Hillsborough will give lectures too when his book is <br/>
released...JAL is aware that Hillsborough has written a book in <br/>
English on the Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
Many of us here understand and appreciate the synthesis between fact <br/>
and fiction but the bottom line...is the bottom line <br/>
$$$$$...personally, I hope that the hyper commercialization of the <br/>
shinsengumi will lead the few to appreciate their historical <br/>
relevance.<br/>
