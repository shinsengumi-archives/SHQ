<div id="ygrps-yiv-897643543">good and BAD news...the speaker on sept 9 will be Jiro Asada who wrote<br/>
Mibugishiden...now for the bad news...no translator...S. California is<br/>
home to a huge population of Japanese Americans not to mention major<br/>
universities with Japanese language dept.  if you are upset then so am<br/>
I!!! I have PERSONALLY encouraged JAL to hire a translator for Mr.<br/>
Asada because as a native of CA I know that many anime fansubs are<br/>
from these universities.  So I was outraged that JAL would send Mr.<br/>
Asada here without a translator.  The lady on the line said that she<br/>
will speak to her superiors about getting a translator for Mr. Asada<br/>
<br/>
For the S. CA (Torrance) lecture you can only pay with personal check<br/>
or money order over the phone and tickets will be mailed to you ASAP...<br/>
...furthermore there will be a second lecture again by Jiro Asada in<br/>
San Francisco on Sept 10 call (415) 765-8545 at the Palo Alto Hotel<br/>
but the focus will be more on the Bakumatsu.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209967617">Perhaps not an authority, but as the key speaker(the one being <br/>
advertised), I think it&#39;s important for anyone interested in going <br/>
to know what they&#39;re paying for.  Will Jiro Asada be presenting <br/>
anything insightful, or will this just be a press junket for his <br/>
latest Shinsengumi-based novel?  I guess a better example would be <br/>
if the marquee speaker is the scriptwriter for that god-awful NHK <br/>
Shinsengumi series airing right now.  He may have done some research <br/>
to write the script, but I doubt anyone would want to pay to hear <br/>
his &quot;knowledge&quot; of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if Hillsborough will be doing anything like this, <br/>
especially when his new book comes out?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130318864">Yes tickets are $10, if you have JAL mileage its $5.00...<br/>
Torrance lecture concentrates on the Shinsengumi.  San Francisco one <br/>
is more Bakumatsu...I share your concerns Alan...I was on the phone, <br/>
the lady asked if I had seen the TV ad?  So I&#39;m assuming that this <br/>
event will attract alot of attention in the Japanese community.<br/>
<br/>
*yes, NHK&#39;s Shinsengumi does not advertise itself to be historically <br/>
accurate...it&#39;s just entertainment...I agree that NHK should be very <br/>
clear with some issues...perhaps the books sold concerning the <br/>
series points out what is history, rumors/folktales, or fiction...at <br/>
least I would hope that they feel some responsibility<br/>
<br/>
*I hope Hillsborough will give lectures too when his book is <br/>
released...JAL is aware that Hillsborough has written a book in <br/>
English on the Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
Many of us here understand and appreciate the synthesis between fact <br/>
and fiction but the bottom line...is the bottom line <br/>
$$$$$...personally, I hope that the hyper commercialization of the <br/>
shinsengumi will lead the few to appreciate their historical <br/>
relevance.<br/>

&gt; Perhaps not an authority, but as the key speaker(the one being <br/>
&gt; advertised), I think it&#39;s important for anyone interested in going <br/>
&gt; to know what they&#39;re paying for.  Will Jiro Asada be presenting <br/>
&gt; anything insightful, or will this just be a press junket for his <br/>
&gt; latest Shinsengumi-based novel?  I guess a better example would be <br/>
&gt; if the marquee speaker is the scriptwriter for that god-awful NHK <br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi series airing right now.  He may have done some <br/>
research <br/>
&gt; to write the script, but I doubt anyone would want to pay to hear <br/>
&gt; his &quot;knowledge&quot; of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering if Hillsborough will be doing anything like this, <br/>
&gt; especially when his new book comes out?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, we didn&#39;t say he is an authority on the Shinsengumi. I <br/>
doubt<br/>
&gt; &gt; many people would dare to make that claim seeing how in the <br/>
short <br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; period the Shinsengumi existed, their intense record would cause<br/>
&gt; &gt; people to divide up different aspects of their duties and battle<br/>
&gt; &gt; theatres (Toba Fushimi, Nagarayema, Aizu and Hakodate).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; At the request of SAitou, his secretary has made numerous calls <br/>
now<br/>
&gt; &gt; and spoke to 2 different people...all I can say is this JAL has<br/>
&gt; &gt; contact info for translators in San Francisco and Torrance...It <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; UP<br/>
&gt; &gt; TO THEM to do their part.  If you guys are interested please <br/>
call <br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; and urge them to acquire translators...my goodness there are grad<br/>
&gt; &gt; students who would do this for free. </span></blockquote></div>
