<h3>Kyoto Arc does NOT begin with a battle at the Ikedaya</h3>
by <i>nlf7</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632741059">Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s Kyoto Arc does NOT begin with a brief battle at the Ikedaya. The name <br/>
of the inn IS actually listed in the anime (Eventhough I could not read that, I could read <br/>
&quot;Ikedaya.&quot;) Also, Kenshin does NOT have the complete cross-shape scar till Dec (lunar <br/>
calendar), 1864. In addition, one could also get several clues from the conversation at the <br/>
inn.<br/>
<br/>
The Ikedaya Affair took place in June (lunar calendar) 1864. However, the Shinsengumi <br/>
didn&#39;t have 10 units until 1865 (Saito wasn&#39;t the captain of the 3rd squad and Okita wasn&#39;t <br/>
the captain of the 1st squad till then.) <br/>
<br/>
From DVD Vol 7: <br/>
&quot;Apparently, goverment army members are pouring into Kyoto mainly from Satsuma and <br/>
Choshin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Army members from Satsuma went to Kyoto in October (lunar calendar) 1865 and in <br/>
November (lunar calendar) 1867. They weren&#39;t around Kyoto in June (lunar <br/>
caleander) 1864. (The Satsuma army was around a month after the Ikedaya Affair though.) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering whether &quot;Choshin&quot; could be &quot;Chushu&quot; (or could include Chushu). If so, <br/>
then we all know that the alliance between Satsuma and Choshu was formed in January <br/>
(lunar calendar) 1866. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, there would be no camellia around in June (lunar calendar.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686747101">I haven&#39;t looked at the OVA and anime introductions of the context of<br/>
our introduction to Himura the Battousai recently to even gauge<br/>
whether historically one is more accurate than the other.<br/>
 <br/>
However, I think that because production of the animated series was<br/>
occurring as Watsuki was still revealing the later Jinchuu arc and the<br/>
events surround Tomoe that the correct contiuity to work from is the<br/>
OVA and the manga.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what your questions are about the Satsuma and Choshu from<br/>
your post. Were you trying to reconcile errors in the subtitles?  If<br/>
it appeared as &quot;Choshi&quot; or &quot;Choshin,&quot; it probably should have read<br/>
&quot;Choshu,&quot; &quot;Choushu,&quot; or some permutation of those.   <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list, btw.  If you need more information on the Choshu,<br/>
I can redirect you to a few links (although they are listed at the<br/>
main Shinsengumi page) and communities.  <br/>

&quot;I think of this Okita as the young man with the flower fetish. We don&#39;t get but a glimpse of <br/>
him, but he kiks some serious butt at the Ikedaya. It&#39;s a pity Saitou intervened when that <br/>

<br/>
Perhaps that should be corrected?<br/>
<br/>
PS In the manga, it&#39;s also stated clearly during the Kyoto Arc, that Kenshin didn&#39;t fight <br/>
Saito or Okita until 1865.<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-2805">&gt;</a> Re: [SHQ] for nlf-- Re: Kyoto Arc does NOT begin with a battle at the Ikedaya</h3>
by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920579244">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
There is a way to explain everything and put an end to the growing confusion...<br/>
<br/>
In volume 20 of RK (not animated unfortunately), which depicts Kenshin&#39;s past with Tomoe, you can see a description of what happens at Ikedaya, from Kenshin&#39;s pov. As we see in that volume, Kenshin never intervened at Ikedaya, only becoming aware of the events once everything is over. He then assists to the Shinsengumi &quot;parade&quot; and exchange a long look with Saito. Kenshin then thinks &quot;J&#39;ai l&#39;impression que je reverrai souvent cet homme...&quot; or if I&#39;m translating from the French version &quot;I was under the impression that I would often see that man in the future...&quot;, implying that they didn&#39;t knew each other yet.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in volume 21, once Tomoe is dead (sorry, if I&#39;m spoiling that to anyone, but... where have you been?) Kenshin returns to Kyoto and soon engage in a duel with Saito for the first time. Seeing him, Saito says &quot;Je me disais bien que ce n&#39;ÃÂ©tait pas un sabreur ordinaire... c&#39;ÃÂ©tait donc cela&quot; or &quot;I thought he was no ordinary swordsman... this explains it...&quot;, meaning that he just understood that the man he saw in the crowd after Ikedaya is Battosai. <br/>
<br/>
So knowing this, it then becomes clear that the scene in volume 7 (or episode 28) does not happens at Ikedaya, like many people thinks, but WAY after Ikedaya. It really is a common mistake as I&#39;ve also been under that impression for a long time.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a way to explain everything and put an end to the growing confusion...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In volume 20 of RK (not animated unfortunately), which depicts Kenshin&#39;s past with <br/>
Tomoe, you can see a description of what happens at Ikedaya, from Kenshin&#39;s pov. As we <br/>
see in that volume, Kenshin never intervened at Ikedaya, only becoming aware of the <br/>
events once everything is over. He then assists to the Shinsengumi &quot;parade&quot; and exchange <br/>
a long look with Saito. Kenshin then thinks &quot;J&#39;ai l&#39;impression que je reverrai souvent cet <br/>
homme...&quot; or if I&#39;m translating from the French version &quot;I was under the impression that I <br/>
would often see that man in the future...&quot;, implying that they didn&#39;t knew each other yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, in volume 21, once Tomoe is dead (sorry, if I&#39;m spoiling that to anyone, but... <br/>
where have you been?) Kenshin returns to Kyoto and soon engage in a duel with Saito for <br/>
the first time. Seeing him, Saito says &quot;Je me disais bien que ce n&#39;ÃÂ©tait pas un sabreur <br/>
ordinaire... c&#39;ÃÂ©tait donc cela&quot; or &quot;I thought he was no ordinary swordsman... this explains <br/>
it...&quot;, meaning that he just understood that the man he saw in the crowd after Ikedaya is <br/>
Battosai. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So knowing this, it then becomes clear that the scene in volume 7 (or episode 28) does <br/>
not happens at Ikedaya, like many people thinks, but WAY after Ikedaya. It really is a <br/>
common mistake as I&#39;ve also been under that impression for a long time.<br/>

Please refer to my original <br/>
&gt;  message for more information.  In addition, I&#39;ve uploaded a screen cap of the <br/>
&gt;  name of the inn from ep.28. (By the way, could anyone read that? I know it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;  not &quot; Ikedaya&quot;  but what is it?) <br/>

&gt;  I&#39;ve explained this one to people nearly 100 times. It would be helpful if you <br/>
&gt;  could make one tiny correction. I apologize for any inconveneince.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Since I&#39;m the one who wrote that bit of commentary I don&#39;t think there&#39;s <br/>
&gt;  &gt; anything to &quot;correct&quot; really. It was simply MY impression of that <br/>

&gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Though it&#39;s been a long time since I watched it I do recall Saitou <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639480309">PS In the anime, Saito does make an appearance at the very end of the Kyoto Arc. <br/>
I guess that question had came from people that hadn&#39;t finish watching the animated <br/>
Kyoto Arc. <br/>
