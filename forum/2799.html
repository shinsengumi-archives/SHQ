<h3>Kyoto Arc does NOT begin with a battle at the Ikedaya</h3>
by <i>nlf7</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632741059">Rurouni Kenshin's Kyoto Arc does NOT begin with a brief battle at the Ikedaya. The name <br/>
of the inn IS actually listed in the anime (Eventhough I could not read that, I could read <br/>
"Ikedaya.") Also, Kenshin does NOT have the complete cross-shape scar till Dec (lunar <br/>
calendar), 1864. In addition, one could also get several clues from the conversation at the <br/>
inn.<br/>
<br/>
The Ikedaya Affair took place in June (lunar calendar) 1864. However, the Shinsengumi <br/>
didn't have 10 units until 1865 (Saito wasn't the captain of the 3rd squad and Okita wasn't <br/>
the captain of the 1st squad till then.) <br/>
<br/>
From DVD Vol 7: <br/>
"Apparently, goverment army members are pouring into Kyoto mainly from Satsuma and <br/>
Choshin."<br/>
<br/>
Army members from Satsuma went to Kyoto in October (lunar calendar) 1865 and in <br/>
November (lunar calendar) 1867. They weren't around Kyoto in June (lunar <br/>
caleander) 1864. (The Satsuma army was around a month after the Ikedaya Affair though.) <br/>
<br/>
I've been wondering whether "Choshin" could be "Chushu" (or could include Chushu). If so, <br/>
then we all know that the alliance between Satsuma and Choshu was formed in January <br/>
(lunar calendar) 1866. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, there would be no camellia around in June (lunar calendar.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686747101">I haven't looked at the OVA and anime introductions of the context of<br/>
our introduction to Himura the Battousai recently to even gauge<br/>
whether historically one is more accurate than the other.<br/>
 <br/>
However, I think that because production of the animated series was<br/>
occurring as Watsuki was still revealing the later Jinchuu arc and the<br/>
events surround Tomoe that the correct contiuity to work from is the<br/>
OVA and the manga.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what your questions are about the Satsuma and Choshu from<br/>
your post. Were you trying to reconcile errors in the subtitles?  If<br/>
it appeared as "Choshi" or "Choshin," it probably should have read<br/>
"Choshu," "Choushu," or some permutation of those.   <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list, btw.  If you need more information on the Choshu,<br/>
I can redirect you to a few links (although they are listed at the<br/>
main Shinsengumi page) and communities.  <br/>

PS In the manga, it's also stated clearly during the Kyoto Arc, that Kenshin didn't fight <br/>

by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920579244">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
There is a way to explain everything and put an end to the growing confusion...<br/>
<br/>
In volume 20 of RK (not animated unfortunately), which depicts Kenshin's past with Tomoe, you can see a description of what happens at Ikedaya, from Kenshin's pov. As we see in that volume, Kenshin never intervened at Ikedaya, only becoming aware of the events once everything is over. He then assists to the Shinsengumi "parade" and exchange a long look with Saito. Kenshin then thinks "J'ai l'impression que je reverrai souvent cet homme..." or if I'm translating from the French version "I was under the impression that I would often see that man in the future...", implying that they didn't knew each other yet.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in volume 21, once Tomoe is dead (sorry, if I'm spoiling that to anyone, but... where have you been?) Kenshin returns to Kyoto and soon engage in a duel with Saito for the first time. Seeing him, Saito says "Je me disais bien que ce n'Ã©tait pas un sabreur ordinaire... c'Ã©tait donc cela" or "I thought he was no ordinary swordsman... this explains it...", meaning that he just understood that the man he saw in the crowd after Ikedaya is Battosai. <br/>
<br/>
So knowing this, it then becomes clear that the scene in volume 7 (or episode 28) does not happens at Ikedaya, like many people thinks, but WAY after Ikedaya. It really is a common mistake as I've also been under that impression for a long time.<br/>
