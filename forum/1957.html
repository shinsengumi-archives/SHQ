The book info is right on the picture<br/>
sadly the painting was reproduced as a black and white pic...but <br/>
look ~carefully~ women with naginata to the left, right and a "room" <br/>
with people and heads arranged on the floor<br/>
*what strikes me is that compared to paintings of the Seinan War <br/>
this painting about the fall of Aizu shows women all over the place</div>
