<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740607953">The original model for Kenshin was a guy named Kawakami Gensai, and <br/>
his style was something like Shiranui or Furanui Ryu, I've never <br/>
been able to find out one way or the other.  He was one of 4 <br/>
assassins working for the ShiShi and was from Higo.  After the war <br/>
was over he raised a stink about the direction the government was <br/>
moving in and raised a stink about it.  He was thereafter found <br/>
guilty on some trumped up charges and executed.  Far as I know <br/>
though he was only occasionally called Hitokiri Gensai, never <br/>
Battousai.  Watsuki had even said he used Kawakami as one of the <br/>
models for Kenshin.<br/>
<br/>
Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu DID NOT exist.  I'm fairly certain I read an <br/>
interview when Watsuki Nobuhiro said he invented the style for his <br/>
Kenshin style.  (I'm gonna have to bookmark that interview next time <br/>
I manage to find it.)<br/>
<br/>
The Sakabato also never existed.  It's a creation for the manga.  A <br/>
while ago a custom smith named Rick Barret made it for a customer.  <br/>
However, it was never used by any samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, what that kid goes off about, is a bunch of things I've <br/>
neither heard about let alone believe.<br/>
