<h3>The Real Ikedaya Plot</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-361647215">We all know or think we know about Ikedaya. It's in all the movies,<br/>
after all-- Okita and Kondou burst in, Choshu man comes down the<br/>
stairs, Kondou goes up the stairs, dead Choshu man rolls down, and so<br/>
on. We also think we know the leadup-- Furutaka Shuntaro, posing as a<br/>
merchant, gets taken in, tortured, and confesses.<br/>
<br/>
Here's some things from Oishi Manabu's book "Shinsengumi"-- where he<br/>
makes use of primary sources to put together a composite picture of<br/>
the event. Some of the information contradicts itself, but by putting<br/>
together a multitude of sources, a general idea about what happened<br/>
can be acquired.<br/>
<br/>
But I'd like to talk about the Choshu men's plans. Their intent, as is<br/>
known to those who have seen the movies or read manga like Rurouni<br/>
Kenshin, was to set fire to the city, kill Matsudaira Katamori (the<br/>
lord of Aizu and the Shinsengumi's boss), and kidnap the Emperor and<br/>
rush back to Hagi, Choshu's capital.<br/>
<br/>
However, in the items confiscated after the Shinsengumi raid which<br/>
took in Furutaka, many secret documents were uncovered (Oishi p. 105).<br/>
According to these documents, their plan was to wait for the Gion<br/>
Festival (where many people would crowd the streets), dress as AIZU<br/>
MEN (they even had lanterns with the Aizu crest for this), and wait<br/>
for strong wind and set fire to the imperial palace. They would kidnap<br/>
 the Emperor, kill Nakagawa-no-miya Asahiko (the prince who was<br/>
sympathetic to Aizu and Satsuma at the time) and Matsudaira Katamori<br/>
(who were due for an appearance at the palace), and then take the<br/>
Emperor and flee to Hagi, the Choshu capital. (Oishi, 104)<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to reiterate that point-- they intended to masquerade as AIZU<br/>
men and do this. By doing so, they would not only destroy Aizu's<br/>
credibility as protectors of the peace in Kyoto, but it would also be<br/>
very easy for the fire to spread from the palace, to the surrounding<br/>
nobles' houses, to the city at large. And by masquerading as Aizu men,<br/>
they would be able to go about the city at will, without being questioned.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the whole plan was Choshu's attempt at revenge for their<br/>
loss to Aizu in 1863.(Oishi, 104)<br/>
<br/>
If that were to happen to Aizu, Shinsengumi would have also suffered,<br/>
because they depended on Aizu for their entire livelihood.<br/>
<br/>
However, Shinsengumi, as Aizu's "dirty" tool, struck hard and fast and<br/>
defused the plot in the carnage at Ikedaya.<br/>
<br/>
No one can deny that Ikedaya was a bloodbath. However, it is critical<br/>
that its antecedents and background be closely examined, as well.<br/>
