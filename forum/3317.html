<h3>Best Map for the Fujita Family</h3>

<br/>
the map is absolutely the best (most accurate) map for the Fujita <br/>
family in the Meiji era because it was made before 1923<br/>
<br/>
I do have access to Meiji Era maps however they are entirely in <br/>
Japanese and do not provide visual markers for the locations I would <br/>
need for orientation purposes...they look like EDO ERA MAPS STILL <br/>
(*_*)<br/>
<br/>
1) The Fujitas lived at Masaga-cho (see blue box)<br/>
<br/>
2) The Tokyo Womens Normal School is at Ochanomizu Yushima Bunkyo-ku<br/>
****remember the school moves after the 1923 Earthquake, any map <br/>
after 1923 showing the school location is wrong***<br/>
<br/>
3) Since our recent posts deal with Takamine, I've highlighted his <br/>
home at Otsukakubocho Koishikawa (located near the Men's Normal <br/>
School)<br/>
<br/>
****please notice how close the Fujitas lived to their <br/>
workplace...aside from the philosophy that teaching (or any job <br/>
connected to education) is a personal responsibility and "way of <br/>
life", both Mr and Mrs Fujita had a very strong sense of dedication <br/>
to their jobs because they were so close to the facilities<br/>
<br/>
this is why people shouldn't misinterpret Fujita's helpfulness in <br/>
directing rickshaws at the school as his "primary" job---his real job <br/>
was office work<br/>
<br/>
I worked at a school for many years in various capacities and believe <br/>
me you have to be willing to wear many hats<br/>
<br/>
I hope the map is also helpful for RPGers who want a glimpse into the <br/>
lives of the Fujita family</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902315399">Alright, I'm attempting to post this thing a second time.  Let's <br/>
see.  Here is a map of Fujita's place in Modern time:<br/>

<br/>
I'm not sure exactly where/ which house it is, perhaps someone else <br/>
knows?  <br/>
