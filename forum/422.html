Are you referring to the movie &quot;Kill!&quot; a parody of other famous<br/>
samurai films?  The one in which Tatsuya Nakadai stars and makes fun<br/>
of a bamboo sword (which is critical in the film<br/>
Seppuku/Harakiri)...totally hilarious and I think it was directed by<br/>
Kihachi Okamoto too...geez Sword of Doom! and then Kill! big contrast.</div>

<br/>
Uchiko removes all the old oil and debris from a blade. It&#39;s made by taking a polishing stones and grinding them up. This process shouldn&#39;t be done too often on blades since it&#39;ll dull the polish and mar the details in the metal. Course in the old days this didn&#39;t matter as the upkeep as a weapon mattered more than perservation as a piece of art.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313733795">Uh... well... I&#39;m not sure, but I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m watching.  <br/>
I&#39;m more than a bit confused at the moment --- there is *so* much <br/>
going on in this film and so many crazy connections among <br/>
characters.  Definitely hilarious in spots.  Anyone who likes samurai <br/>
films and spaghetti westerns has gotta love this one!  :-D  It <br/>
repeats later tonight if anyone wants to try to catch it (on IFC).  <br/>
According to Quentin Tarantino (who&#39;s hosting this mini-fest) it&#39;s <br/>
difficult to find and rarely shown.  (BTW, the time period for this <br/>
story is 1833, if anyone is interested.)<br/>

discusses in some detail how swords were cared for (more interested <br/>

<br/>
If these sites don&#39;t have exactly what you&#39;re looking for, just google &quot;Japanese sword care&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for use in the past, I just mainly meant that marring polish of the blade wouldn&#39;t matter as long as the sword stayed free of rust and other gunk. What I mentioned is just what most people go by when caring for blades in the present. There are others that feel otherwise though.  <br/>
<br/>
If were to put myself in the past. I would only uchiko whenever the blade drew blood. If the blade hasn&#39;t seen combat in a while, maybe every month. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps ^_^<br/>
