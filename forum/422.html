Are you referring to the movie "Kill!" a parody of other famous<br/>
samurai films?  The one in which Tatsuya Nakadai stars and makes fun<br/>
of a bamboo sword (which is critical in the film<br/>
Seppuku/Harakiri)...totally hilarious and I think it was directed by<br/>
Kihachi Okamoto too...geez Sword of Doom! and then Kill! big contrast.</div>

<br/>
Uchiko removes all the old oil and debris from a blade. It's made by taking a polishing stones and grinding them up. This process shouldn't be done too often on blades since it'll dull the polish and mar the details in the metal. Course in the old days this didn't matter as the upkeep as a weapon mattered more than perservation as a piece of art.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313733795">Uh... well... I'm not sure, but I think that's what I'm watching.  <br/>
I'm more than a bit confused at the moment --- there is *so* much <br/>
going on in this film and so many crazy connections among <br/>
characters.  Definitely hilarious in spots.  Anyone who likes samurai <br/>
films and spaghetti westerns has gotta love this one!  :-D  It <br/>
repeats later tonight if anyone wants to try to catch it (on IFC).  <br/>
According to Quentin Tarantino (who's hosting this mini-fest) it's <br/>
difficult to find and rarely shown.  (BTW, the time period for this <br/>
story is 1833, if anyone is interested.)<br/>

<br/>
If these sites don't have exactly what you're looking for, just google "Japanese sword care"<br/>
<br/>
As for use in the past, I just mainly meant that marring polish of the blade wouldn't matter as long as the sword stayed free of rust and other gunk. What I mentioned is just what most people go by when caring for blades in the present. There are others that feel otherwise though.  <br/>
<br/>
If were to put myself in the past. I would only uchiko whenever the blade drew blood. If the blade hasn't seen combat in a while, maybe every month. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps ^_^<br/>
