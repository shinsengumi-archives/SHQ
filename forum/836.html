<div id="ygrps-yiv-388870039">Found three books that are translated texts which were designed to <br/>
instruct samurai in various matters. They were in the "Sports" <br/>
section of the bookstore, of all places! LOL! I didn't know being a <br/>
samurai could be considered a "sport"! While you certainly wouldn't <br/>
want to follow ALL of they're suggestions, I suppose some of this <br/>
would be helpful to modern martial artists if for no other reason <br/>
than to help them better understand the history of their sport. <br/>
<br/>
I'll list a brief description of each book, along with the info <br/>
needed to track down a copy for yourself:<br/>
<br/>
Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai by Yamamoto Tsunetomo. Translated <br/>
by William Scott Wilson. Kodansha America, Inc. (First paperback <br/>
edition, 1983. New hard-cover edition, 2002) ISBN# 4-7700-2916-0<br/>
<br/>
This one is more or less a collection of thoughts and very short <br/>
stories that were meant to be used as guidance in making decisions <br/>
that reflected the true spirit of Bushido. Offers good insight into <br/>
the way they viewed the world. Here is a typical example of the sort <br/>
of entries you'll find: "Shame and repentance are like upsetting a <br/>
pot of water. When a certain friend of mine listened to the way that <br/>
a man who had stolen his sword ornament confessed, he felt <br/>
compassion. If one will rectify his mistakes, their traces will soon <br/>
disappear." Then there are others like: "The master took a book from <br/>
its box. When he opened it there was the smell of drying clovebuds."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Life-Giving Sword: Secret Teachings from the House of the Shogun <br/>
(The classic text on Zen and the No-Sword by Musashi's great rival) <br/>
by Yagyu Munenori. Translated by William Scott Wilson. Kodansha <br/>
America, Inc. (First edition, 2003) ISBN# 4-7700-2955-1<br/>
<br/>
This one is a MUST HAVE!!! Gives Great detail on actual sword <br/>
techniques! Plus there are some fantastic isllustrations in the back <br/>
to illustrate a few of them. Some of these drawings show a man <br/>
(persumably Yagyu Munenori) facing off with a tengu! Explains such <br/>
things as No-Mind. (Remember that from The Last Samurai?) Definitely <br/>
worth owning!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Code of the Samurai: A Modern Translation of the Bushido Shoshinshu <br/>
of Taira Shigesuke. Translated by Thomas Cleary. Tuttle Publishing <br/>
(1999). ISBN# 0-8048-3190-4<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A bit more straight-forward guide to samurai behavior than the first <br/>
book. Gives advice on such things as Familial Duty, Horsemanship, <br/>
Facing Death, Vassalage, and Escort. Then there are instructions <br/>
regarding things such as Big Talk and Criticism, Warning Against <br/>
Backbiting (guess Katsura, Okubo, and Saigo missed this one somehow), <br/>
and Lazines.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was one other both on Iai sword-drawing techniques I wish I had <br/>
gotten now. I can't recall the name, but it was from Tuttle and had a <br/>
whole section on seppuku. -sigh- I'll try to find it later. Hopefully <br/>
it will still be there! In the meantime, I'll repost the names of <br/>
these books to the messageboard later.<br/>
