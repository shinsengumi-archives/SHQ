<h3>New film involving the Shinsengumi</h3>
by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645140381">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I do not think that this has been brought to the attention of this ML <br/>
before, I'm sorry if it has. There is a new film featuring our <br/>
favorite boys in blue called: Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage. <br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen it, but from what I can understand it is not a <br/>
strictly historical movie, it's a fiction where Satsuma sends five <br/>
Kunoichi to spy on the Shinsengumi. Apparently, it also involves some <br/>
supernatural events. I'm under the impression that it is not really a <br/>
masterpiece, but if you are interrested, more info can be found here:<br/>

Yeah, plus in a lot of the movies and anime I've watched (especially if they're low-budget translations) cover blurbs have little to do with what actually goes on in the film. Let's not judge it sight unseen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852477144">Thanks for bringing this film to our attention Mary-Ann,<br/>
and as you have correctly assumed, KUNOICHI: DEADLY MIRAGE is NOT a <br/>
masterpiece...<br/>
<br/>
Wounds please add to our Shinsengumi files because it is a good <br/>
example how zombies and Shinsengumi and historical innaccuracy do not <br/>
mix...so this film is "educational" in that sense<br/>
<br/>
Download the screencaps here...(my screencaps are rated-G and does <br/>
not contain the graphic violence towards women shown in the film)<br/>

<br/>
It's soooo BAD...I don't know where to begin<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought there was some potential...kunoichi sneaks into<br/>
Hijikata's room (^_^)...but folks it goes downhill from there <br/>
really...do not rent or buy this film...I mean it isn't even logical <br/>
in its overall bad taste (I highly doubt numerous Shinsengumi would <br/>
run to the gate to see a geisha---as if they've NEVER seen a pretty <br/>
woman before)...film contains violence towards women, nudity, zombies <br/>
with slime,laser beams... and the HIjikata (let's just say he IS NOT <br/>
Koji Yamamoto)...and according to this film we have it all wrong you <br/>
see the Shinsengumi were planning to burn down Kyoto and abduct the <br/>
emperor...had it not been for Okita (who is the ONLY person who sees <br/>
the black cat) and his attraction to Kagerou, the female ninja who <br/>
wears red, then the super secret letter would've been delivered and <br/>
who knows what would've happened....I've seen better films made in <br/>
highschools...even the zombies were aweful...I can't believe it mixes <br/>
GRAPHIC violence with might morphin power ranger effects.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully KUnoichi: Lady Ninja (about Aizu ninja according to the <br/>
cover) is better.<br/>

All right, I take back what I said, after seeing those caps I really wish I *had* judged the film without seeing it 'cause that way I'd not have had the sheer BADNESS of this imprinted on my brain.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No.  It is not.  Trust me, it was probably one of the worst movies I<br/>
have EVER seen.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I did shut it off about halfway through when one of the<br/>
kunoichi started shooting "death lasers" out of her breasts,<br/>
so...heck, maybe the ending was better than the first half.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I am not quite sure I understand why the hero had to deflower<br/>
the virgin kunoichi (while being shot at with arrows) in order to be<br/>
able to get them out of the Strange Pit Of Destruction which the Bad<br/>
Guy Who Had Been Abducting Brides had in the middle of his living<br/>
room...for no apparent reason.  So, if you watch Kunoichi: Lady Ninja,<br/>
and feel you can explain that part to me, I would appreciate it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I understood that part, sadly, it's so gross I will not post <br/>
my explanation...just watch -where- the hero places his sword after <br/>
the deflowering (it's a split second)...the result of which allows <br/>
his sword to cut through anything... even though the Phoenix magic <br/>
released is what saves them as it sets fire to the jug of oil which <br/>
was thrown at them.<br/>
<br/>
Other kunoichi magic requires the heroine to assume highly suggestive <br/>
poses.<br/>
<br/>
The BAD GUY is the lord of Aizu who also happens to be the sex fiend.<br/>
I believe that Aizu's Board of Tourism gave the greenlight to this <br/>
film...the entire 2nd half of the film was filmed on location very <br/>
often against the base of the castle, or along one of the beautiful <br/>
ston pathways and contains good shots of the castle...in one cliff <br/>
hanger (literally) you get to see a shot of one of many entrances to <br/>
the domain...it looks smaller than the one which was the site of the <br/>
Bonari Pass in one of the major battles during Boshin (we see this <br/>
pic alot on Shinsengumi related sites)<br/>
here is a nice screencap<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/AIZUaerial.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/AIZUaerial.jpg</a><br/>
the movie even advertises "Edo has its pleasures so does Aizu" cuts <br/>
to a studio recreation of the hot springs complete with a bunch of <br/>
naked women...in fact the film uses every excuse possible to exploit <br/>
women.<br/>
<br/>
The pattern is, any movie with "kunoichi" in the title is AWEFUL.</div>

not exactly a masterpiece, in case someone actually enjoyed that <br/>
movie...<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine had seen that movie in a DVD store and I've been <br/>
wondering if I should go buy it or not. I now know that that movie is <br/>
going to stay right on its shelve.<br/>

sense of humor, though.  The jitsu must be seen to be believed. <br/>
Tit-fu!  Reverse-fart-fu!  Nun-fu!  And as an added bonus, a flying<br/>
Tokugawa princess!  (er, that's how it was translated.  I'm wondering<br/>
if she was supposed to be a kami of some sort?)  Also: witness the<br/>
amazing sexual attraction-power of the legendary Yagyu Jubei!  *shakes<br/>
head*  Boy, that guy got around!<br/>
<br/>
The Aizu are the bad guys in this film, btw, doing things like raiding<br/>
convents and slaughtering nuns.<br/>
<br/>
Going back to lurking now.<br/>
