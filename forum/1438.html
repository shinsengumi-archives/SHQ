<h3>About adoption in Japan</h3>
by <i>tamagot93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940335964">I understand that many people are perplexed with the question of adoption in <br/>
Japan in the past.<br/>
Certainly blood relation is important for us, if so we wonder why so many <br/>
adoption cases?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve seen NHK drama, you can remember Isami&#39;s mother-in-law talking that <br/>
 Isami was adoptive son for Kondo family as well as his father-in-law. <br/>
Therefore none of Isami, his father and mother-in-law have blood relation with <br/>
original Kondo family!<br/>
And again, recently in the drama, Isami adopted another stranger for the <br/>
family, the youngest brother of Tani bros. as the heir of Kondo family, because he <br/>
hasn&#39;t a son yet and Tani are distinguished family.<br/>
It seems strange, no? But it doesn&#39;t mean Kondo family case was special nor <br/>
it was invention of scriptwriter.<br/>
<br/>
It can be explained just in earlier Japan, the family name was considered <br/>
more important than blood relation, especially in some important family.<br/>
Family name means every property, function, duties, and rights attached to <br/>
the family.<br/>
And at that time as only male successor is considered as heir of the family, <br/>
having no son means extinction of the family. Extinction of the family name <br/>
was something very painful and humiliating thing for the people of that period. <br/>
We can understand that mentality as the extinction of family has been the <br/>
most important punishment for Daimyo or Hatamoto during Edo period.<br/>
<br/>
Adoption has been also a method of social promotion for rich farmer or <br/>
merchant family.<br/>
There were different forms of adoption; adopting a child of certain family as <br/>
the heir, or taking the husband of the daughter as adoptive son. The latter <br/>
one means the husband takes the name of his wife&#39;s family and this practice is <br/>
always done in certain family even now.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning Numazawa family, as this family has been the chief retainer of <br/>
Aizu,it was important for  Numazawa Kohachiroo to maintain the family name. <br/>
And if they&#39;ve kept the secret, I think that they just wanted to raise Tatsuo <br/>
as their own son as he was a baby, for son&#39;s happiness.<br/>
(Because if they adopted a grown son like Isami, naturally there is no <br/>
secret.)<br/>
For Fujita&#39;s side, I think they gave the son for the solidarity of the <br/>
relatives and respect for the Aizu clan.<br/>
<br/>
In fact our mentality has been changed so much since after WW2, and we became <br/>
more than more individual, and such adoption is now considered as something <br/>
special. <br/>
Although my family isn&#39;t an important one, I have also some adoption cases <br/>
within my relatives, until at the time of my grand parents, so this kind of <br/>
practice is not so shocking for me, thinking the context of the period.<br/>
<br/>
May be I talked too much!<br/>
 I&#39;ll keep post for the Saito&#39;s possibly new photo.<br/>

Wait a minute?! You mean it was the other family that did the adopting?! Not <br/>
Saito?!<br/>

I think now I understand the reason of confusion.<br/>
Yes, Tatsuo was the child of Tokio and Goro, adopted by Numazawa family soon <br/>
after birth. That&#39;s why Tatsuo didn&#39;t know his real parents were Fujita until <br/>
he became teenager.<br/>

angry. There was a discussion about this a few months ago but back <br/>
then it was agreed that Tatsuo was adopted INTO the Fujita <br/>
household.. But back then it didn&#39;t make sense to me because he <br/>
wasn&#39;t in the record and his last name was different than FUjita.<br/>

and she turned me into the reason that they gave their last son away <br/>
or had their last son because that Aizu retainer needed to continue <br/>
their family name. Although I did not really agree with her because I <br/>
found the reason a bit unacceptable in my point of view, being an <br/>

Which leads me to wonder how exactly did Tatsuo react after <br/>
accidentally learning of that fact. I seem to remember this was <br/>
discussed several months ago, he was pretty angry at the situation. <br/>
So maybe Tokio wrote him a letter to apologize? Did she realize that <br/>
her child&#39;s life wasn&#39;t theirs to do as they wish? I know a number <br/>
won&#39;t agree with me since as Phil pointed out, I&#39;m applying 20th <br/>
century values to the Meiji... But even if we don&#39;t speak about <br/>
values, let&#39;s just go through a normal person&#39;s psyche, Tatsuo&#39;s <br/>
reaction is not surprising as basically he would see himself not <br/>

<h3>Re: [SHQ] Re: About adoption in Japan</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-146017112">Just to clarify since my name has been brought up, when I spoke of not applying 20th century values to Meiji thinking, I was referring to the Fujitas&#39; decision to either have the child purposely to help the other family survive or to allow the family to adopt their much younger third son... not to how Tatsuo might have felt.  Though the practice of surrogating has always been around and continues to this day, I don&#39;t think people have as much contact with it as they do adoption in general and it may be difficult to accept how a couple could purposely produce or relinquish a child, especially when part of the driving force is loyalty to something as broad as keeping Aizu strong.  And as difficult as it seems to fathom how a woman could do what Tokio did (and others have done, before and since), she may have cared for this relative of hers and felt both blessed and honored that she could do this for her as well as an Aizu family.  Of course she felt something... those 9 months do<br/>
 something to you... but from everything I&#39;ve learned about Tokio on this list, this was a very strong woman with a loyalty to her homeland as strong as her husband&#39;s and an ability to live a life of her own instead of simply through her husband and children.<br/>
 <br/>
What I&#39;m curious about is why Tatsuo was upset about the news... upset with his adoptive family or with the Fujitas?  Or the relative who spilled the beans and changed his perceptions of himself?<br/>

thing over IM yesterday a quick Google search pointed out that the <br/>
name/word Numazawa is _very_ prominent in the Aizu-Wakumatsu  area in <br/>
terms of many thngs/places carrying the name so we decided--assummed <br/>
that the family may have been quite important in terms of the history of <br/>
Aizu and that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t want to fade away.Can&#39;&#39;t have a village <br/>
of Numazawa without any live Numazawas to lord over it now can you *grin*<br/>

As I said this is _All conjecture_ from two active imaginations However <br/>
it makes perfect sense in terms of the ever -loyal Fujitas being willing <br/>
to give up a son &quot;for the cause/clan&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496786721">Things to consider....<br/>
<br/>
If you all check out the nifty translation of the 1to5.net <br/>
translation it mentions Numazawa and S.H. (under his other name <br/>
Denpachi Ichinohe)....what if the Numazawa&#39;s came into contact with <br/>
S.H. during the exile?<br/>
<br/>
The Numazawa&#39;s were Tokio&#39;s (distant) relatives...they didn&#39;t <br/>
exactly give away their son to complete strangers.<br/>
<br/>
How did their 2 older sons think of their parents.  They probably <br/>
wondered &quot;mom and dad gave away our brother&quot; this is something that <br/>
they would remember their whole lives. It is possible that the boys <br/>
were clueless (this secret may have been kept from them), but from <br/>
their ages, I think they could guess that something was very wrong.<br/>
<br/>
How did Tokio and Goro handle questions from co-workers?  Although <br/>
the Queen of Conspiracies, Mistress of Mysteries, the Chief to <br/>
SHQ.com has come up with infinite ways in which the pregnancy can be <br/>
hidden by having Tokio live with the Numazawas before and after <br/>
giving birth, the QUESTION REMAINS the Numazawas had to know of the <br/>
pregnancy through family channels and I think that externally the <br/>
pregnancy was obvious to anyone who may have seen Tokio. BUT what if <br/>
she was the rare woman who&#39;s pregnancy didn&#39;t &quot;show&quot; much.<br/>
<br/>
The Numazawa&#39;s may be asking for payback for &quot;something&quot;.  Asking <br/>
for a family&#39;s child is not the same as asking for money, a car or <br/>
favor.  The Numazawa&#39;s had to be 99.9% that the Fujitas would <br/>
say &quot;yes&quot;.  Think, were the Fujita&#39;s in a position to say &quot;no&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I believe that Tokio&#39;s letter to Tatsuo 1 month before Fujita Goro <br/>
died may have been an attempt to explain things to Tatsuo and more <br/>
importantly allow F.G. to get things off his chest before he died.  <br/>
In fact, what if both parents decided that after all one was dying <br/>
might as well atleast attempt to clear things up and settle secrets.<br/>
<br/>
Tatsuo&#39;s tears are to be expected.  His aunt&#39;s words basically <br/>
turned his world upside down and he had HIS OWN SUSPICIONS, that is <br/>
why he asked...people may have treated him differently and so <br/>
forth.  My question is did he come into contact with the Fujitas <br/>
every once in a while during family gatherings and so forth?  <br/>
Tokio+Goro would have atleast wanted to see their son from [afar] <br/>
and both would be careful not to do anything which would jeopardize <br/>
Tatsuo&#39;s position in the Numazawa family.  Both parents would engage <br/>
in the &quot;blame game&quot;, imagine their long talks and attempt to avoid <br/>
conversations which may lead to the 3rd son. I would think F.G. <br/>
would&#39;ve made the decision but they were related to Tokio,they would <br/>
relive over and over the decision and harbor their own doubts and <br/>
wonder &quot;how is our Tatsuo doing?&quot;  The adopting out of Tatsuo any <br/>
way you look at it was a like a lifelong cloud of sorrow which would <br/>
hang over Tokio&#39;s conscience.  I do not see either parents as <br/>
shopping around and looking for a family to take their son once the <br/>
pregnancy was apparent...I think the Numazawa&#39;s made a request that <br/>
they had to fulfill and I don&#39;t think simple loyalty was the ONLY <br/>
REASON.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they lived in a different culture and different time period.  <br/>
However, the human heart has not changed much.  Culture and society <br/>
can help them to try to rationalize their actions to themselves but <br/>
the bottom line is that a mother&#39;s instinct is to grieve the loss of <br/>
her child...it was a peculiar situation and in their early 40s, <br/>
Fujita Goro was a chief inspector and Tokio was well placed in her <br/>
career both would have been financially able to raise another boy.<br/>
No husband/father can understand the heart of a mother and Tokio <br/>
would have to grieve alone...I actually imagine Fujita Goro <br/>
concentrating more and more on work to the point he would lose <br/>
himself in it.</div>
