<h3>Toba-Fushimi depiction</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985017089">Ran across this today and am now completely confused. I am guessing <br/>
this is a modern depiction of the battle? But why do they 1) have the <br/>
Shinsengumi armed with rifles? and 2) Put the makoto symbol on the <br/>
back of their haori?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the symbol is just meant to identify them? But I am just not <br/>
understanding about the guns...<br/>
