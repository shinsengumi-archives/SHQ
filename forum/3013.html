<h3>Saitou Speaks at the Fall of Aizu</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-938174071">There are many out there, such as self-proclaimed authority Romulus <br/>
Hillsborough, to whom the story of Shinsengumi after Kondou Isami's death is <br/>
meaningless. However, the fact of the matter, as we know, is that <br/>
Shinsengumi, as an organization, survived until mid-1869, when its last <br/>
survivors, under the nominal command of Soma Kazue, surrendered together <br/>
with Nagai Genba-no-Kami Naoyuki's forces at Benten Daiba, in Hakodate.<br/>
<br/>
One of the "forgotten" elements of this ignored history is Saitou Hajime's <br/>
period in command of the Shinsengumi, during the Aizu Theater of the Boshin <br/>
War.<br/>
<br/>
By the latter part of the 8th month of Meiji 1, Aizu was surrounded, and the <br/>
month-long siege had begun. At this time, the former Shogunate army under <br/>
Otori Keisuke abandoned Aizu, heading for Sendai. This force could have been <br/>
put to good use in defending Aizu, however, its commander considered <br/>
withdrawal the better course of action. Despite this, the fact remains that <br/>
by doing so he probably did as much to hasten Aizu's fall as Itagaki <br/>
Taisuke's lightning-strike through Bonari Pass did.<br/>
<br/>
When Saitou Hajime heard of Otori's army having left Aizu, he spoke, and <br/>
spoke harshly. For a man of little words, the following ones, as recorded in <br/>
the diary of Taniguchi Shirobei, a Kuwana-han retainer turned Shinsengumi <br/>
samurai (picture is here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin3/sirobei.jpg)">http://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin3/sirobei.jpg)</a>, are <br/>
powerful. Remember, Saitou and the Shinsengumi had just fought a long and <br/>
brutal battle at Bonari Pass in order to defend the people of Aizu, and had <br/>
barely managed to escape with their lives. Listen to what the taciturn <br/>
warrior has to say about Otori's army:<br/>
<br/>
"If they are really our allies, then they should come back to Aizu and <br/>
help-- and then we wouldn't have to see the castle about to fall like this. <br/>
For our so-called comrades to run like this is unjust!"<br/>
<br/>
(cited from: Ito Tetsuya, "Saitou Hajime Nenfu". pp. 223-243 of "Saitou <br/>
Hajime no Subete". Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 2003, p. 236)<br/>
<br/>
The fall of the castle was still a month away, but in many people's eyes the <br/>
fate of Aizu was already sealed...<br/>
<br/>
Definitely words to think about.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Saitou Hajime and What it Means to Lose a Name</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-345708255">When one considers the price of war, it is often all too easy to get caught <br/>
up in the details. "Heroes" loom large, facts get distorted, and in the <br/>
earnest quest for "truth," one can easily get sidetracked. I'd like to bring <br/>
up another fact that is important for all of us who have an interest in <br/>
Shinsengumi or the period at large.<br/>
<br/>
Following the fall of Aizu, Saitou Hajime, who had tried to get into Aizu <br/>
Castle, was with Aizu senior retainer Sagawa Kanbei, fighting on in <br/>
Minami-Aizu, south of the domain capital of Wakamatsu. Aizu military affairs <br/>
magistrate Asabane Tadanosuke was sent to Sagawa's men, and informed them <br/>
that the battle was over. Saitou and the men who had fought outside Aizu <br/>
Castle during the siege were rounded up and taken to an internment camp in <br/>
Shiokawa. They remained there until the beginning of the following year, <br/>
when it was decided they were to be sent to Takada, in Echigo Province, for <br/>
incarceration. The group stopped by Amida-ji in Aizu to pray for safety <br/>
before embarking. Saitou had fought in that area, in the time leading up to <br/>
and during the siege, and this must have affected him. On the 5th, the group <br/>
was separated into six units, and after some time they arrived in Takada.<br/>
<br/>
They were to remain in Takada until the 9th month, and it was in reference <br/>
to the 2nd day of the 9th month that scholar Ito Tetsuya notes something <br/>
curious: "[On this day], the Meiji Government permits the prisoners to use <br/>
surnames and wear swords." (from-- Itou Tetsuya, "Saitou Hajime Nenfu", <br/>
appearing pp. 223-243 of "Saitou Hajime no Subete". Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu <br/>
Oraisha, 2003, p. 237)<br/>
<br/>
The new government granting permission to have surnames and wear swords <br/>
implies that these men, who were samurai and *born* with that right, had <br/>
been deprived of it after the surrender, since they were viewed as <br/>
criminals. (A pardon was issued hard on the heels of this announcement, on <br/>
the 28th of the 9th month)<br/>
<br/>
Our beloved Saitou Hajime obviously had a name-- Ichinohe Denpachi. The Aizu <br/>
men interacting with each other, men who in many cases knew each other since <br/>
childhood, obviously still had to have called each other by their names. But <br/>
legally, and in the eyes of the country, Saitou Hajime, and his Aizu <br/>
friends, were nameless, faceless, and without any clearly defined position <br/>
in society. The best way that it can be described is if a group of people <br/>
were treated like burned-out lightbulbs and thrown into a box for nine <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder...can any of us in this modern world of rights and privileges <br/>
imagine what it must have been like, to have no name and no place in <br/>
society? Can we imagine how heart-wrenching it might have been?<br/>
<br/>
Once again, something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
-M.<br/>

<h3>Re: Saitou Speaks at the Fall of Aizu</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-979968404">Saitou says (continued)<br/>
<br/>
all of the info below is unlike what Hirotada Tokugawa posted, <br/>
because in that case...Saitou's words were recorded in a diary<br/>
<br/>
these words are noted from word of mouth and are probably not "exact" <br/>
but close enough:<br/>
<br/>
1) Saitou liked to lament the evils of the times (during the Meiji <br/>
Era) with various friends and relatives<br/>
<br/>
2) "Tie your sash tightly: don't leave it loose and untidy!" <br/>
<br/>
3) "When you draw your sword with the intent to kill, don't waste <br/>
your time posturing like in kenjutsu. Just kill your enemy on the <br/>
spot."<br/>
[or]<br/>
"When you actually fight somebody with a real sword, never mind about <br/>
taking a correct<br/>
posture as you would in your fencing trainings; you just have to go <br/>
forward holding your sword up high. Then the next moment you'd find <br/>
your oppenent collapsed on the ground.")<br/>
<br/>
4)"I want my bones to be buried next to the [mass?] grave of the men <br/>
who died at Amida-ji in the Aizu Boshin War"<br/>
<br/>
** he also said he didn't want a Buddhist posthumous name<br/>
<br/>
5) Saitou tells Yamakawa Kenjiro about the Tenmaya incident ""In a <br/>
real fight with real swords, people cannot think how to knock down <br/>
their enemy. We just fight off one's head (react---do not "think"). <br/>
While I [Saitou] rampaged around in this evening as in the usual <br/>
fight, one of enemies said, `he is wearing something. Don't cut him, <br/>
but thrust with sword.' Therefore, I thought if they started to <br/>
thrust me with sword, I would wait for it.""<br/>
<br/>
Saitou spoke to many friends and relatives and we have descriptions <br/>
of Fujita Goro from those people.<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
Ofcourse we all know he often asked [this is pure fiction]<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro "Tokio?---where is the detergent I need to wash my <br/>
fundoshi"<br/>
<br/>
Goro shuffles around an empty house looking for his absent wife.<br/>
<br/>
:: PANIC ::<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro :: thinking :: "this ruins my day, I can't do anything <br/>
without first washing my fundoshi, patting it down and hanging it up <br/>
neatly, then I take my tea and check in at work and then have lunch, <br/>
then I come home and change and bring in my dried fundoshi..."<br/>
<br/>
obsessive compulsive disorder is also a recurring characteristic of <br/>
people with gastric ulcers---if their daily routine is changed <br/>
*suddenly---it usually upsets them considerably<br/>
