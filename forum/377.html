<h3>Sasaki Tadasaburo</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-281213208">Well I was doing a little research on the Mimawarigumi... There's <br/>
really not much info about them... I did come across another <br/>
interesting rumor from a livejournal somewhere (can't remember right <br/>
now)... Saitou seems to be related by blood to Mr. Sasaki? I know.. I <br/>
know... All I ever bring to the tables are rumors, just like that <br/>
other woman of Saitou-sama... But really? This just sparked my <br/>
interest because, Saitou joined the Shinsengumi why did he not join <br/>
the Mimawarigumi? If he was related to Mr. Sasaki, wouldn't it have <br/>
been easy? Or was it because his father was a Ronin that it would be <br/>
preposterous for him to join the other patrol group who were composed <br/>
of "higher blood/lineage/ etc".<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
By the way... You can find more photos on the shinsengumi and <br/>
Sasaki's grave at this site...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208518198">forgot to mention...the Shinsengumi overshadowed other groups not only<br/>
because of Ikedaya but because their [rules] were the most<br/>
strict~seppuku*...maybe Saitou felt that the Shinsengumi were as<br/>
samurai as you can get...by imposing seppuku they weren't just all<br/>
"talk" (however I don't ~think~ they had time to chase after deserters)<br/>
<br/>
*seppuku (the history of seppuku is interesting it goes in and out of<br/>
"fashion" and the revolution allowed for a climate of ruthlessness and<br/>
intense nostalgia) its like they understood perfectly that they could<br/>
be the last members of their way of life.<br/>

Wait... I'm confused.  Do we know that Saitou was related to Sasaki?  <br/>
I thought it was still a "rumor" he was related to "someone" within <br/>
the Mimawarigumi...<br/>
<br/>
And where does the info that Saitou's father was a ronin come from???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644625509">I really should stop talking about rumors like they were real. I was <br/>
merely speculating if he was related then why not the other group. <br/>
<br/>
As for his father being a ronin, it was also a rumor (I really should <br/>
stop doing this). I read somewhere that Saitou's origins were obscure <br/>
and there are several theories like he was a son of a ronin, or son <br/>
of a bakufu official or son of the 12th shogun (highly doubt). I <br/>
don't really know which is true. Do you know what is definite? Thanks.<br/>

<h3>Sasaki Tadasaburo / Saitou connection?</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003922471">That name has been haunting me all day and now I know why!  I've been <br/>
watching the last few episodes of the NHK Shinsengumi (un subtitled <br/>
*sigh*) and I came into it when Kondou was trying to get in with the <br/>
Roshigumi that was forming to  head to Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
A bit ago I was looking at the characters' pictures on the NHK website <br/>
trying to figure out who this kid is that Nagakura keeps having words <br/>
with, and while clicking through the name banners to find said kid I <br/>
clicked on the pic of the actor playing  Sasaki Tadasaburo and the <br/>
proverbial light bulb went off over my head, <br/>
<br/>
He's one of the two main leaders of the Roshigumi! He and Serizawa Kamo <br/>
have a serious dislike for one another and he and the other top guy in <br/>
the Roshigumi (names escapes me) are always at odds.<br/>
<br/>
According to the previews at the end of last week's show Saitou finally <br/>
hits Kyoto so maybe we'll see the connection?  I will do my best to <br/>
decipher something from the body language/facial expressions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sasaki comes across to me as a guy who has some definite ideas of <br/>
exactly how he wants things done and when. Sort of the type to say "When <br/>
I say 'Jump!' you ask how high."<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They were the group of 200 or so samurai who joined up to go to Kyoto to <br/>
help the Shogunate quell the unrest/violence. The one backing/paying <br/>
them I believe was a Matsudaira can't-remember-just-now (not Katamori, <br/>
his father or grandfather)<br/>
<br/>
Kiyokawa, the guy Sasaki is always pissed at just last week on the show <br/>
tried to slip past everyone in the rules and regulations that they are <br/>
not working for the Shogunate but "supporting the Emperor" i.e.siding <br/>
with the Choshu rebels. The bookish/smarmy Yamanami has caught this bit <br/>
of fine print and went to Sasaki with it and that's pretty much where it <br/>
left off. The synopsis for this week says:<br/>
<br/>
<<Since Hachiro Kiyokawa’s plan to make Roshigumi serve for the Imperial <br/>
Court, instead of the Shogunate is revealed, the leaders of Roshigumi, <br/>
including Tadasaburo Sasaki decides to take the members back to Edo. <br/>
........ Keisuke Yamanami brings news that Roshigumi will be sent back <br/>
to Edo. Toshizo Hijikata suggests Isami to form another Roshigumi group <br/>
to stay in Kyoto. >><br/>

There's a cool little side story where the daughter of the Yagi's (where <br/>
Kondou & Kamo's groups are staying has to disguise herself as a boy so <br/>
as not to draw attention from the miscreants invading their home. Kondou <br/>
& Hijikata come upon her and apparently make comments about her being <br/>
pretty puny to wield a sword. They mention the Tennen Rishin style and <br/>
I'm guessing they said "We'll teach it to you and make a man out of <br/>
you!" The poor girl runs crying to her mother the minute the guys walk <br/>
away. It was hilarious to see the girl's look of terror as they're <br/>
lifting her arms,squeezing her muscles, adjusting the sword she's <br/>
carrying in her belt.<br/>
<br/>
<<I really envy that you get to see this NHK drama... Over here in the <br/>
midwest, absolutely NOTHING. :O(>><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I dropped the local cable service and signed up for Dish Network <br/>
satellite because they offer TV Japan for an additional $25 a month. Of <br/>
course it's not like I'm obsessed or anything..................<br/>

 </span></blockquote> They probably won�t go into this in the series, but<br/>
when the Roshigumi split, and most went back to Edo,<br/>
those that went back were going to be used if a<br/>
possible war broke out with England in Edo. It never<br/>
did of course, but those members were to become the<br/>
Shinchogumi (Newly Formed Group). When Kiyokawa and<br/>
the men reached Edo they started stirring up trouble<br/>
in the city. <br/>
 With the news of a possible insurrection against the<br/>
government and Kiyokawa became known as part of the<br/>
plot a hit was put out on him. He was killed on April<br/>
13, 1963 (I would say yesterday was the anniversary,<br/>
but I think that date is using the other calendar).<br/>
Anyways, the government then rounded up and imprisoned<br/>
the bad members of the group and those still around<br/>
became the Shinchogumi. I don�t know anything about<br/>
Tadasaburo Sasaki's role in even of this though.<br/>
<br/>
 I take it that in the tv series that it will be the<br/>
end of episode 16 and then in episode 17 that Kondo<br/>
and company become the Shinsengumi. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206979667">Wow! Such wealth of info... This is really great... So I take it the <br/>
Roshigumi was formed before the Shinsengumi and that some members of <br/>
this group who stayed in Kyoto joined both the Shinsengumi and <br/>
Mimawarigumi. Sugoi!<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... I wonder how modern Japan thinks of Sasaki? Either way, it's <br/>
good to know that's how he is, all the better.<br/>
<br/>
The story about the girl, hilarious! I'm wondering though if they <br/>
ever saw through the disguise. I hope they didn't because, I don't <br/>
know I'd think it'd be mean for them to do that and I always had this <br/>
vision of them being galant. :O)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the info... Really appreciate it! Ja ne!<br/>

Is there anyway that I can get those episodes from you? I'd be <br/>
willing to pay for the shipping, tape, and whatever extra for your <br/>
trouble. Since the series is ongoing, I'm pretty sure it will be a <br/>
recurring transaction until it's done. I'd prefer to get 3 episodes <br/>
at a time to encode. Then from here I'd encode it and post it for <br/>
download via FTP or another hosting service for the group.<br/>

 If you have access to binaries there is a guy uploading a SVCD <br/>
version in the alt.binaries.multimedia.japanese.<br/>
<br/>
 I collect these type of samurai movies and TV series so I am doing <br/>
the full DVD-R conversion for myself to watch on stand alone players. <br/>
Anyone can get that from me, but due to size it isn't really suitable <br/>
for ftp downloading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856062630">Thanks for bringing that to my attention. Actually someone is now <br/>
helping me get this series (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND THANK YOU VERY <br/>
MUCH ^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I've bookmarked the site though. I've missed a lot of post when I <br/>
went on vacation, so I really appreciate that you brought this to my <br/>
attention... Arigatou!<br/>
