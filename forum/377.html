<h3>Sasaki Tadasaburo</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-281213208">Well I was doing a little research on the Mimawarigumi... There&#39;s <br/>
really not much info about them... I did come across another <br/>
interesting rumor from a livejournal somewhere (can&#39;t remember right <br/>
now)... Saitou seems to be related by blood to Mr. Sasaki? I know.. I <br/>
know... All I ever bring to the tables are rumors, just like that <br/>
other woman of Saitou-sama... But really? This just sparked my <br/>
interest because, Saitou joined the Shinsengumi why did he not join <br/>
the Mimawarigumi? If he was related to Mr. Sasaki, wouldn&#39;t it have <br/>
been easy? Or was it because his father was a Ronin that it would be <br/>
preposterous for him to join the other patrol group who were composed <br/>
of &quot;higher blood/lineage/ etc&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
By the way... You can find more photos on the shinsengumi and <br/>
Sasaki&#39;s grave at this site...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208518198">forgot to mention...the Shinsengumi overshadowed other groups not only<br/>
because of Ikedaya but because their [rules] were the most<br/>
strict~seppuku*...maybe Saitou felt that the Shinsengumi were as<br/>
samurai as you can get...by imposing seppuku they weren&#39;t just all<br/>
&quot;talk&quot; (however I don&#39;t ~think~ they had time to chase after deserters)<br/>
<br/>
*seppuku (the history of seppuku is interesting it goes in and out of<br/>
&quot;fashion&quot; and the revolution allowed for a climate of ruthlessness and<br/>
intense nostalgia) its like they understood perfectly that they could<br/>
be the last members of their way of life.<br/>

I thought it was still a &quot;rumor&quot; he was related to &quot;someone&quot; within <br/>

As for his father being a ronin, it was also a rumor (I really should <br/>
stop doing this). I read somewhere that Saitou&#39;s origins were obscure <br/>
and there are several theories like he was a son of a ronin, or son <br/>
of a bakufu official or son of the 12th shogun (highly doubt). I <br/>
don&#39;t really know which is true. Do you know what is definite? Thanks.<br/>

There&#39;s a cool little side story where the daughter of the Yagi&#39;s (where <br/>
Kondou & Kamo&#39;s groups are staying has to disguise herself as a boy so <br/>
as not to draw attention from the miscreants invading their home. Kondou <br/>
& Hijikata come upon her and apparently make comments about her being <br/>
pretty puny to wield a sword. They mention the Tennen Rishin style and <br/>
I&#39;m guessing they said &quot;We&#39;ll teach it to you and make a man out of <br/>
you!&quot; The poor girl runs crying to her mother the minute the guys walk <br/>
away. It was hilarious to see the girl&#39;s look of terror as they&#39;re <br/>
lifting her arms,squeezing her muscles, adjusting the sword she&#39;s <br/>
carrying in her belt.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really envy that you get to see this NHK drama... Over here in the <br/>
midwest, absolutely NOTHING. :O(&gt;&gt;<br/>

I dropped the local cable service and signed up for Dish Network <br/>

 </span></blockquote> They probably won�t go into this in the series, but<br/>
when the Roshigumi split, and most went back to Edo,<br/>
those that went back were going to be used if a<br/>
possible war broke out with England in Edo. It never<br/>
did of course, but those members were to become the<br/>
Shinchogumi (Newly Formed Group). When Kiyokawa and<br/>
the men reached Edo they started stirring up trouble<br/>
in the city. <br/>
 With the news of a possible insurrection against the<br/>
government and Kiyokawa became known as part of the<br/>
plot a hit was put out on him. He was killed on April<br/>
13, 1963 (I would say yesterday was the anniversary,<br/>
but I think that date is using the other calendar).<br/>
Anyways, the government then rounded up and imprisoned<br/>
the bad members of the group and those still around<br/>
became the Shinchogumi. I don�t know anything about<br/>
Tadasaburo Sasaki&#39;s role in even of this though.<br/>
<br/>
 I take it that in the tv series that it will be the<br/>
end of episode 16 and then in episode 17 that Kondo<br/>
and company become the Shinsengumi. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206979667">Wow! Such wealth of info... This is really great... So I take it the <br/>
Roshigumi was formed before the Shinsengumi and that some members of <br/>
this group who stayed in Kyoto joined both the Shinsengumi and <br/>
Mimawarigumi. Sugoi!<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... I wonder how modern Japan thinks of Sasaki? Either way, it&#39;s <br/>
good to know that&#39;s how he is, all the better.<br/>
<br/>
The story about the girl, hilarious! I&#39;m wondering though if they <br/>
ever saw through the disguise. I hope they didn&#39;t because, I don&#39;t <br/>
know I&#39;d think it&#39;d be mean for them to do that and I always had this <br/>
vision of them being galant. :O)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the info... Really appreciate it! Ja ne!<br/>

&gt; More than likely it is. The station I tape it off of<br/>
&gt; is KSCI channel 18 in southern CA, but it is not an<br/>
&gt; NHK station. KSCI has a variety of different asian<br/>
&gt; programs so it is probably the same type of thing in<br/>
&gt; your area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163256425">To those who are taping the series... Is there anyway you can encode <br/>
and post those up for download? If not...<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway that I can get those episodes from you? I&#39;d be <br/>
willing to pay for the shipping, tape, and whatever extra for your <br/>
trouble. Since the series is ongoing, I&#39;m pretty sure it will be a <br/>
recurring transaction until it&#39;s done. I&#39;d prefer to get 3 episodes <br/>
at a time to encode. Then from here I&#39;d encode it and post it for <br/>
download via FTP or another hosting service for the group.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is kind enough to do this... Please let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Oh.. If only I had cable/satellite... Alas! I am but a poor girl.. ^_^<br/>
