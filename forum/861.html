<h3>Momoiro-Usagi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361565086">I -think- Momoiro-Usagi will join <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>
I invited him/her for the chat session and momoiro missed it only <br/>
because of a prior engagement.  Anyways I keep telling her/him to <br/>
join.<br/>
<br/>
****so if we pose questions regarding translations and what not on <br/>
shinsengumimb.com try to be clear because momoiro keeps saying that <br/>
he/she is happy to help...the problem is momoiro has NO IDEA what <br/>
she's getting into....<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time to edit and some stuff we know but momoiro's <br/>
opinions are pretty neat.<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
[I mentioned Sagara, Phil]<br/>
<br/>
In Japan, although Saigou, Okubo, and Katsura are famous, almost all <br/>
men do not know Sagara. <br/>
Of course, RK made him famous partly. However, for most Japanese, he <br/>
is obscurity.<br/>
I got to know him with the book which I read by chance at the time <br/>
of a high school student. <br/>
I thought that it was a very merciless talk. <br/>
 <br/>
In Japan, the style of a text has changed to Meiji Era considerably. <br/>
Furthermore, the text style has changed also after WW2. <br/>
Japanese people cannot read the text of the Edo period in many <br/>
cases, either. Please do your best, although I think that there are <br/>
many Japanese sites which cannot be translated.<br/>
 <br/>
[mentioned Romulus Hillsborough's previous work and future book on <br/>
the Shinsengumi]<br/>
I read a part of the site. <br/>
Is "RYOMA-Life of a Renaissance Samurai" a novel? <br/>
It seems to be interesting as long as I look at a reviews. <br/>
Is it Shinsengumi which assassinated Ryoma with this book? The <br/>
review has said it. <br/>
The culprit who assassinated Ryoma is still unknown. <br/>
Surely, there is an opinion which makes Shinsengumi a culprit. <br/>
However, opinion that Sasaki Tadasaburou of Mimawarigumi <br/>
assassinated is leading now. But this is testimony of the friend who <br/>
was Mimawarigumi, after Sasaki dies. This testimony has many opaque <br/>
portions and Saigou Takamori is related. Therefore, there is an <br/>
opinion of a true culprit in Saigou. The fact does not clarify <br/>
<br/>
[The Last Samurai]<br/>
I was surprised very much by TLS. I think that many Japanese were <br/>
surprised. TLS was wonderful Jidaigeki although there were many <br/>
mistakes and strange scenes. Can the present Japanese movie make the <br/>
movie which tells Bushido as wonderfully as TLS? <br/>
It cannot reply to me. "Twilight Samurai" was a long run in Japan. <br/>
However, I do not so like it. <br/>
<br/>
[Jin Roh:The Wolf Brigade]<br/>
The work of Oshii Mamoru with what I looked at is only "Jin-Roh". <br/>
What kind of image do Americans have in wolf? <br/>
In Japan, there is the image "loneliness", "the strongest animal", <br/>
and "the ruined animal" .<br/>
A long time ago, wolfs was in Japan. They were the strongest animals <br/>
in this island country. <br/>
They did not build a group but it liked acting alone. They were <br/>
ruined by man after all. <br/>
I think that various images are mixed to "Jin-roh". <br/>
 <br/>
[Hiroshi Kurogane's Shinsengumi book and the animated film directed <br/>
by Kon Ichikawa]<br/>
DVD is not released. <br/>
The work makes Manga of Kurogane Hiroshi the original. <br/>
I have read Manga. <br/>
The fan who wants to see handsome Hijikata and handsome Okita seldom <br/>
reads. However, among the favorite fans of a historical fact, it is <br/>
a popular work. <br/>
 <br/>
Manga of Shinsengumi is planned and announced by some magazines this <br/>
year. <br/>
Some are likely to become a long series although many are short <br/>
stories. <br/>
The day when you read these works may come. <br/>
Incidentally, manga which I like is this. <br/>
 <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youngsunday.com/rensai/comics/getsumei.html">http://www.youngsunday.com/rensai/comics/getsumei.html</a><br/>
 <br/>
Getsumeiseiki -sayonara Shinsengumi-<br/>
 <br/>
This manga is good at depiction of the scene using a sword. <br/>
Now, only two volumes are put on the market. <br/>
I think that a series should just continue for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
As for the old "Shinsengumi Keppuroku", DVD will be released in July <br/>
and afterwards. <br/>
This work built the foundation of the present Shinsengumi <br/>
popularity. Therefore, there are many old fans. <br/>
The actor who played Hijikata with this work is playing the elder <br/>
brother of Hijikata's blindness in the Taiga drama. <br/>
(In fact, Hijikata had the elder brother of the blindness on 24 <br/>
years old.) <br/>
I saw "Die a Samurai" (Shinsengumi shimatsuki), "TABOO" (Gohatto), <br/>
and  "Mibugishiden movie" .<br/>
Although "TABOO" was disrepute at the fan of Shinsengumi, it was <br/>
popular to other people. (Kondou and Hijikata age too much.) <br/>
This movie is created based on two pieces of short tales <br/>
in "Shinsengumi keppuroku" which Shiba Ryoutarou wrote. <br/>
Although this movie is a fiction, it is the truth that there was a <br/>
disturbance of homosexuality in Shinsengumi. <br/>
<br/>
"Mibugishiden" also has TV drama besides a movie. <br/>
Watanabe Ken was performing Yoshimura Kanichirou. <br/>
Although it is a good work, Saitou of Satou Kouichi or Odagiri Joe <br/>
(The actor of Taiga drama) cannot be recommended to a favorite <br/>
person. <br/>
Frightful Saitou is appearing. (Do you know Takenaka Naoto?)<br/>
<br/>
[momoiro is referring the actor from SHALL WE DANCE...the funny guy <br/>
not Koji Yakusho]<br/>
 <br/>
About Satou Kouichi (KOICHI SATO)<br/>
Have you seen the movie of Shinsengumi in which Mifune Toshirou <br/>
performed Kondou Isami? <br/>
The actor (Mikuni Rentarou) who is performing Serizawa Kamo with <br/>
that work is Satou's father. <br/>
Mikuni is an actor very famous for Japan. And Serizawa which he <br/>
performed is also famous. <br/>
Therefore, Satou desired to perform Serizawa. <br/>
<br/>
[Japanese film buffs will recall that Rentaro Mikuni starred in such <br/>
classics as BURMESE HARP, Harakiri/Seppuku, KAIDAN and more]<br/>
<br/>
***Rentarou Mikuni is Koichi Sato's father...cool...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026176635">I think I speak for a few of us when I say we'll be undoubtedly <br/>
directing a sincere bow of thanks and gratitude in Momoiro-Usagi's <br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><<In Japan, the style of a text has changed to Meiji Era considerably. <br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is most interesting .  When they say style of text I wonder if they <br/>
mean the kanji itself or do they mean in the general way sentences are <br/>
constructed etc? Sort of comparing  an English language book from the <br/>
1800s to one written recently. They're the same in terms of language yet <br/>
very different.<br/>
<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'd love to hear what they consider ed to be the "strange scenes"<br/>
<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, Miss B and I are squealing with major delight about now as we have <br/>
developed a major fangirl crush on Murakami Hiroaki..  I saw him in the <br/>
NHK series, thought he had an excellent screen presence compared with <br/>
the younger actors playing Hijikata and Kondou  but of course hadn't a <br/>
clue as to who he was at the time since I've only just seen S.K.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > About Satou Kouichi (KOICHI SATO)<br/>

><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As SHQ's resident  Koichi Sato groupie I really appreciate this <br/>
information.  The movie mentioned would be Band Of Assassins, right?  <br/>
That's finally worked it's way to the  top of my must get  list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>And just when I thought my "to track down" list had reached an end.....<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there's any aspect of American or western history that <br/>
Momoiro-Usagi is interested in. I'm sure there are many of us who would <br/>
love to repay the favor  of tracking down information  they can't easily <br/>
find in Japanese.<br/>
