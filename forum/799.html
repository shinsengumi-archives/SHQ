<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859951812">I think Miss B brought this up...about how the word "tail" shows up in<br/>
babelfish translations examples are <br/>
translation of Fujita Goro in the Seinan War (newspaper article)<br/>
Nagakura's battle record and now this...<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/women.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/women.html</a><br/>
read "Tomoe Gozen"<br/>
"Tomoe was one of the last five of the Kiso standing at the tail end<br/>
of the Battle of Awazu"<br/>
<br/>
now...Tomoe was a consummate warrior "She was also a remarkably strong<br/>
archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready<br/>
to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken<br/>
horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents.<br/>
Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first<br/>
captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a might<br/>
bow; and she preformed more deeds of valor than any of his other<br/>
warriors."<br/>
(Tale of the Heike, McCullough, pg. 291)"<br/>
<br/>
[so we have to figure out...would a brave warrior stand at the tail<br/>
end of any battle?  Clearly "tail" doesn't imply what it means in English]</div>

I have a feeling that in this particular instance it means at the very end of <br/>
the battle. Still doesn't make sense to me in other sentences though.<br/>
