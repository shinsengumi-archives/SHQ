<br/>
www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20040414wo3a.htm<br/>
<br/>
Important bit of info....<br/>
&quot;Descendants of those killed by Shinsengumi still maintain it was a <br/>
rogue force,&quot; said Toyoji Miyakawa, 79, a descendant of force <br/>
commander Kondo Isami (1834-186 . &quot;In my childhood I heard of such <br/>
people who wanted to terminate our family line.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
*Note if you guys go to Dr. Fanlang&#39;s pavement and read all the pages <br/>
related to Saitou then you will note that it mentions that his family is <br/>
targeted by assasins----it may be an overstatement IMHO but Toyoji <br/>
MIyakawa&#39;s words seem to lend some validity to it</div>

<h3><a href="#msg-395">&gt;</a> Shinsengumi Dream Trip</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075874796">Really~ I was thinking along going to Japan (whenever I have the<br/>
dinero) and try to visit the places during the same exact time/place<br/>
when everything happens...<br/>
<br/>
e.g. <br/>
1)visit where Ikedaya used to be (some pachinko place is there now) on<br/>
the day/time (estimated although Christophermayo.com has a timeline)<br/>
when the raid occurred<br/>
<br/>
2)do a Kyoto tour at night and try to follow real patrol routes (as I<br/>
understand many of the major streets are still the same because it is<br/>
a historic site) and try to emulate the patrol conditions (carry a<br/>
lantern walk with the correct number of people...I want to do a<br/>
complete patrol and end up back at headquarters within the correct<br/>
timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
3) hang out at Nagarayema/Goryokaku on the same day/time when Kondo<br/>
was captured and when Hijikata was killed<br/>
<br/>
4) highest on my list is to camp out at Buddha Hall at Aizu and hike<br/>
around the Bonari Pass...and ofcourse meditate on the day that Aizu<br/>
fell...I&#39;d probably spend time at night along the river near the<br/>
castle where many peasants had to cross via ferry when all the carnage<br/>
broke out.<br/>
<br/>
As you can figure I&#39;m really interested in the natural environment and<br/>
conditions during which all these events happened.  I think one can<br/>
start to understand how hard their job was to patrol the streets (if<br/>
you think about it they were easy pickings/moving targets/with their<br/>
uniforms and all) at night.  The Ishin Shishi on the other hand, were<br/>
hard to weed out from the populace.  Because my museum catalog has<br/>
tons of scrolls/lists/poetry/letters I figure there may be info on the<br/>
daily official routine of these guys.  Time to wake up, Time to be<br/>
ready for patrols, Time to practice in the dojo, Time to be back at<br/>
headquarters [rumor] I read &quot;somewhere&quot; (again the mysterious<br/>
&quot;somewhere&quot;) that no matter what the guys had to return to<br/>
headquarters at night---no matter how late...I wonder if a curfew was<br/>
imposed at some point when the activities of the Ishin Shishi became<br/>
more bold.<br/>

me you in fact WON&#39;T be allowed to leave Japan EVER. We&#39;ll end up detained in <br/>
a maximum security facitilty for that rash of fundoshi raids.... And we&#39;ll <br/>
bug the heck out of the poor guards who get stuck with us continously asking <br/>
them questions like &quot;Do you think Saito ever worked here?&quot;, &quot;How does it feel to <br/>
be in the same profession as Saito-sama?&quot;, and &quot;Can we get moved to the <br/>
facitily in Hokkaido where Shinpachi worked?&quot;....<br/>
