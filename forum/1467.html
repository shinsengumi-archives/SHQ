<h3>Question</h3>
by <i>nana_41175</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041699891">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anybody knows the extent of the responibilities of <br/>
the Shinsengumi in policing Kyoto from 1864-1865? Were they also <br/>
tasked to handle crimes that seemingly do not concern or threaten the <br/>
Shogunate? If not, is there a specific agency that handled these <br/>
problems?<br/>
<br/>
Also, how does the Shinsengumi heirarchy hand down specific <br/>
assignments?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance for any answers.<br/>
<br/>
Nana</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537652260">The Shinsengumi were one of many police troops which patrolled <br/>
Kyoto.  They did not patrol the entire capital.  Please see the map <br/>
in our &#39;photos&#39; section provided by our member Masayoshi.  Simply, <br/>
they were kind of a task force however we do know for sure that one <br/>
of the captains Saitou Hajime did capture a burglar (this appears on <br/>
his timeline in a translation of the Japanese website http://www.3-<br/>
hajime.com, which I&#39;m assuming was your run of the mill burglar and <br/>
not some anti-government guy.<br/>
To me it would make sense that if they ran across <br/>
anything &quot;suspicious&quot; they would respond just because anti-<br/>
government activity can take many forms.  If they see some guys <br/>
snooping around at night they would have to stop them for <br/>
questioning at the very least. So they would run across a variety of <br/>
bad guys...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264588790">Thanks, Barbara and Tiffany, for pointing out the areas of <br/>
jurisdiction of the Shinsengumi. One last question: who comes next in <br/>
the heirarchy after Kondou and Hijikata? Should these two be away,who <br/>
do they leave to take charge of things?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229908373">I would think Yamanami since he&#39;s  a vice commander like Hijikata unless <br/>
of course he&#39;s already left this world by the time your story is set. <br/>
Next I would say Ito would step in whether he should or not and then <br/>
maybe emphasis on &quot;maybe&quot; Takeda would think he was worthy of being in <br/>
charge.<br/>
<br/>
Most likely Hijikata would tell whoever he wanted to be in charge to be <br/>
in charge. I think he was a major control freak in that regard. Shhhh <br/>
don&#39;t tell Miss B. :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669423634">Depends on what time period you&#39;re using. Hijikata actually wasn&#39;t the only Vice-Commander. Yamanami was his equal, so if both Hijikata and Kondo were out that&#39;s the person you would have went to. Of course he was eventually forced to commit seppuku. Also, if you&#39;re doing a story about the very beginning of the Shinsengumi then there were two other Commanders besides Kondo. You&#39;ll probably want to have a look at Serizawa Kamo&#39;s Biography. That site has most all the important members listed and what their positions where, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146159524">Thanks very much for the info! The time frame I have in mind is <br/>
autumn 1864. Hmm hmm hmm...hmm...okay, I think I know how to do that <br/>
part of the story now.^^ Thanks a lot! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post the chapters when they come up and please tell me if I&#39;ve <br/>
got things wrong. The problem with writing Shinsengumi fanfics is the <br/>
perpetual danger that one might get the facts wrong. ^______^<br/>
