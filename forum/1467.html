<h3>Question</h3>
by <i>nana_41175</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041699891">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anybody knows the extent of the responibilities of <br/>
the Shinsengumi in policing Kyoto from 1864-1865? Were they also <br/>
tasked to handle crimes that seemingly do not concern or threaten the <br/>
Shogunate? If not, is there a specific agency that handled these <br/>
problems?<br/>
<br/>
Also, how does the Shinsengumi heirarchy hand down specific <br/>
assignments?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance for any answers.<br/>
<br/>
Nana</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537652260">The Shinsengumi were one of many police troops which patrolled <br/>
Kyoto.  They did not patrol the entire capital.  Please see the map <br/>
in our 'photos' section provided by our member Masayoshi.  Simply, <br/>
they were kind of a task force however we do know for sure that one <br/>
of the captains Saitou Hajime did capture a burglar (this appears on <br/>
his timeline in a translation of the Japanese website http://www.3-<br/>
hajime.com, which I'm assuming was your run of the mill burglar and <br/>
not some anti-government guy.<br/>
To me it would make sense that if they ran across <br/>
anything "suspicious" they would respond just because anti-<br/>
government activity can take many forms.  If they see some guys <br/>
snooping around at night they would have to stop them for <br/>
questioning at the very least. So they would run across a variety of <br/>
bad guys...<br/>

jurisdiction of the Shinsengumi. One last question: who comes next in <br/>
the heirarchy after Kondou and Hijikata? Should these two be away,who <br/>
do they leave to take charge of things?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229908373">I would think Yamanami since he's  a vice commander like Hijikata unless <br/>
of course he's already left this world by the time your story is set. <br/>
Next I would say Ito would step in whether he should or not and then <br/>
maybe emphasis on "maybe" Takeda would think he was worthy of being in <br/>
charge.<br/>
<br/>
Most likely Hijikata would tell whoever he wanted to be in charge to be <br/>
in charge. I think he was a major control freak in that regard. Shhhh <br/>
don't tell Miss B. :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669423634">Depends on what time period you're using. Hijikata actually wasn't the only Vice-Commander. Yamanami was his equal, so if both Hijikata and Kondo were out that's the person you would have went to. Of course he was eventually forced to commit seppuku. Also, if you're doing a story about the very beginning of the Shinsengumi then there were two other Commanders besides Kondo. You'll probably want to have a look at Serizawa Kamo's Biography. That site has most all the important members listed and what their positions where, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146159524">Thanks very much for the info! The time frame I have in mind is <br/>
autumn 1864. Hmm hmm hmm...hmm...okay, I think I know how to do that <br/>
part of the story now.^^ Thanks a lot! <br/>
<br/>
I'll post the chapters when they come up and please tell me if I've <br/>
got things wrong. The problem with writing Shinsengumi fanfics is the <br/>
perpetual danger that one might get the facts wrong. ^______^<br/>
