<h3>More Suzuki info</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-953409027">I just popped over to shinsengumimb and what should be there but a new message in the Sekihoutai forum!  A message from momoiro with a story of how later in life Suzuki prayed for not only his brother and others, but also Kondou and Hijikata.  There was also apparently something written about him by his son-in-law and I *think* the links momoiro provided either are or are derived from an interview with Suzuki's grandson.  I got so excited I forgot to copy links and such...  :-D  Just go on over to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> and it's under the Suzuki website topic in the Sekihoutai forum.<br/>
 <br/>
Really cool comment (from the grandson, I think, when Suzuki was teaching him kendo) about how Suzuki's eyes shone, too!  Suppose it was a requirement for entry into the Shinsengumi?  :-D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's so funny you should mention that. I received and watched Chusingura <br/>
1/47 yesterday about the 47 ronin and in the beginning one of the guys <br/>
who becomes one of Asano's retainers and later one of the 47 takes on a <br/>
bunch of guys trying to beat a really old samurai. He takes them all out <br/>
and the Edo "tabloids" (one sheet flyers complete with gory artwork) <br/>
have it that he killed 18 men as opposed to the actual 3. He's a star <br/>
and all sorts of people want him to marry their daughters or let them <br/>
adopt him into the family etc. There's even a scene when he goes tot eh <br/>
dojo he teaches at at there's this mob of fangirls screaming his name <br/>
peeking inside trying to get his attention. It was hilarious and I <br/>
wondered if Hijikata ever had a brush with that.<br/>

I think about "Toshizo's parcel"episode.<br/>
(It's mentioned here on net; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toshizo.com/jiken/jibody01.html#07">http://www.toshizo.com/jiken/jibody01.html#07</a>   <br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
[One day Hijikata send a parcel to his birthplace, saying, "I send you <br/>
something ectremely precious". When birthplace people open the parcel, they find a <br/>
bunch of love letters adressed toToshizo. It make them laugh, and they say,  <br/>
"Toshi san gains another point!"]<br/>

Hijikata STILL has fangirls screaming for him! I'd be willing to bet there <br/>
were times when he sent poor old Saito out first to take a peek and make sure <br/>
the coast was clear before he'd come out into the open! LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972633307">Speaking of Suzuki... I just had a random thought. I'm wondering if he could <br/>
have been the character model for another one of the RK characters? You all <br/>
recall Usui, ne? The pathetic fellow who tried and tried to take revenge on <br/>
Shishio without success and finally got his sorry tail nailed to the wall by none <br/>
other than Saito? Maybe Watsuki-sama was implying that is what would have <br/>
happened if the Miki and Saito ever met up agian phil!<br/>

is coming-<br/>
