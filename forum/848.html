<h3>Hijikata sings!</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421941839">Okay so I don&#39;t know if the real Hijikata sang but I just got to see <br/>
episode 20 of the NHK Shinsengumi and Serizawa cheezed some important <br/>
person off to  the point that they were going to leave the gathering <br/>
Kondou threw for them. To lighten up the situation Kondou prods Hijikata <br/>
into singing some popular song of the day while he (Kondou) and Inoue <br/>
Genzaboru do some dance. Nagakura and Harada join in the dance too <br/>
(Harada taking yet another chance to show of his fundoshi--bright yellow <br/>
this time). I&#39;m guessing it was a popular song of the day because two of <br/>
the little kamuro girls in attendance wit their mistress sang along with <br/>
part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that boy can sing!!! It&#39;s a catchy little tune too, I just wish <br/>
the darn vcr was working properly to have taped it.<br/>
<br/>
In other events, Yamanami, Todou and Saitou & Okita were in charge in <br/>
signing up new recruits. One guy was a total boob and Todou knocked him <br/>
out with a small tap tot eh head. The next guy that came took Saitou on <br/>
_Barehanded_ and won!!!!! Saitou was crushed and quickly went off to <br/>
sulk alone. Apparently the boob knows the hand to hand combat guy which <br/>
would explain his lack of sword skills if he&#39;s also a judo specialist.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me for not being able to name them as they spoke so fast and I <br/>
don&#39;t have subtitles here since I get the show on satellite direct from <br/>
NHK..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326336882">I&#39;m assuming fundoshi will be making a huge comeback in Japan due to<br/>
this series.<br/>
One of the Japanese sites does mention jiujitsu teachers in the<br/>
Shinsengumi which makes sense in terms of restraining people you need<br/>
to take in alive for questioning.<br/>
Perhaps this is where Saitou will take up his jiujitsu seriously--note<br/>
hist. Saitou&#39;s Sekiguchi style.  So did Saitou fight the guy with a<br/>
wooden sword and the guy was bare-handed?  But many guys back then had<br/>
to study both, since childhood, ofcourse people had their preferences.<br/>
This is what makes the Shinsengumi so interesting...the guys came from<br/>
all over the country and brought with them their skills...martial arts<br/>
mayhem galore in the Shinsengumi dojo I&#39;m sure...I wonder if Romulus<br/>
Hillsborough worked with any experts to cover this issue.<br/>
Well, if Hijikata could write poetry who knows what other hidden<br/>
talents he may have possessed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brightly colored fundoshi no less first it was Kondou’s orange when he <br/>
got married (the official family crested fundoshi worn on special <br/>
occasions apparently) and Harada&#39;s red and yellow<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So did Saitou fight the guy with a<br/>
wooden sword and the guy was bare-handed?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes! And it happened to fast I&#39;m not sure how the guy did it but he knocked the sword away and it ended up with him getting Saitou in a headlock from behind. It looked like the type position where he could have snapped his neck had he been so inclined. <br/>
<br/>
Highly impressive stuff.<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-850">&gt;</a> S.H.---Sekiguti info is from</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-836946481">Barb mentioned the jiujitsu guy in the recent episode of the NHk Taiga<br/>
beating poor Saitou.  It got me thinking abou the Sekiguti/Sekiguchi<br/>
jiujitsu S.H. believed to have practiced.  On one of the posts at<br/>
3-hajime.com<br/>
<br/>
fish says...<br/>
&quot;Saito one Sekiguti style [jiujitsu lineage/style] softly had<br/>
completed technique, because the history charge supporting is not<br/>
clear, assertion is not possible, but because it is the information<br/>
where the Akama Cipango [Akama Shizuko] child person is procured from<br/>
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, as for the possibility it is<br/>
high with you think. Because Tadasi Matsubara softly seems that is<br/>
softly the master of technique of the extent which serves the<br/>
technique teacher head afterwards, being taken after, is not strange,<br/>
don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
so the info is from the TMPD.  The Sekiguti style was mentioned on the<br/>
S.H.&#39;s chart <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/">http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/</a> <br/>
And I think the guy in the NHK drama was Tadasi Matsubara--master of<br/>
his style(?)  his name pops up in other threads regarding the drama. <br/>
Indeed the guys in the Shinsengumi were skilled as is ...and due to<br/>
the varied demographics of the group they continued to broaden their<br/>
martial knowledge obviously. I just found it pretty neat how Akama S.<br/>
was able to find this shred of info.</div>
