<h3>New Journal of Japanese history</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-478165087">I've been dragged away from Bakumatsu research due to a consulting gig<br/>
that had me focus on the 1850s, so I haven't had much time to get<br/>
deeper in, but I wanted to let everyone here know that I am working<br/>
with a group of people to publish a new history journal - simply<br/>
titled "The Samurai Archives Journal of Japanese History".  Our focus<br/>
will be on pre-20th century Japan, although we'll make allowances for<br/>
Meiji era histories as well.  Pretty much everything is set up and<br/>
ready to go, including publishing and distribution; we're in the<br/>
process of accepting submissions, so if anyone is interested, here is<br/>
the website with information on the journal, the staff, and the<br/>
submission process:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153669662">Dear Kitsuno, thank you for posting to the list to announce this <br/>
venture, I had some questions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 *I wanted to let everyone here know that I am working<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > with a group of people to publish a new history journal - simply<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1) has this journal consulted with other publications such as Monumenta <br/>
Nipponica or Journal of Asian Studies, in other words what will your <br/>
journal provide which these older publications cannot---I think that <br/>
your journal will allow for opportunities to encourage and refine <br/>
independent scholarship (especially for undergrads).  So I'm glad to <br/>
see you enter this field and hopefully inform JAS or MN (by providing a <br/>
new venue). JAS and MN have very strict rules on what they accept and <br/>
what they publish.  I'm not saying your publication was intended to <br/>
compete with JAS/MN but perhaps offer something different (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
*Our focus will be on pre-20th century Japan, although we'll make <br/>
allowances for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Meiji era histories as well.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>2) I noticed the strength of your staff are the prestigious <br/>
qualifications of some individuals and the wide ranging interests of <br/>
others which will serve as a key to your future success. However, let's <br/>
say if I were to submit an article on the Meiji Educational system as <br/>
it relates to the perversion of bushido and rise of fascism (yes as <br/>
early as 1890s...predating good ole Italian model but it's evident in <br/>
the many works dealing w/ the topic)...your staff may not be able to <br/>
provide a peer evaluation.  <br/>
<br/>
Would you seek qualified guest editors to assist in oversight of the <br/>
scholarship (even if it is from someone not traditionally part of the <br/>
field?).  Have you approached maybe the young up and coming open minded <br/>
professors to assist in this effort?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > ready to go, including publishing and distribution; we're in the<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>3) how will SA-JJH sustain itself?  I am worried because I feel that <br/>
it's tough if you guys have to pay out of pocket.  Have you acquired a <br/>
grant?  If so then perhaps a grant to back you on this project will <br/>
also help this magazine be distributed to research libraries in the <br/>
USA.  My concern is, from my own experience many magazines after a <br/>
certain number of issues do have to close down and in the process the <br/>
meticulously written work ends up becoming a rarity for students to <br/>
find/read. Aside from the online format which everyone can read and I <br/>
assume the print formatting, will you consider CD formats for libraries <br/>
too?  Will you try to get this publication onto library databases <br/>
(which can subscribe to you or link to articles?).  Ofcourse the online <br/>
format will be most accessible however students in school would feel <br/>
more comfortable if perhaps their library's East Asian bibliographer <br/>
has approved of the journal as a source of info as well---and with the <br/>
qualifcations of your staff I'm sure they would be able to devise a <br/>
good strategy for penetrating academia and make this a valuable <br/>
resource.<br/>
<br/>
what are the long term goals of this magazine?  will it exist years <br/>
from now?  part of why JAS/MN are held in high esteem is that they are <br/>
very stable and authors feel that their work will be preserved for <br/>
decades...do you have a back up plan for your magazine if someone <br/>
should need to take a break from it?  For the SHQ we are just <br/>
volunteers so we don't have to worry about it really.  But your journal <br/>
is a very ambitious effort and I was concerned with its stability.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have friends in the Japanese history department at the University of<br/>
Hawaii who are informing the staff, and once we get things really<br/>
rolling we hope to involve Dr. Paul Varley in the process (he was the<br/>
thesis advisor of one of my friends). I also have a friend at the<br/>
University of London who is doing the same.  I have a few more<br/>
contacts at Harvard and some west coast universities, but I can't<br/>
honestly expect much from harvard (a harvard student would probably<br/>
have to stoop pretty low to submit a paper for publication in a<br/>
non-academic journal :D), but that is the extent of my connections,<br/>
although I do know "a few people who know people", so it probably<br/>
would be a good idea to look to them for input.  I am encouraging<br/>
anyone in a history program to inform the staff of their respective<br/>
universities.<br/>
<br/>
We have indicated on the website that the authors retain their own<br/>
copyright, but like you said, I should probably really highlight that.<br/>
 Also, I like the word "interdisciplinary" - that was the intent of<br/>
"free to approach from whichever discipline you wish", but<br/>
"interdisciplinary" is a great word to use, I'll fix it up with my<br/>
next update. I am really interested in the interdisciplinary concept,<br/>
and also to really go after the topics that "regular" academics and<br/>
journals avoid, i.e. biography, military history, and narrative<br/>
history. I find dry meta-analysis boring, but narrative histories that<br/>
bring the history to life has always been my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
The initial ideas for articles that I've heard so far have been<br/>
interesting and encouraging (including a person who is using medical<br/>
databases and research to examine the cause of death of some Sengoku<br/>
era Daimyo based on the various symptoms listed in primary sources).<br/>
It should be all around interesting. I've been translating the early<br/>
17 century text "Shinchokoki" (record of Oda Nobunaga), so my first<br/>
part will go into the first issue.  I'm also really fascinated with<br/>
Nagakura Shinpachi's journal, so I hope to translate some of that for<br/>
the future.  The main thing at the moment is to really get the word<br/>
out about the journal and get the submissions. I have a good group of<br/>
editors, as well as some "informal" editors in the UH Japanese history<br/>
PhD program, so I'm hoping for a pretty high quality product.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention, I have to admit I like the concept of the copyright<br/>
laws that protect published material far better than the spotty laws<br/>
on "publishing" on the internet - I think this is the logical next<br/>
step. I can publish my translations and make them available, and<br/>
frankly not have to worry about them being copied and pasted into<br/>
wikipedia or other random web pages.</div>

<br/>
"Peer Review" is a tough one.  I'm trying to cover the bases with the<br/>
official staff, but like you said, there are some holes. The major<br/>
advantage of having people who know the history read it is that they<br/>
can notice inconsistencies and questionable sources, etc. I hadn't put<br/>
a large amount of thought into it, but I do know enough people who<br/>
know other people to hopefully cover all the bases. It will be on a<br/>
case by case basis - I don't forsee a big problem, but I hope to get<br/>
applicable papers to at least one relative expert before okaying<br/>
anything for publication. I haven't approached any upcoming professors<br/>
per se (yet), but I do have a fair pool of Graduate level historians<br/>
who are qualified to either help directly with the process, or point<br/>
me in the right direction. I don't expect to be ready to publish the<br/>
first issue until february or march of next year, so that should give<br/>
me enough time to get everything squared away.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, I'm in the process of creating my own<br/>
publishing company (so I'll be doing more than just this journal) - I<br/>
have a "print on demand" distributor with rates that are extremely<br/>
affordable, and the journal would be made available immediately on<br/>
amazon.com (and the canada and UK version) and barnesandnoble.com). I<br/>
will also have the option of e-books. Basically, since there are no<br/>
"bells and whistles" (no editors, no designers, no getting them on the<br/>
shelves in bookstores, pretty much nothing- they publish what I give<br/>
them), all they do is publish and distribute, so it is extremely<br/>
affordable, and there are no limits to how many issues they publish. I<br/>
can also buy them very cheaply to distribute myself. Which means that<br/>
I would have to go to bookstores personally (or my other staff<br/>
members) to get them on the shelves or in libraries.  Another friend<br/>
of mine has already done this, and I was extremely impressed with the<br/>
service and the finished products, so I am more than confident in the<br/>
distributor. But like I said, aside from online sources, the rest is<br/>
up to myself and the staff.  So, on the one hand, it is very<br/>
affordable, but on the other hand, it is up to us to market.  Having<br/>
it on the various amazon.com and B&N sites is a huge help though. <br/>
<br/>
I have looked at grants from the government, nothing really is<br/>
applicable. Frankly, I don't *need* a grant, but it would be very<br/>
nice. I'm not entirely sure where to look.<br/>

><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Basically (and this could be a problem), we can only keep it going for<br/>
as long as we get quality submissions.  That aside, the book will be<br/>
available online for as long as I'm willing to pay $12 per year per<br/>
issue. The goal, of course, is to build a base of both readers and<br/>
contributors, and hopefully it will become self sustaining. I plan to<br/>
wait until I have enough papers for a year of issues (4 issues) - they<br/>
will be in book form, rather than "magazine" form, and I also have the<br/>
option of hardcover or softcover, whichever I prefer, although I'm<br/>
planning on paperback.  I also intend to republish 19th century books<br/>
on Japan, written by sailors and academics and diplomats to help<br/>
sustain the business.  I actually have a book coming out within a<br/>
couple months - "Japan and Her People" by Anna Hartshorne, edited by<br/>
myself and my publisher friend, so that should give me some indication<br/>
of the market for that type of book. Here is the link to that:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.typeandculture.com/?page_id=36">http://www.typeandculture.com/?page_id=36</a><br/>
<br/>
Lian Hearn (Author of the Tales of the Otori series) was kind enough<br/>
to write the introduction to this edition.  <br/>
<br/>
So, right now I just have an ambitious plan. Hopefully by the end of<br/>
this year it will come together.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, looks like I mixed your two messages, and then missed this one. <br/>
Obviously we are on a different playing field than the MN and JAS or<br/>
the journal of Japanese Studies, and one of the reasons for our<br/>
journal is specifically what you stated - no one I know can ever hope<br/>
to be published in any of the above. Also, the above are restricted by<br/>
what is in vogue in academia, so we are able to sidestep that and<br/>
hopefully be able to publish what people want to read, rather than<br/>
what academia wants to publish. No academic is going to attempt to put<br/>
time and effort into something that interests them if they didn't<br/>
think that an academic journal would publish it. And, like I said,<br/>
Japanese military history, narrative history, and biography is<br/>
apparently frowned upon currently. If you don't believe me, check out<br/>
the PMJS mailing list :P - it's all about heian books, art history,<br/>
intellectual history, and other things that I have no interest in ever<br/>
actually reading :D</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531693512">(my apologies ahead of time to SHQ ML friends for deviating off-topic)<br/>
<br/>
I will ask Kitsuno for infos about a western female educator in Japan<br/>
during the later Meiji Era.  You may wonder well "and this has<br/>
something to do with the Shinsengumi how???".<br/>
<br/>
The answer is this:<br/>
Fujita Goro and Fujita Tokio had devoted *years* of their life at the<br/>
Tokyo Women's Normal School (it had some name changes, won't list them<br/>
here) but the TWNS had *EXTENSIVE* interaction with Jyoshi Eigakujyuku<br/>
(Tsuda Jyuku Univ)---students interacted and observed classes, in fact<br/>
staff and faculty were friends and there were even shared social<br/>
gathers (parties!)...I am casting a wide net here and even in the<br/>
published (and censored) letters of Tsuda Ume, some details about TWNS<br/>
did emerge (not to mention some serious dirt on MEIJI VIPS). Tsuda Ume<br/>
is a confirmed gal pal of Yamakawa Futaba (WHO WAS A FRIEND OF TOKIO,<br/>
actually Tokio's superior at the school).<br/>
<br/>
My gameplan was, study TWNS and sooner or later Mr. and Mrs. Fujita<br/>
WILL appear (the issue for me friends is money...intuition tells me<br/>
that Mr. and Mrs. Fujita are sitting at the WOmen's STudies Library in<br/>
Ochanomizu---which has one of the largest collections on the topic<br/>
from that era...lots of stuff still there! I just can't get to Tokyo<br/>
nor can I hire someone who can read Japanese from that era....)<br/>

<br/>
Dear Kitsuno,<br/>
I am a bit familiar with Anna C. Hartshorne, her contribution to<br/>
Tsuda's institution and the role Hartshorne played in preserving the<br/>
Tsuda's famous Attic Letters. ACH, is a major figure in Christian<br/>
education in that era, I was always curious to read her works because<br/>
I'd like to see if she mentions Takamine Hideo who played a key role<br/>
in establishing Jyoshi Eigakujyuku's Scholarship committee for Tsuda<br/>
Ume (and sent her packing to Oswego NY).  Sometimes Takamine comes off<br/>
as shady and a bit cunning (perfectly understandable given the<br/>
politics).  If you come across something on T-sensei or TWNS send me<br/>
an email---I have some pieces of the puzzle still.  The Min. of<br/>
Education was really functioning like a gigantic gang most of the time<br/>
and detractors set up their own "gangs" if you will and one posse was<br/>
the pro-women's education group (which ofcourse ACH was part of).<br/>
<br/>
So you were so lucky to work on ACH's book!<br/>
<br/>
It's my understanding that this book was already pubished (however I<br/>
cannot acquire it through my library) as noted here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ilab.org/db/book804_HB8225.html">http://www.ilab.org/db/book804_HB8225.html</a><br/>
<br/>
so this a republication of her 1902 book correct? But refined by you.<br/>
Does she discuss women's educ. much?  You know scholars like LIncicome<br/>
would want it (if it does cover education).<br/>
<br/>
Alot of people here on SHQ ML may like LIan Hearn's fiction and it's<br/>
very awesome she wrote the intro to your book.  She's like the JK<br/>
ROWLING of Japan/fantasy.  Please tell us of all your future projects<br/>
so if some of us have the money we can snap up the books.<br/>
<br/>
I hear Lian Hearn is planning possibly a BAKUMATSU BOOK----likely set<br/>
in KYOTO?  Will the Shinsengumi make a cameo appearance?  YOU MUST<br/>
TELL US...we'll keep it our little secret (^_^)...don't hold out on<br/>
us...we fans don't have a whole lot to wait for. </span></blockquote></div>

references....<br/>
-------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Kitsuno "The main thing at the moment is to really get the word<br/>
out about the journal and get the submissions."<br/>
<br/>
you need to contact:  <br/>
UCLA, CORNELL, YALE, UPENN at Philadelphia and <br/>
University of Georgia (just because the no nonsense Prof. Karl Friday,<br/>
the true authority of samurai/bushido and spectacular academic and<br/>
practitioner of koryu---Kashima Shinryu teaches there still--I think).  <br/>
<br/>
These schools are also considered to be major pillars in this<br/>
discipline (aside from the ones you listed). I know many professors<br/>
may not warm up to this idea right away...but you just need to get on<br/>
the departmental email lists and make one announcement...for<br/>
students...because those universities have libraries with TONS OF<br/>
MATERIAL...they can help setup a network and even provide resources to<br/>
your writers.  <br/>
<br/>
Heck, at UW MADISON we have tons of works from the Meiji, first<br/>
prints, of books in English written in the spirit of "Orientalism"<br/>
along the same vein as Hartshorne's work (I know she had a very deep<br/>
understanding of Japan having lived and worked there).<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Cameron Hurst would write just a bit and help give advice<br/>
to people interested in samurai studies...(note for shinsengumi<br/>
fans...) Hurst is outstanding. Author of a book worthy BUYING The<br/>
Armed Martial Arts of Japan: Swordsmanship and Archery. (Yale, 1998)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure the topic of her bakumatsu book, but Hearn actually<br/>
participated in the Shinsengumi discussion group a few months back<br/>
under a pseudonym. So... maybe? :D  I sent her a bunch of journal<br/>
articles about the bakumatsu for her research, but there really wasn't<br/>
much on the shinsengumi in them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Haverford College has a huge collection of Anna Hartshorne's<br/>
letters - I got about 10 of them copied and sent to me, hoping to get<br/>
information on her life, but they were mostly letters written to her -<br/>
one appeared to be a love letter, and another one mentioned Tsuda Ume,<br/>
and also Inazo Nitobe.  You can find the collection with a google<br/>
search on anna hartshorne - they have a huge collection if you are<br/>
interested - I think it was $10 plus 25 cents per page. One problem is<br/>
that since they are hand written, they are hard to read, at least for<br/>
me.  I'm too used to reading Times New Roman.<br/>
<br/>
"Japan and Her People" is a reprint of the 1902 book. It is mostly a<br/>
travelogue and history of the places she visited, most of the<br/>
contemporary information is on what the cities and places look like.<br/>
The cultural references are more general, things like food and<br/>
clothing, etc. - but I've only edited half the book, my friend edited<br/>
the other half. I guess it's possible she looks at education in the<br/>
first half of the book, but I'm not sure, I haven't read the entire<br/>
book yet. We are just publishing the first volume, at least for now.</div>

I sent her a bunch of journal<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dear Kitsuno,<br/>
I understand that Ms. Hearn may be concerned about privacy issues, I <br/>
hope you direct her to our list and she is welcome to post questions <br/>
on teh Shinsengumi and we have people here who have spent many years <br/>
in both (English & Japanese) researching them and are happy to help.  <br/>
We certainly do not know who is who and will not pry...identity is <br/>
never an issue.  <br/>
<br/>
If the list seems quiet it's because there are no questions posted <br/>
and people may not have found an aspect of fandom (movies etc) which <br/>
are coming out to post about.  In the past a handful of members had a <br/>
posting frenzy during the early ears of SHQ and it misled people to <br/>
think that we were trying to impose our will on the many (which <br/>
wasn't the case)---so we essentially stopped and wanted people to <br/>
direct the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Please be sure she reads our recommended list here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography.html">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography.html</a><br/>
<br/>
the solid text on teh origins of the SHinsengumi and their hometown<br/>
Steele, M. William. Alternative Narratives in Modern Japanese History.<br/>
New York: Routledge Curzon, 2003.Isbn 0415305705<br/>
summarized here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/farmersofedo.html">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/farmersofedo.html</a><br/>
Steele is the only guy who laid a really good groundwork on the <br/>
dynamic background of Tama and its politics in the Meiji Era too (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Other than Hillsborough's book I *urge* her to read KINSE SHIRIAKU: A <br/>
HISTORY OF JAPAN which mentions the Shinsengumi and is pretty <br/>
detailed up until the very end of the war. Kinse is a good companion <br/>
to Boyer, Samuel Pellman, 1839-1875. Naval Surgeon; The Diary of Dr. <br/>
Samuel Pellman Boyer. Edited by Elinor Barnes and James A. Barnes. <br/>
Introd. by Allan Nevins. Bloomington, Indiana University Press [1963] <br/>
if she wants to take a peek at the Hakodate/Hokkaido theatre of 1869.<br/>
<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa, a member here, could recommend a number of solid <br/>
books in Japanese on the Bakumatsu (these are not the flimsy texts on <br/>
the era printed during the height of SHinsengumi popularity---but <br/>
academic texts)...and those books also approach teh Shinsengumi <br/>
maturely.  I don't know how long Ms. Hearn has studied Japanese but I <br/>
think she is lucky to have you to help with some research. So if she <br/>
does give the Shinsengumi a cameo role it would be an interesting <br/>
episode (^_^).  Fans here are pretty familiar with "Robot Shinsengumi <br/>
whose job was to Kill. Kill. and Kill some more" and we know better.  <br/>
I know she writes fiction/fantasy which frees her from all the <br/>
historical details but still based on the popularity of her work I <br/>
think people like her complex characterizations, and even the bad <br/>
boys in blue can offer alot of that. <br/>
<br/>
Kitsuno:<br/>
"Also, Haverford College has a huge collection of Anna Hartshorne's<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > letters - I got about 10 of them copied and sent to me, hoping to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get information on her life, but they were mostly letters written to <br/>
her -one appeared to be a love letter, and another one mentioned <br/>
Tsuda Ume, and also Inazo Nitobe. " <br/>
<br/>
If you and your co-editor have not already finished the book...and I <br/>
think you have....you will like THE ATTIC LETTERS compiled by <br/>
students at TSUDA COLLEGE...those letters Ume wrote to her American <br/>
mother could give a good parallel account to any info you had on <br/>
Hartshorne and would fill in the blanks or atleast lay a foundation <br/>
for the world in which ACH worked.  But if you read it already, just <br/>
ignore my rant.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I have with the Attic Letters was that it was not indexed <br/>
(really that detailed without an index is sad) and CENSORED by <br/>
students desperate to preserve an "image" of Ume (really Ume was a <br/>
good/normal human being, it is totally unnecessary for them to do <br/>
this).  This is the same problem we have with some Shinsengumi <br/>
research...the need to white wash -or- the other extreme can be seen <br/>
with Hillsborough, the obsession with painting them to be nothing but <br/>
villains.  Nothing like good ole' bias to stand in the way of a fair <br/>
inquiry.<br/>
<br/>
If you visit Japan...just go to the TSUDA COLLEGE collections and <br/>
don't tell them you research Hartshorne...otherwise that would tip <br/>
them off.  Just "mix" your research and request access to alot of <br/>
stuff. Even if the book comes out next year, maybe you can still <br/>
continue ACH research because you have insight into her! (^__^)<br/>
<br/>
"Love Letter" then you are lucky Haverford didn't put a restriction <br/>
on the collection...it was probably a cute letter yeah?  (*^_^*).  <br/>
The historical society where I work and other places must honor <br/>
family restrictions and time extensions on privacy (30, 50 years <br/>
etc). So it was very kind of the Hartshornes not to have done that.  <br/>
Since Tsuda was essentially Hartshorne's "boss", I assume that more <br/>
ACH material will discuss not only Tsuda but also Yamakawa Sutematsu <br/>
a key figure of the school.<br/>
<br/>
Kitsuno:<br/>
"You can find the collection with a google search on anna <br/>
hartshorne ...it was $10 plus 25 cents per page. One problem is that <br/>
since they are hand written, they are hard to read, at least for <br/>
me."  <br/>
<br/>
yes, as I mentioned in my previous reply, one can spend easily <br/>
hundreds of dollars on acquiring primary material and many places <br/>
will not let you take in a digital camera to photograph letters etc.  <br/>
Actually I'm pretty sure Hirotada and I have spent easily hundreds of <br/>
dollars, and I spent...well weeks scanning books in Japanese. I've <br/>
done alot of research using Eng. handwritten material...you would <br/>
think that back in the day when they took penmanship classes they <br/>
would try to make their cursive look more than lines across a page....<br/>
<br/>
Also if you ever come across Hartshorne and DOSHISHA UNIV. in Kyoto <br/>
send me an email too cuz, we have a major AIzu family who <br/>
established/ran that Christian school.  I wager that Hartshorne dealt <br/>
directly with Ibuka Kajinosuke (Aizu samurai) of Meiji Gakuin too. <br/>
It's a small small world of education and especially western style <br/>
education. Everyone knew each other too well.<br/>
<br/>
sorry about the rant...I'm obsessed with the post 1868 Aizu <br/>
network....where there is Aizu...there is the FUJITA family and <br/>
Saitou ofcourse :P</div>

  3. Yamanami Keisuke no jutsuryuu wa Hokushin Ittouryuu or Tennen Rishin Ryuu ?<br/>
      ( cause both is exist in different book )<br/>
  4. What did Kiyokawa do when Kondo and Serizawa (and their team) chosed to stay in <br/>

      Roshigumi)<br/>
  5. Hows the real relation between Kondo (or Hijikata) with Yamanami Keisuke ?<br/>
      I know theyre friend. But in Oishi Manabu (Shinsengumi. Saigo no bushi no jitsuzou), <br/>
      why Kondo was so happy when Yamanami will commit seppuku ? (or its just me who <br/>

<h3>Re: [SHQ] Question !!</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064725321">Shinoda-dono, here are my answers:<br/>
<br/>
1. Why bakufu allowed a peasant to become their troop ? (Roshigumi case)<br/>
<br/>
The shogunate needed manpower, and anyone who could hold a sword counted.<br/>
Think about it: Serizawa was in *jail* and he was allowed to join.<br/>
<br/>
2. When the bakufu government about to collapse, are the daimyou still doing<br/>
sankin koutai<br/>
or other bakufu laws ?<br/>
<br/>
Sankin-kotai was revised (essentially eliminated) in the early 1860s. Not<br/>
everyone stopped obeying the shogunate all at once...for instance, when<br/>
Satsuma had their ronin terrorizing Edo in early 1868, the shogunate ordered<br/>
Shonai, Kaminoyama, and other domains to surround the Satsuma yashiki, and<br/>
Shonai (and the others) obeyed.<br/>
(See: Totman, Conrad. Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu. Honolulu: University<br/>
of Hawai'i Press, 1980)<br/>
<br/>
3. Yamanami Keisuke no jutsuryuu wa Hokushin Ittouryuu or Tennen Rishin Ryuu<br/>
?<br/>
( cause both is exist in different book )<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami Keisuke-san no ryuuha wa Hokushin Ittouryuu darou? (Isn't<br/>
Yamanami's sword tradition Hokushin-ittoryu?) Do a search in our message<br/>
archive for Yamanami-- I've mentioned a theory before about his origins and<br/>
how they connect to Hokushin-ittoryu.<br/>
<br/>
4. What did Kiyokawa do when Kondo and Serizawa (and their team) chosed to<br/>
stay in Kyoto instead follow him ? Didnt he make any execution ? (since he<br/>
was the leader of Roshigumi)<br/>
<br/>
Kiyokawa's unit left soon after the split (see Oishi's "Shinsengumi" and<br/>
Kikuchi Akira's books).<br/>
<br/>
5. Hows the real relation between Kondo (or Hijikata) with Yamanami Keisuke<br/>
? I know theyre friend. But in Oishi Manabu (Shinsengumi. Saigo no bushi no<br/>
jitsuzou), why Kondo was so happy when Yamanami will commit seppuku ? (or<br/>
its just me who cant read the kanji)<br/>
<br/>
I have no comment on this right now.<br/>
<br/>
6. May I know what do you think about Shinsengumi beliefe ?<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by Shinsengumi's beliefs? You mean "makoto," or martial<br/>
(budo) skill, or (gasp) homosexuality, or what?<br/>

<h3>Re: [SHQ] Question !!</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237653890">For the sake of everyone else on the ML, I'll make this post bilingual.<br/>
<br/>
Rei-san: Hoka no mina mina sama no tame ni Eiyaku shiteimasu.<br/>
<br/>
Rei asks where the discussion on Yamanami took place-- it took place right<br/>
here on the ML. (Koko no yahoo mailing list no archive ni arimasu)<br/>
<br/>
Rei also asks if it could be true that he trained in 2 styles. My answer is<br/>
this-- cross-training was common in those days among serious martial<br/>
artists. (Sono jidai dewa, honki wo dasu bugeisha wa hitotsu no style ijou<br/>
wo mananda de arou? Eigo-de "cross-training" to iu. Motto tsuyoku naru tame<br/>
da to omou.)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Rei asks about the feelings/belief of Shinsengumi toward martial<br/>
training. As we all know, Shinsengumi was a group of people who were trained<br/>
and hired for the sake of doing "dirty work." Therefore it would be<br/>
important for them to keep themselves trained, because that's how they get<br/>
paid. Just like how any of us would work, and get the money we need to live,<br/>
the same applies to them. In order to earn what you need to live, you have<br/>
to be good at what you do. (Shinsengumi wa ken de ikita hitotachi de arou?<br/>
Hoka no mono wo shitakunai yaranakereba naranai koto wo shita kara, Aizu-han<br/>
kara kane wo itadaita. Dakara buki de issho kenmei renshu shinakereba<br/>
naranai. Watashitachi wa shigoto to ka kaisha ka dokka de hataraki, ikiru<br/>
tame ni daiji na kane wo itadaku you na koto da to omou-- watashitachi mo<br/>
issho kenmei hatarakanakerebanaranai)<br/>
<br/>
And finally she wants books.<br/>

Rei-san: Hoka no mina mina sama no tame ni Eiyaku shiteimasu.<br/>
<br/>
Rei asks where the discussion on Yamanami took place-- it took place right<br/>
here on the ML. (Koko no yahoo mailing list no archive ni arimasu)<br/>
<br/>
Rei also asks if it could be true that he trained in 2 styles. My answer is<br/>
this-- cross-training was common in those days among serious martial<br/>
artists. (Sono jidai dewa, honki wo dasu bugeisha wa hitotsu no style ijou<br/>
wo mananda de arou? Eigo-de "cross-training" to iu. Motto tsuyoku naru tame<br/>
da to omou.)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Rei asks about the feelings/belief of Shinsengumi toward martial<br/>
training. As we all know, Shinsengumi was a group of people who were trained<br/>
and hired for the sake of doing "dirty work." Therefore it would be<br/>
important for them to keep themselves trained, because that's how they get<br/>
paid. Just like how any of us would work, and get the money we need to live,<br/>
the same applies to them. In order to earn what you need to live, you have<br/>
to be good at what you do. (Shinsengumi wa ken de ikita hitotachi de arou?<br/>

of Kiyokawa Hachiro in order to get amnesty to all<br/>
those people (including himself).<br/>

joined Tennen Rishin after losing to Kondo Isami and<br/>
eventually he became even a shihandai.<br/>
<br/>
But Yamanami's original style was Hokushin Itto. If we<br/>
suppose that Yamanami and Todo have indeed convinced<br/>
Ito Kashitaro to join the troop, then the Hokushin<br/>
Itto link must have played a crucial role in it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let's remember also that we have two kinds of<br/>
cross-training: one involving practicing more than one<br/>
style, and other involving matches against other<br/>
styles.<br/>
<br/>
The latter was much more frequent. Although the styles<br/>
did have some "diplomatic connections", so to speak,<br/>
it wasn't that polite to practice more than one style<br/>
at a time, unless you had authorization for that<br/>
and/or had achieved mastery in one style before<br/>
learning another.<br/>
<br/>
Also, kenjutsu dojos were more than simply a place for<br/>
martial arts practice. They were a kind of political<br/>
party, so to speak, and some were very influential.<br/>
Therefore, the students who achieved a high status in<br/>
a dojo had to have not only a good proficiency with<br/>
swords, but also a fine education.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not to mention that the core members of the<br/>
Shinsengumi were originally martial arts<br/>
practitioners. Even Ito Kashitaro, who tends to be<br/>
more known for his erudition, was the headmaster of<br/>
the Hokushin Itto-ryu, a style created by his adoptive<br/>
father, Ito Seiichi, and derived from Hokushin<br/>
Itto-ryu. Yeah, the pronunciation is the same, but the<br/>
kanji (ideograms) are different.<br/>
<br/>
They were recruited by Aizu because of their purposes<br/>
and more importantly, of their martial arts skills.<br/>
Hence lots of emphasis were given in the training. Not<br/>
to mention stuff like "shiniban" and all.<br/>
<br/>
Talking about Aizu, found recently a magazine, owned<br/>
by my grandfather, issued in 1928 by Aizu-kai, an<br/>
organization of Aizu-related people, having as members<br/>
people like Yamakawa Kenjiro. Although there is no<br/>
mention to Shinsengumi, there are some tidbits of<br/>
information about Boshin War and the Aizu fief, from<br/>
the Aizu point of view. It's also interesting to read<br/>
a bit about Saigo Tanomo and the rendition of Aizu.<br/>
Not to mention some rare pictures taken at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way, yes, there MAY be a connection with<br/>
Shinsengumi. One of the associates of Aizu-kai is a<br/>
certain Fujita Tsutomu, which sounds suspiciously like<br/>
Fujita Goro(Saito Hajime)'s son. If one finds out that<br/>
Saito Hajime's son was in the Army (Lt. Colonel, if<br/>
I'm not mistaken) in 1928, then chances are that this<br/>
Fujita Tsutomu is indeed Saito's son.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Serizawa, thank you for your information.  Oh we put you on the <br/>
thank you list on the new site as well (^_^).  For new members here, <br/>
just so you know Serizawa has been very generous to us over these <br/>
many years and we are happy to hear form him when he has the time to <br/>
write to us.<br/>
<br/>
1928 it is really a critical year and I think alot of surviving 1st <br/>
or second generation Aizu folks became very ACTIVE.  Because of the <br/>
marriage between Matsudaira Setsuko (granddaughter of Matsudaira <br/>
Katamori and Prince Chichibu---brother of Emperor Hirohito).  The <br/>
information we posted on the SHQ site for a long time now is about <br/>
how in 1928, Fujita Goro's sword (one of perhaps no doubt many he <br/>
owned) was made a gift during this important wedding.<br/>
<br/>
Yamakawa was a key figure in this wedding and discussed the matter <br/>
with Matsudaira TSuneo (son of Matsudaira Katamori).  SO we can see <br/>
how one generation of retainers...carries his duties over regardless <br/>
of era.<br/>
<br/>
1928 is also year of the EArth Dragon.  Interestingly...similar to <br/>
The Boshin War of 1868.  It is just a coincedence...maybe.  The <br/>
Imperial wedding was meant to also symbolize a reincorporation of <br/>
Aizu back into the mainstream (politically).<br/>
<br/>
Since we know Fujita Tsutomu and Matsudaira Tsuneo were actually <br/>
friends I sort of would like to think that the possibility is very <br/>
very high that indeed "Fujita Tsutomu" is GOro and Tokio's oldest son.<br/>
(^_^) but by 1928 he would be long retired from the army...maybe they <br/>
included his last rank or something?<br/>
<br/>
Aizukai kaiho?? (Report of the Aizu Society)---this could be the same <br/>
magazine likely...it is so valuable to us.  <br/>
<br/>
For example although it is not connected to the Shinsengumi, this <br/>
magazine contains narratives you WILL NOT FIND IN ENGLISH AT ALL.  We <br/>
can read the best books in English and it can tell us the politics, <br/>
the international diplomacy, the statistics but rarely a human <br/>
narrative.<br/>
<br/>
For example a narrative by a woman on what happened in the war <br/>
(specifically at Aizu).<br/>
<br/>
I was close to obtaining Kinoko Takamine, "Takamine Kinokojiden," <br/>
Aizukai kaiho (April 1970). But ultimately I failed.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to read about how a mother (widowed) was trying to survive <br/>
through these hard times.  <br/>
<br/>
Takamine Kinoko's relation to Takagi Tokio (Fujita Tokio) was that of <br/>
an aunt and no doubt was a maternal figure to Tokio, this is a story <br/>
Takamine Kinoko would relate to female survivors of Aizu (such as <br/>
Tokio).</div>

  For Serizawa sama, could you please explain more about Hows exactly Kiyokawa get the amnesty for all those people (you meant Roshigumi, right ?) ?<br/>
   <br/>
  About Yamanami, Yes his original style was Hokushin Ittoryuu.<br/>
  But, could anyone help me according to the book "Shinsengumi. Shunretsu Mibu Roushi no Chuu to Zan" Rekishi Gunzou Shiri-zu 31.(2003) Publised by Gakken, page 126-128 in artikel wrote by one Shinsengumi kenkyuuka, Itou Seirou, about Yamanami Keisuke ?<br/>
  Something about when Yamanami joined Shieikan-Tennen Rishin Ryuu in 1860 based from data file Shinsengumi 'Ryouyuushiden' (1907).....<br/>
  ( cause I cant read the whole kanji.. -_- ;; )<br/>
