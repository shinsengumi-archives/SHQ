<h3>[SHQ] Survey.</h3>
by <i>aishiterukouji</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-612267643">1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you<br/>
would like us to <br/>
know about you)<br/>
<br/>
My name is simply Yuki. (Real name Yukiko) Screen Name<br/>
for everything: KoujiDaisuki76   (Yea yea you all know<br/>
what it means. ^_^x) Or you can call me the name<br/>
secretary calls me. <br/>
<br/>
2) How did you discover the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
I was watching Good Will Hunting I think. My sister<br/>
knowing I was obsess with Japanese History and Rurouni<br/>
Kenshin switched the channels and what you know<br/>
Shinsengumi !<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
<br/>
Hai! My Favorite Shinsengumi member is Hijikata<br/>
Toshizou becasue I admire his personality and I can<br/>
relate to him in certain ways. He became my favorite<br/>
character when I found out that he was once a farmer<br/>
and how he worked hard to be part of history. Kondo<br/>
Isami did the same I know but Hijikata to me is more<br/>
interesting. <br/>
<br/>
For ceratin reasons I don't like Okita Souji as much<br/>
as the other members. My other second favorite<br/>
Shinsengumi Member is Yamanami Keisuke or Saitou<br/>
Hajime (Can't decide) and My third favorite would be<br/>
either Harada Sanosuke or Todou Heisuke.<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
<br/>
Um. Nhk Shinsengumi. One episode of Shinsengumi<br/>
kepproku(Sry if I spelled it wrong) I would liek to<br/>
watch Gohatto. Peace Maker Kurogane, Rurouni Kenshin.<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film<br/>
(or series) do you <br/>
think captured your favorite member(s) the best and<br/>
why?<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh, Nhk Shinsengumi best captured Hijikata<br/>
Toshizou and Yamanami. If you compare the pictures, to<br/>
me Hijikata looks like the orignal one. I can't really<br/>
say Nhk best captured Yamanami though, since I haven;t<br/>
read much about him. But I do love Hijikata in NHK.<br/>
Kouji Yamamoto did a great job protraying him.<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you<br/>
about any <br/>
particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
<br/>
After Kondo died, what excatly did Hijikata do? I know<br/>
he went up North and died by a bullet shot but are<br/>
their any details about it?<br/>
<br/>
KoujiDaisuki76<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I Love Kouji<br/>
