<h3>A Chatroom Idea</h3>
by <i>shenlong71328</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-159416914">Alright, this is just an idea I'm throwing out there for all to  consider.   The Shinsengumi/Edoji/& Spy division have a  an excellent home and message board going all thanks to the sweat and  blood of the presistant fans that keep the mailing lists going  strong.  My idea was, how 'bout we make a chatroom?    Maybe not on the actual site but on mIRC... Somewhere were we can all  meet and chit chat about everything and anything that comes to  mind.   It'll be a great way to get to know the memebers of  the 3 mailing lists.   What do you guys think?<br/>

<h3>Re: A Chatroom Idea</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503962987">I think that you have a great idea<br/>
some things to consider:<br/>
<br/>
1) in the past we've had chats based on appointments because some of <br/>
us live in different states and countries however we never realize <br/>
that sometimes the chats generate new details based on our questions <br/>
to more knowledgeable members (those who know Japanese or have <br/>
studied this topic for a long time)<br/>
<br/>
2) so you may want to consider asking all participants if they are <br/>
willing to have their chats be stored and posted for those who cannot <br/>
attend chats---or if not then perhaps we can replace their names with <br/>
anonymous labels<br/>
<br/>
3) you may also want to make use of the forums in existence for <br/>
example there is a forum here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hajimenokizu">http://www.hajimenokizu</a> and post <br/>
questions there too<br/>
<br/>
4) if a chat is designed to be more history based then some members <br/>
may want to introduce themselves to -prevent- misunderstandings <br/>
(because we are all typing and we can't hear each other's voices and <br/>
figure out the other person's tone)<br/>
<br/>
I will use myself as an example<br/>
<br/>
****if someone asks me a history question on a topic I feel <br/>
comfortable in answering---I will use whatever information I know <br/>
from reading texts in English (just because we know where the info <br/>
comes from)--I may in fact ****AGREE WITH YOU**** on a {personal} <br/>
level however I will ignore my own gut feeling until I can prove it <br/>
somehow <br/>
<br/>
****however if you want me to SPECULATE in a fictional sense (like if <br/>
someone wants a plot bunny for a fic) I can do so just like any other <br/>
fangirl---and then some!!! like I have 100 theories for everything <br/>
(but I also have fangirl speculation vs. speculation using history as <br/>
a framework) too<br/>
<br/>
****what I'm saying is when we discuss these Shinsengumi topics be <br/>
aware that many of us can assume many, many, many stances---and when <br/>
we state something it is not some attack on person---but trying <br/>
to "think out loud" to figure out something---that's how we learn<br/>
<br/>
and thank you Bunny for always contributing to the timeline which is <br/>
undergoing revision....again (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Bunny you should also feel free to take the lead too if you feel that <br/>
there will be alot of interest --- and please encourage people not to <br/>
be so shy!!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427918280">I love this idea! <br/>
<br/>
Secretary's suggestions sound very practical, and I<br/>
know I personally would appreciate a chat<br/>
"appointment" and also the archives - I'd like to see<br/>
what went on in the chat, seeing as how I don't know<br/>
how often I'd be able to participate. Also, many of my<br/>
Japanese friends are extremely amused that such a<br/>
thing as an English Language Shinsengumi mailing list<br/>
exists! <br/>
<br/>
With best wishes, <br/>
<br/>
Mio. <br/>
<br/>
PS. Bunneh, I have not forgotten that I'm linking your<br/>
pics for my story when I upload the next chapter - the<br/>
problem is getting around to finishing the darn thing.<br/>

 One other person eh?   I don't  know... it might have been be... maybe someone else?    Hopefully we'll get more people in there as time goes by... and like  many other chatrooms, it could be a 24 hour chat ^^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788391716">Grrrr... just noticed that for some reason the  attacked file didn't appear in the e-mail, so here are the  instructions.   If you guys have any more questions, feel  free to send me a mail ^^<br/>
  <br/>
  ~ * ~ * ~<br/>
  When the window first opens you get a pop up with some  freaky looking dude.   Just hit the  Continue button.   The next screen has  4 areas to fill out, fill them out and then hit Cancel and NOT OK.<br/>
              Next you will see only a blank screen.   On the line all the way to the bottom type  in /server aurora.caelestia.net and hit enter.   The screen called mIRC Favorites will  appear.   On the right, click on the  button Add.   Under channel type in  #ShinsengumiHQ and hit the add button all the way in the bottom.   This will take you back to the previous page  and have the channel highlighted.   All  you do from there is either doubleclick on the chatroom name or highlight it  and hit join on the right of the popup.<br/>
   Hopefully that is helpful.   I know, I know, its a bit confusing at first  (I got extremely confused when I first did this).   Well, hope to see you guys in there ^_^<br/>
