<h3>Toba-Fushimi through Nagakura&#39;s eyes</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758019898">"On the 3rd, 25 or 26 men under Okita, Nagakura, Harada and others,<br/>
were gathered in the meeting hall of the Fushimi Magistrate's offices,<br/>
and drinking good sake. Around 4 PM they saw Satsuma men rolling<br/>
cannons into position around Gokomiya, a shrine which had a good<br/>
commanding view of the other Bakufu forces' encampment. It seemed that<br/>
war was about to start and could come suddenly, so [the Shinsengumi<br/>
men] prepared to be deployed at a moment's notice. That night at<br/>
around 7, the cannons at Gokomiya erupted. Every building in Fushimi<br/>
became a target. The Magistrate's office also took about 10<br/>
hits...vice-commander Hijikata, sensing that this was it, gathered the<br/>
men in the courtyard and ordered an all-out offensive. First they<br/>
brought out the cannon that was assigned to the magistrate's office,<br/>
and then pointing it at the Satsuma positions at Gokomiya, began to<br/>
fire. The Satsuma forces saw this and zeroed in, unleashing a<br/>
withering barrage of fire. After about half an hour the cannonade<br/>
continued, and so Nagakura's 2nd Unit was detached as an assault team<br/>
and ordered to disrupt the enemy positions.<br/>
Nagakura and his sergeants Shimada Kai and Ito Tetsugoro led the men<br/>
over the earthen wall and charged the Satsuma camp. Swinging their<br/>
swords, Nagakura and his men bravely struck the enemy, Satsuma men<br/>
under Nozu Shigekatsu, who were forced to retreat. They gave chase for<br/>
about three cho, and then found that the houses on both sides of the<br/>
road were aflame, and no advance was possible. Out of options,<br/>
Nagakura and his men withdrew to the earthen wall outside the<br/>
magistrate's office, intending to return inside. However, Nagakura's<br/>
armor was heavy and he could not climb over the wall, so his sergeant<br/>
Shimada Kai extended his rifle, and pulled it up over the wall with<br/>
Nagakura hanging off. Those who saw were shocked at the extent of his<br/>
[Shimada's] strength."<br/>

<br/>
Been awhile; hope you all are doing well.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that Shinsengumi saw the cannons later used for<br/>
the surprise attack, being rolled into place at Gokomiya. Some of us<br/>
know the story of Nagakura being pulled up over a wall at<br/>
Toba-Fushimi; apparently this is it. For the longest time I thought it<br/>
was a spear Shimada used, but apparently it was a rifle.</div>

<br/>
Okita, "Ummm this is some good sake it's making me see things..."<br/>
<br/>
Harada "Yeah I see cannons being moved around..."<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura "Should we tell someone?"<br/>
<br/>
Okita "If we told the Bakufu command would they care or listen to us?"<br/>
<br/>
So I wonder if the "higher ups" were informed at all.  Or was it a wait <br/>
and see game --- obviously the cannons illustrated Satsuma intent to <br/>
use them (duh) but this description by Old Nagakura is a bit weird.<br/>
<br/>
It would be hilarious if he recorded all this in the third person<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The really really short answer is Shimada Kai was one of the very few<br/>
Shinsengumi who stayed with Hijikata during the move north to<br/>
Hokkaido.  After serving a brief detention after the war, Shimada Kai<br/>
continued to live in the Meiji era and left behind a record of<br/>
Shinsengumi activities.  From past discussions (this is from my memory<br/>
mind you) he did not wish to seek government employment and this or<br/>
may not be connected to his views on the new order.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> website is a search bar in the<br/>
upper left hand corner and if you type in "Shimada Kai" every page on<br/>
which his name appears should be pulled up for you to browse.<br/>
<br/>
--------[Extra Info]--------<br/>
<br/>
Some of Shimada Kai's writing is invaluable in terms of cross checking<br/>
some facts and Hirotada wrote a great summary comparing what Shimada<br/>
said about the name "Shinsengumi" and perhaps a more likely explanation:<br/>
<br/>
"What's in a Name?"--Shimada Kai and the Question of Shinsengumi's<br/>
Name [return to top]<br/>
<br/>
by Hirotada Tokugawa(Shimazu Masayoshi)<br/>
<br/>
According to Shimada Kai's record, the name "Shinsengumi" was received<br/>
by the Buke-denso (Imperial Messengers) following the unit's<br/>
performance on 8/18/Bunkyu 3. However, Tsuri Yoichi, in "Doujidainin<br/>
wo mita Matsudaira Katamori" (appearing in "Matsudaira Katamori no<br/>
Subete"), points out that after the incident, on the day that the<br/>
group received the name "Shinsengumi," the buke-denso-- Nomiya<br/>
Sadanori and Asukai Masanori-- were confined from meeting with anyone<br/>
on that day, since they were in the list of 20 nobles in Sanjo<br/>
Chunagon Sanetomi's group who were similarly confined. "Therefore,<br/>
there is no way," Tsuri says, "that they could have been there to<br/>
bestow the name of 'Shinsengumi'. If we are to trust Shimada Kai's<br/>
record and believe they were the ones who bestowed the name, they<br/>
would have had to bestowed it prior to the 8/18 incident. Therefore it<br/>
is more probable that Katamori or one of the men close to him bestowed<br/>
the name instead."<br/>

Matsudaira Katamori no Subete, Tsunabuchi Kenjo, ed. Tokyo: Shin<br/>
Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1984, pp. 161-162)<br/>
<br/>
Katamori bestowed the funerary name of<br/>
Kanteninden-junchuuseigi-daikoji upon the late Kondou Isami following<br/>
the latter's burial in Aizu.<br/>
