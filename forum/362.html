<h3>Book Recommendation</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443337270">I just borrowed this from one of the suburban branches of the library <br/>
and while I&#39;ve only begun to read it, it seems to me to be a definite <br/>
&quot;must buy&quot; for anyone interested in the period as the first 200 pages <br/>
(give or take) deals with the end of his father&#39;s reign and the Revolution.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fairly new book (2002) and a large one with close to 900 pages <br/>
which includes extensive and informative footnotes and bibliography.<br/>

Emperor of Japan--Meiji and His World 1852--1912<br/>
<br/>
by Donald Keene<br/>
<br/>
Columbia University Press<br/>
<br/>
ISBN: 0-231-12340-X<br/>
<br/>
I found it for sale through the Amazon marketplace for  $23.50 quite a <br/>
break on the publisher&#39;s cover price of $40<br/>
