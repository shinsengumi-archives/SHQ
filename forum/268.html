<h3>S.H. NEW INFO!!!!!!!!</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911497656">uh oh you think...Tiffany is using babelfish again...<br/>
-NOPE-<br/>
My university had a special event with artists/delegates from the<br/>
Chiba Perfecture Japan (sister city to my city)(dance/kendo<br/>
demo/puppet skit/blurb on the hakkenden etc) and so I attended the event.<br/>
I just ~happen~ to be carrying around the book Saitou Hajime No Subete<br/>
with me and I tried to communicate with them.  Fortunatly, they happen<br/>
to know about the Shinsengumi (one lady definately knew about S.H.<br/>
based on the film Mibugishiden because I heard her say Sato <br/>
Hiroshi---the name of the actor who played S.H. in the film---I'm<br/>
pretty sure) and so they were flipping through the book and chattering<br/>
amongst themselves for a while and I was just standing there like the<br/>
idiot that I am...I didn't want to impose and say "translate this<br/>
now!" (Like we do to Serizawa Kamo and Shimazuryu)...of all the pics<br/>
they picked out ones of where Saitou lived before finding work in Tokyo...<br/>
<br/>
p.147 +148 (Shimazuryu if you are interested) pic shows a forest and<br/>
the 2nd shows an empty field (used to have houses)<br/>
<br/>
p.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern building<br/>
used as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it<br/>
wasn't a prison/jail but a "place where people could not leave until<br/>
they know they did wrong"...so I was trying to ask her if he committed<br/>
a crime or did something 'bad' (robbery, murder etc) of some sort and<br/>
she said 'no' and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he was<br/>
a police officer?  And I was like "yes" (so the pages must deal w/<br/>
Fujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word "discipline" and so<br/>
she was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,<br/>
disciplinary issue and this detention center that he "stayed" at.  I<br/>
kept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like yes<br/>
he stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he WORKED<br/>
there...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because if you<br/>
think about it --- it wouldn't be a good idea to throw a cop in a<br/>
prison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he was<br/>
formerly "disciplined" for something...because I trying really hard to<br/>
be sure that he wasn't just a prison guard but she was trying to<br/>
communicate that he did something 'bad' but not 'criminal'.<br/>
<br/>
Geez...maybe there is something to S.H. being a "psycho-cop" as Misao<br/>
said -_-<br/>
<br/>
Will scan pics when I can get to a scanner.</div>

reading this was Aku Soku Zan = S.H. was maybe the "Dirty Harry" of his <br/>
day. Can we not picture him dispatching the criminal element by whatever <br/>
means necessary?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090041750">Ironically, I've been reduced to watching prison history on "History <br/>
Channel" today...  I don't know how similar Japanese imprisonment <br/>
systems were to western at the time, but given that so much of the <br/>
police and armed forces were being patterned after European models, I <br/>
would expect them working on similar ideas in prison reform.<br/>
<br/>
If they were incorporating western ideas (or maybe it was practiced <br/>
in Japan, too, before westernization attempts), it would NOT be <br/>
unusual for Fujita Gorou to be living at the facility as an <br/>
employee.  What I'm getting from all of this history on prisons <br/>
(again, US & European... unfortunately) is that it was more usual for <br/>
prison staff to live on or near the prison grounds in the 19th into <br/>
the 20th centuries, from the warden on down.   Alcatraz, for <br/>
instance, had a community for staff families on the island itself.  <br/>
What are the dates for this assignment?  Was it before he married <br/>
Tokio & his sons were born?  I can imagine the bachelor Fujita (or <br/>
even married) living in quarters at the facility.  From what you are <br/>
saying the woman told you, it sounds to me that that was exactly the <br/>
case --- he was an officer working at the detention center and he <br/>
lived there like other staff.  I don't come to the conclusion you <br/>
do.  (But then, my head is currently stuffed with prison history... :-<br/>
D)  Needs to be explored!!<br/>
<br/>
*DEFINITELY* fascinating new info, though.  I've been thinking <br/>
recently about how he might regard incarceration --- in terms of <br/>
practices and who he could be seeing locked up... maybe more & more <br/>
young people (ahem... like Sano)without opportunity and few options <br/>
but to turn to crime just to eat.  Anyone have any good sources for <br/>
info about crime statistics during the Meiji, especially in the first <br/>
decade or two? (and more than how many were arrested for peeing in <br/>
public!)<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to know more when you find out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556039382">Yes, Phil, I was thinking the same exact thing you are thinking (I<br/>
kinda cropped my post below) and the overall tone is that he was the<br/>
one being detained.  Now, I am in the process of getting this book in<br/>
the hands of someone who knows Japanese & the Shinsengumi. Yes, I am<br/>
trying to approach this with caution...and as soon as I can get to a<br/>
scanner I will scan the photo and the paragraph...because the<br/>
"letters" right below the pic are also headers for a paragraph...so<br/>
I'm eager to get everything crystal clear.<br/>

I somehow missed the last sentence of your story... more like misread <br/>

so now I'm more than curious as to what the situation was.  How can <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215488907">Pity, I should have videotaped myself courteously "interrogating" this<br/>
kind lady...then there were other Japanese people who came over to<br/>
take a look at the book:)...then one person walked away with it for a<br/>
while...LOL...I'm Asian so everyone is like "Nihongo xxxxx" "Can you<br/>
speak Japanese" I AM carrying around a book written in Japanese...<br/>
<br/>
I tried my best guys to be absolutely clear on this new piece of<br/>
info...the funny thing is while I was trying to get a clear<br/>
differentiation between "stay" vs. "worked", then "bad" not "criminal"<br/>
then she adds "discipline" to make things complicated!<br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of getting this book into the hands of another<br/>
person who knows Japanese and can probably add some more details. So<br/>
we are crystal clear...if it wasn't for Serizawa I would be pointing<br/>
to my head and saying "fundoshi"<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking would his superiors really care if he broke some kind<br/>
of regulation while dealing with a common criminal?  I wonder....hmmmmm.<br/>

yes, alcoholism -used- to be blamed.<br/>
<br/>
Ofcourse he drank...if I'm understanding the Japanese sites he even<br/>
competed in drinking contests while he was in the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Grace I was thinking along the same lines as you too:)  And<br/>
would his superiors care if he roughed up some criminals?  Maybe<br/>
another officer made an off hand comment about the Shinsengumi and he<br/>
taught them a lesson or something LOL<br/>

<br/>
You can see Sooji-temple opposite to the city assembly hall at 1-7-22<br/>
Teramachi if you get off at Takada station on the main line between<br/>
Nagano and Niigata, take a way toward south, and turn to right at a T<br/>
corner.  <br/>
<br/>
After Boshin-war , samurais of the old Aizu  Clan who fought against<br/>
Meiji government outside of Aizu-wakamatsu castle were on their best<br/>
behaviors at Tera-machi of Takada.  According to (1)Takada Omote<br/>
On-azukari Hitobito Betsu in (2) Takada Kinshinchuu Zakki that lists<br/>
people who were put them on their best behaviors, Hajime Saitoo is<br/>
recorded as Denpachi Ichinose among Suzaku  menbers who were<br/>
accommodated in Temple Sooji-ji.   According to (3) Aihan Hokuetsu<br/>
Takada Kinshinnin Mei, (4) Echigo Takada Tsume Myoosai Yuujin Choo,<br/>
and (5) Aizu-han Takada Yuushuu Meibo, while he was on his best<br/>
behaviors, he is recorded as his false name, Denpachi Ichinose again.<br/>
<br/>
It is confirmed by the list that puts the names of people who<br/>
immigrated to Tonan in 1869, that Hajime Saitoo used the name, Goroo<br/>
Fujita when he moved to Tonan.  He moved to Goko after he changed his<br/>
name from Denpachi Ichinose to Goroo Fujita, and became a Tonan citizen.</div>

Hajime Saitoo is<br/>
"recorded as Denpachi Ichinose among Suzaku  menbers who were<br/>
accommodated in Temple Sooji-ji."   <br/>

<br/>
This refers back to "Remembering Aizu:The Testament of SHiba Goro" ed.<br/>

"Shujakutai (South): Men from eighteen to thirty-five, who would<br/>

Tera-machi, under a different name... Oh how many names can there <br/>

Well when it says "best behavior", what does that mean? As it said <br/>
this place was for Aizu samurais who fought against the Meiji... So <br/>
does this mean that they were actually being detained? Or did they <br/>
detain themselves "at will" (in best behavior), because doing <br/>
otherwise would be futile? What does this best behavior meant?<br/>

<h3>Re: S.H. NEW INFO!(TRANSLATION HERE) Clarification</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245855259">I met ~very~ briefly with the translator today...she is a Japanese<br/>
language instructor with a specialization in linguistics and your<br/>
question was on my list.<br/>
<br/>
"best behavior" isn't a description -all- the time, it is like a stock<br/>
phrase to label prisoners, [but] in this specific case he was really<br/>
was a good prisoner...it is a detention center on the grounds of a<br/>
Buddhist temple...if you recall back to the Miburo Yahoo Groups list<br/>
we did list his names (this is from memory)<br/>
1) Yamaguchi Hajime (also written as Hazime)<br/>
2) Saitou/o/oh Hajime<br/>
3) Yamaguchi Jiro/u<br/>
4) Denpachi Ichinohe<br/>
5) Fujita Goro/ou<br/>
<br/>
*this translation further proves the accuracy of the the book<br/>
"Remembering Aizu:The Testament of Shiba Goro" which describes the<br/>
exact same thing.  Samurai detained in various camps were even allowed<br/>
to leave the camp to but medicine for example as long as they were<br/>
"good"/trustworthy and according to the book many samurai had too much<br/>
pride to just run away (perhaps part of the "rules" of engagement if<br/>
there any really)<br/>
<br/>
*Tonan=Tonami Shimokita, the translator explained...thus he was<br/>
detained here and then moved<br/>
<br/>
*I really wanted to ask her more but she seemed busy and I didn't want<br/>
to annoy her that is all the info I could get :)<br/>
