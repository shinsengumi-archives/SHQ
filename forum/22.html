<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986902197">I name the fiction list "SHQ Spy Division"?  I'm flirting with the <br/>
spy theme because we're telling stories... sometimes stories <br/>
characters probably wouldn't want told.  I think that Yahoogroups <br/>
searches the group description, so having Saitou's name in there <br/>
would still pull it up on a search by his name...<br/>
