It's about his assasination...he was the guy in NHK's "Shinsengumi!" <br/>
<br/>
I have also uploaded some of the articles concerning the police <br/>
system and Seinan War, including the eyewitness account by Hubbard <br/>
(which is one of the sources used by Ravina I'm sure in describing <br/>
the body+head of Saigo).<br/>
<br/>
I have not read all the articles.<br/>
Also, I posted 2 articles on women...I will get the info on women <br/>
and the opening of bank accounts in the early 20th century as part <br/>
of a more quiet movement for women's rights (I read one sentence in <br/>
a dusty old journal but SADLY the article is not on JSTOR.org)...the <br/>
time period matches Tokio's life exactly...and the movement DOES <br/>
start in Tokyo as there was a population of educated women there.</div>

 </span></blockquote>****ofcourse it doesn't mean that all women with money who opened <br/>
bank accounts were part of this movement but it was one of the <br/>
things women who supported the movement did to make a <br/>
point...interestingly in the newpaper article which mentioned Tokio <br/>
it [still] had to cite her husband and his job</div>
