<h3>Know They Enemy Pt 1</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-53289571">I posted the first thrilling installment of my report on Katsura,<br/>
Saigo and Okubo in both the group files and on the ShiinsengumiHQ<br/>
website in the &quot;Facts&quot; section.<br/>
<br/>
Note to Philalexandros--- the Seagraves (whose book I got the info<br/>
from) appear to be Saigo fans though I refuse to think or refer to him<br/>
as a gentle bear of a man. _They_ site his greatest flaw as &quot;sincerity&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Go figure<br/>
