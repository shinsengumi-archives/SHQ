<h3>Chat? 6/27</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899673391">*remember, you can chat with friends anytime over at the<br/>
http://www.shinsengumimb.com...please don't feel as if you have to<br/>
wait for these "official" ones<br/>
<br/>
[Sunday June 27, 2004]<br/>
New York 5:00 pm	<br/>
Los Angeles 2:00pm<br/>
Chicago 4:00 pm	<br/>
Sao Paulo/Buenos Aires 6:00 pm<br/>
As a courtesy to our patient friends in Japan, Tokyo (Monday 6:00 am) -_-<br/>
<br/>
I chose this date because we had a recent string of good topics and<br/>
otherwise we would have to wait at least a couple more weeks for a<br/>
chat because I know that on the 4th of July you all are planning<br/>
crossover patriotic Shinsengumi themed barbeques<br/>
<br/>
*I am ~aware~ that a certain character portrayed by someone's favorite<br/>
actor will be assasinated this week or next week on NHK Shinsengumi! <br/>
If this is the case we will have to push back the time (that being<br/>
said I will miss 60 min. of the chat and [not] be able to maintain a<br/>
transcript...so someone has to take up this task ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Possible Topics to discuss (based on topic popularity):<br/>
Shinsengumi Grandpas ("Don't Mess With Miki" & Nagakura at the Movies)<br/>
Nagakura + Saitou after the Restoration <br/>
(The Absence of Saitou's name on the Cenotaph and its implications)<br/>
Saitou's words <br/>
Shinsengumi Spirits?<br/>
[More] Shinsengumi Stories?<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
recalling momoiro's words on the fear of having your soul sucked in by<br/>
the camera...<br/>
Tokio to Hajime/Goro "Anata, I have set up an appointment for a family<br/>
portrait I already had your uniformed dry cleaned and---"<br/>
Hajime/Goro "Woman?! Are you planning to kill me?"<br/>
Tokio in chibi mode [sweatdrop]</div>

 </span></blockquote>I'm sure the spirit of Capt. Okita would like to remind you all that <br/>
pork products are discouraged.....while Capt. Saitou encourages <br/>
consumption of soba dishes and along with  Capt. Suzuki reminds you not <br/>
to forget the liquor hehehe<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don't think the time needs to be changed it's on tv at 8--8:45 NewYork <br/>
time so if someone can make sure to get a transcript for that 45 min I'd <br/>
be eternally grateful<br/>

Hehehe... one more thing Hajime and the roosterhead agree on? (thinking of the RK episode "Danger on a Runaway Locomotive," where Kaoru forces Sano to have his picture taken)<br/>
 <br/>
Sano:  "Hey man, I thought you were spending the day with the family"<br/>
Hajime: "The wife made an appointment for a family portrait"<br/>
Sano, grabbing Hajime & holding him close [sweatdrop]: "No!  She's not going to take you away from me THAT way!"<br/>

Was Miki in on a plot to destroy Sagara???  MissB, you gonna be there?  How about you, SK?  You going to be there to keep me in line on Saigou?  :-D  (BTW, SK, MissB has given me sufficient reason to believe that Saigou had nothing to do with it...)<br/>

(I don't know, Kevin... just how many times *can* you watch Serizawa's assassination?)<br/>
(Not that that's what's going to happen on NHK this week... I'm not sure *who* bites the dust... I *do* know, however, who the favorite actor is. :-D)<br/>

So there's not going to be one for the next weekend either? Well, I guess that means the next chat will be the weekend after, so I'll be missing that one as well... -sigh-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I have a kenbu presentation on this very day, I'm<br/>
not sure if I'll be able to attend the chat, since I'm<br/>
not sure if I'll be home at that time, but I will try<br/>
to show up, at least later on. Either way, I hope that<br/>
the chat will be fun, as always :) <br/>
<br/>
And definitely, after reading momoiro-usagi's comments<br/>
to Tama, I am certain that reading Japanese in romaji<br/>
is very different from reading Japanese in Japanese<br/>
(now, tell me some news :P)<br/>
