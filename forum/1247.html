<h3>Chat? 6/27</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899673391">*remember, you can chat with friends anytime over at the<br/>
http://www.shinsengumimb.com...please don&#39;t feel as if you have to<br/>
wait for these &quot;official&quot; ones<br/>
<br/>
[Sunday June 27, 2004]<br/>
New York 5:00 pm	<br/>
Los Angeles 2:00pm<br/>
Chicago 4:00 pm	<br/>
Sao Paulo/Buenos Aires 6:00 pm<br/>
As a courtesy to our patient friends in Japan, Tokyo (Monday 6:00 am) -_-<br/>
<br/>
I chose this date because we had a recent string of good topics and<br/>
otherwise we would have to wait at least a couple more weeks for a<br/>
chat because I know that on the 4th of July you all are planning<br/>
crossover patriotic Shinsengumi themed barbeques<br/>
<br/>
*I am ~aware~ that a certain character portrayed by someone&#39;s favorite<br/>
actor will be assasinated this week or next week on NHK Shinsengumi! <br/>
If this is the case we will have to push back the time (that being<br/>
said I will miss 60 min. of the chat and [not] be able to maintain a<br/>
transcript...so someone has to take up this task ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Possible Topics to discuss (based on topic popularity):<br/>
Shinsengumi Grandpas (&quot;Don&#39;t Mess With Miki&quot; & Nagakura at the Movies)<br/>
Nagakura + Saitou after the Restoration <br/>
(The Absence of Saitou&#39;s name on the Cenotaph and its implications)<br/>
Saitou&#39;s words <br/>
Shinsengumi Spirits?<br/>
[More] Shinsengumi Stories?<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
recalling momoiro&#39;s words on the fear of having your soul sucked in by<br/>
the camera...<br/>
Tokio to Hajime/Goro &quot;Anata, I have set up an appointment for a family<br/>
portrait I already had your uniformed dry cleaned and---&quot;<br/>
Hajime/Goro &quot;Woman?! Are you planning to kill me?&quot;<br/>
Tokio in chibi mode [sweatdrop]</div>

pork products are discouraged.....while Capt. Saitou encourages <br/>
consumption of soba dishes and along with  Capt. Suzuki reminds you not <br/>
to forget the liquor hehehe<br/>

time so if someone can make sure to get a transcript for that 45 min I&#39;d <br/>
be eternally grateful<br/>

Hehehe... one more thing Hajime and the roosterhead agree on? (thinking of the RK episode &quot;Danger on a Runaway Locomotive,&quot; where Kaoru forces Sano to have his picture taken)<br/>
 <br/>
Sano:  &quot;Hey man, I thought you were spending the day with the family&quot;<br/>
Hajime: &quot;The wife made an appointment for a family portrait&quot;<br/>
Sano, grabbing Hajime & holding him close [sweatdrop]: &quot;No!  She&#39;s not going to take you away from me THAT way!&quot;<br/>

Was Miki in on a plot to destroy Sagara???  MissB, you gonna be there?  How about you, SK?  You going to be there to keep me in line on Saigou?  :-D  (BTW, SK, MissB has given me sufficient reason to believe that Saigou had nothing to do with it...)<br/>

So there&#39;s not going to be one for the next weekend either? Well, I guess that means the next chat will be the weekend after, so I&#39;ll be missing that one as well... -sigh-<br/>

not sure if I&#39;ll be able to attend the chat, since I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if I&#39;ll be home at that time, but I will try<br/>
to show up, at least later on. Either way, I hope that<br/>
the chat will be fun, as always :) <br/>

And definitely, after reading momoiro-usagi&#39;s comments<br/>
to Tama, I am certain that reading Japanese in romaji<br/>
is very different from reading Japanese in Japanese<br/>
