<h3>Hijikata the clothing store apprentice</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154703608">Now some of us may recall that Hijikata worked in a clothing store<br/>
during his youth and was dismissed for some reason due to some sort of<br/>
a run-in with a woman.<br/>
<br/>
Below is some background info of the store where young Hijikata was<br/>
employed.  The info was passed along to me from Michael who composed<br/>
the Shinsengumi filmography (Michael is usually at<br/>

on cinema).<br/>

The following is a translation of the Henshu Techo column from The<br/>
Yomiuri Shimbun&#39;s Feb. 20 issue.<br/>
<br/>
* * *<br/>
<br/>
Unable to have his petition to save impoverished people suffering from<br/>
famine accepted, Oshio Heihachiro (1793-1837), a former official of<br/>
the Osaka Higashimachi magistrate&#39;s office and a scholar of Wang<br/>
Yangming doctrines, led an armed uprising against the establishment in<br/>
1837. The rebels set fire to the town and attacked the warehouses of<br/>
wealthy merchants.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Daimaru is a chivalrous merchant shop. Don&#39;t vandalize its<br/>
warehouses&quot;--words uttered by Oshio and quoted in Daimaru Inc.&#39;s<br/>
company history book. The book says that Daimaru avoided being burned<br/>
down due to Oshio&#39;s words.<br/>
<br/>
Matsuzakaya Holdings Co., Daimaru&#39;s negotiating partner for management<br/>
integration, has a company history comparable to Daimaru&#39;s.<br/>
Matsuzakaya originated from a kimono fabric shop opened in 1611 by Ito<br/>
Ranmaru, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga (1534-82) in present-day Nagoya.<br/>
Hijikata Toshizo (1835-69), an executive member of the Shinsengumi<br/>
(literally, newly selected group) dedicated to support the Tokugawa<br/>
shogunate, is said to have worked as an apprentice at its Ueno branch.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the Daimaru-Matsuzakaya merger talks represent those between two<br/>
shops with long-standing traditions.<br/>
<br/>
The two department store chains, which have their own traditions and<br/>
corporate cultures, are reportedly approaching each other to seek<br/>
economies of scale through management integration against the<br/>
background of a market that has been shrinking in size due to the<br/>
decline in the population--yet another area over which the declining<br/>
birthrate has cast a shadow.<br/>
<br/>
The two merchant shops evolved into leading department store chains<br/>
after surviving the turbulent years at the end of the Tokugawa<br/>
shogunate, depressions, defeat in the war, oil crises and the bursting<br/>
of the economic bubble. Now each of them finds it difficult to go it<br/>
alone as a consequence of demographic change.<br/>
<br/>
Haiku poet Hiryoshi Tagawa composed a poem that reads:<br/>
<br/>
A line of students<br/>
<br/>
on a school excursion trip<br/>
<br/>
passing through Daimaru<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of a line of students walking through sales floors<br/>
while looking around pleasantly.<br/>
<br/>
After reading newspaper stories on the Daimaru-Matsuzakaya merger<br/>
plan, I think of department stores as places that glitter with<br/>
children as a source of light.<br/>
