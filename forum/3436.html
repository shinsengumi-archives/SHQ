*** Again, it's an indy film you can view by paying $1.99.  I haven't<br/>
seen it yet so I cannot say if it's good, bad, decent or anything. <br/>
The director/writer, Raffi Asdourian, is a graduate of the NYU Tisch<br/>
Film & TV school who is currently a movie editor. ***<br/>
<br/>
Does the film feature Shinsengumi?  No, sadly no but it -does- feature<br/>
the ever popular "samurai + honor + revenge + female w/ sword" theme<br/>
which may just be a fun little romp to view in 13 min.<br/>
<br/>
Thank for reading (^_^).</div>

<br/>
The camera work is pretty impressive given the limits in equipment.<br/>
I'm happy that they could find Japanese actors to help out as well.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, not bad at all.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753905920">*** It is better to purchase the film through this link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://heretic.bside.com/films/ai">http://heretic.bside.com/films/ai</a> ($1.99)<br/>
You get a download link and that's it---you don't have to download no <br/>
software etc etc<br/>
<br/>
This film is certainly worth MORE than a cup of coffee folks.  <br/>
<br/>
Technique<br/>
<br/>
Cinematography was very well done except one teeny tiny moment where <br/>
I noted an unintentional wobble.  Color was spectacular.  Digital opening <br/>
and closing is superb for a work with this budget.<br/>
<br/>
Choreography<br/>
GREAT!  This is due to the fact that the cast has some experienced actors <br/>
on board and it really paid off.  You have to watch some of the movements <br/>
carefully because there are some good details in the fight scene.<br/>
<br/>
Story<br/>
The story may have been based on the Buddhist saying: When you meet <br/>
the Buddha, kill the Buddha (you can imagine the multitude of <br/>
interpretations for this, it is based on non-attachment and killing within <br/>
your mind, killing all sentiment towards someone psychologically--not <br/>
necessarily literally killing---although in the Lone Wolf and Cub comic there <br/>
was a more gross interpretation).  Anyways in this film there is a tie in <br/>
with the phrase but you need to replace the word Buddha with "sensei".  <br/>
<br/>
The film's content was actually closer to 10 min and in that short amount <br/>
of time there was a good narrative.  Honestly I've seen MUCH WORST and <br/>
so this film, IMHO, gets a solid "A".  It's every manga fan's dream and yet <br/>
it tries to kick up all the cliches we've seen a hundred times a bit higher (in <br/>
a good way).  <br/>
<br/>
Rather than opting for the "supergirl" angle, what you get is a gritty and <br/>
raw work without going overboard with the "stylized" movements we see <br/>
in modern j-popish samurai movies (such as the forgettable blood-fest <br/>
AZUMI).  In fact it's better to watch a 10 min story which gets to the point, <br/>
has some elegant action rather than buy a dvd of AZUMI.<br/>
<br/>
It's my understanding that the filmmaker greatly condensed the entire <br/>
script due to lack of a budget (something from 10K to 5K) and yet he still <br/>
managed to create something to be proud of. If it was the filmmaker's <br/>
intent to demonstrate he can direct action (with one camera and a minimal <br/>
crew), then he certainly succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
So today, don't buy coffee and a pastry...just buy this movie and have your <br/>
pastry.  You'll be glad you did (AND) you'll be supporting an indy filmmaker <br/>
too.</div>
