[source translation of &quot;people who knew Fujita Goro&quot; from 3-<br/>
hajime.com]<br/>
&quot;He was born on July 17th in 1854 (Ansee 1).  Younger brother of <br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi and Oyama Sutematsu.  During the Boshin War, he <br/>
joined (1)Byakkotai, but due to his age, he was discharged.  He went <br/>
to the United States in 1871, and studied civil engineer at Yale <br/>
University.  After returning, he taught at Tokyo Kaisee University <br/>
first, and became the first professor of physics in Tokyo <br/>
University.  He made &quot;Dictionary of English, Germany, and France in <br/>
physics terms.&quot;  He used an X ray for an experiment for the first <br/>
time in Japan.  Later, he engaged in development of educational <br/>
administration and science administration.  He became a president of <br/>
Tokyo University, Meiji Technical College, Kyuusyuu University, Kyoto <br/>
University, and Musashi High School.  He also became a member of <br/>
Congress and worked for Privy Council.  He died 1931 (Syoowa 6).&quot;<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro was the source of the Tenmaya story....<br/>
&quot;Saitoo Hajime, later Yamaguchi Jiroo, often visited me and talked <br/>
this Tenmaya&#39;s story.  Since Saitoo Hajime felt that his enemy would <br/>
come on that night, he was drinking with wearing a chain mail.  <br/>
However, when he got drunk, he was annoyed at his chain glove.  <br/>
Furthermore, he felt it was too hot.  He tried to take off the chain <br/>
mail, but he could not do it easily.  While he was trying to take off <br/>
his chain around his hand, many people were crushed into his room.  <br/>
Therefore, he was lucky, and the chain mail became very useful then.  <br/>
He said:<br/>
&quot;In a real fight with real swords, people cannot think how to knock <br/>
down their enemy.  We just fight off one&#39;s head (react---do <br/>
not &quot;think&quot;).  While I rampaged around in this evening as in the <br/>
usual fight, one of enemies said, `he is wearing something.  Don&#39;t <br/>
cut him, but thrust with sword.&#39;  Therefore, I thought if they <br/>
started to thrust me with sword, I would wait for it.&quot;<br/>
This is the story that Shibozawa Hiroshi heard from Yamakawa Kenjiroo <br/>
who was still in life and 77 years old at that time.&quot;<br/>

Now for the really **WEIRD** part<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiroo participated in a strange experiment involving <br/>

you gotta read the entire article....so scary<br/>
*when the RING was published in Thai there were related news articles <br/>
and magazine columns which mentioned Japanese scientists conducting <br/>
such experiments during the turn of the century...I didn&#39;t know that <br/>
one of them would be a very well respected scientist who had to put <br/>
up with listening to Fujita Goro&#39;s Tenmaya story over and over and <br/>
over again</div>
