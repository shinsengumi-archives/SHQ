<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401668128">As you all know I have been diligently trying to read the <br/>
messageboard at hino-shinensengumi and I often get some <br/>
***valuable*** insider info, from really serious fans and news about <br/>
lectures and activities....<br/>
<br/>
nifty translated the latest post quiet beautifully<br/>
WED DEC 22<br/>
<br/>
paraphrase = it is not an understatement that this year has been THE <br/>
year for the Shinsengumi and alot of academic progress <br/>
and &quot;historical reappraisment&quot; has been made<br/>
<br/>
NHK Shinsengumi! is a drama and its historical value is low however <br/>
it was able to convey a general storyline or &quot;intelligible story&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*NOW FOLKS FOR THE WEIRD PART*.....<br/>
&quot;The history of a new compilation group is still short, and a <br/>
possibility that &quot;the diary of the Hijikata age 3&quot; and &quot;ö¶ of the <br/>
Hijikata age 3&quot; will come out from now on, the ashes of Kondo, <br/>
Hijikata, and Inoue will be discovered, or the set photograph of new <br/>
compilation will come out is left behind. (Although it is not <br/>
releasable to a field yet, it unites with the &quot;Hino new compilation <br/>
group tradition hall&quot; renewal opening next year, and the historical <br/>
records of first public presentation are prepared)&quot; <br/>

doesn&#39;t that paragraph make you go &quot;hmmmmmm&quot;  If someone has a <br/>

Being the poser of weird theories I must concur with the resident <br/>
child-artist&#39;s theory that the most interesting things may have been <br/>
hidden beneath the floorboards of various people&#39;s houses and have yet <br/>
to turn up. :-)<br/>

Depends, IIRC the thing that was billed as &quot;Yamazaki&#39;s diary&quot; was some kind of duty roster/investigation reports. So Hijikata&#39;s diary may not contain much about him as a person, or about sensitive stuff (unlikely for ex that he wrote down things about the assassination of Serizawa or of Itou, in case someone found it). but we can always hope!<br/>

Sorry. I&#39;m talking about the &quot;kinshin&quot; episode where he, Ito, and Nagakura <br/>
were all punished for breaking curfew. Saitou had to spend like 2 or 3 days in <br/>
Hijikata&#39;s room, persumably without talking. You might have read about that on <br/>

<br/>
Ah! Well in that case I imagine the entries may have looked something like:<br/>
<br/>
Day 1: I will finish this entry elsewhere as I cannot concentrate. Saitou-kun is sitting at the very edge of my vision and is fidgeting constantly. I swear he&#39;s doing it on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Day 2: Was this meant to be punishment for Saitou or for me? I got *no* sleep last night. He was staring at me all the time. Very annoying. <br/>
<br/>
Day 3: Finally got rid of my unwanted tenant. Celebrated by taking out poetry book and jotting down a few haiku (couldn&#39;t do that before as he might see where I hide it). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113695882">Okay, you *started* this enma_o you&#39;ve distracted us all from serious <br/>
historical research about the Shinsengumi!  ::giggles::<br/>
<br/>
....here is MY list (*_*)<br/>
<br/>
[Saitou was with Hijikata as he awaited his kinshin sentence]<br/>
the info was divulged by Serizawa Kamo during an Aim chat several <br/>
months ago...<br/>
<br/>
possible activities over 3 days (and I DO believe that it was not in <br/>
complete silence at all)....<br/>
<br/>
Although some say that Saitou and Hijikata were comparing notes on <br/>
Itou and planning out the &quot;Itou Affair&quot;...we know that may not have <br/>
been the case...<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi #1 &quot;Man, captain SAitou has been with the vice chief for <br/>
2 nights now&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi #2 &quot;Yeah and the vice chief was yawning non-stop today <br/>
during the meeting&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi #1 &quot;sounds pretty -serious-...(elbows Shinsengumi #2, <br/>
wink wink)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi #2 ::giggles::<br/>
<br/>
[origami]<br/>
Hijikata &quot;I showed you how to make a paper crane a dozen times <br/>
already! Here (grabs mangled paper from SAitou&#39;s hands) I&#39;ll make it <br/>
for you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Saitou &quot;excuse me, some of us just aren&#39;t into arts and crafts&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[love letter writing]<br/>
Saitou &quot;Aioi Tayu never replies to my love letters&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata (skimming Saitou&#39;s letter) &quot;Okay first of all, I never write <br/>
love letters....I just receive lots of them...you may want to start <br/>
by not addressing her as &#39;babe&#39; every other line&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[fashion consultation]<br/>
HIjikata &quot;give me your honest opinion who has better fashion sense, <br/>
me or Itou?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Saitou &quot;ummmmmm&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[dress up]<br/>
Hijikata (bored) &quot;I&#39;ve been working on a little side <br/>
project...basically I want to cosplay as a westerner...turn around <br/>
and give me some privacy as I change and show you the costume&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SAitou (facing wall---but attempting to look over shoulder)<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata &quot;stop peeking SAitou!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[interrogation]<br/>
Hijikata &quot;tell me your secret how DO YOU survive all those drinking <br/>
contests Saitou?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SAitou &quot;well first of all I bribet he waitress and have her replace <br/>
sake with water in all of the bottles I get...and I always make a <br/>
point of competing against Miki (Itou&#39;s little bro)&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Hijikata Toshizou diary is the data which came out by <br/>
investigation of Itou Seirou which is a Shinsengumi researcher. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/440402861X/250-0121696-">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/440402861X/250-0121696-</a><br/>

<br/>
The letter which suggests that Hijikata&#39;s diary is in Edo existed <br/>
from old times. <br/>
However, even now, the genuine article is not discovered. <br/>
Mr. Itou discovered one day of Hijikata&#39;s diary out of the old <br/>
magazine. <br/>
It was the report which the local history investigator of the Tama <br/>
area wrote in 1943. <br/>
It was writing that they did the game of a sword in front of <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori. <br/>
And the members of a game were described in detail. <br/>
Mr. Itou examined the contents and he concluded that this was <br/>
quotation from Hijikata&#39;s diary. <br/>
Though regrettable, there is no other information about this diary. <br/>
We only wait to discover this diary from somewhere. <br/>
(Hijikata&#39;s fans desire discovery of this diary between own lives.)<br/>
^^ <br/>
<br/>
The data of Shinsengumi may be discovered suddenly. <br/>
The book which Nagakura Shinpachi wrote was discovered by chance in <br/>
the old book store in 1998. <br/>
Or their posterity may have without getting to know the data. <br/>
(It seems that there is much posterity who does not know that they <br/>
are the persons involved in Shinsengumi.) <br/>
<br/>
For example, it is the episode in this book. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4404031408/ref=pd_sim_dp_1/2">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4404031408/ref=pd_sim_dp_1/2</a><br/>
50-0121696-0201845<br/>
Shinsengumi meimeiden (vol.2)<br/>
<br/>
It is the episode which researchers investigated about Ichimura <br/>
Tetsunosuke. <br/>
Researchers found the posterity of Tatsunosuke from the old data of <br/>
the area, and visited their house. <br/>
Tatsunosuke became a merchant in the hometown, after escaping from <br/>
Shinsengumi. <br/>
(Incidentally, about Tetsunosuke, there is an opinion that he was <br/>
killed in Seinan war, and there is an opinion of having died of an <br/>
illness when he was 20 years old. Even if it is which, as for Tetsu, <br/>
posterity does not exist.) <br/>
The posterity of Tatsunosuke preserved data detailed about the <br/>
origin of the Ichimura family. <br/>
It was guessed from there why the Ichimura brothers joined <br/>
Shinsengumi. <br/>
Furthermore, one of posterity was Okita Souji&#39;s passionate fan. <br/>
She gave Souji and a name to the own son. <br/>
However, they did not know that their ancestor was a Shinsengumi <br/>
member. <br/>
Researchers visited and they got to know it for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since Shinsengumi attracted attention in the Taiga drama this year, <br/>
a quite special research document came to be published. <br/>
I think that there continues to be good discovery.<br/>
