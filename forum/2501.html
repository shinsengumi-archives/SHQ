<h3>The Education of Young Samurai (Nisshinkan/Aizu) + Dorm Life</h3>

<br/>
In the zip file are 2 items.  <br/>
1) the original article in German by Kenji Koike (1940)<br/>
2) a rough translation/summary of the main points of the article in <br/>
English (the translator received very LITTLE compensation so I let <br/>
him do whatever he wanted) I do not know any German so I have no way <br/>
of double checking his work<br/>
<br/>
The orginal article and translation are both very short.  I highly <br/>
recommend these files for people who may in the future create their <br/>
own fictional characters and needed reference material.  There are <br/>
some humorous moments in the article (^_^)  ::ice skating::<br/>
<br/>
The article is basicallly about Nisshinkan a school for boys in <br/>
Aizu.  Nisshinkan was ranked in the top 5 schools of Japan before <br/>
1868 (I read somewhere it was #3).  It educated boys who later were <br/>
part of the Byakkotai when the domain was besieged by the Imperial <br/>
Army.<br/>
<br/>
All domains are unique and this article focuses only on Aizu's <br/>
Nisshinkan however I assume that some of the disciplinary codes may <br/>
be easily found elsewhere in Japan---it is part of samurai culture.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, when I researched Takagi Tokio by examining her <br/>
famous cousin, Takamine Hideo, his biographer emphasized Nisshinkan <br/>
because the dorms for young women in Tokyo Women's Normal School <br/>
emulated the "format" of Nisshinkan (which is not surprising given <br/>
Hideo's background as Matsudaira Katamori's page).  Ironically, <br/>
during the early days of the Meiji era dorms for boys lacked <br/>
discipline, it was in the 1890s when they returned to their more <br/>
Spartan roots.  Hence, the article was significant for me because <br/>
the three people from Aizu (Takamine Hideo, Takagi Tokio and <br/>
Yamakawa Futaba) all would've been very familiar with <br/>
the "traditional" system and made some adaptions in the Meiji Era.<br/>
<br/>
[notes for the article]<br/>
The idea of the oldest student supervising the younger ones is <br/>
called self-governance---something emphasized in the dorms Takagi <br/>
Tokio supervised. <br/>
<br/>
Reading out loud still continued into the Meiji Era.  Many <br/>
westerners who taught at Tokyo University commented that some of <br/>
their students had to learn how to read silently when they reached <br/>
the university level.  They often saw boys moving their lips as they <br/>
read.  Reading out loud was believed to help in absorbing the <br/>
material.<br/>
<br/>
The strong emphasis on camaraderie/teamwork ofcourse may reflect on <br/>
the sad end of one Byakkotai unit.</div>

Thank you, that's just way too cool! I can't wait to read it since I just so happen to have such a fictional character who would have been educated through the Nisshinkan. <br/>
