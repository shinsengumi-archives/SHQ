<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-616586879">Well Tiffany says it's working okay.... So how about you try getting <br/>
a download manager like download accelerator or getright? That way <br/>
even if you do stop in the middle you can resume the download and not <br/>
lose precious minutes (or hours) ^_^<br/>
<br/>
What else? Yes if the download terminates early then when you open it <br/>
through your unzip program it will say corrupted or invalid archive. <br/>
You can only open it if it's 100% done.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>
