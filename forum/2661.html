<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703805338">I&#39;m writting a fiction-novel that revolves around the war between the <br/>
Ishin Shishi and Shinsengumi. I have most of the characters and scenes <br/>
jotted down but I need a bit of help. I need a detailed timeline of <br/>
the battles between them, which has been hard for me to find.(I am <br/>
considering writting some of the novel, and it&#39;s sequel if I make one, <br/>
in diary form, thus the very very important need for a timeline.) <br/>
<br/>
Also I need information on the 4th-9th Captains. (I&#39;ve got a fairly <br/>
good idea of how I am going to write Souji, Toshizou, Sanosuke, <br/>
Shinpachi, Saitou, and Kondou.) <br/>
<br/>
And last of all, I need an opinion on whether I should start the novel <br/>
in the Edo Bakufu or Bakumatsu. The novel, or novels, will last until <br/>
the beggining of the Meiji Era. Thanks for the help. If you are <br/>
intrested in reading the novel, which I hope to have finished before <br/>
Nov. 2007, then look for &#39;Makoto: Wolf in Maiden&#39;s Clothing&#39; by S. C. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Masayoshi had compiled a fairly extensive timeline for the time period in question on the shinsengumihq site that compiled information from several historical sources.   (Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a> )   <br/>
<br/>
There also is a brief timeline in the English version of the Rurouni Kenshin Hiden (Profiles) book (Viz publications). The accuracy of the English version I can&#39;t vouch for, as I haven&#39;t sat down and validated the years against other references yet.  This timeline does not include specific dates, but only years.  (Incidentally,  Albert Craig indicates the original Satsuma Choshu Alliance was formally agreed upon 21/1/66 although this plan did not come to fruition until late 1867.) <br/>
<br/>
A few thoughts as you embark on writing your book --<br/>
The beginning of the Meiji era did not coincide with the end of fighting --instead various wars (1868) dragged into Meiji 2.  This is covered in Masayoshi&#39;s timeline.    <br/>
<br/>
In trying to examine what you are trying to think of in terms of &quot;Ishin Shishi&quot; actions, do you mean to include battles post-Restoration?  If so, technically speaking the forces  encountered by Shinsengumi from 1868 forward would not be called &quot;Ishin Shishi&quot; but&quot; Imperial forces&quot; as the Emperor had been restored at this point. <br/>
<br/>
Looking backwards -- there were clashes between loyalist/reformists and pro-bakufu forces in Kyoto that you might want to consider researching as well if you have not already researched them.  These were not part of the later conflict (1868--).    For example, you could potentially include and narrate the Battle at the Forbidden Gate (Hamaguri Gate) in 1863, in which joint Satsuma-Aizu forces demolished Choshu forces, who were responding to their expulsion at court and the charges levied against their daimyo with a seriously misguided attempt to &#39;rescue&#39; the Emperor.<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming the Shinsengumi were involved, but that may not be correct and defer to others on the list. ( The NHK taiga placed them there, but NHK also took its own liberties with history ;) ) . <br/>
<br/>
Of course, the question as whether this represents a &quot;Ishin Shishi&quot; battle is something to consider.   I haven&#39;t read enough on the war council and factions in Choshu at this time to determine whether there was a unified purpose in advancing on Kyoto and the motivations of the four sets of Choshu troops that were involved .  It would seem to me that there wasn&#39;t - hence the question of whether to include or not based solely on history. However -- given the purposes of fiction, it might be interesting to throw it in -- since it does take place in Kyoto and could be argued to be an &quot;Ishin shishi/Shinsengumi&quot; conflict.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the dates for Teradaya and Ikedaya should probably added to your list.  A fellow Choshu nut kindly translated a Japanese-language site to yield some info on popular theories regarding the death of one (notorious) Choshu Ishin.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116481200">Thus far, as far as timelines go, the best one  that I&#39;ve found is at this mailing list&#39;s HQ.   It pretty  much has the major battles that were fought, and like it saids, it&#39;s  still under constuction and there are a few errors (nothing major  though):<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-2663">&gt;</a> Re: Soon-to-be Shinsengumi Novel [timeline errors]</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-220252388">[Himura Usagia] which books have you read?  There some good books on <br/>
the Ishin Shishi out there which would totally help you fill in the <br/>
gaps in terms of the timeline and help your novel.<br/>
<br/>
please also get<br/>
Hillsborough, Romulus. Shinsengumi: The Shogun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps <br/>
Tuttle Publishing ISBN: 0804836272 <br/>
<br/>
although it contains some gems like...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Certainly the two Shinsengumi leaders were elated. They had wielded <br/>
their propensity to kill to exercise their will to power and now <br/>
walked away victorious, domeonstrating to themselves and to the <br/>
world their extraordinary importance. Merely suppressing ronin was a <br/>
thing of the past; killing the enemies of the Tokugawa Shogunate was <br/>
now their raison detre. In their victory, they were unfazed by the <br/>
fact that they had butchered some of the finest men of their <br/>
generation.&quot; (Hillsborough 82)<br/>
<br/>
and some revolutionaries didn&#39;t agree to these plans---nor would <br/>
they claim as R.H. would that these were the &quot;finest&quot; men on their <br/>
side... so why R.H. had to say this is beyond me...again he has <br/>
problems with &quot;tone&quot;<br/>
<br/>
it still has a narrative which can help you with a timeline<br/>
I have not had the patience to pull info from Hillsborough&#39;s book <br/>
into the timeline at all<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------<br/>
[Bunny] please let me know about the errors you may email me offlist <br/>
at secretarytocapt(a)hotmail.com our goal is to provide accurate <br/>
info as humanly possible so your help is appreciated (and all <br/>
contributors are credited)---also if people visit the timeline you <br/>
will notice that on certain entries I noted [discrepencies] not all <br/>
authors use exact dates in their analysis---and each has to decide <br/>
whether or not to convert dates and so forth<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Masayoshi (Hirotada Tokugawa) did give more information on Aizu&#39;s <br/>
role and since at this point Aizu is under represented in academic <br/>
texts the SHQ will address some of these issues in time.  I just <br/>
haven&#39;t had the chance to sit down and incorporate it into the <br/>
timeline yet (sec currently in fangirl mode).<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the essays on this page<br/>
although as we know -M- is fascinated with Aizu---his 2nd essay is <br/>
VERY VERY VERY good---logical and contains info we have not yet <br/>
discussed on this list so please check it out!<br/>
