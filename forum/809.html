<h3>Tech Question (Word img&gt;&gt;&gt;Jpeg)</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-924868364">I could only retrieve a few portraits of the Shinsengumi painted by<br/>
Nakajima Nobori...I got them out of the internet cache...but the<br/>
problem is I had to babel the captions on each portrait (the artist<br/>
wrote about his subject right on the painting)...so I had to save the<br/>
image on Word format (the address for each image was no longer<br/>
working...really weird...everything was &quot;broken&quot; because geocities<br/>
deactivated everything) but that in a nutshell is how I could not save<br/>
the image as a jpeg.<br/>
<br/>
So basically I have the images and babelled captions all on Microsoft<br/>
word...does anyone know how to turn the images into a jpeg?  If worst<br/>
comes to worst the portraits will be placed on one word file...but it<br/>
is so inconvenient...sigh<br/>
----------------------<br/>
has anyone found a website for the museum at Goryokaku?  I would like<br/>
to request prints I just don&#39;t know how to contact them :(</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822095163">My book newsletter is Word document and it has book cover pictures in it <br/>
and playing around a bit I saved the newsletter as a web page. Looking <br/>
at the view code/source thing it shows one of the images as this<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/v:shape&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;![if !vml]&gt;&lt;img width=95 height=148<br/>
src=&quot;./Document1_files/image002.jpg&quot; <br/>
v:shapes=&quot;_x0000_i1025&quot;&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I ftp&#39;d it to my website because it tends to make a folder of images and <br/>
stuff like this contain gin any images &lt;&lt;Document1_files&gt;&gt; of course <br/>
this time it didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t imagine that&#39;s much help but  I thought it can&#39;t hurt to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759728731">Are you able to highlight the image within the document? (You should be able to)<br/>
 <br/>
With the image highlighted, right click.<br/>
 <br/>
One of your choices is (or should be... Photo Editor must be installed probably) &quot;Photo Editor Photo Object&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Choose &quot;Edit&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That should dump the image into Photo Editor where you can save as a .jpg or other file.<br/>
 <br/>
If you need to clean the images, it&#39;ll have to go into MS Paint after it&#39;s saved as a .jpg.<br/>
 <br/>
Let me know off-list if this doesn&#39;t work... I&#39;m constantly futzing around with images in MS.<br/>
