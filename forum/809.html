<h3>Tech Question (Word img&gt;&gt;&gt;Jpeg)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-924868364">I could only retrieve a few portraits of the Shinsengumi painted by<br/>
Nakajima Nobori...I got them out of the internet cache...but the<br/>
problem is I had to babel the captions on each portrait (the artist<br/>
wrote about his subject right on the painting)...so I had to save the<br/>
image on Word format (the address for each image was no longer<br/>
working...really weird...everything was "broken" because geocities<br/>
deactivated everything) but that in a nutshell is how I could not save<br/>
the image as a jpeg.<br/>
<br/>
So basically I have the images and babelled captions all on Microsoft<br/>
word...does anyone know how to turn the images into a jpeg?  If worst<br/>
comes to worst the portraits will be placed on one word file...but it<br/>
is so inconvenient...sigh<br/>
----------------------<br/>
has anyone found a website for the museum at Goryokaku?  I would like<br/>
to request prints I just don't know how to contact them :(</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822095163">My book newsletter is Word document and it has book cover pictures in it <br/>
and playing around a bit I saved the newsletter as a web page. Looking <br/>
at the view code/source thing it shows one of the images as this<br/>
<br/>
</v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img width=95 height=148<br/>
src="./Document1_files/image002.jpg" <br/>
v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"><![endif]></span></p><br/>
<br/>
I ftp'd it to my website because it tends to make a folder of images and <br/>
stuff like this contain gin any images <<Document1_files>> of course <br/>
this time it didn't.<br/>
<br/>
I don't imagine that's much help but  I thought it can't hurt to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759728731">Are you able to highlight the image within the document? (You should be able to)<br/>
 <br/>
With the image highlighted, right click.<br/>
 <br/>
One of your choices is (or should be... Photo Editor must be installed probably) "Photo Editor Photo Object"<br/>
 <br/>
Choose "Edit"<br/>
 <br/>
That should dump the image into Photo Editor where you can save as a .jpg or other file.<br/>
 <br/>
If you need to clean the images, it'll have to go into MS Paint after it's saved as a .jpg.<br/>
 <br/>
Let me know off-list if this doesn't work... I'm constantly futzing around with images in MS.<br/>
