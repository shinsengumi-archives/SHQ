<div id="ygrps-yiv-773358200">This is not a joke o.k. this is what happens in HOllywood:)<br/>
Due to the weird twists and turns in the entertainment industry...<br/>
<br/>
Ken Watanabe (Last Samurai, MIbugishiden TV series)...will be Batman's<br/>
arch enemy Ra's Al Ghul in the 2005 release of BATMAN:Beginnings<br/>
<br/>
*I happened to have grown up watching BAtman the ANimated Series and<br/>
so I'm very familiar with this villain<br/>
<br/>
Pics of Ken Watanabe on the red carpet for the Academy awards<br/>

<br/>
The above mentioned news is all over Batman related sites on the net<br/>
as well and on a Japanese online newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Watanabe looks very handsome as himself from the pics on the<br/>
site...I just don't want to know what they'll do to him to transform<br/>
him into "THE DEMON's HEAD"...</div>
