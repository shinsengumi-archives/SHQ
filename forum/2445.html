<h3>Sequel - NHK Shinsengumi!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391851136">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just seen this announcement on the NHK Shinsengumi! mailing list <br/>
and thought that I should share the news.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, there will be a sequel to NHK Shinsengumi!, with the same <br/>
cast. Kouji Yamamoto (Hijikata) would be the lead actor. The official <br/>
announcement can be found at this addresse: <br/>

<br/>
Unfortunately, translation softwares doing a very poor job, it is <br/>
highly incomprehensible. I&#39;m mostly relying on what people from the <br/>
other mailing list are saying, so sorry for anything that wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
accurate.<br/>

<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
A sequel for &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; announced, to be aired<br/>
next January = NHK<br/>
<br/>
NHK has announced on the 25th that it will be airing<br/>
in January, as a historical soap opera for New Year&#39;s,<br/>
a one-shot soap opera showing what happened after the<br/>
ending of last year&#39;s long run historical soap opera<br/>
(&quot;taiga dorama&quot;) &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;. It is the first time<br/>
that a sequel for historical soap operas is made.<br/>
<br/>
As for the soap opera, it will feature the same cast<br/>
of the original work, including Koji Yamamoto playing<br/>
the lead role as Toshizo Hijikata. The script will be<br/>
written by Koki Mitani. It hasn&#39;t been announced the<br/>

Have withstood pain to create many weapons.<br/>
     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.<br/>
         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;<br/>
