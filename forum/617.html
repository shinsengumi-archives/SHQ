<h3>Confused... Please help clarify.... Nanae&#39;s Manga</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003611296">Okay... So I'm a wee bit confused on some of the stuff that I've <br/>
read on the internet... Please take note I have NOT read the manga <br/>
nor have finished the Anime... <br/>
<br/>
So for sure I know that there are two manga releases by Nanae-san... <br/>
One is the "Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker" and the other <br/>
is "Peacemaker Kurogane". Tying the anime to the manga, I would <br/>
think the anime started with Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker? Since I've <br/>
never seen the ending, did it just end with the first manga series <br/>
or the second? OR did the anime start with the second manga series, <br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane?<br/>
<br/>
*Possible Spoiler*<br/>
<br/>
The scanlations most of us have... The three volume one, is that <br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane or Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker? I was talking to <br/>
an acquaintance back in Singapore and she kept going on and on, on <br/>
how unhappy she was that Okita is slowly but surely getting sick. To <br/>
those who have read both manga series, does the second one mention <br/>
this at all?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a fan of manga (have not even read past volume 3 of RK) so <br/>
please can someone tell me since, I haven't read this at all. Thank <br/>
you!</div>
