<h3>Saito&#39;s sword fight, injured at Toba-Fushimi, and new &quot;towel&quot; theory</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876611587">Ok, I just looked at the www.3-hajime.com site with a different <br/>
translator and it offered a different interpretation of the first <br/>
police kendo competition that Saito competed in. According to this <br/>
translation the victory was actually awarded to him, but there were <br/>
some who spread the rumor that the fight had actually ended in a <br/>
draw. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been considering the whole thing about him never wrapping a <br/>
towel about his neck. So far I&#39;ve come up with two new clues that <br/>
have led me to a conclusion about what they mean. The first is the <br/>
fact that the word &quot;neck&quot; is not necessarily the correct translation. <br/>
The evil goldfish also has a tendency to say &quot;neck&quot; when it&#39;s talking <br/>
about Kondo&#39;s beheading. So it could actually be talking about his <br/>
head, not his neck. The second thing I found was a reference to <br/>
a &quot;worktowel&quot; that people wore wrapped around their head to keep the <br/>
sweat out of their eyes. It was in a book on the Edo period and <br/>
mentioned that people took these off in the presence of someone of <br/>
higher rank. As I recall, in the Shin Kepp miniseries many of the <br/>
scenes that featured training in the dojo showed the Shinsengumi <br/>
memebers wearing just such a towel on their head. So my conclusion is <br/>
that this is in fact the &quot;towel&quot; that Saito never wore around <br/>
his &quot;neck&quot; (or rather his head).<br/>
<br/>
And I found another reference to Saito being wounded at the battle of <br/>
Toba-Fushimi in the 1to5.net notes. He went to a medical place at the <br/>
Kando Izumi bridge on the 19th it says. The assumption made was that <br/>
it was for treatment of injures substained during the battle. I just <br/>
finished watching &quot;When the Last Sword is Drawn&quot;, courtesy of Barb. <br/>
In that movie, Saito is wounded in the leg in the Toba-Fushimi fight. <br/>
Coincidence or is this based on fact? I note that the movie also had <br/>
Saito referring to Kondo as a &quot;snob&quot;. This becomes VERY relevant in <br/>
light of the info we just received about Kondo&#39;s attitude problem and <br/>
the quarrel within the ranks because of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868625218">What new translator are you using?  If you can translate all of<br/>
3-hajime and zip the files please do so because frankly, the fish is<br/>
killing me...I&#39;ll never finish babelfishing the entire site.<br/>
<br/>
See I was thinking if in fact the kenjutsu tournaments in the TMPD<br/>
were in the process of &quot;converting&quot; to modern kendo it seems that they<br/>
would be using some new rules such as time limits.  In modern<br/>
tournments there are set time limits---but back then there were no<br/>
stop watches?!?  The fact that the TMPD adopted a kendo ranking<br/>
system, used till this very day in mainstream kendo, implies that<br/>
their tournaments MUST have had modern restrictions.  Fujita Goro may<br/>
not have been able to land a decisive strike in the eyes of the<br/>
referee.  It seems that Fujita Goro&#39;s opponent was from a different<br/>
department/ward so perhaps the opponent&#39;s buddies weren&#39;t happy.  In a<br/>
kendo book I read, the tournaments were also used to encourage<br/>
vigorous training in the dept.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I have with Saitou being that severely injured at<br/>
Toba-Fushimi is...he walks with a very impairing limp which to me<br/>
would be far too dangerous to send a guy to the Seinan war with that<br/>
&quot;handicap&quot; to begin with.  The newspaper article clearly narrates that<br/>
he was actually on the field with whatever battalion he was assigned to.<br/>
<br/>
The wrapping a towel around the head/neck...I see you haven&#39;t &quot;let go&quot;<br/>
of this detail either ^_^...I was thinking back to the film Bakumatsu<br/>
Mono....and the main character&#39;s stomache wound was aggravated by a<br/>
practice session and he ends up wrapping a towel around his neck.  And<br/>
didn&#39;t someone say that guys did that to maintain their health or<br/>
something?  I don&#39;t have my copy of Shinsengumi Kepp. with me but<br/>
towels called tenugui are wrapped around your head before you put on<br/>
the &quot;men&quot;/helmet for kenjutsu practice...but in this case you HAD to<br/>
wrap the towel around your head (looks easy but it ain&#39;t trust<br/>
me)...because the towel is supposed to prevent you from stinking up<br/>
the helmet.  I think after the guys take off the &quot;men&quot; they still kept<br/>
the towels around their head...some will even wipe their faces with it<br/>
(eeeeeewwwwww). Hmmm so -wouldn&#39;t- he wrap a towel around his<br/>
neck/head.  I think we have to ask momoiro about this question ^_^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116068881">Sec, that is a little unsettling... I&#39;ve always wondered why there <br/>
were no fansites for Kondou Isami, especially since I started <br/>
watching NHK... This would explain it... I wonder what other <br/>
forums/boards (japanese) has to say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On another note... was that an online translation software MissB or <br/>
a local program in your PC? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that the movie exaggerated the injury. He certainly had something happen to him at Toba-Fushimi. Not only to both 1to5.net and www.3-hajime.com mention it, I just noticed that the new site with the info on all the Captains says he &quot;suffered a slight illness&quot;. I doubt it could have been anything too serious, because he took several days to go to this medical place about it and then he went straight back into action.<br/>
<br/>
That tummy-wrapper thing is in one of my books actually. I suggested that before, but I thought we decided that couldn&#39;t be it? Hm, it could still be that tenugui thing. Perhaps we have it all wrong? Don&#39;t let those clean fundoshi fool you!  It&#39;s not Harada&#39;s equipment you want to avoid, you want to steer clear of Saito&#39;s! LOL! Seriously though, please ask momoiro what the devil they mean!<br/>
<br/>
I had to buy a translator that frankly works similar to Gist. That&#39;s the only way I can get some sites to come up, which is the only benefit. The Fish won&#39;t work for me most of the time and occasionally Gist won&#39;t either. I have to paste everything onto it, which can be a real pain. As far as doing zip files goes, I&#39;ve never tried to do that before and I have no idea where to start. You&#39;d have to give me a crash course, IF this computer will even co-operate. It can be a real PITA when it comes to zip files. I STILL haven&#39;t been able to retrieve that info about that Shogitai, either from here or your account. It tells me the format isn&#39;t recognized. <br/>

up for our fantasy trip to Japan? ^_^<br/>
<br/>
I am skimming &quot;The True Story of The Siege of Kumamoto Castle&quot;<br/>
translated by James H. Buck<br/>
Standard Book Number (which I guess means isbn in the 1970s) 533-02324-6<br/>
mentions how the Imperial Army used to suppress the Satsuma Rebellion<br/>
had low morale and little training so the gov. organized &quot;Special<br/>
Mobile Brigades&quot; consisting of [policemen] from the samurai class from<br/>
all over Japan.  The book is (gasp) very very very PRO &quot;GREAT SAIGO&quot;<br/>
however I think the detail about the [police] fighting &quot;hand-to-hand<br/>
combat with swords and bayonets so vigorously that they fought with<br/>
Satsuma samurai on an equal basis&quot; (Buck, viii) was used to add some<br/>
sort of balance to both sides in the conflict.  Like all books,<br/>
demographics were left out entirely seeing how many of those policemen<br/>
were from Aizu and all...<br/>
<br/>
Miss B, have you used jstor.org to look up journal articles?  I found<br/>
a totally cool journal article about the TMPD and how it was run<br/>
during Fujita Goro&#39;s time...but ODDLY not too much stuff on Aizu and<br/>
Hakodate...so we gotta come up with some keywords to use.</div>
