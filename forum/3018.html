<h3>Romulus Hillsborough</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-101380253">I&#39;ve heard generally negative comments about Romulus Hillsborough&#39;s<br/>
book on the Shinsengumi, and was wondering if the issue is poor<br/>
scholarship (i.e. incorrect, misquoted, or just plain bad info), or if<br/>
it is just not well written, Is it a reliable historical reference? Or<br/>
are there just issues with the conclusions he draws?  I&#39;m starting to<br/>
read up on the Shinsengumi with a few Japanese books on the way via<br/>
amazon.co.jp, but it is always nice to get a foundation in my native<br/>
language. I checked the archives here, and it seems that people tend<br/>
to dislike it, but I&#39;d probably have to read every post to get the<br/>
full picture, so I hope you don&#39;t mind me cheating with a direct question.</div>

if<br/>
<br/>
*at this time we cannot double check his work without gathering all <br/>
the books he used and then placing them side by side with what is <br/>
presented in Eng.  That would take alot of money and time due to the <br/>
need of assembling a team of translators.  So I cannot really say his <br/>
information is bad.  However in terms of *scholarship* the book <br/>
approaches the topic by using themes.  Instead of the cause and effect <br/>
of historical circumstances he for instance highlights the ambitions <br/>
of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it is just not well written, Is it a reliable historical reference? <br/>
Or<br/>
&gt; are there just issues with the conclusions he draws?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Personally I think his work is very immature due to the sarcasm he <br/>
constantly uses to describe the Shinsengumi.  If he wanted to write a <br/>
text on history such a tone is entirely inappropriate.  I think he did <br/>
not use the most recent nor best sources...as Hillsborough <br/>
knows..there are MANY books on the Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
for example:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography2.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography2.htm</a><br/>
you will see books which have collected letters written by the <br/>
Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough should have used those books to create a more complete <br/>
narrative<br/>
<br/>
the author also noted that his book is not 100% &quot;historical&quot; because <br/>
as he fairly noted---writing such a book on the Shinsengumi would be <br/>
incredibly difficult<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he should add that his heroes, the Ishin Shishi were 100% <br/>
responsible for &quot;revising&quot; Japan&#39;s history and suppressing what <br/>
the &quot;other side&quot; (losers) had to say---THAT IS WHY IT IS HARD TO WRITE <br/>
A BOOK ON THE SHINSENGUMI.  Alot of info has been lost, destroyed or <br/>
still hidden.  Even some descendents of the Shinsengumi today feel <br/>
inconvenienced to discuss their ancestors.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to<br/>
&gt; read up on the Shinsengumi with a few Japanese books on the way via<br/>
&gt; amazon.co.jp, but it is always nice to get a foundation in my native<br/>
&gt; language. I checked the archives here, and it seems that people tend<br/>
&gt; to dislike it, but I&#39;d probably have to read every post to get the<br/>
&gt; full picture, so I hope you don&#39;t mind me cheating with a direct <br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
I think many of us dislike it not because Hillsborough holds a <br/>
different opinion on the Shinsengumi.  For me personally, I was <br/>
angered by the fact that <br/>
<br/>
1) he was writing the FIRST BOOK IN ENGLISH on the Shinsengumi---<br/>
technically it makes his text &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.  Rather than providing <br/>
a straight up text which is both neutral in tone and helpful in <br/>
establishing a foundation for future serious research he comes across <br/>
as a bitter man annoyed by the popularity of the Shinsengumi.  I <br/>
would&#39;ve been eternally grateful if he was a bit civil in his text.  <br/>
And imagine how much money he can make if he followed up with an <br/>
attempted biography of let&#39;s say Okita?  The man shot himself in the <br/>
foot IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
2) He abused that golden opportunity of being the first western author <br/>
to introduce the group in text by using the Shinsengumi to prove his <br/>
own personal view that the restoration was glorious and led by <br/>
infallible idealists who were not filled with personal ambition, greed <br/>
or &quot;propensity to kill&quot; ---we know this to be innaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough is a blatant Ishin &quot;worshipper&quot; and fanboy who thinks <br/>
that he is ripping the mask off the Shinsengumi HEROES.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, Hillsborough is not aware of the fact that even <br/>
Shinsengumi fans have a mature view of the miburo and their record.  <br/>
<br/>
We know they were not perfect.<br/>
<br/>
We get it.<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough should put his journalism background to use and <br/>
investigate his own &quot;heroes&quot; and what foundation they laid for Japan!<br/>
<br/>
A Japan which was neither democratic, nor enlightened.<br/>
<br/>
1868 was the restoration of feudalism.<br/>
<br/>
If he feels that the Shinsengumi were just the dogs of the <br/>
bakufu...why did he write a book on them?  If they held historical <br/>
significance why did he simplify their narrative so much?<br/>
<br/>
Because the Shinsengumi were/are a hot topic and he wanted a piece of <br/>
the pie.<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3 (incredibly hormonal today)<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Shinsengumihq.com has quoted Hillsborough&#39;s book extensively.  <br/>
We have fans who did find the book very useful and therefore we have <br/>
not posted harsh criticism of his work anywhere on our site.<br/>
I respect HIllsborough for some &quot;effort&quot; and the fact that he has <br/>
studied Japanese for 15 years.<br/>
<br/>
In fact our home page recommends the book because gosh darnit there is <br/>
no other book to overshadow his text.<br/>
<br/>
we tried our best to be fair and direct people to what is &quot;out there&quot; <br/>
without making our personal opinion a deciding factor. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545047568">I agree with secretarytocapt3. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, even though Hillsborough noted that his book is not 100% &quot;historical&quot;, he <br/>
should not have referred to Shimozawa Kan&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&quot; repeatedly without <br/>
mentioning it being a historical novel based on a lot of historical data (especially regarding <br/>
the accounts that have already been concluded to be fictional.) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I bought Hillsborough&#39;s book though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the feedback.  My biggest aggrivation with English<br/>
histories of events in Japanese history is one mentioned in your<br/>
review - not enough footnotes or discussions in text of other<br/>
possibilities or conflicting reports/documents - almost like the<br/>
historian writing the book either 1. doesn&#39;t want to take away from<br/>
their own POV, 2.Doesn&#39;t want to bother, 3.Doesn&#39;t realize there are<br/>
conflicting documents, or 4.Is just lazy.  The Evil Turnbull is the<br/>
worst offender in this sort of thing (I won&#39;t get into the countless<br/>
other issues I have with that guy&#39;s &quot;work&quot;, although I&#39;ll give him the<br/>
only credit I can, that he has probably done more to get people<br/>
interested in the subject that the academic rice-counters).  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I have the same problem a lot of people have in general - the<br/>
scholars of Japanese history in the West are forced to publish books<br/>
on the kokudaka output of XYZ province or the &quot;intellectual history&quot;<br/>
(which is a fancy word for writing long run on sentences with words<br/>
only found in the dusty pages of long out of print Olde English<br/>
dictionaries with an aversion to common adjectives) otherwise they<br/>
just won&#39;t get published.  I&#39;m still waiting for a Carl Sagan of<br/>
Japanese history to make things interesting.  Usually I gather a few<br/>
rare useful articles from the Journal of Japanese Studies or the<br/>
Monumenta Niponica (I did see the journal list SHINSENGUMI IN ACADEMIC<br/>
JOURNALS, so I&#39;ll be getting those articles soon), but then since<br/>
nothing of much interest has been published since Sansom, so I pretty<br/>
much stick to reading Japanese history books. It&#39;s a shame, too, since<br/>
the things I read in Japanese are far more colorful and interesting<br/>
than anything found in English.<br/>
<br/>
End Rant :-P<br/>
<br/>
I just picked up the Gakken Shinsengumi book put out in 2003, and the<br/>
Gakken books to this point have always had good information and lots<br/>
of interesting &quot;extras&quot; - this one has about 100 shinsengumi<br/>
biographies, maps of various battles, a map of areas where important<br/>
members were assasinated, and all sorts of other goodies.<br/>
<br/>
I checked Hillsborough&#39;s book on Amazon.com - shouldn&#39;t someone here<br/>
write a more unbiased review? Only one review out of 4 there seems to<br/>
be at all critical.</div>
