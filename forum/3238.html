<br/>
and look around for Ken Watanabe as Yoshimura Kanichiro---this is <br/>
Mibugishiden the TV series not the award winning movie we all know and <br/>
love...this is very rare folks because otherwise you'd have to buy the <br/>
TV series which is really pricey. Remember Mibugishiden was a novel, TV <br/>
Series and then a major motion picture...it's a pity that no one has <br/>
translated the novel into English---some fictional touches aside it <br/>
would be a good devue literary work on the Shinsengumi to enter the <br/>
west in our generation.<br/>
<br/>
The user also has a documentary (in Japanese) on the Bakumatsu with an <br/>
emphasis on the Shinsengumi.<br/>
