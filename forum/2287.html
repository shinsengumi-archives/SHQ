<h3>Early 19th century peacekeepers</h3>

<br/>
Still decoding it, but from what I can tell:<br/>
<br/>
-This is from the early 19th century and denotes major clans with special <br/>
assignments in the country.<br/>
<br/>
-The Yamanouchi of Tosa (listed under their honorary Matsudaira surname on <br/>
the top row) were in Osaka, which makes a lot of stuff about the Bakumatsu <br/>
make a lot more sense. They were at Tennozan in Osaka-- <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rekishikaido.gr.jp/time-trip/gengo/eng/tennozan.htm.">http://www.rekishikaido.gr.jp/time-trip/gengo/eng/tennozan.htm.</a> Important <br/>
site in the Sengoku for the  Battle of Yamazaki  (hmm...), was still a <br/>
strategic site in the Edo Period.<br/>
<br/>
- Matsudaira of Aizu are listed with the Sakai as being based at Ezo <br/>
Matsumae (Hokkaido), defending against the Russians. Another Matsudaira had <br/>
east Ezo, and Satake Ukyo-dayuu had west Ezo.<br/>
<br/>
-There were 11-- count &#39;em-- ELEVEN clans in Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
Shiba Gorou&#39;s &quot;Remembering Aizu&quot; puts this at 1806 earliest. I think that <br/>
was around the time of Oshio Heihachirou&#39;s rice riots in Osaka-- hence <br/>
people like Yamanouchi in Osaka and 11 clans in Kyoto. Remember, the Oshio <br/>
rice riots are the precursors for the Ee Ja Nai Ka craze of 1868...<br/>
<br/>
Will update as I decipher more.<br/>

<br/>
Very top has a drawing of 200 Aizu men on the way to battle at Toba Fushimi.<br/>
<br/>
Later on there are pictures of Hijikata, Yoshinobu, Katamori, <br/>
etc...Shinsengumi&#39;s 1867/12 HQ of the Fushimi Bugyosho (which is HUGE), and <br/>
so on. And the calligraphy is &quot;Makoto&quot; Yoshinobu&#39;s own handwriting.<br/>
