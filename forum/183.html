<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691687065">These are just some thoughts I wanted to share since it relates to the samurai in general.<br/>
<br/>
This whole week i've been attending a seminar for Suio Ryu headed by the headmaster who came from Japan. Tonight was one night that had probably one of the most interesting discussions of the week. Our headmaster was presented with a scroll with the kanji for "bushido" on it which was written by one of the grandfather's of one of the students. <br/>
<br/>
Our headmaster then told us the meaning of the word bushido, which pointed to it's simplest meaning, yet I and many others never saw of it as this way. He broke down the meaning of the strokes in the first kanji "bu" and told us it basically meant "to stop conflict". "shi" refers to a person i.e. samurai. And "do" the way. But basically he said it means "The way of stopping conflict". He then asked how do you stop conflict. Thinkuing to the hisotry of Japan, the only way to stop conflict is to produce conflict. To fight. To suppress the enemy so that you cease their ability to produce conflict.   <br/>
<br/>
From this, I could see the truth behind the word. Bushido is not what is written in books about the samurai code, the way a samurai is supposed to conduct himself, it's true meaning is simply in the way of combat, the way of the warrior. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749923501">yeah, sometimes the most simple truths are hard to grasp.<br/>
I read in a book that talks about the origin of "bu" from Chinese and<br/>
explains how things were done in imperial China.  People who<br/>
represented "Bu", warriors were placed nearly at the same level as<br/>
those who represented "Boon" that is the thinkers/advisors. Boon&Bu<br/>
are "supposed" to assist the leader in making decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Many books out there will as you mentioned give the definition to<br/>
bushido as "the way a samurai is supposed to conduct himself" perhaps<br/>
this is due to the elaboration of the meaning during the Tokugawa<br/>
period when things were ~relatively~ peaceful---and there was a need<br/>
to redefine their roles?  During the Tokugawa many samurai added more<br/>
"peaceful" aspects to their way of life right (popularity of zen,<br/>
calligraphy, and flower arrangement <- this one still shocks me but I<br/>
definately read this in a book on samurai!)?  So for non practitioners<br/>
who just read anything that comes our way the definition of bushido<br/>
itself is far removed from its origins (99.9% of the writers do not<br/>
practice martial arts and therefore can't tap into the warrior aspect<br/>
of the samurai).<br/>
<br/>
If you guys have a chance, join e-budo.com and read the posts to get<br/>
an idea of what others are thinking and there are some really<br/>
knowledgeable posters some of whom have all these characteristics<br/>
1)know the language 2)research 3)practice martial arts (some for<br/>
several decades).<br/>
<br/>
My favorite post is "Rural swordsmen beat urban "Zen" swordsmen" which<br/>
reminds me of Kondo and company moving into Kyoto :)<br/>

I'll try to locate the more specific info I have on this because, like most things, it's not quite THAT simple.<br/>
 <br/>
When my mother was competing in flower arranging, there were many men involved in it.  Some of them were some pretty tough lookin' dudes, too.  ;-)  <br/>

There's another fun image to contemplate... Kenshin coming in on RK Saitou arranging flowers (maybe after Kenshin's just had green tea with Aoshi?)  :-)<br/>

Sounds like the rose competition episode from King of the Hill.<br/>
<br/>
My sister used to have pet mice and in a book on pet mice it mentioned <br/>
that samurai came up with different strains of colored mice and raised <br/>
them in large/deep clay containers...can't forget the koi raising <br/>
too...makes me think of Angry Bee's Hajime and Tokio...I guess the <br/>
samurai secure in their positions with a guaranteed source of income <br/>
needed a hobby...imagine being born in this social class and having NO <br/>
interest in martial arts whatsoever...must've been hard.<br/>

<br/>
right, the chado<br/>

I was thinking along the lines of Tokio always preparing a weekly <br/>
