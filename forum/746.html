<div id="ygrps-yiv-682848152">OK, I now have a kanji dictionary, and am working on the names I couldn't <br/>
decipher. I've managed to get several, and will be steadily continuing work <br/>
on the family tree. Most recent addition-- Tokio's aunt Fuku, Tokio's <br/>
brother Morinosuke, Tsutomu's daugther, Kyouko, and Saitou's brother-in-law <br/>
Soma Yoshiaki, the chief physician to the Mito Tokugawa. Oh, and <br/>
interestingly enough, the Numazawa who are related to Tokio are also related <br/>
to a Saigou family-- spelled the same way as Saigou Takamori. However, I <br/>
doubt it was the same Saigou.<br/>
<br/>
Will continue to keep you all updated!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too. My guess is that it was the family of Saigou<br/>
Tanomo. Those who are acquainted with the history of<br/>
Aikido and Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu will certainly<br/>
recognize that name. And those who know the history of<br/>
Judo will probably know about his son, Saigou Shirou,<br/>
the person who created the technique "Yama-arashi",<br/>
and was the basis for that Kurosawa's movie, "Sugata<br/>
Sanshiro".<br/>
