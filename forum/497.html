<h3>OT--Kaze Hikaru files</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-975307439">Personally I think it's a plot by the fish who shall remain unnamed---<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded those Kaze Hikaru files and once unzipped they became a <br/>
"zip document" with the .rar at the end of the filename . The last time <br/>
I downloaded something like this once unzipped it turned into readable <br/>
little image files.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer a clue as to what might have gone wrong?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853925817">You did it right...continue to unzip using WINZIP or RARLAB as<br/>
mentioned on the page...Okita had to compress the files that<br/>
way...winzip and handle rar files<br/>
<br/>
*when I have the time I will research a way to make it easier to open<br/>
but as it is you need to do just one more step that doesn't require<br/>
any type of downloading<br/>
<br/>
[notice to all members]<br/>
A list of those who are conspiring against the fish (the thin line<br/>
between fundoshi fans and the secrets of the Shinsengumi) have been<br/>
compiled and Hijikata as taking a look right now.  As soon as he deems<br/>
this group a "renegade faction" this anti-fish group will be dealt with...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449533284">I'm going to keep the hosting up for a while...cuz it is handy for<br/>

<br/>
The catalog is huge so I had to include a list a plates for navigation<br/>
and thumbnails file so you can preview what you want to download...I<br/>
understand that we don't all have the miraculous DSL :) There is a<br/>
huge amount of scrolls in the catalog and even if we can't read it it<br/>
is cool to see the calligraphy, map drawn by Hijikata!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not done uploading the catalog yet...it takes like 4 hours to<br/>
upload 25 mb from my slow computer!<br/>
<br/>
I could've scanned everything smaller but the thing is you don't get<br/>
to see the detail like the stitchwork on Kondo's jacket or Hijikata's<br/>
chain mail.<br/>

I'll announce when I'm totally done.<br/>

Open the Museum Cat. folder to get the list of files to download<br/>
to help you navigate which group of plates to download:<br/>
listplates1.jpg<br/>
listplates2.jpg<br/>
SHcatTN.zip = Thumbnail version of ALL plates<br/>
<br/>
buycatalog.doc = all the contact info needed to acquire this<br/>
catalog...here is my sales pitch...I think this book is really<br/>
inexpensive for $35.85 because the exhibit managed to bring together<br/>
items from all over Japan...the photos are awesome and the scrolls all<br/>
have accompanying typed kanji beneath it so you can actually read what<br/>
the letters say (if you know Japanese)<br/>
<br/>
I left out 20 pages of Japanese text (contains photos we've seen<br/>
before on the Miburo Yahoo Groups)<br/>
<br/>
In fact if any of you can't download huge files just go to see some of<br/>
the photos @ Mibur Yahoo Groups under the "files" section</div>
