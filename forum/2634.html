Totally unrelated (((please help)))<br/>
If anyone here is in any way affiliated with UC Berkeley<br/>
(student/staff/admin which would allow you to borrow a library book)<br/>
please email secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com<br/>
Berkeley won&#39;t send the book to me--and a librarian even inquired as<br/>
to the reason why not--and we didn&#39;t get an answer<br/>
<br/>
I pursued this matter for almost 2 months now and it is really<br/>
important to duplicate this book if possible (even if we can&#39;t read<br/>
it...yet)<br/>
<br/>
The *only* library in the world (including the ones in Japan--the<br/>
database I use also covers universities in that country)---is BERKELEY<br/>
(T_T)<br/>
<br/>
I totally realize the importance of a book written by Takagi<br/>
Morinusuke/Morinosuke<br/>
because now Japanese fans are saying they can&#39;t find it<br/>
either---ofcourse it was printed Taisho 1 (it wasn&#39;t supposed to be a<br/>
bestseller---but a biography of an older woman who wasn&#39;t a member of<br/>
the Joushitai but clearly left a profound impression on her nephew<br/>
from the Takagi family)<br/>
<br/>
The book was published by Tatsuo&#39;s adopted father Numazawa Shichiro<br/>
<br/>
Numasawa MIchiko-kun no den / ?????, 1854-<br/>
Morinosuke Takagi; Tanomo Saigo召ｴ 1913<br/>
Japanese ?? 1, 19 leaves, [2] leaves of plates (1 folded) : ill. ; 23 cm.<br/>

***Saigo Tanomo was a key figure in Aizu administration</div>
