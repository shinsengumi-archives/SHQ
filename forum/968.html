<h3>PMK musicvids</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595719363">I'm trying to get back to finishing some things (like websites that have been woefully neglected of late) and just don't have the energy for this one thing --- the hunt for PMK musicvids that feature and/or include Saitou.  Does anyone here know of any (preferably those that people can link to and watch/downlaod --- I know some RK titles are not available but still listed on AMV, including one that I really liked called "Saito's Here")?  I don't need RK musicvids, just PMK.<br/>
 <br/>
Speaking of "Saito's Here," does anyone know why heraldtalia stopped access to it?  It used to be available over on prettyanimeboys.com, but last time I tried to load the site it was unavailable (the site itself).  Is it available somewhere else?  (wondering if I can contact the artist... )<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
