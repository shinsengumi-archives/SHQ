<h3>Best Incarnations of the Shisengumi:</h3>
by <i>darkmalik</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824657724">Here&#39;s a question which version (anime, manga, live action) of each <br/>
character is best. Here&#39;s my vote:<br/>
Hajime Saitou: PMK version, RK one is nice too but the PMK version is <br/>
more softer and I like that.<br/>
Souji Okita: PMK version hands down, I don&#39;t liket he way they <br/>
portrayed him in PK as a stupid looking little kid.<br/>
Susumu Yamazaki: PMK I&#39;ve only seen him in this particular series so <br/>
I vote this version best.<br/>
Keisuke Yamanami: PMK again as I&#39;ve only seen him in this series I <br/>
can only vote for this version of him.<br/>
Isami Kondou: PMK I don&#39;t liek the way he&#39;s sometimes portrayed as <br/>
old and fat in live action so I choose PMK for the liveliness they <br/>
gave him in it.<br/>
Sanosuke Harada: PMK because of the comedy factor totally.<br/>
Toshizo Hijikata: PMK I don&#39;t like how they prtray him as an <br/>
overpowering jerk with no sense of humor in the live actions I&#39;ve <br/>
seen so I have to vote for the cool one in the anime PMK.<br/>
Shinpachi Nagakura: PMK for the comedy routine he, Sanosuke and <br/>
Heisuke get into.<br/>
Heisuke Toodou: Is he even real? Oh well since I&#39;ve only seen him in <br/>
PMK I vote for the PMK version.<br/>
Well here&#39;s my votes, what&#39;re yours?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613438911">umm, well, there really aren&#39;t very many choices...most of the characters only appear in PMK... but i would say i like the RK version of Saitoh better than PMK...*loves sexy bad ass cops... XD XD XD*  as for Hijikata, i can&#39;t decide between the PMK version and teh live action NHK version... they&#39;re both so good looking! I still can&#39;t get over how handsome the real actor is...omg... *drools* XD<br/>

&gt; Well here&#39;s my votes, what&#39;re yours?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
Kondou - either NHK or Keppuroku... I like the younger version in <br/>
NHK. I think he&#39;s cute.. but as a leader Keppuroku I think is better. <br/>
The quiet strong type.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata - I like Keppuroku a lot. Very good right hand man I think.<br/>
<br/>
Okita - Keppuroku again wins. He&#39;s not much like a kid which I really <br/>
like<br/>
<br/>
Saitou - No one will ever beat Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s Saitou..<br/>
<br/>
Harada - PMK!!! Funny!<br/>
<br/>
Todou - PMK!!! Funny<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura - NHK is good. I like that he is serious and strong unlike <br/>
PMK where he is like a runt...<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami - I LOVE NHK version... He is very lovable... Although <br/>
Keppuroku comes a close second....<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-595566297">My choices (until I change my mind again :D)<br/>
<br/>
Kondou - I really like the NHK version As much flack as poor Shingo Katori is getting for this role I think he&#39;s doing a nice job. If you see the last few episodes (this coming Sunday will be #40) You can really see the change in Kondou. He looks so much harder and older than he did in the beginning. The job has clearly taken its toll. Maybe that&#39;s why the historic Kondou looks much older than  his years?<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata -Keppuroku Hijikata is by far the coolest though I like Mibugishiden Hijikata. I think Maybe NHK Hijikata wins out though. He comes across as pretty believable most of the time. <br/>
<br/>
Okita --This is a four way ties between Mibugishiden, NHK and Keppuroku and Gohatto OKita. <br/>
<br/>
Saitou--Again with the tie! RK was the and the best for a long time but then Koichi Sato won me over in Mibugishiden (his sneer is to died for!)closely followed by NHK Jo Odagiri.  <br/>
<br/>
Harada --PMK & NHK tie again.<br/>
<br/>
Todou --Yet again with the PMK NHK tie though I think NHK Heisuke has the edge because he&#39;s really so sweet with his feeling that he&#39;s in OKita&#39;s shadow in everything.<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura--Though he had but 37 seconds in screen time Mibugishiden Shinpachi is #1 all the way. They really needed to let his character do more because he really stood out in his brief appearances. <br/>
<br/>
Yamanami ---PMK edges out NHK in this case. <br/>
<br/>
