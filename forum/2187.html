<h3>Mito survivors from Serizawa&#39;s group</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-318643434">Of the group of men from Mito who followed Serizawa Kamo into Kyoto with Kiyokawa & Kondou's group, I know that Nimii Nishiki and Hirayama Gorou died.  Hirama Juusuke, who was with Serizawa & Hirayama when they were murdered, survived the attack.  But what happened to him after that?  And what about a Noguchi Kenji, who also was part of Serizawa's group and the Shinsengumi... what happened to him during all of this wiping out of the Mad Duck club?  Anyone know?  Help!<br/>
