<h3>upcoming movie</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440852952">This one is not just full of eye candy for the ladies but also much <br/>
action and blowing up things for the guys...<br/>
<br/>
The movie hasn't even started filming yet but it sounds pretty cool <br/>
let's hope we get to see it here (wishful thinking I know)<br/>
<br/>
(I snagged it form a Hiroyuki Sanada <br/>
fansite----<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.twilightforest.net/sanada/)">http://www.twilightforest.net/sanada/)</a><br/>
<br/>
The title is "Bokoku no Aegis" ("Aegis of ruined country"?? hard to <br/>
translate without reading the original story...). A terrorist group <br/>
hijacks an Aegis warship of Japanese Self Defence Forces, and SDF's <br/>
members fight against the terrorists. The original story swept lots of <br/>
literary awards in 1999-2000 in Japan. SDF will provide a full support <br/>
for this movie. In addition to Sanada-san, Koichi Sato ("The Spiral - <br/>
Rasen") and Kiichi Nakai (Japan Academy Award winner this year for "Mibu <br/>
Gishiden") are also playing. These three heartthrobs are long-time good <br/>
friends, and so there won't be any problem of chemistry!! ">><br/>
<br/>
Okay so they really should rewrite it to say two heartthrobs and one <br/>
semi-dweeb :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245060426">Scream!!!! Let's hope that we get to see Koichi Sato in uniform <br/>
(still amazed by his excellent performance in GONIN).  My hunch is <br/>
Sanada would be the bad guy and Kiichi Nakai is the poor family man <br/>
caught in this entire mess LOL!<br/>
<br/>
JSDF is everywhere in the world of anime most noticeably in the <br/>
Patlabor 2 directed by Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell and Jin-<br/>
Roh:The Wolf Brigade).  Mamoru Oshii is fascinated with how the <br/>
police and military function, advanced technology and ofcourse naked <br/>
female cyborgs.  In Patlabor 2, no naked female cyborgs ^_^ by the <br/>
way,  the tension between JSDF and the TMPD Mobile Unit (focus of <br/>
the film) is addresed and the director makes some pretty straight <br/>
forward and highly critical AND controversial comments about <br/>
politics, an unjust/just peace, the concept of a just/unjust war and <br/>
so forth.  I find it fascinating that many anime actually address <br/>
the competition(?) and quiet conflict between the police and army <br/>
(all of which can be traced back to the Seinan War).  Mamoru Oshii <br/>
does not show the police and army attacking one another but he does <br/>
illustrate the rift between the organizations.<br/>
