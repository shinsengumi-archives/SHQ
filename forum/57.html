<h3>The many incarnations of Saitou PHOTOS</h3>

"The many incarnations of Saitou" <br/>
PHOTOS section<br/>
<br/>
I need to add that I just received "Saitou Hajime no subete" a newly <br/>
published book on S.H. and *just like* the books by Shizuko Akama <br/>
who seems to be the foremost (but not the only) person researching <br/>
S.H. "Saitou Hajime no subete" also insists that S.H. is this man <br/>
here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.3-hajime.com/hs3.jpg">http://www.3-hajime.com/hs3.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
and in all the books in Japanese I recently purchased...NONE have <br/>
included the charcoal sketch which actually has his name written <br/>
right next to his face<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.3-hajime.com/hs1.jpg">http://www.3-hajime.com/hs1.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
Again, this all begs the question that if these researchers have <br/>
access to the Fujita family (e.g. Shizuko Akama) then perhaps the <br/>
descendants must have an alternate photo/painting otherwise how <br/>
could they i.d. him?  I cannot imagine the photographer tracking <br/>
down each soldier and sending/giving him his own copy at a later <br/>
time...it's not like they had polaroids back then:)</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you. I'd like to do that for as many of the Shinsengumi as I can <br/>
so if you come across anything from different movies please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Sure wish I knew how to do the screencap thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So the second picture is actually a sketch? I thought it was an old <br/>
protrait photograph.  The thing that gets me is that the men look so <br/>
different . I'm just not seeing enough similarity between them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is a charcoal sketch...done with soft charcoal so it does look like<br/>
a photo...there are bigger versions of this image with writing on the<br/>
side and his name "Saitou Hajime" even though he was supposed to go by<br/>
Yamaguchi Jirou/o by the time this portrait was done.  1to5.net has a<br/>
mini essay which debunks the charcoal sketch portrait we have gotten<br/>
used to.  <br/>
<br/>
If the man identified in the group photo is S.H. then -wow- either the<br/>
artist who did the charcoal sketch was WAY off or perhaps someone<br/>
accidently wrote in the wrong name on the wrong portrait...he is SO<br/>
unattractive LOL...what a contrast to Tokio who looks very elegant in<br/>
the photo with their son :) well I'm not a model myself:)<br/>
<br/>
My Japanese books came with lots of inserts and advertisements listing<br/>
Shinsengumi books and on one ad it actually cropped the group photo to<br/>
show the REAL S.H....so it seems that the marketing is also changing<br/>
to address what researchers have found rather than go with the image<br/>
which is all over the internet.</div>
