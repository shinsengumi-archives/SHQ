<h3>Shinsengumi Haori Anyone?</h3>
by <i>shenlong71328</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665887739">Hey all!<br/>
<br/>
To put things bluntly, I was wondering about making Shinsengumi haori and selling them.   Would any of the members of this mailing list be interested in getting one if I offer them?   I figure that this would be the best place to offer something like this.   I already made one that I wore everyday at the Anime Expo this last weekend and I plan on putting pictures up online on my DeviantArt page.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, this is just a hypothesis.   I just want to see what your opinions are and if anyone would be interested.<br/>

<br/>
Feel free to give us the dev-art link once you are done.  I can paste <br/>
your message to the Shinsengumi LJ blog as well.<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, I can't buy a haori at this time---I just spent <br/>
money on something else recently.<br/>
