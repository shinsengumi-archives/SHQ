<div id="ygrps-yiv-640523124">Book in English which mentions Hijikata<br/>
Author: Nagai, Hyo¯sai.<br/>
Title: The young prince /<br/>
Publisher: Ritsumeikan Press<br/>
Place: Tokio<br/>
Date: 1937<br/>
<br/>
I ordered this book and it even arrived at the library I<br/>
use...supposedly...and I even returned it.<br/>
<br/>
I have an evil twin out there because I never even saw the book! <br/>
<br/>
So anyone at a university or college should try to request this book<br/>
and see how Hijikata is portrayed (even if it is just in a cameo role)<br/>

I think Nakajima Nobori left a death poem (I *think*---I used<br/>
nifty) here<br/>

Wikipedia has become very helpful for people who <br/>
need some basic facts.  However, please notice that<br/>
many wikipedia entries do not seem to use any books<br/>
nor are the authors taking the time to quote authors.<br/>
Anyone can go in and delete whatever work you post.<br/>
<br/>
Wikipedia has numerous shinsengumi entries which we<br/>
have listed on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a><br/>

ALOT OF Bakumatsu/Aizu cosplay (hover curser above pics to figure out<br/>
where Enomoto is)<br/>
There is "standard" Shinsengumi in blue haori pics (near the middle of<br/>
the page) however since this one is easy to miss I'll post it here<br/>

some clubs have different versions of the uniform and especially on<br/>
how they think the Shinsengumi "looked like" in Hakodate<br/>

Clarification<br/>
People are wondering which books to buy and which are fiction vs<br/>
non-fiction.  Well, there are hundreds of Shinsengumi books and many<br/>
fictional works have inspired research into the history. Some books<br/>
focus on one figure for instance.  Just go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiNames.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiNames.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
highlight, copy and paste the name you want into google.co.jp and add<br/>
"ISBN" and you will find books about the specific Shinsengumi figure.<br/>
 Then take that number and plug it into amazon.co.jp to find the book,<br/>
read reviews.  You may also search Japanese blogs and read fan reviews<br/>
too once you get the book title.<br/>
<br/>
There is also commentary that Akama Shizuko (a very old well respected<br/>
Shinsengumi researcher best known for her research into Saitou Hajime)<br/>
writes HISTORICAL FICTION.<br/>
<br/>
This is partly true. <br/>
However, making sweeping generalizations does ***damage*** her<br/>
reputation.  <br/>
<br/>
Information on her books has been recorded here for over a year(s).  I<br/>
just bolded "fiction" vs "non-fiction" for clarification today<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Since I don't know Japanese, how do I know which book is fiction or<br/>
non-fiction?<br/>
<br/>
Simple, I used Worldcat which has a database of Japanese books to note<br/>
its category and also read several blogs which reviewed her work (to<br/>
confirm Worldcat's category).  If you visit major Shinsengumi sites<br/>
which focus on history you will note how highly regarded her work is<br/>
(her facts are carefully quoted)...she by the way interviewed people<br/>
not just used texts, her research was dynamic and very detail<br/>
oriented, from newspapers to public records, you name it.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Akama, DID DO SERIOUS history research and put her OWN<br/>
SPECULATION into novel form---in a totally [separate] work---not mixed<br/>
in with her serious work. <br/>
<br/>
Please take care in posting information on websites, especially in<br/>
this case.  Akama did stick to the golden rule and went through alot<br/>
to bring details on Saitou to light (many of those details can be<br/>
interpreted in a negative way).  Even though Akama is also a fan, she<br/>
did her job as a historian as well.<br/>
<br/>
So which book is the best?  We don't know.  <br/>
<br/>
SHQ is using alot of English language texts and we have no problem in<br/>
putting conflicting information side by side.  Examples can be found<br/>
here on the still in progress timeline.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Notice how we are going to try to get every single account we can<br/>
find.  We can't rely on one book because each historical figure was in<br/>
a different place and interacted with different people. So there are<br/>
"piecs" of information everywhere.<br/>

(all we need now is a Shinsengumi themed piercing my friends) (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Kondou Isami "whoa, that tattoo is as badass as the skull on the back<br/>
of my black training gi"<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata ::nods in agreement::<br/>
<br/>
Saitou "it's a good tattoo, but not as good as MINE" ::Saitou whips<br/>
off shirt to reveal his back::<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata "nice chrysanthemum flowers there"<br/>
<br/>
Saitou "no they are cherry blossoms---can't you tell?"<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata "clearly -chrysanthemums- Saitou"<br/>
<br/>
Kondou "cool carp there too"<br/>
<br/>
Saitou "Carp?  I had the guy tattoo a dragon on me not some fish!"<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata "you should talk to the guy who did the work and have him<br/>
tattoo something on top of the naked baby swimming with the fishy too"<br/>
<br/>
Saitou "I'm going to do more than talk to him!!!"...walks off mad<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata + Kondou ::LOL!!::<br/>
<br/>
(just kidding, historical Saitou as far as we know, did NOT hav tattoos)</div>
