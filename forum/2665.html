<h3>Shinsengumi! Special final episode</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434007159">I think it&#39;s been discussed here before, but the special final episode of NHK&#39;s taiga drama &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;, focusing on the last days of Hijikata, was broadcast a few days ago.  It&#39;s now available over on d-addicts.  The URL for the torrent is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?info_hash=e98207f407be423b5fbf693cf9078e8f4328578f">http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?info_hash=e98207f407be423b5fbf693cf9078e8f4328578f</a>  (hopefully that copied complete... if not, check the torrent page ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php)">http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php)</a>  and type in Shinsengumi in the search torrent field... it&#39;ll be the first on the list that comes up).  Size of the file is 624.50 MB.  Official title of the torrent is Shinsengumi!Hijikata Toshizou Saigo no Ichinichi(2006.01.01 704x396 DivX61)SP.avi  .  As new as it is, it&#39;s staying very well seeded.<br/>
   <br/>
  It currently does not have subtitles.  It&#39;s been said that neither TV-Japan nor KIKU-TV (out of Hawaii) are going to provide subtitling, nor do fansubbers tend to attempt taiga dramas because of the difficulty of the historical/more formal language used.  We&#39;ll just have to see what happens.<br/>
   <br/>
  If anyone who wants to see it isn&#39;t familiar with d-addicts or downloading torrents (or how to watch them), they have a lot of information to help you... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16155">http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16155</a> .  My knowledge is limited, but I can also help as much as I can and I know there are some pros on the list who would probably also be willing to help get someone started.  Don&#39;t be afraid to ask!  (And be forewarned that Jdorama of any kind is addictive, especially considering many of our beloved actors in &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; have very long, healthy drama careers!  ^_^)<br/>

number of other shows they&#39;ve put up without subtitles, fans from<br/>
there have made srt files available (which are not hardcoded subs, but<br/>
better than nothing).  These usually appear within a few weeks of the<br/>
original file going up there. (I watched Densha Otoko and a number of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394143750">Yes, a request was made (though more in the form of asking if there would be subtitles... asking for subtitling is a touchy subject with the mods over there for various reasons).  The reply came from the person who uploaded the torrent (a longtime member), stating that fansubbers don&#39;t tackle taiga dramas because of the difficulty of the language used for those and they rely on the subtitling that is provided by professionals.  Unfortunately, in this case, neither of the two main sources that have previously provided subtitles for taiga have provided them for this.  **shrug**  Like I said, we&#39;ll just have to see if someone does considering the drama itself was so popular.<br/>
   <br/>
  And, yes, d-addicts is an incredible source of all kinds of drama from East Asia and there are a lot of wonderful fans who take the time to provide soft subs (srt files, which I prefer actually).  We&#39;re gearing up for a new season in Japan in the next week and the likes of Odagiri Jo (Saitou), Tanihara Shosuke (Itou), Yashima Norito (Takeda), and Sato Koichi (Serizawa and Saitou in &quot;Mibu gishi den&quot;) have parts in new dramas from January to March.  I didn&#39;t look closely enough, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Eguchi Yosuke (Sakamoto) also has a new one... he shows up regularly.  If you had a favorite in &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;, you&#39;re bound to find plenty more of the actor.  Jdorama is a lot of fun!  (And &quot;Densha otoko&quot; (Train Man) is one of my very favorites... it speaks to us computer-dependent otaku.  ^_^)<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369646457">It&#39;s regrettable if there wouldn&#39;t be subbed version, indeed we can&#39;t blame <br/>
on the people doing fan sub using their time and with many effort.<br/>
However, I think Shinsengumi!!&#39;s language isn&#39;t that old one. Instead they <br/>
are using very    modern lines. I can say that as there are some core jidaigeki <br/>
fans criticizing Mitani( the scriptwriter) that his lines are too modern to be <br/>
historical drama.<br/>
And especially, in the sequel, the conversation between Hijikata and Enomoto <br/>
is really long and having important signification.<br/>
May be I&#39;ll try to make a synopsis for that if there wouldn&#39;t really be the <br/>
subbed one.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell that really I loved the sequel as well as the previous series <br/>
and it worth seeing even without sub. And Tetsu in this drama( a very young <br/>
actor who had played also Yoshitsune child last year) was simply adorable!<br/>
<br/>
Tama<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Speaking of recent J-drama with actors in Shinsengumi!, you can see <br/>
also Tatsya Fjiwara(Okita) in the &quot;Furuhata Ninzaburo episode 1&quot;, and actor <br/>
of   Genzaburo Inoue (co casted with Ichiro of Seattle Mariners himself) in the <br/>
second episode of the same series. Both are currently seeded by Torrent.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to phil&#39;s list, Shingo Katori (Kondo)will play Sun Wu Kong or <br/>
Monkey King in the remake of &quot;Monkey Magic&quot;( I don&#39;t know how many people would <br/>
remember this series ) based on the &quot;Journey to West&quot;.<br/>
And Sakai Masato (Yamanami) will be in the new NHK short historical series <br/>
&quot;Izumo no Okuni&quot;, telling the life of an actress who became the founder of <br/>
actual Kabuki theater.<br/>
Both series will be aired from someday in January. ( Sorry I don&#39;t check <br/>
closely yet)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325793686">Well, I suppose the d-addicts mods are one thing, but most of the srt<br/>
files are put together by the fans. <br/>
<br/>
Tama --  if you put together a summary (or a script), I would be happy<br/>
to edit it (if no one else volunteers). That might actually generate<br/>
some interest for a soft-sub at least.   <br/>
<br/>
As for the Shinsengumi! alums showing up elsewhere -- it seems the<br/>
pool of actors is small.  A large number kept showing up in Gokusen<br/>
season 1 as teachers, much to my amusement. Of course, these tended to<br/>
be the ones that were forced to seppuku or got killed.  (Reincarnation<br/>
as teachers in the worst school in Tokyo seems rather funny to me.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; we&#39;ll just have to see if someone does considering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the drama itself was so popular.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t use torrent here at home (download limits), so<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll try downloading it elsewhere. After I get it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll sub it in my free time and post the .ssa here in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the list. Then, it is sufficient to use DirectVobSub<br/>
&gt; &gt; or the like to see the subtitles.<br/>

Michael from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ninjadojo.com">http://www.ninjadojo.com</a> has informed me that<br/>
KIKU in Hawaii will air the NHK Shinsengumi! sequel aka &quot;The Last <br/>
DAy of Hijikata Toshizo&quot;.  ***WITH SUBTITLES*** IN JUNE <br/>
(please monitor Kiku schedules and post the exact day/time)<br/>
there is a possibility that if it airs in Hawaii then it should also <br/>
be available in California afterwards<br/>
<br/>

WE STILL NEED YOUR INPUT...<br/>
on how many people would be interested in seeing<br/>
BYAKKOTAI subtitled by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samuraidvd.com">http://www.samuraidvd.com</a><br/>
other Shinsengumi films (black-white) and more recent ones including <br/>
the TV series Moeyoken have all been subbed and available all over <br/>
the place from ebay to torrents...<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve heard that &quot;Byakkotai&quot; doesn&#39;t have the Shinsengumi...that <br/>
is a misunderstanding.  Yes the title is &quot;Byakkotai&quot; but the entire <br/>
first half is Shinsengumi (this is a 2 part series).  This film <br/>
explains the interdependence between our boys and the Aizu domain<br/>
see caps here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Michael has been incredibly helpful to us in terms of history <br/>
research and compiling lists of films, recommendations and updating <br/>
us with alot of info for pop culture.  Please help us provide an <br/>
answer to this small request. Basically, would you BUY BYAKKOTAI? Is <br/>
the question (^_^) just say &#39;yes&#39; &#39;no&#39; that&#39;s all we <br/>
want  ::secretarytocapt3 begging::  -or- tell us what other <br/>
Shinsengumi film you&#39;d like to see subtitled<br/>
<br/>
WE NEED YOUR INPUT...<br/>
If a Shinsengumi haori (either blue or black) FROM JAPAN was the <br/>
prize...would you consider entering in a video/multimedia contest?  <br/>
It can be a music vid, short live-action movie, your own animation, <br/>
puppetry, audio drama, anything...the contest would occur early to <br/>
late summer.  The project would be judged on creativity and <br/>
originality.  It can come from any &quot;universe&quot; however, if possible <br/>
some of the project should incorporate your own work.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be interested?  I can host your project and it will be <br/>
posted here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm</a><br/>
It can be as large as 20-40 MB...or more<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to write up the rules etc, design a promo page and then <br/>
have no entries (^_^).  In previous contests we had only a few <br/>
entries I was able to give prizes to ALL contestants however this <br/>
time I wanted to give a haori.<br/>
<br/>
If the competition is fierce I will also include a hakama with the <br/>
coat so all your cosplay dreams can come true. No I will not buy you <br/>
a sword....<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
TRIVIA<br/>
Did you know that the Ikedaya fight scene in the RK OVA was based on <br/>
the scene in the film Byakkotai?  This can be seen easily because <br/>
the animators copied the live action movie frame by frame in the <br/>
part where the Choshu samurai pour out onto the balcony/rooftop.  <br/>
I&#39;m not talking about the part where everyone is in the dark and the <br/>
fireflies illuminate the swords but a bit later on in that sequence. <br/>
It&#39;s so cool I will post screencaps later.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
When I get a block of free time there will be even more updates on <br/>
SHQ however lately I had to work on scanning some rare books such as:<br/>
<br/>
Author: Kusunose, Yasuma. <br/>
Title: Kondo&#772; Isami to Tosa Kinno&#772;to&#772; / Kusunose, Yasuma cho. <br/>
Publisher: Ko&#772;chiken : Inobe Sho&#772;saku, Sho&#772;wa 4 [1929] <br/>
Description: 2, 206 p. ; 19 cm. <br/>
<br/>
[status = OUT OF PRINT]<br/>
<br/>
currently on Worldcat which incorporates libraries in Japan too, <br/>
lists that there is only *** ONE *** copy available out there for <br/>
lending purposes...we have it (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
This book is all in Japanese and it is about Kondo Isami and the <br/>
Tosa group.  To many of us Kondo was a military leader, however he <br/>
was also an administrator please read some of Kondo&#39;s office work on <br/>
the timeline: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575265128">To give you a bit of the background and why you might never see subs for this special, I&#39;m adding below some of the messages from a topic over on d-addicts (and btw, they have a strict policy of not requesting subtitles... it&#39;s run purely on a volunteer basis and they want no pressure put on those who have the ability).  The information is from a member who&#39;s been watching and dealing in jdrama (and with KIKU) for a very long time.  If the link will copy here, the full topic is at <br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic_p438163.htm#438163">http://d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic_p438163.htm#438163</a> .  I&#39;m quoting without permission, too, but felt this would be easier to communicate the issue.<br/>
   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;&gt;Do you think the subs gonna be realeasd?<br/>
    &gt;&gt;No, because TV Japan and KIKU-TV are not making English subs for this SP. Taiga dramas are never subbed by fansubbers because, like you said, the old language is too difficult to interpret. Traditionally we rely on the professionals for subs of taiga and many other jidaigeki/period dramas.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    The version of Shinsengumi uploaded on D-Addicts was subbed by TV Japan of New York USA, which is a partner of NHK. To date, there are no fansubs of taiga dramas because up to today there is no need for fansubs. <br/>
<br/>
Brief review... Until Yoshitsune in 2005, two companies made subtitles for taiga dramas: TV Japan and JN Productions of Hawaii USA (using KIKU-TV to broadcast.) The taiga dramas you see on the Internet was subbed by one of the two companies, depending on who provided the resources. <br/>
<br/>
In the continental US TV stations, the subs were provided by TV Japan. I&#39;m not sure who did the subbing prior to Toshiie to Matsu. <br/>
<br/>
In Hawaii, the subs were provided by JN Productions, and aired on KIKU-TV. One exception to this is Shinsengumi (2004)... The first 25-percent or so of the series was subbed by JN Productions. In April 2004, ties between KIKU-TV and JNP were broken, so KIKU-TV subbed the remaining 75-percent of Shinsengumi in-house. I&#39;ve yet to see the JNP/KIKU-TV version released to the Internet. <br/>
<br/>
It is easy to tell who subbed what... <br/>
- If the subs are white and two-lines, they&#39;re JN Production subs. <br/>
- If the subs are white and three-lines, they&#39;re KIKU-TV (in-house) subs. <br/>
- If the subs are yellow and two-lines, they&#39;re TV Japan &lt;&lt;<br/>
   <br/>
  For what it&#39;s worth. I don&#39;t know what this means for future taiga dramas (I haven&#39;t been following this season&#39;s & don&#39;t know if NHK & other entities are dropping subtitling all together).<br/>
