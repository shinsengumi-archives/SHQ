<br/>
First off I came across this little &quot;documentary&quot; about a couple of <br/>
people setting off to check out rumors of a Shinsengumi ghost that <br/>
has been appearing in Kyoto. Or at least that is what it says it is <br/>
about. This sounds suspiciously like it could be the &quot;Shinsengumi <br/>
Witch Project&quot; to me...<br/>
<br/>
Some caution on the site might be wise. I did not see any pics that <br/>
might offend, but some of the other titles were a bit raunchy. This <br/>
is perhaps only for the very brave then. <br/>

<br/>
Next I found a more &quot;family friendly&quot; tourist site that had a new <br/>
detail about Hijikata&#39;s death. Apparently there was a barrier of some <br/>
sort he was trying to break through when he was killed? I know that <br/>
many roads in the Edo period had check points which all travelers had <br/>
to pass through in order for the Bakufu to be able to control the <br/>
movements of troops and weapons in the country. I am guessing that <br/>
this &quot;barrier&quot; was one of the checkpoints in Ezo?<br/>
<br/>
Also some info on a memorial tower that the people of Hakodate built <br/>
especially for the Tokugawa war dead.<br/>

<br/>
And last but certainly not least is this little reference to Kondo <br/>
getting his butt kicked?! In all fairness it says he was using a <br/>
spear at the time rather than a sword, but still... Tale tell or <br/>
truth?<br/>

<br/>
On a note of redemption for the Commander&#39;s honor, I did find a small <br/>
reference saying that people in Nagareyama now consider him a hero <br/>
for surrendering and sparing their town from being destroyed in fight.<br/>
