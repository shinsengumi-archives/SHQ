<h3>Raid Planned for July 6</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-910066856">Shinsengumi will raid Ikedaya on July 6th, in the chatroom at <br/>
www.shinsengumimb.com...:-D 140 years to the day of the original raid.<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive there, be sure to arrive in small groups, so as not to <br/>
attract attention (and to prevent deserters)-- but once you do arrive there, <br/>
announce yourself (either in English or Japanese)-- such as &quot;We are the <br/>
Shinsengumi! We have business!&quot;, or &quot;Shinsengumi da! Goyou aratame de aru!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is much like a game of go or shogi. If we don&#39;t act now, they will get <br/>
back at us in the next turn. Therefore, we must arrest or kill all of them <br/>
tonight!&quot; --Kondou Isami, in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen&quot;<br/>

It is around 10:00 p.m. that Kondou went into Ikedaya-inn. <br/>
How about making it somewhere start at the time? <br/>
(The participation from Tokyo is impossible.)   <br/>
And although this is very hard to say, the Ikedaya-inn attack was on <br/>
July 8. <br/>
The incident arose on June 5, 1864 on old Japanese calender. <br/>
I searched this date at some sites. It is on Occidental calender on <br/>
July 8 on that day. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370948485">I hope a couple of us can be at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> on <br/>
July8th...no time has been suggested yet it seems...<br/>
<br/>
I am however going to make a role playing game proposal<br/>
&quot;Be Saitou for a few minutes&quot; your choices are<br/>
RK, PMK, NHK, Mibu. or a mixture with history or any well known <br/>
version...you will not be thrown to the sharks...whoever starts the <br/>
game will set the rating (G, PG, PG13 or R)...this is how the game <br/>
can work<br/>
<br/>
*one person at a time can interview or ask whoever plays Saitou a <br/>
question (when forming the question keep the rating system in mind)<br/>
<br/>
*questions can be drawn from history or the RK or PMK universe<br/>
<br/>
*you don&#39;t have to be Saitou for the entire chat...you can bail out <br/>
and ask for someone to step in<br/>
<br/>
*this means that you should just skim some of the info we have <br/>
gathered over these past couple of months<br/>
<br/>
*in the future I hope with more info someone will &quot;be&quot; Hijikata<br/>
<br/>
*this game is just a suggestion if anyone of our storytellers drop <br/>
in to entertain us with more tales then ofcourse we will gather <br/>
round and listen<br/>

can work<br/>
<br/>
*one person at a time can interview or ask whoever plays Saitou a <br/>
question (when forming the question keep the rating system in mind)<br/>
<br/>
*questions can be drawn from history or the RK or PMK universe<br/>
<br/>
*you don&#39;t have to be Saitou for the entire chat...you can bail out <br/>
and ask for someone to step in<br/>
<br/>
*this means that you should just skim some of the info we have <br/>
gathered over these past couple of months<br/>
<br/>
*in the future I hope with more info someone will &quot;be&quot; Hijikata<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522841905">I can&#39;t attend the chat for July 8, it&#39;s really regrettable. I would like to <br/>
take the role of NHK Saito, if I were.<br/>
<br/>
I put only a precision about PMK Saito&#39;s yukata mentioned by M san.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I personally don&#39;t like walking around in a yukata with <br/>
&gt;only one sword at my side. :-D<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In fact PMK Saito doesn&#39;t wear yukata, but ordinary kimono without hakama nor <br/>
haori. It&#39;s casual way of wearing kimono for men, called &quot;kinagashi &quot;style.<br/>
<br/>
A modern styel kinagashi page is bellow. Only difference with Edo period is <br/>
underwear, there is few person who wear fundoshi in this time, I think.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sawai/club2/r2nagasi.html">http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sawai/club2/r2nagasi.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Yukata is originally a kind of bath robe for nobility in Heian period.<br/>
It become populer in Edo period, and especially for townpeople( both men and <br/>
women). They used to wear it for some occasion like festival or hanami ( <br/>
cherry blossom viewing),however it considered too casual. For exemple,a wife or a <br/>
daughter of Samurai class did never wear yukata at least in public.<br/>
<br/>
So Saito and some PMK characters are dressed kinagashi style kimono.<br/>
You can notice in Jidaigeki (Japanese costume drama), some people wearing <br/>
kinagashi style kimono. NHK Harada also appears frequently in kinagashi, but <br/>
inconvenience of this style is, if you don&#39;t move properly, you are in danger of <br/>
expose your fundoshi.<br/>
<br/>
An addition for NHK Hijikata fan,<br/>

And yes, it is pretty much true. Rurouni Kenshin<br/>
(known as Samurai X here) was a huge hit, despite the<br/>
heavy censorship suffered when it was aired and the<br/>
incredibly poor dubbing (e.g., they never defined if<br/>
Kenshin was going to Kyoto, Tokyo, Edo or Aioria(sic)<br/>
to fight Shishio). The &quot;Yahiko no Sakabatou&quot; is being<br/>
released here almost one year after the end of the<br/>
original series and already its first print is almost<br/>
sold out (ookata kanbai desu), though it&#39;s being sold<br/>
so far only in a local anime con. Not to mention that<br/>
there are still many RK cosplayers in the event,<br/>
including Kenshin, Sanosuke, Yahiko and Saito, despite<br/>
the end of the series.<br/>
<br/>
As for RuroKen popularity, I guess it is quite popular<br/>
in the Phillipines and France, just to name other two<br/>
countries where RuroKen was published and got popular.<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-1359">&gt;</a> Recommended Movies + RK Popularity Momoiro</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-886884730">I would like to add to SK&#39;s comments about Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s<br/>
popularity in other countries.  It was very popular in Thailand and<br/>
well translated.  The entire series was aired and the dubbing was<br/>
outstanding but I still prefer Saitou&#39;s Japanese voice ^_^.  The tone<br/>
and overall word selection of the manga translation was superb.  For<br/>
example how Cho speaks to Saitou, how Saitou speaks to Kenshin.  The<br/>
translators were very careful and the Thai audience is very well<br/>
acquainted with martial arts terminology borrowed from Chinese martial<br/>
arts.  So the translators used Chinese terms or provided footnotes to<br/>
further explain a Japanese term.  What is incorrect is the title<br/>
&quot;Wandering Samurai&quot;.  So you have to draw an &quot;X&quot; on your cheek or show<br/>
a picture to the store clerk so they understand.  If you say Rurouni<br/>
Kenshin as the title they will not understand ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Since many people are now starting to view martial arts films I would<br/>
like to recommend:<br/>
&quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot; DVD directed by Kurosawa (judo, karate,and western<br/>
boxing takes place in 1887 Yokohama)  I have always preferred<br/>
Kurosawa&#39;s earlier films over his later films such as Kagemusha or<br/>
Ran.  Sanshiro Sugata must be enjoyed over a couple of days at least.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A Touch of Zen&quot; directed by King Hu...the film was, like SWORD OF<br/>
DOOM (I propose a new title the &quot;Psychopath Samurai&quot;), given the wrong<br/>
title.  A Touch of Zen is actually a Chinese film so maybe they should<br/>
have called it &quot;A Touch of Ch&#39;an&quot; or something ^_^  This film takes<br/>
place in a totally different time period from that seen in Crouching<br/>
Tiger or Once Upon a Time in China or Iron Monkey...&quot;A Touch of Zen&quot;<br/>
contains wushu/kungfu action with little or no strings attached...the<br/>
film does NOT go for the fairytale feeling as seen in Crouching Tiger<br/>
so if you want that kind of action this is not for you. There is some<br/>
string work in a bamboo grove scene but I assure you no one walks on<br/>
water in this movie! Contains best man versus woman fight.  If the<br/>
movie was simply about a woman who kicks major *ss then I would not<br/>
recommend it (the martial arts genre if filled with strong female<br/>
characters and an argument can be made that KILL BILL butchers the<br/>
idea of a &quot;strong&quot; woman)...this film is MUCH more.  Banish the<br/>
horrible imported kungfu movies of the 70s with wild colors,<br/>
incompetant dubbing and crazy Shaolin monks from your mind this film<br/>
is at a whole different level. Amazing story, cinematography and<br/>
acting makes it perhaps THE BEST martial arts movie to come out of<br/>
China.  But labelling it as simply an action film may be wrong as well<br/>
because it deals with femininity (WITHOUT THE CROSS DRESSING!), the<br/>
art of war, and ethics and morality.  This film contains elements such<br/>
as the whole &quot;shining eyes&quot; (literally!!!), steady steady stare, and<br/>
the famous &quot;stare your opponents down&quot;.  In fact the heroine hardly<br/>
blinks at times ^_^. The film was made in 1971 but can easily capture<br/>
an audience in 2004...it was shown at a film festival in L.A. not too<br/>
long ago and dazzled the audience with its sophistication and class<br/>
absent in many martial arts films.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, I was mistaken in the address. <br/>
My subject is the report of the first address which you put up. <br/>
I surmise that it will probably be extremely popular that each <br/>
volume sells rather than 100,000 copies although a scale is <br/>
naturally different for every country. <br/>
Although RK is a fiction, history of Japan is involved. <br/>
And a color of Japan is a strong work. <br/>
I think that it will be really serious to translate it as the people <br/>
of a foreign country can understand it. <br/>
However, I read that translators have translated the world of RK <br/>
very in conscience. <br/>
Is the page of the talk of Watsuki sensei also translated? <br/>
Translation is more difficult for that page than story. <br/>
I think that people who are not interested in Japanese history and <br/>
Shinsengumi do not understand the talk of the model of the character <br/>
at all. <br/>
<br/>
I have heard rumor that there is a fan of very deep Shinsengumi, <br/>
about France. <br/>
(Since I cannot read French, I cannot confirm it.) <br/>
For me, RK is only one of the eccentric Shonen Manga. <br/>
However, it is very wonderful because this Manga is introducing <br/>
Shinsengumi to many countries. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My aunt comes from Thailand. <br/>
Correctly, my uncle&#39;s wife comes from Thailand. <br/>
(She is a Japanese now.) <br/>
When she came to Tokyo about 15 years ago, she had said in Thailand <br/>
that Japanese animation was popular. <br/>
She had said that &quot;Ikkyusan&quot; was popular. <br/>
I do not know what Ikkyusan was called in Thailand. <br/>
It is the talk of the boy monk of the Muromachi period. <br/>
He is a very clever boy and solves the difficult problem which <br/>
Syogun and a rich merchant bring. <br/>
I wondered why the work would be popular. <br/>
My mother surmised that it was because Thailand is a Buddhism <br/>
country. <br/>
Even so, that work has many special features of ancient times of <br/>
Japan, and I thought that it was the difficult work of translation. <br/>
Since there is such memory, even if I hear that the translators of <br/>
Thailand translated RK well, I am not surprised. <br/>
(But it is a surprising thing. Since Bakumatsu is a very troublesome <br/>
time, there are many people who cannot explain well even among <br/>
Japanese people....And I am also contained there.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A long time ago, I looked at GONIN in the movie theater. <br/>
I and a friend entered to kill time in the movie theater, became <br/>
somewhat crazy, and came out from there. <br/>
&quot;Sato Koichi and Motoki Masahiro were kissing!!&quot; <br/>
&quot;Kitano Takeshi was homosexual Yakuza!!!&quot;<br/>

By the way, has the talk of &quot;Azumi&quot; movie already come out here? <br/>
With this work, Odagiri Joe is playing the crazy swordsman. <br/>
Since there was much action using a wire, to those who like a <br/>
legitimate sword-play film, it was disreputable, but it was <br/>
comparatively interesting. <br/>

&gt; (The romanji text of Kamo san is very polite.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for your kind compliment ^_~ I think it<br/>
isn&#39;t polite at all, compared to your Japanese, but...<br/>
^^;;;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I surmise that it will probably be extremely popular<br/>
&gt; that each <br/>
&gt; volume sells rather than 100,000 copies although a<br/>
&gt; scale is <br/>
&gt; naturally different for every country. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True enough. But in Brazil, manga is a new kind of<br/>
media and it is something very specific, so it is<br/>
quite surprising and outstanding that it has sold that<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although RK is a fiction, history of Japan is<br/>
&gt; involved. <br/>
&gt; And a color of Japan is a strong work. <br/>
&gt; I think that it will be really serious to translate<br/>
&gt; it as the people <br/>
&gt; of a foreign country can understand it. <br/>
&gt; However, I read that translators have translated the<br/>
&gt; world of RK <br/>
&gt; very in conscience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, in the Brazilian case, there was a lot of<br/>
footnotes, so that people would be able to at least<br/>
have an idea of the wordings, characters and concepts<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
As for the setting of the manga, there are many people<br/>
who have a keen interest in Japanese culture (just as<br/>
a curiosity, many people started practicing kendo<br/>
after reading RuroKen. Kinda like what Captain Tsubasa<br/>
did to Japanese soccer, methinks ^^), especially manga<br/>
and anime. Some older people (20s and higher) do like<br/>
tokusatsu too, ranging from Ultraman/Ultraseven to<br/>
Changeman (including Magma Taishi!). There was<br/>
recently a local anime con with the presence of four<br/>
JAM Project members, Kageyama Hironobu, Okui Masami,<br/>
Endo Masaaki and Sakamoto Eizo, and their show was a<br/>
huge success (I am still a bit dizzy thanks to the<br/>
show ^^;;;). The artists themselves were quite<br/>
impressed, as their diaries show:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.makusonia.com/cgi-bin/diary/diary.cgi">http://www.makusonia.com/cgi-bin/diary/diary.cgi</a><br/>

(Kageyama Hironobu&#39;s diary)<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess the interest in the Japanese culture was<br/>
one of the reasons why RuroKen was such a success<br/>
here. Obviously, there was also the artwork, the plot<br/>
and the characters ^^<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is the page of the talk of Watsuki sensei also<br/>
&gt; translated? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, all the character profiles and the free talks<br/>
were translated. I guess the same happened in other<br/>
translations, like in French and in American English.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Translation is more difficult for that page than<br/>
&gt; story. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For those who are not acquainted to Japanese history<br/>
and Shinsengumi, it surely is. But the translator<br/>
handled the job ^^ Plenty of footnotes on the<br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
And in the first few volumes, there was even some<br/>
extra material explaining things like Japanese<br/>
history, basic Japanese swordsmanship (kendo) jargon<br/>
and all, including a short essay on the &quot;Miburo&quot;<br/>
manga, starring Serizawa Kamo (no, not me, of course<br/>
^^;;;) who was the model for Jin-eh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that people who are not interested in<br/>
&gt; Japanese history and <br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi do not understand the talk of the model<br/>
&gt; of the character <br/>
&gt; at all. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps, but on the other hand, I guess many people<br/>
also developed an interest in Japanese history and in<br/>
Shinsengumi thanks to those talks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have heard rumor that there is a fan of very deep<br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi, <br/>
&gt; about France. <br/>
&gt; (Since I cannot read French, I cannot confirm it.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps it&#39;s Tama-san ^.^ (just kidding!). But I&#39;m<br/>
sure there are many Shinsengumi enthusiasts in France.<br/>
There are some hardcore Shinsengumi fans here as well.<br/>
Just as a curiosity, the winning &quot;cosplay&quot; of one<br/>
anime con in 2001 was about the Shinsengumi killing<br/>
Battousai ^^;;; I really got surprised when I saw one<br/>
person fighting with a spear and another one coughing<br/>
up blood during the masquerade ^^;;;;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For me, RK is only one of the eccentric Shonen<br/>
&gt; Manga. <br/>
&gt; However, it is very wonderful because this Manga is<br/>
&gt; introducing <br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi to many countries. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree ^^ That&#39;s very good, especially because the<br/>
only other &quot;source&quot; of information on the Shinsengumi<br/>
here was... the &quot;Gohatto&quot; movie... ^^;;;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She had said that &quot;Ikkyusan&quot; was popular. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ikkyusan: &quot;kaze ni makasete mairu&quot;<br/>
(&quot;I go where the wind blows&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Yamabushi: &quot;kaze no nai toki wa&quot;<br/>
(&quot;And if there is no wind?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Ikkyusan (playing his shakuhachi): &quot;jibun de fuite<br/>

<br/>
I remember I took years to understand what it meant<br/>

it is based on a manga, I didn&#39;t expect a jidaigeki or<br/>
anyting similar ^^;;; Odagiri Joe reminded me of a<br/>
character that appears in the first volumes of Burai,<br/>
though. And they could have replaced Aya Ueto for a<br/>
cute doll and it would have acted better than her<br/>
^^;;; Let us hope that her acting skills will improve<br/>
for the sequel...<br/>
<br/>
Have you watched &quot;Jigoku no Koshien&quot;? Odagiri Joe<br/>
appears in that work too, as Yakyu Jubee, if I&#39;m not<br/>
mistaken ^^<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The idea of a young novice monk easily translates into Thai culture <br/>
because many children attend temple schools and most Thai men spent <br/>
time as a monk before marriage (from a couple of days, 2-3 months or <br/>
a year).  Ikkyusan is called ikkyusan in the Thai dub or an <br/>
alternate pronoun is the Thai word for novice+Ikkyu.<br/>
But the most popular manga and anime is still Doraemon it seems.<br/>
Manga is so popular in Thailand that we have problems with official <br/>
compared to unofficial translations and companies have to clearly <br/>
state that they have purchased the copyrights from Japan usually <br/>
with a holographic sticker or some other symbol.<br/>
<br/>
A Thai man invented ultraman SK ^_^ and it was exported to Japan in <br/>
one episode of ultraman he fights with the monkey king from the <br/>
Indian epic Ramayana the costume of the monkey king is in the <br/>
traditional Thai dance style.  The Japanese company purchased the <br/>
rights to ultraman for a certain number of years and continued to <br/>

to provide a few comments as soon as I could. So, for those who are <br/>
interested, you will find these comments in the NHK&#39;s section of my <br/>
website (btw, thanks for advertising it while I was away Sec) as well <br/>
as a few pics of Jo Odagiri in the movie. It&#39;s really worth the look. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are actually many people who read &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; and began <br/>
soccer among the players of J.League. Before that work was set to <br/>
anime, most Japanese boys were playing baseball.^^ <br/>
Recently, there were many children who were influenced by &quot;Hikaru no <br/>
go&quot; and began the game of go. <br/>
<br/>
Although I have read and noticed their diary, now present Brazil is <br/>
winter. Since Brazil had a hot image, I was surprised that they are <br/>
writing that that is cold.<br/>
<br/>
Tokusatsu is popular among the mothers who have small child in the <br/>
latest Japan. Although it is shown to children, in fact, they are <br/>
absorbed in Tokusatsu. lol<br/>
Is Kageyama the person who sang the song of &quot;DragonBall&quot; and &quot;Saint <br/>
Seiya&quot;? <br/>
About &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, some South American broadcasting stations heard <br/>
rumor that it requested so that TOEI created the sequel of that. <br/>
Although only it is not the cause, DVD of the new episode of &quot;Saint <br/>
Seiya&quot; has come out now. <br/>
Many of my friends were the fans of Saint Seiya at their school <br/>
days. Although not excited like before, several persons buy DVD. <br/>

In Japan, it only introduced that there was Manga which became <br/>
origin. I found &quot;Miburo&quot; by chance at the secondhand bookseller, and <br/>
it got to know that this Manga was the work of the talk of Watsuki. <br/>
Japanese RK fan may have many those who do not know this work. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, there is an opinion that Serizawa Kamo (not you) had <br/>
trouble with his syphilis, truly. <br/>
(This is a guess of some researchers and there is no positive <br/>
proof.) <br/>
If syphilis advances, a patient&#39;s brain goes crazy and it becomes <br/>
impossible for him to understand anything. Researchers explain that <br/>
Serizawa drank alcohol and rioted in order to beguile the sick fear. <br/>
The Japanese of that time was threatened by syphilis and <br/>
tuberculosis. <br/>

Probably, it was an interesting work to people who know Shinsengumi. <br/>
Is a short play performed there at the time of &quot;cosplay&quot;? <br/>
In Japan, although much cosplayers gather at the time of comic <br/>
market or other events, the short play is not performed. <br/>
Since comic market is the place which sells doujinshi, cosplay is a <br/>
supporting player. I do not know about the event of only cosplay. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Gohatto&quot; thinks that it was disreputable to the fans of <br/>
Shinsengumi. The angry person was also in my surroundings. <br/>
I am interested in how you have recognized Shinsengumi on that <br/>
movie. <br/>
<br/>
About RK, I sensed that it was very strange. <br/>
When RK caused Shinsengumi boom, it differed from the former boom. <br/>
Although the fans in novel or drama of the boom till then were <br/>
centers, RK called in the fans of manga or anime. <br/>
And although Okita, Hijikata, and Kondou of the boom till then were <br/>
the leading roles, the leading role at that time was Saitou Hajime. <br/>
<br/>
I said to RK fan&#39;s friend. <br/>
&quot;Although the Shinsengumi member most famous for Japan is Okita <br/>
Souji, a Shinsengumi member famous for countries other than Japan is <br/>
Saitou Hajime.&quot; <br/>
After my friend thought for a while and understood the meaning, she <br/>
laughed. <br/>
She said. &quot;The Shinsengumi member whom I got to know at the very <br/>
beginning was also Saitou Hajime.&quot; ^^;;<br/>

his information.) <br/>
<br/>
Burai....To be sure, that character also wore the white kimono. <br/>

He is an actor named Sakaguchi Taku.<br/>
It seems that he was appearing also on &quot;Azumi&quot; as three brothers&#39; <br/>

Thank you for finding this episode. Since this was not found, I was <br/>
melancholy about one month. Before, I read these contents with the <br/>
book partly. Although I wanted to write this talk when I wrote to a <br/>
board about the episode of the grave which Nagakura built, I was not <br/>
able to remember this correctly. <br/>
I looked at the books of Shinsengumi which I have. However, no books <br/>
was written about this. My knowing is having engraved the side of <br/>
the grave with the dead&#39;s name. Therefore, about Saitou&#39;s name, I <br/>
thought that it was my misapprehension. <br/>
Thank you very much again. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056986007"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There are actually many people who read &quot;Captain<br/>
&gt; Tsubasa&quot; and began <br/>
&gt; soccer among the players of J.League. Before that<br/>
&gt; work was set to <br/>
&gt; anime, most Japanese boys were playing baseball.^^ <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see ^^ Well, no wonder, since baseball is one of the<br/>
most popular sports in Japan ^^<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Recently, there were many children who were<br/>
&gt; influenced by &quot;Hikaru no <br/>
&gt; go&quot; and began the game of go. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; stirred some interest in anime fans<br/>
here and several have tried learning the game. But<br/>
still, it&#39;s an obscure game here, compared to chess<br/>
and checkers.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although I have read and noticed their diary, now<br/>
&gt; present Brazil is <br/>
&gt; winter. Since Brazil had a hot image, I was<br/>
&gt; surprised that they are <br/>
&gt; writing that that is cold.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being a continental country, in the southern parts it<br/>
actually snows in the winter ^^ (demo Nihon no nanbu<br/>
wa Okinawa dakara chotto &quot;minami no kuni&quot; te iu image<br/>
to chigau desho? ^^;;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tokusatsu is popular among the mothers who have<br/>
&gt; small child in the <br/>
&gt; latest Japan. Although it is shown to children, in<br/>
&gt; fact, they are <br/>
&gt; absorbed in Tokusatsu. lol<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see ^^ A cousin of mine who&#39;s living in Japan is one<br/>
of such cases ^^ I though it was only her, though<br/>
&lt;laugh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is Kageyama the person who sang the song of<br/>
&gt; &quot;DragonBall&quot; and &quot;Saint <br/>
&gt; Seiya&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, the theme of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; (Cha-la<br/>
Head-cha-la) and the 2nd opening of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;<br/>
(Soldier Dream)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although only it is not the cause, DVD of the new<br/>
&gt; episode of &quot;Saint <br/>
&gt; Seiya&quot; has come out now. <br/>
&gt; Many of my friends were the fans of Saint Seiya at<br/>
&gt; their school <br/>
&gt; days. Although not excited like before, several<br/>
&gt; persons buy DVD. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Several people here are excited about that, and they<br/>
are wondering if Toei will produce more Saint Seiya<br/>
stuff. It was very popular here in the early 90&#39;s, so<br/>
people do still remember it.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Incidentally, there is an opinion that Serizawa Kamo<br/>
&gt; (not you) had <br/>
&gt; trouble with his syphilis, truly. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have read this somewhere too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If syphilis advances, a patient&#39;s brain goes crazy<br/>
&gt; and it becomes <br/>
&gt; impossible for him to understand anything.<br/>
&gt; Researchers explain that <br/>
&gt; Serizawa drank alcohol and rioted in order to<br/>
&gt; beguile the sick fear. <br/>
&gt; The Japanese of that time was threatened by syphilis<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; tuberculosis. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And &quot;hashika&quot; and &quot;korori&quot;, right? ^^<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is a short play performed there at the time of<br/>
&gt; &quot;cosplay&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here the short play is optional. Those who want to<br/>
present such play sign up for it ^^<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Since comic market is the place which sells<br/>
&gt; doujinshi, cosplay is a <br/>
&gt; supporting player. I do not know about the event of<br/>
&gt; only cosplay. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is the opposite. Cosplay draws a much greater<br/>
attention than doujinshi. So far, we have nothing like<br/>
Komiketto, and no Odaiba presentation hall (laughs)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Gohatto&quot; thinks that it was disreputable to the<br/>
&gt; fans of <br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi. The angry person was also in my<br/>
&gt; surroundings. <br/>
&gt; I am interested in how you have recognized<br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi on that <br/>
&gt; movie. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, coming from Oshima Nagisa, couldn&#39;t expect a<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; movie... but it is far from the jidaigeki I&#39;m<br/>
used (?) to watch.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; About RK, I sensed that it was very strange. <br/>
&gt; When RK caused Shinsengumi boom, it differed from<br/>
&gt; the former boom. <br/>
&gt; Although the fans in novel or drama of the boom till<br/>
&gt; then were <br/>
&gt; centers, RK called in the fans of manga or anime. <br/>
&gt; And although Okita, Hijikata, and Kondou of the boom<br/>
&gt; till then were <br/>
&gt; the leading roles, the leading role at that time was<br/>
&gt; Saitou Hajime. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here, it was RK that made Shinsengumi famous among<br/>
anime fans here, and therefore, it&#39;s Saitou Hajime the<br/>
most known person from the Shinsengumi. Some people<br/>
know Sanosuke or Okita, but they are in a few number.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She said. &quot;The Shinsengumi member whom I got to know<br/>
&gt; at the very <br/>
&gt; beginning was also Saitou Hajime.&quot; ^^;;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t deny that I knew Shinsengumi first by reading RK<br/>
^^;;; Only then I read &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; and &quot;Shinsengumi<br/>
Keppuroku&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I remember I took years to understand what it<br/>
&gt; meant<br/>
&gt; &gt; ^^;;;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Possibly, was Ikkyu-san broadcast even in Brazil?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it wasn&#39;t, although many old anime were broadcast<br/>
here ^^<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Have you watched &quot;Jigoku no Koshien&quot;? Odagiri Joe<br/>
&gt; &gt; appears in that work too, as Yakyu Jubee, if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; mistaken ^^<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, the actor of &quot;Jigoku Koshien&quot; is not Odagiri. <br/>
&gt; He is an actor named Sakaguchi Taku.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whoops... sorry for my mistake -_-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Shikashi Kamo san kuwashisugi desu. Brazil no Anime<br/>
&gt; fan wa minasan <br/>
&gt; soudesuka? ^^;;;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eh? Sonna ni kuwashiku arimasen ^^ Tada ikkai no &quot;fan&quot;<br/>
to shite Shinsengumi wo medeteru dake desu ^^ <br/>
<br/>
As for other kinds of info, there are some people who<br/>
are way more knowledgeable than I am here in Brazil.<br/>
There are people who have an incredible knowledge on<br/>
the old series that were aired here, like Ultraman,<br/>
Ultraseven, Paa-man (Super Dinamo), Magma Taishi,<br/>
Tetsujin 28go, Cyborg 009, Heiji, Ribon no Kishi and<br/>
more ^^ And plenty of people who have got deep<br/>
knowledge of 80&#39;s series like Macross (Robotech),<br/>
Yamato (Starblazers), Jaspion, Changeman, Flashman.<br/>
And, of course, the die-hard fans of Saint Seiya,<br/>
Dragon Ball, Yu Yu Hakusho and others ^^<br/>
