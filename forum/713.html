 </span></blockquote>Not KIND is not the word for it. Yahoo was more like downright CRUEL. Just before I was talking to you, someone else tried to chat with me on that and the same thing happened. So now I know, DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!<br/>
<br/>
I'm still going round and round with that interesting little twist you gave me Phil! I think I'm close to a solution though! Must do more research!<br/>
