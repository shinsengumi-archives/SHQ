<div id="ygrps-yiv-372497898">initially, I felt that we didn&#39;t need the live chat feature at<br/>
ezboard...however I just read how 2 fanfic writers are fighting over<br/>
Hijikata (again)...<br/>
if you are a member on that board then all you do is click on &quot;Live<br/>
Chat&quot; beneath the banner<br/>
live chat works...pretty slick format...now everyone can speculate on<br/>
how hist. Hijikata managed to end rumors about Shinsengumi ghosts<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not KIND is not the word for it. Yahoo was more like downright CRUEL. Just before I was talking to you, someone else tried to chat with me on that and the same thing happened. So now I know, DON&#39;T TOUCH ANYTHING!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still going round and round with that interesting little twist you gave me Phil! I think I&#39;m close to a solution though! Must do more research!<br/>
