I tried to post it on SHQ message board at Itou affair thread, but curiously <br/>
they requiered registeration to posting though I&#39;ve already done it, and as my <br/>
e-mail adersse is taken by me I can&#39;t register with my account. It&#39;s strange, <br/>
because I could log in to the chat last night. <br/>
I&#39;ll see closely the problem later.<br/>
<br/>
Just one things about a subject of  the last chat. <br/>
I wonder if Soji&#39;s flatfish like face fact chocked many of yours...<br/>
I remembered after chat that in &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot;manga , Itou said about Soji <br/>
that he wasn&#39;t interested in someone like &quot;Dark flatfish&quot;.<br/>
And even Sei (the heroine) treat him as &quot;Dark Flatfish&quot;, so Kaze Hikaru Souji <br/>
is considered like this I think, if he hasn&#39;t such a kind of appearence in <br/>
this manga.<br/>
