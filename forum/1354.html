I tried to post it on SHQ message board at Itou affair thread, but curiously <br/>
they requiered registeration to posting though I've already done it, and as my <br/>
e-mail adersse is taken by me I can't register with my account. It's strange, <br/>
because I could log in to the chat last night. <br/>
I'll see closely the problem later.<br/>
<br/>
Just one things about a subject of  the last chat. <br/>
I wonder if Soji's flatfish like face fact chocked many of yours...<br/>
I remembered after chat that in "Kaze Hikaru"manga , Itou said about Soji <br/>
that he wasn't interested in someone like "Dark flatfish".<br/>
And even Sei (the heroine) treat him as "Dark Flatfish", so Kaze Hikaru Souji <br/>
is considered like this I think, if he hasn't such a kind of appearence in <br/>
this manga.<br/>
