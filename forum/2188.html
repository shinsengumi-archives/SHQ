<h3>Fanart Contest + Nakazato Kaizan + Natsume Soseki</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275095628">came across yet another literary connection<br/>
<br/>
Nakazato (also spelled Nakasato) Kaizan the author of DAIBOSATSU-TOGE <br/>
(novel with Shinsengumi), if you recall I scanned the entire English <br/>
translation in the past.  Nakazato Kaizan supposedly was *inspired by <br/>
Natsume Soseki (author of I am a Cat and believed to have been a <br/>
friend of Fujita Goro) and started his own literary club.  Basically <br/>
Nakazato Kaizan's views on literature and writing were in line with <br/>
those of Natsume Soseki.<br/>
<br/>
many writers during the Meiji Era joined clubs but in the case of <br/>
Kaizan he didn't join any of the more traditional clubs<br/>
<br/>
the reference in the book I read merely said "inspired by" not if <br/>
they knew each other personally...but I just thought that was an <br/>
interesting connection *IF* a man who wrote about the Shinsengumi <br/>
knew another novelist who was a friend of a former member of the <br/>
Shinsengumi (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Moeyoken Fanart Contest<br/>
you do NOT have to draw in the style of Moeyoken...the idea is just <br/>
*from Moeyoken...basically design a daughter of the member of the <br/>
Shinsengumi *BE CREATIVE* (^_^) you must also submit a brief write up <br/>
of the personality of your newly designed character<br/>
