<h3><a href="#msg-2971">&gt;</a> Scholarly info?</h3>

this book has already been discussed. Please forgive<br/>

<br/>
On Friday, my correspondent and I are going to<br/>
interview a Mr. Michael Auslin, Associate Professor of<br/>
History at Yale and Director of the Project for<br/>
Japan-US Relations. He wrote a book which was<br/>
published in 2004 called &quot;Negotiating with Imperialism<br/>
- The Unequal Treaties and the Culture of Japanese<br/>
Diplomacy&quot;. I have only been able to get a reading<br/>
sample online and the book I ordered will not arrive<br/>
in time for the shoot. <br/>
I was wondering whether anyone here has it handy and<br/>
what their thoughts were on the book and his analysis.<br/>
All comments would be very much appreciated. Thanks in<br/>
advance! <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, <br/>
<br/>
Mio. <br/>

[PS. Shameless plugging alert: in case anyone is<br/>
interested, at last I have the next chapter finished -<br/>
and it&#39;s been one of the worst writing experiences<br/>
I&#39;ve had so far. I intend to post it on Friday night.]<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774557249">Well it is about time we get our next chapter!!<br/>
secretarytocapt3 can wait for so long..........<br/>
(^_^)<br/>
<br/>
oh no I think there are hundreds of decent books out there we have not<br/>
yet covered.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for telling us about this work by Auslin.<br/>
<br/>
My library does have the book (^_^)<br/>
However, if I do not email you off-list tonight then it means for some<br/>
reason I was unable to get it (due to my research I get very rare<br/>
texts from other schools---when I reach a limit the library does not<br/>
let me check out *more books until I *return those rare texts).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious to read his analysis as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I think unequal trade treaties have been explored by many many<br/>
scholars over the past century however what they are missing is this:<br/>
<br/>
***the treaties themselves were not the motivating factors for many<br/>
men who actually did the fighting in 1868.  For example samurai &quot;A&quot;<br/>
many not say &quot;I am totally going to fight and die because of the<br/>
ridiculous treaty with the USA! Ha!&quot; and so forth<br/>
Samurai &quot;A&quot; generally fought for his domain and what he felt was<br/>
happening to it (for example Aizu and other allied northern<br/>
domains)---or if he felt his domain would now rise to national power<br/>
(for example Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, Hizen etc)<br/>
<br/>
***some of their leaders did not explain the details to them just that<br/>
the bakufu was incompetent in handling the foreigners<br/>
<br/>
***so many normal citizens at the time had no access to what was<br/>
going, much of the info they heard was incorrect, while there were<br/>
newspapers and so forth they were not at the level of media we have<br/>
today ofcourse<br/>
<br/>
so while in looking back, the trade treaties played a key role in the<br/>
collapse of the shogunate they did not matter much to the common<br/>
people who were not aware of the situation their country was facing<br/>
<br/>
for me personally economics destroyed the bakufu<br/>
I think many of us here wandered in the Meiji era and are very<br/>
familiar with zaibatsu (monopolized family based industries---e.g.<br/>
many banks, mines etc) which played a role in the rise of fascist<br/>
Japan and WW2<br/>
<br/>
but did you know that major families such as the MITSUI, by witholding<br/>
money they were to give to the bakufu...literally bankrupted the<br/>
shogunate?  Zaibatsu have been incorrectly studied as a Meiji<br/>
phenomena when it began way back in the edo era---and they were the<br/>
real heavy weights of the Bakumatsu <br/>
<br/>
no money = no guns<br/>
<br/>
so many of us have read that the bakufu was backwards and unwilling to<br/>
change militarily (this was a reason proposed by the Ishin Shishi for<br/>
instance)---however few of those writers can explain the economics of<br/>
...WHY...<br/>
