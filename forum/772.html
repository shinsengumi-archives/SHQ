 under banner) but then you have to an ezboard member...it worked okay<br/>
last night but it was my computer/modem that messed up I believe and<br/>
not always Okita's ghost)<br/>
*everyone should bring a virtual hors d'oeuvres or drinks okay :D<br/>
----------------------------------------------<br/>
3-hajime.com poster discusses a movie on the Byakkotai and Yamaguchi<br/>
Jiro (SAitou Hajime)  was shown in the film...note how the poster<br/>
mentions "braided talk" or an oral history concerning the<br/>
Byakkotai...I wanted to ask 3-hajime.com info on the TV series but one<br/>
poster had already mentioned that my posts are too confusing to read :(<br/>
<br/>
BABELFISH:<br/>
"With around the parents' home, perhaps, that you say, also handing<br/>
down and the like regarding the survivor party loyal retainer of white<br/>
tiger party has been transmitted the variety, don't you think?. "White<br/>
tiger party" of end of year period adventure drama special, I saw.<br/>
When 2 3 years ago you borrowed video from the friend, seeing, Saito<br/>
one (Jiro Yamaguchi) there is the memory which thinks that it does not<br/>
come out completely regrettably."<br/>
----------------------------------------------<br/>
I am still babelfishing the Fujita G. chronology on 3-hajime and it<br/>
seems that the family lost a grandchild who was like 2-3 years old only</div>
