brought up the topic of the Mimawarigumi...so I decided to revive the<br/>
topic because it is connected to the Shinsengumi.<br/>

------ORIGINALLY POST 3754 on MM List------<br/>
I was thinking back to the movie Jin Roh again and the crest was a<br/>
3-headed wolf (the movie will show a 3-headed wolf against a red<br/>
flag)...then I remembered the other gumi(s).<br/>
<br/>
1) Shinsengumi/Shinsen-gumi/Sinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
2) Mimawarigumi/Kanto Hasshu Mimawari-gumi<br/>
(I heard through one of our members here as being involved in the<br/>
murder of Ryoma Sakamoto---portrayed in PMK as the &quot;cowboy&quot; with<br/>
dredlocks)(another theory is expressed through the novel/movie<br/>
MIBUGISHIDEN~When the Last Sword is Drawn as Saito Hajime being the<br/>
assassin!...mainstream history books said more than one person was<br/>
involved)...according to credible resources the Mimawarigumi did frame<br/>
the Shinsengumi for this assasination and later confessed to it.  Many<br/>
people initially and understandably believed that the Shinsengumi<br/>
killed Ryoma Sakamoto because they did attempt to arrest him earlier<br/>
but failed.  I have read on 2 Japanese sites that Saitou Hajime was<br/>
related to someone in the Mimawarigumi [this may be speculation ok it<br/>
may not be true at all--you&#39;ve been warned :)]<br/>
<br/>
*Romulus Hillsborough will address the above mentioned controversy in<br/>
his book on the Shinsengumi (in ENGLISH) which will be released this fall!<br/>
<br/>
3)Tokubetsu Koto (Tokko) Keisatsu (?) I&#39;m not sure if this is another<br/>
group...whenever the Shinsengumi are mentioned this name follows so<br/>
I&#39;m assuming they had a similar role.<br/>
<br/>
*I&#39;m sure there were more groups out there...Kyoto is a huge city I<br/>
always wondered how they managed to patrol it by foot and if these<br/>
groups had &quot;turf wars&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***WATCH Jin Roh: the Wolf Brigade***<br/>
It is very much like the story of Yamanami&Spy<br/>

&gt; anyone out there has any information on them, it&#39;d be great to learn<br/>
&gt; more. So far, all I have is the following: as with the Shinsengumi,<br/>
&gt; they operated under the auspices of the Kyoto Military Commission, and<br/>
&gt; the commander was a man named Sasaki Tadasaburou, a master of the<br/>
&gt; kodachi (short sword). That&#39;s about it...<br/>
