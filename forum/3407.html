<h3>Old Scroll from 1853 Found</h3>
by <i>kirasaige</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375795327">The other day I was talking with a co-worker. He was looking over all <br/>
the Japanese paraphenelia I have at my cubicle and asked if I spoke <br/>
or read Japanese. Unfortunately I read none and my speech is well <br/>
enough to get me around but not fluent.<br/>
He said that back in the 60's he had purchases a Habachi in Japan for <br/>
$20. The drawers were all swollen shut from the humidity. When he had <br/>
finally dried the desk out and was able to open the drawers he found <br/>
inside a box and inside that box was a scroll. He hired a translator <br/>
but the language was too old for the translator and all he could <br/>
translate was the writing on the box that said Commodore Perry.<br/>
At this point my jaw dropped to the ground. And I tried not to laugh <br/>
when he said that that dated the scroll back to the 1700's lol. I <br/>
politely corrected him. :)<br/>
So the reason he was asking me if i read Japanese was he wanted to <br/>
see if I could translate it. I couldn't but my bestfriend's mother <br/>
might. Her mother grew up in a Buddhist Temple and is very interested <br/>
in her history. <br/>
So he's going to bring the scroll in and have my friends mom <br/>
translate it. I'm so excited!! I can't wait to actually touch a peice <br/>
of history that I love so much.<br/>
I'll keep everyone informed when i get it. I'll take pictures and <br/>
post them somewhere for all to see. <br/>

<br/>
This is amazing!  I hope that you also convince your friend to seek the aid <br/>
of someone who is knowledgeable about preservation.  Such a delicate <br/>
and potentially valuable piece needs to be protected.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and PLEASE keep us up to date!<br/>
<br/>
Your message made my day!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Frankly it sounds like he wasted his money on a bad translator, or<br/>
someone just claiming to read Japanese. Anyway, keep us posted, should<br/>
be interesting.</div>
