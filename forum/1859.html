Eps. 49 (Final)<br/>
Having captured by the troops of New Government, Isami Kondo is put <br/>
under an interrogation concerning on Koyo Chinbutai which fought <br/>
against the Imperial Forces. Without naming Kaishu Katsu as its <br/>
initiator, Isami accepts all the responsibility. Understanding <br/>
Isami's real intention, Toshizo Hijikata and members from <br/>
Shinsengumi who survived try not to disappoint him, while Sutesuke <br/>
frantically tries to rescue Isami. After sending Hajime Saito and <br/>
others to Aizu to fight, Toshizo sees Katsu and asks him to save <br/>
Isami's life. Katsu refuses his plea and tells Toshizo to go to Ezo <br/>
to fight so that he can prove himself as a true retainer of Shogun. <br/>
As the Tokugawa keeps silence on the request to identify Isami, New <br/>
Government decides to behead him instead of giving him a choice to <br/>
die in dignity by seppuku. On the day of Isami's execution, Toshizo <br/>
is in a battle against New Government. Soji Okita feels lonely as he <br/>
is seriously ill and has lost Okou. Saito is ordered to bring <br/>
Isami's head back by Katamori Matsudaira before it is displayed in <br/>
public . At the execution site, Sutesuke is killed in his desperate <br/>
trial to stop Isami's execution. Leaving the last words to his wife, <br/>
Tsune, his mother, Fude and his brother Otogoro, Isami Kondo faces <br/>
his death. <br/>

posted Barb seeing as I'm only slightly over half-way. LOL. I was <br/>
wondering though if anyone here knows if the interview/highlights <br/>
will be released in bittorrent? And if not, I sure hope someone will <br/>
tape it for future translation. ^_^</div>

they've been doing to the main series.  Even if they don't I'll probably <br/>
tape it anyway just to look and listen :-)<br/>

<h3>Mimawarigumi?</h3>
by <i>enma_o</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431507037">Wondering if someone could give me basic info on this group... whereabouts in Kyoto their HQ was, what their uniforms looked like, any colorful personalities besides their leader Sasaki Tadasaburo (I know a little bit about him already).<br/>
 <br/>
Also, would like to know if there's truth to the rumor of them having a "friendly rivalry" with the Shinsengumi - one site I saw said the two groups were usually in competition but that the leaders sometimes went drinking together. <br/>

<h3>RE: [SHQ] Mimawarigumi?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321001622">Mimawarigumi were composed of an assortment of Tokugawa vassals. Their <br/>
leader was Sasaki Tadasaburou-- who was originally from Aizu but whose <br/>
family also served the Tokugawa directly. Their uniforms were usually gray <br/>
with brown hakama, from what I've found. I haven't found a flag or banner <br/>
yet...and I do have names of some members, from the group that supposedly <br/>
killed Ryoma and Nakaoka Shintarou:<br/>

Sasaki Tadasaburou, Imai Nobuo, Watanabe Yoshitarou, Takahashi Yasijirou, <br/>
Katsura Junnosuke, Dohi Nakazou/Chuuzou, and Sakurai Daizaburou.<br/>
