My original goal was to finish the film section by Friday---didn&#39;t happen <br/>
because I need to use a desktop computer to adjust images and the <br/>

You&#39;ll see some very very old reviews back online, which is why I&#39;m looking <br/>
for some fresh reviews which would give me an excuse to do some editing.<br/>
<br/>
But most importantly &quot;Kunoichi&quot; (contains adult material--keep kids away <br/>
from this one) is available.  It would&#39;ve made a great film for Halloween <br/>
viewing because the quality was truly scary.<br/>

I pondered whether or not the screencaps I made were worth the server <br/>

to be preserved on the internet somewhere...</div>
