My original goal was to finish the film section by Friday---didn't happen <br/>

You'll see some very very old reviews back online, which is why I'm looking <br/>
for some fresh reviews which would give me an excuse to do some editing.<br/>

But most importantly "Kunoichi" (contains adult material--keep kids away <br/>
from this one) is available.  It would've made a great film for Halloween <br/>
viewing because the quality was truly scary.<br/>

I pondered whether or not the screencaps I made were worth the server <br/>
