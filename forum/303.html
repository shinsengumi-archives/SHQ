 </span></blockquote>The episode last  night (#13, I believe) was so good--So good that you <br/>
could understand 90% of what was going on even though you couldn't <br/>
understand a word they said. It was about Kondou facing off against <br/>
Serizawa as the Roushigumi headed from Edo to Kyoto and Serizawa was not <br/>
given proper accommodations.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren't a fan of the actor playing serizawa (Koichi Sato who was <br/>
Saitou in Mibugishiden) you will be after seeing this performance. That <br/>
man can convey what would be lines and lines of dialogue with a few <br/>
facial expressions. I'm not at all surprised he won an award for his <br/>
Saitou portrayal..<br/>
