<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711314827">Thanks for posting it up Sec! Ahahaha this one is so slow sometimes. <br/>
But please do consider, there's a plethora of doujinshi available... <br/>
Ehehehe, mostly RK Saitou but there's PMK and Kaze Hikaru as well. Oh a <br/>
non-shinsengumi too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857228515">I've noticed a few mistakes in regard of the Okita information.<br/>
<br/>
1. Okita was born in Tenpou 13 (1842) or Tenpou 15 (1844.) <br/>
<br/>
2. Okita was born in the Shirakawa domain's mansion in Edo. He wasn't born in Shirakawa.<br/>
<br/>
3. His birth name (in full) was "Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa". Before he went to <br/>
Kyoto In 1863, he changed his name to "Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi." Other than his <br/>
full name, he could be referred as Okita Souji, Okita Souji Kaneyoshi, or Fujiwara no <br/>
Kaneyoshi. In the case of his birth name, he could be referred as Okita Soujirou, Fujiwara <br/>
no Harumasa, or Okita Soujirou Harumasa (but never Okita Harumasa or Okita Harumasa <br/>
Soujirou!)<br/>
<br/>
Family Name: Okita<br/>
Given Name/First Name Equivalent: Soujirou, Souji<br/>
Family Clan Name:Fujiwara<br/>
Formal Given Name/Middle Name Equivalent: Harumasa, Kaneyoshi<br/>
<br/>
4. His father's name was Okita Katsujiro (?-1845); his oldest sister's name was Okita Mitsu <br/>
(1833-1907.)<br/>
<br/>
