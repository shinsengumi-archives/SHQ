About that Hijikata encounter.....<br/>
<br/>
Like many of people my Emmi Maeda had a bit of a fangirl crush on<br/>
Hijikata after seeing those great historic photos of him but when she<br/>
found herself back in 1864 and face to face witheh real man she found<br/>
out why he was called the "Demon Vice Commander".  It's not like she did<br/>
anything to provoke him...not really...it was an accident...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I lay down on the futon again but knew that I'd never fall back to<br/>
sleep. My brain buzzed with a million and three questions, the first<br/>
beinghow was I ever going to get back home when I wasn't even<br/>
quite sure how I got here?<br/>
<br/>
I sat up and crinkled my nose. A breeze blew through the tiny window set<br/>
high in the wall outside the cell and the smell it carried reminded me<br/>
of the chamberpot's existence. Bad enough the place stunk because of<br/>
the male prisoners' waste, but I really didn't want anything of<br/>
the sort to be closer to me than necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I remembered that Yamanami went out last night to relieve his own<br/>
bladder and I didn't recall him unlocking the outer door before<br/>
exiting, so maybe it wasn't locked. I could go out, leave the pot<br/>
then come back and wait to be formally sprung. After all, it's not<br/>
like I was a criminal prisoner or anything.<br/>
<br/>
I retrieved the chamberpot carefully, moving slowly so as not to spill<br/>
it. I tiptoed between the futon and the sleeping samurai leader and<br/>
hoped he didn't decide to stretch out his legs. I stepped over him<br/>
without any disaster and breathed a quick sigh of relief. I inched to<br/>
the door not wanting to draw the attention of those gross guys down the<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
I'm almost home free, I thought, testing the door by nudging it with<br/>
my foot. It gave way a bit and I turned sideways to push it open with my<br/>
shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I knew, the door flew open. I pitched outward and the pot<br/>
flew out of my hands<br/>
<br/>
Right into the center of Toshizou Hijikata's chest. He roared an<br/>
obscenity so loud it had to wake half of Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
I fell to my knees partly as a sign of apology, partly to pray that he<br/>
wouldn't slice my head off. I looked up a bit and winced. The tissue<br/>
I'd used as toilet paper had deposited itself right in the center of<br/>
his low obi.<br/>
<br/>
I bent my head to the ground and apologized profusely in Japanese the<br/>
best I could. I begged his forgiveness, adding that I was a complete<br/>
fool who didn't deserve his mercy.<br/>
<br/>
After all, when confronted with angry men who brandished sharp,<br/>
dangerous objects, it seemed wise to push one's modern pride aside<br/>
and grovel.<br/>
<br/>
Especially after one dumped a pot of pee on them.<br/>
