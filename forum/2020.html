<h3>Bunkyo Ward Archaeology</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791627849">Fujita Family (as well as the Higuchi Ichiyo's family) lived in <br/>
HOngo ...more specifically the Fujitas lived in the Bunkyo Ward <br/>
(F.G. was assigned to the Bunkyo division)...<br/>
<br/>
according to a Saitou Hajime fansite site he lived <br/>
*near* "Masago"...the site took a picture of the "Masago" street to <br/>
aid future fangirls in their search for the location of the Fujita <br/>
residence<br/>
<br/>
All the info below is from<br/>
Digging for Edo. Archaeology and Japan's Premodern Urban Past (in <br/>
Research Trends)<br/>
Constantine N. Vaporis<br/>
Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 53, No. 1. (Spring, 1998), pp. 73-104.<br/>
<br/>
Masago (in Bunkyo) was excavated and some interesting things have <br/>
been unearthed<br/>
<br/>
1) it was the location of DOSHIN/retainer's barracks during the Edo <br/>
era *conclusion was drawn because there is alot of trash <br/>
(archaeologists analyze dump sites and determine the demographics of <br/>
occupants<br/>
"Edo Iseki Kenkyukai Dai-ikkai Taikai zentai togi kiroku" (p. 291-2)<br/>
<br/>
the dig is known as...<br/>
<br/>
Masago Site (Hongo, Bunkyo-ku)<br/>
dig dates 9/1984-6/1985<br/>
Edo-period usage middle compound Ogasawara (Karatsu Domain)<br/>
main compound of Matsudaira (Ueda Domain)<br/>
<br/>
the Metropolitan Board of Education also sponsored digs for schools<br/>
e.g. Mukogaoka High School (bunkyo)<br/>
<br/>
the article also discussed the various foods eaten...for example a <br/>
Swiss guy in 1870 listed that wolves* and monkey were eaten as well <br/>
as domestic dog*<br/>
<br/>
*during the Meiji various meat stores became popular in Tokyo<br/>
part of the Metropolitan Police Dept's job was to inspect these <br/>
butchers<br/>
<br/>
*dried wolf meat was believed to have medicinal properties<br/>
<br/>
In the Bunkyo Ward pet grave markers were found...the dogs were <br/>
found with coins in their mouths to guarantee safe passage to the <br/>
next world<br/>
