<h3>PMK Saitou Scans on Streamload</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-90735842">I have received permission to host manga scanlations of Peacemaker<br/>
Kurogane Saitou at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/">http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/</a><br/>
from fifay.net (who will also add a link to our board in their next<br/>
update)<br/>
NOT the entire manga...I'm just concentrating on Saitou's first<br/>
appearance which is as far the translators got.<br/>
<br/>
same password: makoto<br/>
and only 5.24 mb zipped<br/>
<br/>
I hope these scans of PMK Saitou will be useful for those of you who<br/>
do fanart/fanfic because even if you saw the anime you may not have<br/>
noticed that Saitou "moves" differently...like how he stoops to look<br/>
at people really close (in the manga it just more obvious) and<br/>
Nagakura calls Saitou "that" as if Saitou wasn't human or something<br/>
(Nagakura even apologizes for saying this)...and the whole bit with<br/>
the notion of a 2nd movement (ninja like move)...lastly there is a<br/>
tiny part that points out to the audience that Saitou was literally in<br/>
the background of various scenes...you just don't notice it. I also<br/>
happen to love PMK Saitou's hair :) and how Nanae draws people's hair.<br/>
<br/>
*Reminder*<br/>
A LOVE STORY OF SAITOU HAJIME (sadly, it seems the the writer for Kaze<br/>
Hikaru beat us to it---the story is about a young lady who literally<br/>
can't keep her hands off of S.H.! <<< how's that for a teaser?)<br/>
