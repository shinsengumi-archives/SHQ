<h3>Re: New poll for SHQ</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-62781976">I think this poll is a great idea.<br/>
Due to the popularity of the Shinsengumi pop culture they are now in<br/>
many languages.  Like our own personal struggles with online<br/>
translators such as <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate</a> which at best can<br/>
help us locate interesting text (so that we can forward the info to<br/>
volunteer HUMAN translators), new fans in other countries will be<br/>
faced with similar difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we can, over time come, up with a standard info sheet only 1-3<br/>
paragraphs long which include the most basic Shinsengumi information.<br/>
Translate it into other languages, post in the files section so that<br/>
new fans will have a basic foundation from which to build their new<br/>
fansites.  The info sheet should be as neutral as possible to allow<br/>
new fans from different cultural backgrounds to begin their research<br/>
without being exposed to too much bias right away.<br/>
<br/>
An great example of how the Shinsengumi have been "translated" can be<br/>
seen here<br/>

<br/>
When a manga is translated---footnotes are included---footnotes which<br/>
are highly biased or simply innaccurate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665412857">Yes I think a basic info sheet would be good. There are many things <br/>
repeated on the net from various sources and instead of individually <br/>
pulling them together (which could be inefficient time-wise) a sheet <br/>
that is free for all to translate is better, plus we could avoid <br/>
offending anyone. <br/>
<br/>
Sec, you suggested I do a Shinsengumi page in Tagalog, I'm <br/>
considering it but see the country's second language is English. <br/>
Since the internet (believe it or not) is more of a luxury than a <br/>
convenience in the Philippines, those Filipinos who do go online <br/>
speak/read quite well since they belong to the middle to upper <br/>
class. That said, I will still translate anything to Tagalog that <br/>
anyone wants me to as long as it's Shinsengumi related. LOL! ^__^<br/>
<br/>
Oh I noticed only two are from the Midwest (so far). Darn, I wanted <br/>
to meet up with some of you ;)<br/>
<br/>
Last but not the least... Does anyone know what the following videos <br/>
are and what they are about? I've never seen them before. Apologies <br/>
if they've been discussed before. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That said, I've noticed that for the game BRS (Bakumatsu Renka <br/>
Shinsengumi), otherwise known as the lovely Shinsengumi dating game, <br/>
doujinshi are being produced and they go for a very lovely price. <br/>
LOL! After the NHK Shinsengumi fever, I hope just like Kidou Moeyo <br/>
Ken they make an anime of this game... It's been a while since PMK <br/>
and of course the manga finishing is questionable... *sigh* Either <br/>
way, I wish someone gets a bright idea to turn BRS into an anime <br/>
considering the doujinshis for this game is fetching quite high <br/>
prices in Japan...<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639507315">If you visit the FILES section please look for the "Introduction to <br/>
the Shinsengumi" folder.  There is a VERY basic htm document in this <br/>
folder.  The document has only general information because...<br/>
 <br/>
1) it will be more easy to translate into another language<br/>
2) many sites are connected to Rurouni Kenshin, Peace Maker <br/>
Kurogane, or NHK Shinsengumi! and often the focus is not necessarily <br/>
history<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like to translate the document into another language <br/>
then please go ahead and upload it into the folder thereby making <br/>
your work available to others.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to provide fans in another country a solid <br/>
*starting*point* for their own research. <br/>

I've seen both videos on Japanese sites before but there was no link <br/>
to Amazon for the anime one.  If only they put names by each <br/>
character!  We can guess Okita is the one with the pacifier (^_^).<br/>
