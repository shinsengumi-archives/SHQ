Episode 11: Good-bye, Mother.<br/>
<br/>
Kondo was about to leave for Kyoto. His mother sent for him and told him <br/>
of her past. She was from a peasant family herself and she had been <br/>
jealous of Kondo, who was easily becoming a samurai. Now she understood <br/>
how Kondo wanted to be like a samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Episode 12: To West! (March 28th)<br/>
<br/>
The Roshigumi assembled at the appointed place. Kondo was appointed <br/>
quartermaster.<br/>
There was a little quarrel concerning the seniority of captains. Kondo <br/>
and his fellows belonged to the third company. The captain was Serizawa <br/>
Kamo. But Serizawa wanted to have the first company. The official had to <br/>
explain that there was no seniority among companies.<br/>
<br/>
The other day, Okita saw Nagakura's excellent swordsmanship at a tavern. <br/>
In a clamped place, he instantly put the sword to his opponent's throat. <br/>
Today, when he saw Serizawa's fellows were to attack Nagakura, Okita <br/>
drew sword at the same instant as *** and impressed him.<br/>
The Roshigumi at last started heading for Kyoto.<br/>
