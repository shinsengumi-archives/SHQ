<div id="ygrps-yiv-695095326">I admittedly ain&#39;t the biggest fan of when they put the swords on <br/>
the wrong side for Saito.  On various Martial Arts boards there are <br/>
threads worth of lefties asking if they can train left hand over <br/>
right on the sword and then they get all huffy when they&#39;re told <br/>
that it&#39;s not done that way (for a variety of reasons, among them <br/>
being that putting the swords on the right hip instead of the left <br/>
will have you whacking saya with pretty much every other swordsman <br/>
you walk past).  In Yagyu Shinkage Ryu we have a few left handed <br/>
draws and cuts, but these waza always end with the right hand <br/>
resuming its topside grip on the tsuka.  Saito may have been <br/>
naturally left handed but as was said he would have been forced to <br/>
use his right hand from the time he was a small child thanks to the <br/>
conventions of the times.  I dug Mibu Gishiden, but the side switch <br/>
with Saito was something that drove me nuts.  I like how its done in <br/>
RK a lot better where he wears his swords on the proper side and <br/>
switches his grip when he decides to use his left handed thrust.<br/>
But anywho, wasn&#39;t there another Shinsengumi game coming out where <br/>
they&#39;re all wearing the generally accepted blue haori?  Are any of <br/>
these ever going to make their way over to the U.S.?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727579791">I doubt the game will make its way over here. As all other Shinsengumi games have not. As for the haori, the game that has the blue ones is Fuun Shinsengumi. <br/>
<br/>
I think the left sided thing with the katana was just something they added in Mibu Gishiden to play on the fact he was left handed and to make his character a bit more interesting.  <br/>
