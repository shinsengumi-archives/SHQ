<h3>Hijikata Questions</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415161441">I have been pouring over my old notes and I need some clarification <br/>
of a few things it seems:<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the proper name of the symbol on the side of that <br/>
medicine box he carried around? The translator called it "the <br/>
mountain in this circle". <br/>
<br/>
What is the proper name of the medicine made by the Sato family? It <br/>
was for chest ailments and Toshizou sold it along with the Ishida <br/>
Sanyaku. Okita may have used this for his TB as well. The translator <br/>
calls it "Empty trouble powdered medicine" and "Empty labor powdered <br/>
medicine".<br/>
<br/>
Tamejirou was the one who inspired Toshizou to write haiku?<br/>
<br/>
WHO jumped into a flooded river with their kimono wrapped around the <br/>
head so they could go home? :D (www.tamahito.com)<br/>
<br/>
There is a passage on www.toshizo.com that I am not sure I'm reading <br/>
correctly. It is saying something about him going off into a corner <br/>
alone to drink when everyone else was celebrating? Was this one <br/>
particular incident or was this common behavior for him?<br/>
<br/>
Toshizou was thought to have been fond of plum blossoms? The passage <br/>
from www.toshizo.com says something about his haiku and that one is <br/>
carved on the tsuba of his sword is the reason people think this?<br/>
<br/>
I noted that it appears Kiroku died in 1860? So then was the "older <br/>
brother" that took care of the dojo while they were in Kyoto Daisaku? <br/>
Or did someone else do this? And what is it trying to say about him <br/>
being the one to make the Shinsengumi's offical sign?<br/>
<br/>
Another passage from www.toshizo.com that I'm not sure about... What <br/>
is it saying about Toshizou's temper? Something about when he was <br/>
angry (which was rare) he was "stormier" than Kondou and could not as <br/>
easily be calmed down again? But he was usually fairly level-headed <br/>
otherwise? Is this a correct interpretation?<br/>
<br/>
What is it trying to say about him "taking plain food" in Hakodate?<br/>
<br/>
Mizosoba (Gyukaku-sou) has some sort of stickers or thorns? <br/>
<br/>
There is one passage that says something about Toshizou wearing a <br/>
hakama of "Sendaihira silk"? What is the big deal with this <br/>
specifically?<br/>
<br/>
What is a "sogami hairdo"? I have no idea what the translator is <br/>
trying to say there...<br/>
<br/>
What about the haiku listed in the PMK Vol 2 graphic novel? Are those <br/>
really his work or something that was made up for the manga? And the <br/>
rules they list? I've heard of two of them, but not those others. You <br/>
could be made to commit seppuku for talking about "ghosts and other <br/>
strange creatures"?! *Starts hiding all her books on the <br/>
supernatural.* Thinking back to his reaction on hearing people <br/>
thought Serizawa's ghost was returning, Toshizou must have -REALLY- <br/>
hated ghost stories! LOL<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The "trademark" of Ishida Sanyaku, called "maru ni yama" by crest term. <br/>
Can be translated as "Mountain on the circle"(Seeing the form of the <br/>
crest the mountain is not "in" but "on" the circle).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > What is the proper name of the medicine made by the Sato family? It<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Japanese name of that medicine called, "Kyorou-san" .<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > Toshizou was thought to have been fond of plum blossoms? The passage<br/>
 > from www.toshizo.com says something about his haiku and that one is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Toshizo composed many haiku about plum blossoms and he carved plum <br/>
flowers on the tsuba too, therefore we can guess the plum flower might <br/>
be his favorite flower.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > There is one passage that says something about Toshizou wearing a<br/>
 > hakama of "Sendaihira silk"? What is the big deal with this<br/>
 > specifically?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sendai hira silk is the name of fine silk fabric with stripes on it.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crane-ny.co.jp/syouken/tenmansendaihira/temnamsendaihira.htm">http://www.crane-ny.co.jp/syouken/tenmansendaihira/temnamsendaihira.htm</a><br/>
It's used for the formal occasion today and you can see it frequently in <br/>
the different Jidai-geki costume films.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shop-japan.co.jp/shop/shinsengumi-s.htm">http://www.shop-japan.co.jp/shop/shinsengumi-s.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > What about the haiku listed in the PMK Vol 2 graphic novel? Are those<br/>
 > really his work or something that was made up for the manga?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those are all authentic Hijikata made haiku.<br/>
<br/>
And the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > rules they list? I've heard of two of them, but not those others. You<br/>
 > could be made to commit seppuku for talking about "ghosts and other<br/>
 > strange creatures"?! *Starts hiding all her books on the<br/>

 > thought Serizawa's ghost was returning, Toshizou must have -REALLY-<br/>
 > hated ghost stories! LOL<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That rule is mentioned as annex to an item of "Gunchu Hatto"(rule under <br/>
the wartime) which said "You shouldn't do any comment about the force of <br/>
either our side or enemy side."(sorry for this is very badly translated <br/>
by me)<br/>
Unlike Kyokuchu Hatto which is supposed to be the invention of Kan <br/>
Shimozawa, this Gunchu Hatto is the real rule applied after Ikedaya, and <br/>
just before the Kinmon incident.<br/>
The reason of special mention about supernatural thing is unknown as far <br/>
as I know. ( The author of the manga "Burai" which is a kind of X-file <br/>
of Shinsengumi at the beginning, has an interesting reflection about <br/>
this, saying if they mentioned especially about that, because <br/>
"something" mysterious has happened...lol)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll look for the answer about other questions and if you would give the <br/>
url of exact pages which mentions about the Toshizo's temper etc, that <br/>
would help me more.<br/>

Tama<br/>
Thank you Tama! That's much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
I cannot seem to get an individual page url for the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tamahito.com/">http://www.tamahito.com/</a> <br/>
site for some reason. It's the last link on the bottom of the first page about <br/>
Hijikata that takes you to the page I was trying to decipher. The passage <br/>
about Tamejirou inspiring him to write haiku is right under the picture of the <br/>
bamboo plant. It's the same passage that talks about someone jumping into the <br/>
river.<br/>
<br/>
Below that is the one that mentions Daisaku and seems to be saying something <br/>
about him making the Shinsengumi sign. I cannot find where I saw that one of <br/>
the brothers looked after the dojo now though. Must be a long-lost website.<br/>
<br/>
The passage about Hijikata taking "plain food" at Hakodate is at the bottom <br/>
of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toshizo.com/name/toshizo.html">http://www.toshizo.com/name/toshizo.html</a> page.<br/>
<br/>
The passage that says something about him going off alone in a corner to <br/>
drink is on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toshizo.com/name/tohito.html">http://www.toshizo.com/name/tohito.html</a>  It appears to be the <br/>
testimony of a journalist of some sort? It's one of the longer notes.<br/>
<br/>
I was wrong about where I saw the note about his temper. It's on this page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.h3.dion.ne.jp/~ash-gate/fukuchyo-2.htm">http://www.h3.dion.ne.jp/~ash-gate/fukuchyo-2.htm</a>  I think it's some official <br/>
(possibly named Kato?) who was the one who made the comment.<br/>
<br/>
And the mention of the "sogami hairdo" (I am still not sure if the translator <br/>
worded that properly) is on <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatu-fubou.htm">http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatu-fubou.htm</a>  It's in the section on Hijikata and says something about him following <br/>
Kondou or something and what they were wearing I think? Cannot really make heads <br/>
or tails what that one is trying to say...<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to one of the pages on mizosoba I was looking at: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/kumagaisan/flowers/mizosoba.html">http://www.ne.jp/asahi/kumagaisan/flowers/mizosoba.html</a>  <br/>
<br/>
It mentions the "splinter", but it has something else interesting too. It <br/>
says something at the end about the fruit of the plant? Are there two different <br/>
plants called "mizosoba"?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for the help Tama!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944166026">Thanks for the url addresses.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it's said that Tamejiro was a kind of dilettante who liked making <br/>
Haiku and Tanka very much and no doubt Toshizo's haiku hobby is the <br/>
influence of the older brother.<br/>
<br/>
And one day on the way home from the brothel at Fuchu of Musashi, the <br/>
river Tama rose and Tamejiro should have stopped there.<br/>
But suddenly he took of his clothes to wrap them around his head, and <br/>
dove into the water. Then he swam using an overhand stroke and went back <br/>
to the riverbank of Ishida village like that.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Daisaku who is adopted by Kasuya family, likes making poetry and excels <br/>
for the calligraphy. The great sign of the Shinsengumi HQ at Mibu might <br/>
be written by him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > The passage about Hijikata taking "plain food" at Hakodate is at the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At Hakodate, Toshizo contented to take plain food and kept the women <br/>
away from him. (the link of the same line which gives the reflection <br/>
about the homosexuality and the practice of adoption is interesting too...)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > The passage that says something about him going off alone in a corner to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This one is the testimony of Genichiro Kikuchi who has known the people <br/>
of Shieikan and who become a journalist in Meiji era.<br/>
But the part about Hijikata's attitude when the other are drinking is <br/>
the comment added by the web mistress it seems.( so the source is not <br/>
mentioned) and it's said that Toshizo often drinks alone leaning against <br/>
a pillar and only looks with smirk the other fellows making noises.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > I was wrong about where I saw the note about his temper. It's on this<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one is Hiroyuki Kato's testimony ( he was the professor of the <br/>
western study school of Bakufu) about Hijikata.<br/>
He said, Hijikata was a very calm man who keeps cool in the face of <br/>
trouble but once he got angry he went wilder than Kondo.<br/>
For Bakufu, Kondo was easier to deal with and Hijikata was difficult.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The link doesn't work but I think I figure out what they talk about.<br/>
"sogami hairdo" means (In correct Japanese) "Souhatsu" hairstyle.<br/>
We may wonder watching costume film of Bakumatsu, why some men<br/>
have shoved head and the other are not.( without Sakayaki, shoved <br/>
hairstyle)<br/>
Such a long hairstyle without shoving the front is called "souhatsu".<br/>
The photo of Kondo and many other have this hairstyle because souhatsu <br/>
has become "a la mode" in Bakumatsu period. That was a sort of <br/>
performance symbolizing they are so concerned by the future of Japan <br/>
that they haven't even the time to shove their head.<br/>
( can be compared little bit those hippie of 70's having long hair as <br/>
the symbol of defiance)<br/>
<br/>

 ><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it's said Mizosoba has some sharp splinters at the stem.<br/>
The common name of mizosoba is come from mizo( gutter) and soba( <br/>
buckwheat). Because its fruit and leaf look like buckwheat and in the <br/>
time of famine, people cultivated this plant to make sobagaki( a kind of <br/>
gnocchi made by buckwheat) with the fruits.<br/>
<br/>
I hope those answers make sense.<br/>

the heck did the translator say that?!)<br/>

ni marujirushi". I wonder if this is a formal term<br/>
like "maru ni yama".<br/>
