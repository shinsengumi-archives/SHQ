<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488237314">After a long absense due to (ongoing) internet problems, I am sorry <br/>
to say that I do not have much new information (regarding actual <br/>
historical facts). Some of you may already know this, but . . . <br/>
<br/>
There is a manga series published by Shonen Jump called Gintama; it <br/>
is an extremely strange mix of aliens and the bakufu. O.o The <br/>
Shinsengumi do have a part, but some have slightly different names (I <br/>
know for a fact that Okita Souji has become Okita Sogo). They first <br/>
appear in chapter 5 (Hijikata, Okita, and a mention of Yamazaki). <br/>
More of an appearance in chapter 6 (Okita, Hijikata, and a few random <br/>
members). Beyond that, I have no clue. ^^; From what I can tell, <br/>
there are even some wackified Ishin Shishi. <br/>
Scanlations are at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://stoptazmo.com/gintama">http://stoptazmo.com/gintama</a><br/>
There is also an online read of chapter one only at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.readmanga.com">http://www.readmanga.com</a><br/>
<br/>
In either volume 5 or 6 of Negima (another manga), there is a mention <br/>
of the Shinsengumi, plus one of the characters dresses in a variation <br/>
of their uniform. The translation notes in the back made a mistake <br/>
though; they seem to have mixed the Shinsengumi up with the Ishin <br/>
Shishi.<br/>
<br/>
For those who rather &quot;decode&quot; kanji bit-by-bit rather than try to <br/>
understand an online translator, there is a site that translates one <br/>
(or sometimes a few) kanji at a time, also giving multiple meanings. <br/>
I don&#39;t have the link for the translating page, but it should be easy <br/>
to find. A warning though; sometimes the translator interpretes it <br/>
differently that you&#39;d expect (&quot;Tennen Rishin Ryuu/Style&quot; <br/>
becomes &quot;Nature Riku Style&quot;). But, given the names of certain people, <br/>
it will also spit out their birth and death dates. =3<br/>

<br/>
And finally, for those who have an interest in older history, there <br/>
is a book called Taiko, mainly about Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It shows the <br/>
relationships between lord and retainer, between lords of different <br/>
provinces, etc; basically the feel of the time period. In relation to <br/>
the Shinsengumi (sort-of . . . ), the book details the downfalls of <br/>
the Imagawa and the Takeda clans, both of which the Inoue family <br/>
served at that time.<br/>
