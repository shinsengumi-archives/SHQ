hit &quot;messages&quot; and search with &quot;Dai-Bosatsu&quot; written by NAKAZATO<br/>
KAIZAN or &quot;Sword of Doom&quot; the film adaptation<br/>
<br/>
to download the ENTIRE translation of the novel come to the list, hit<br/>
&quot;files&quot; and look for the folder (please make sure that you haven&#39;t<br/>
already downloaded the novel earlier this year---for some reason<br/>
geocities is giving people 2,500 MB so I will permanently host these<br/>
files)<br/>
<br/>
I did make some inquiries...currently no one owns the copyright of the<br/>
English translation but I&#39;m sure the original work in Japanese belongs<br/>
to someone.  I would love to buy the copyright and have this work<br/>
reprinted....<br/>
<br/>
so the crazy people at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hajimenokizu">http://www.hajimenokizu</a> decided to open up the<br/>
BRS Bakumatsu Renka universe [BRS]...<br/>
<br/>
I hope that after visiting the only shrine to the novel in existence<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/DBT.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/DBT.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
that DBT&#39;s dark world may inspire someone out there...what a shame! <br/>
Saitou Hajime did not meet Tsukue Ryunosuke.......<br/>
<br/>
I omitted TONS of stuff to focus on the Shinsengumi.<br/>
The Tsukue Ryunosuke as seen in SWORD OF DOOM is but an interpretation<br/>
of an extremely complex and very -sane- character however Okamoto<br/>
Kihachi&#39;s film adaptation does a great job...<br/>
<br/>
[If anyone here needs to study a LITERARY CHARACTER then you gotta<br/>
study Ryunosuke---he&#39;s very INTERESTING]<br/>
<br/>
---this novel is incredibly important in the world of modern Japanese<br/>
literature, it was like the GONE WITH THE WIND of its era, the<br/>
numerous commercial spin offs attest to its fame making it like HARRY<br/>
POTTER in terms of $$$...it&#39;s a classic<br/>
<br/>
---it was the first time the Shinsengumi entered &quot;formal&quot; popular<br/>
literature, they already appeared in various media in the Meiji<br/>
era---none of which was taken seriously<br/>
<br/>
---this translation marks the first move from East to West for the<br/>
Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
---yes it predates by several decades Shiba Ryotaro&#39;s masterpiece<br/>
Moeyoken---and yeah Shiba Ryotaro [probably] read this work<br/>
<br/>
---it hit the presses when Nagakura Shinpachi and SAitou Hajime were<br/>
both alive (it &#39;began&#39; in 1909 the exact date of publication was not<br/>
mentioned)<br/>
<br/>
---it features Kondo, Hijikata, Okita, Yamazaki and Inoue Genazaburo<br/>
<br/>
---the novel is in fact very FAST with TONS of action---the fight<br/>
scene descriptions are lyrical (Nakazato Kaizan himself practiced the<br/>
then new art AIKIDO---I think this is all from my memory)<br/>
<br/>
[a scene from the Fujita household]<br/>
Senior Citizen Fujita Goro takes the politics and government section<br/>
of the newspaper and reads...<br/>
<br/>
Tokio grabs the entertainment section and calls to her daughter-in-law<br/>
&quot;pssst Midori, look the dashing Hyoma goes to Kioto, oh dear he<br/>
associates himself with those rough Shinsengumi&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Midori, gasps, &quot;oh no he gets dragged to the red-light district! He&#39;s<br/>
going to be corrupted!&quot;  ::giggles like a fangirl::<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro ::mumbles:: &quot;Tokio, are you reading that rubbish again?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[In Ezo/Hokkaido] <br/>
Sugimura Yoshitaro reads...&quot;Hmph!  This Nakazato Kaizan fellow didn&#39;t<br/>
even care to mention the great NAGAKURA&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sugimura proceeds to start his memoirs which will be published in 1913<br/>
in the Hotaru Shinbun<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
Lastly, something to ponder.<br/>
I would need to double check on this [so please do not take this as<br/>
fact yet]...but Nakazato Kaizan was part of an entire group of young<br/>
writers mentored by Natsume Soseki (there was a list of names).<br/>
<br/>
Natsume&#39;s influence over his students, who often just stopped by his<br/>
house for advice and conversation, was great (they even used some of<br/>
his symbolism in their own work).  Natsume did read many of his<br/>
student&#39;s work, he was after all once a professor of English Lit<br/>
(succeeded LAFCADIO HEARN) at Tokyo Univ.<br/>
<br/>
Natsume was at least an acquaintance of Fujita Goro, AND some of the<br/>
Fujita family&#39;s Aizu friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Natsume DOES use Aizu folks as characters in his novels and one<br/>
unnamed friend of his (appears as a recurring character on more than<br/>
one work) and shares his physical illness of gastric ulcers does have<br/>
a physical description matching the 2nd photo of Fujita Goro (released<br/>
late 2004-5). I&#39;m just being...silly now...<br/>
<br/>
Natsume&#39;s father (birth father or adopted father not clear) was a<br/>
friend of Nagakura.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm maybe...<br/>
<br/>
Nakazato &quot;Natsume-sensei I&#39;m bored, I want to write about SAMURAI!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Natsume &quot;have you ever heard of the Shinsengumi?....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nakazato &quot;I want to also put a hitokiri in the story too!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Natsume &quot;go ahead, I&#39;m sure one day someone will also write about a<br/>
hitokiri too---but your story will the first to examine the psyche of<br/>
a manslayer&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382376358">I received a very interesting reply...<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://p214.ezboard.com/ftheninjadojo89233frm5.showMessage?topicID=86.topic">http://p214.ezboard.com/ftheninjadojo89233frm5.showMessage?topicID=86.topic</a><br/>
there is a rule at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ninjadojo.com">http://www.ninjadojo.com</a> stating that copying<br/>
and posting comments elsewhere is not allowed so I just wanted to<br/>
direct you all to this 2 message thread<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately the poster didn&#39;t note where he read this detail (T_T)<br/>
<br/>
another explanation is that the character Tsukue Ryunosuke was<br/>
blinded, seeks the aid of a missionary and goes to China (this follows<br/>
the novel) and incidentally was recounted by a very distant descendent<br/>
of the historical figure<br/>
<br/>
also another detail has emerged that Saito Hajime was a comrade with a<br/>
famous Yagyu swordsman TOSHIHISA.  Again, no textual confirmation (T_T)<br/>
