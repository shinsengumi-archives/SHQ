<h3>Watch Japan&#39;s Politics Now</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693540015">I&#39;ve been busy with Thai politics but when I hopped back to read the<br/>
headlines in English here we have Taro Aso moving in for the kill to<br/>
grab the PM seat.<br/>
<br/>
Sure we care about 19th century politics in Japan but Taro Aso comes<br/>
from Okubo Toshimichi&#39;s bloodline.  Many major Choshu and Satsuma<br/>
families survived in the elite political groups *after* WW2.  It&#39;s<br/>
very interesting how everything worked out due to careful reinvention<br/>
and &quot;relabelling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Never ever read Japanese history of any era and take labels like<br/>
&quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; at face value.  Those terms have to be<br/>
comprehended within the context of the specific era and studied carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan has a history of conservatism!   <br/>
<br/>
One wonders if Asian politicians pick certain labels or keywords which<br/>
translate well into English to fool outsiders.  You can find many<br/>
examples in Meiji politics.  LDP was founded post occupation era but<br/>
you can see how good it sounds if the terms are used to keep the<br/>
American media happy. LDP&#39;s job was to smash the socialists just as<br/>
the fascistic pre-war gov. oppressed (often using deadly force) the<br/>
socialists.<br/>
<br/>
Erroneous labels applied to the kangun leaders who monopolized Meiji<br/>
Era politics have prevented students and enthusiasts from<br/>
understanding the complexity of 1868.  People say &quot;OMG so and so<br/>
claimed to want democracy in the Meiji Era---well by golly they<br/>
must&#39;ve been fighting for that in 1868&quot;.  And it&#39;s false.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s written in the media and ENGLISH, whether it be on the net or<br/>
in dusty history books can be very misleading.<br/>
<br/>
Okay done with being off-topic nowz.</div>
