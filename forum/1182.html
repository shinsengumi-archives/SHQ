Of course, I can't resist seeing just who this guy was and when I get to the page, the first name that pops out at me is Saitou Makoto.  It had to do with the selection of a new prime minister after the assassination of PM Inukai in 1932... not many people seemed to trust Suzuki Kisaburou and opted instead for Saito (who was an admiral and once governor general of Korea, very old, no relation to our Saitou that I know of, and was eventually driven out of office under charges of corruption).  History is so bizarre at times.  :-D<br/>
