<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329449975">This is for those who live too many miles from Toronto to make the trip for this screening, but still might be interested in seeing this movie. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it can be rented somewhere, but for less than twice the price of the Toronto ticket, you can buy &quot;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&quot;. (My apology, if it is not appropriate to post the location of an item that is for sale on a website...I have no connection to this website whatsoever, by the way, except to order the movie for myself, since I am a 5+ hour flight away from Toronto.)<br/>
