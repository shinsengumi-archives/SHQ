<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329449975">This is for those who live too many miles from Toronto to make the trip for this screening, but still might be interested in seeing this movie. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it can be rented somewhere, but for less than twice the price of the Toronto ticket, you can buy "Shinsengumi Shimatsuki". (My apology, if it is not appropriate to post the location of an item that is for sale on a website...I have no connection to this website whatsoever, by the way, except to order the movie for myself, since I am a 5+ hour flight away from Toronto.)<br/>
