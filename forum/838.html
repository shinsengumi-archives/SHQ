<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706539078">About Hagakure(&quot;The Book of the Samurai&quot;)-- read it with caution. Sure, it <br/>
has some great comments on bushido and what not, but it was written by a man <br/>
who had fallen on hard times, had become a Buddhist monk, and was basically <br/>
a bitter old man sitting in seclusion ranting about how the youngsters <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248534510">Also, if you&#39;re like me and penniless, this same translation of &quot;The Hagakure&quot; is available free as a pdf document at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/port/www/pdf/Hagakure.pdf">http://web.mit.edu/port/www/pdf/Hagakure.pdf</a>  .  I also have it downloaded onto my hard drive and might be able to send it (not sure how large a file it is) if anyone wants it and can&#39;t get it downloaded.  (I could probably turn it into a zip file maybe?)<br/>
 <br/>
