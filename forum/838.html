<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706539078">About Hagakure("The Book of the Samurai")-- read it with caution. Sure, it <br/>
has some great comments on bushido and what not, but it was written by a man <br/>
who had fallen on hard times, had become a Buddhist monk, and was basically <br/>
a bitter old man sitting in seclusion ranting about how the youngsters <br/>
didn't know nothin' from nothin'. Or, as my uncle puts it, this guy was <br/>
saying something to the effect of: "Kid, when I was your age, we knew the <br/>
_code_. We killed ourselves, and we enjoyed it, too!"<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248534510">Also, if you're like me and penniless, this same translation of "The Hagakure" is available free as a pdf document at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/port/www/pdf/Hagakure.pdf">http://web.mit.edu/port/www/pdf/Hagakure.pdf</a>  .  I also have it downloaded onto my hard drive and might be able to send it (not sure how large a file it is) if anyone wants it and can't get it downloaded.  (I could probably turn it into a zip file maybe?)<br/>
 <br/>
Interesting, but not the easiest reading to do... I found it very disjointed in presentation of ideas.<br/>
