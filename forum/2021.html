<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074845727">Was just looking through "An Illustrated Guide to Shinsengumi," by Nakami <br/>
Toshio. Turns out that Mitsu's husband (Inoue) Rintarou, -was- indeed <br/>
related to Inoue Genzaburou (not sure how, though). Also, Okita and Mitsu's <br/>
father, Katsujirou, was a foot soldier captain (ashigaru kogashira) <br/>
stationed at the lower mansion (shimo-yashiki) of the Shirakawa clan, in <br/>
Edo. Souji was also born in Edo.<br/>

Thanks! (bounces) Must tell my friend... she's really into Souji and this has been one of her pet peeves. She says there's a village named Shirokawa near Edo, and another in Aizu... but if it's the Shirokawa *clan* involved, we've been barking up the wrong tree altogether.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934220535">hello "nlf7",<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed all of your posts very much and we appreciate the time you<br/>
took in giving us info on the mysterious Okita.  I would like to add<br/>
your information to the Okita webpage (with your permission)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
If you notice on that page (and other pages) we name the sites we used<br/>
as sources and we mention the name of the contributor.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you recall from which book you got all this information?  If you<br/>
can give atleast the author and title that would be great so we can<br/>
add that to the page as well---and I try to add a link to the book so<br/>
people can buy it.<br/>
<br/>
The pursuit of history is filled with contradictory facts: that's the<br/>
name of the game.  <br/>
To deal with discrepencies, it is necessary to put everything side by<br/>
side and so we've endeavoured to do that.  I think all of us would<br/>
appreciate your advice and knowledge in improving the website and<br/>
adding more to this mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
You may remember from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kondo_Isami">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kondo_Isami</a><br/>
where I cite Romulus Hillsborough.  Generally, I don't like to use his<br/>
work but it is unavoidable because he is unfortunately the *first*<br/>
westerner to publish a text which focuses on the Shinsengumi.  You<br/>
will notice I mentioned the book and page number (the original source<br/>
for Tani Tateki's words are Teihon: Shinsengumi Shiroku).  <br/>
<br/>
So if there is an incorrect detail anywhere it is necessary to just<br/>
say "this book says different" and so forth so all of us fans will<br/>
understand where the information came from.  None of were actually<br/>
there so we have to rely on texts. <br/>
<br/>
Generally, in the world of academic publishing it is also very<br/>
necessary to cite, detail by detail where information was originally<br/>
found---although <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> is only a fansite we<br/>
still want it to follow that standard whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
If you have anymore correction please post here because many people<br/>
are grateful for your help. Most of us aren't fluent in Japanese<br/>
(^__^) you will note how on pages like the <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378192209">I didn't get all that information from a single book, I currently have about 20 books and <br/>
dozens of websites on the Shinsengumi. (Most of the sources are in Japanese. I don't read <br/>
Japanese that well so I've been reading them rather slowly since 2003.) Anyways, almost all <br/>
of the ones on Okita contain the information I've given you.<br/>
<br/>
I've been editing all the Shinsengumi articles from Wikipedia.  (My user name is "nlf7" and <br/>
my nickname is "Seven".) You could just mention Wikipedia as the source or/and the <br/>
contributor. ( I've written about 2/3 of the current Okita article and have also left several <br/>
notes on the Okita discussion page. )<br/>
<br/>
Yes,  I've also bought "Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps" by Hillsborough, <br/>
but I haven't had the chance to finish reading it.<br/>
