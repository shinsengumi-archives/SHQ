view thing differently.<br/>
<br/>
I added a few comments to the run down of Shinsengumi Keppuroku that <br/>
Secretarytocapt3 wrote and  Okita contributed his thoughts to what he's <br/>
seen of the new NHK drama.  Have anything to add to my ramblings on PMK <br/>
or RK or the kenshin OVAs? C'mon and toss 'em my way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If (IF) I get some free time sometime in August<br/>
(hopefully), I can try making some summaries of some<br/>
Shinsengumi movies I have:<br/>
<br/>
- Shinsengumi Onitaicho ("The Demon Captain of the<br/>
Shinsengumi"), 1854, 119 min, featuring Kataoka<br/>
Chiezo, Nakamura Kinnosuke, Tsukigata Ryunosuke and<br/>
others. I guess if someone asks momoirousagi about<br/>
those actors, most probably she'll know all of them :D<br/>
<br/>
- Shinsengumi Shimatsuki ("The Record of the Beginning<br/>
and the End of the Shinsengumi"), 1963, 94min,<br/>
featuring Ichikawa Raizo as Yamazaki Susumu<br/>
<br/>
- Shinsengumi, 1970, featuring Mifune Toshiro,<br/>
Nakamura Kinnosuke, Kitaoji Kin-ya, Mikuni Rentaro and<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
- Shinsengumi TV Asahi soap opera(2 parts), 1987,<br/>
featuring Matsukata Hiroki as Kondo Isami and<br/>
Shonentai's Higashiyama Noriyuki as Okita Soji.<br/>
<br/>
- Bakumatsu Junjo-den - Okita Soji wa B-Cup ("Tales of<br/>
Romantic Adventures in the End of Shogunate - Okita<br/>
Soji was a B-cup") :D This is a HILARIOUS movie, where<br/>
Okita Soji is a girl (a rather beautiful B-cupped one<br/>
:D), who Sakamoto Ryoma tries to get :D<br/>
<br/>
I have two more movies on the Shinsengumi, but they<br/>
are in my (now deceased) master's house, and I have to<br/>
find time to go there and retrieve them.<br/>
<br/>
But before that, I still owe Tiffany that info on the<br/>
Tenma-ya Inn affair... :(<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That seems to be true, unfortunately. Except on few<br/>
channels (like Toei TV Channel, which has a section<br/>
exclusively on chambara movies), it's hard to see a<br/>
chambara movie. And somehow it's hard to find them<br/>
videos available. I remember that I had some hard time<br/>
till I found that Mifune Toshiro's movie on the<br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, no, no, sorry for the confusion >_< My master has<br/>
passed a few years ago (three, to be more accurate),<br/>
it's nothing recent. I do apologise again for<br/>
expressing myself in a poor fashion m(..)m<br/>

 </span></blockquote> lol. Your right. He meant "1954". It is the same one<br/>
as "The Intrepid Captain of The Shinsengumi" found on<br/>
this page:<br/>
