<br/>
The lecture meeting about Keisuke Otori held in Kasuga (there are <br/>
Shinpachi Nagakura & Saito's 1 remains of a dwelling, and it is a <br/>
fortunate town smile) has been audited today. A lecturer is Mr. Tatsu <br/>
Fukumoto who is the posterity of Mr. Otori's brother. Precious data, <br/>
such as Mr. Otori's letter (actual thing), are brought, and I was <br/>
allowed to see them close at hand. About Mr. Otori, only vague career <br/>
(bony portion) which has appeared in the person file was known until <br/>
now. I carry out [ mind as meat was attached luckily this time ]. <br/>
Although it was mainly the contents after Meiji, it is a too <br/>
attractive person. It is devoted to one thing and respects in "person <br/>
who excelled in learning" って HONTO. Lecturer reason "Otori is a <br/>
scientist and is not a military man's type" -- I also felt so. <br/>
In addition, height is as short in stature as 150cm. However, DEKA ³ <br/>
of the part courage is that it was considerable. It was a lecture <br/>
meeting very significant and precious when considering the thing of è<br/>
'C war, the thing in Goryoukaku, etc.</div>
