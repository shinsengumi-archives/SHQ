<h3>Sort of &quot;new&quot; info on Fujita Goro</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-424284389">Well, new to those of us who don't know Japanese (^_^)<br/>
***all the info will end up on Saitou's profile at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> (eventually)<br/>
<br/>
In the Files section are translated webpages on Saitou Hajime and so <br/>
forth, from those pages we know that Goro was a bodyguard for the <br/>
Meiji Emperor's mother...<br/>
<br/>
but <br/>
he was also a bodyguard to <<<Inoue Kaoru>>><br/>

***the Inoue Kaoru connection was once mentioned on this mailing <br/>
list a really long time ago I think---but my translator said this <br/>
not a rumor at all<br/>
<br/>
We have all committed to memory, Goro's love of washing his fundoshi <br/>
but he also said....<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro "Tie your sash tightly: don't leave it loose and untidy!"<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Makoto, Goro's grandson heard that:<br/>
"My grandfather was the favorite retainer of Matsudaira Katamori"<br/>
which is not surprising at all<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
I have 2 translations of the same page...<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/naitouhougyoku/sub14.htm">http://homepage3.nifty.com/naitouhougyoku/sub14.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
most of it translated by our SHQ member Hirotada Tokugawa (please <br/>
send warm cuddly thoughts to him)...<br/>
<br/>
The Yamakawa Shogun residence (???) was in Tokyo Ushigome-Wakamatsu <br/>
cho, 3rd lot. It had a stable.When Fujita had days off, he would go <br/>
to the Yamakawa residence and drink sake, and his spirit would burn<br/>
Many many people visited all year round, attested to by Ookura <br/>
(Yamakawa Hiroshi) being a person of virtue as well as a "Center of <br/>
(gathering for) Aizu People. So the many comings and goings were a <br/>
matter of course.<br/>
Among those who visited can be seen the name of Fujita Goro.<br/>
Fujita Goro. Of course, it goes without saying that this is <br/>
Shinsengumi 3rd captain, Saitou Hajime.<br/>
The time of his frequent visits then must be around the time that <br/>
Ookura had long since retired from the Police Office and had become <br/>
headmaster of the "Normal School" (I think "Normal School," Shihan-<br/>
gakko, should actually be translated "Military Academy")<br/>
The man who, as Yamaguchi Jiro, left his fame and renown in many <br/>
places in the course of the Boshin War's Aizu front.<br/>
Fujita, after Hijikata Toshizo left Aizu, commanded the remaining <br/>
Shinsengumi men, sharing in Aizu's fate, following the people to <br/>
Tonami, and then fighting in the Seinan War, always remaining by the <br/>
side of Aizu people.Looking at it from Fujita's perspective, his <br/>
visits to the Yamakawa residence must have been very calming.<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro "When you draw your sword with the intent to kill, don't <br/>
waste your time posturing like in kenjutsu. Just kill your enemy on <br/>
the spot."<br/>
<br/>
(from another volunteer translator: "When you actually fight <br/>
somebody with a real sword, never mind about taking a correct <br/>
posture as you would in your fencing trainings; you just have to go <br/>
forward holding your sword up high. Then the next moment you'd find <br/>
your oppenent collapsed on the ground.")<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro "I want my bones to be buried next to the [mass?] grave <br/>
of the men who died at Amida-ji in the Aizu Boshin War"<br/>
<br/>
Today, Fujita Goro's soul, as was his wish, rests alongside those of <br/>
his war comrades in Amida-ji, sharing in their eternal rest<br/>

***Yamakawa Hiroshi was one of the matchmakers for Goro+Tokio, and a <br/>
major figure in the post 1868 Aizu story<br/>

***the Normal School was a teacher training academy in Tokyo for men<br/>
the history of the Normal School is totally connected to Tokyo <br/>
Women's Normal School (Takagi/Fujita Tokio's workplace and her <br/>
cousin Takamine Hideo)<br/>

in his amazing book JAPAN DAY BY DAY (contains info on Takamine <br/>
Hideo all over the place)--book has no index<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
In the past I have mentioned that Fujita Goro was a friend of <br/>
Natsume Soseki (just google this name) my volunteer translator did <br/>
some double checking independently and found that this eccentric <br/>
novelist had not one but 2 connections to the Shinsengumi. I have <br/>
recently searched for webpages and found quiet a few repeating this <br/>
connection---nifty mistranslated some things.  Below is a *human* <br/>
translation.<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura Shinpachi was a friend of Natsume Soseki's [father]<br/>
[warning] Natsume Soseki was adopted out to a family and then later <br/>
adopted back into his natural birth parents...it is not clear <br/>
*which* father<br/>
<br/>
Natsume Soseki and Fujita Goro were co-workers (they worked in the <br/>
same office)<br/>
<br/>
[note: Soseki wasn't alive during the Bakumatsu however he did write <br/>
2 weird short stories on that era. <br/>
Anyone who reads Soseki's works will notice that he has an older <br/>
friend, who like himself was neurotic and had gastric ulcers this <br/>
friend is an elderly man with a white moustache (who eats relish a <br/>
food recommended to people who have ulcers).  This older friend is a <br/>
recurring character in more than one work. Soseki ofcourse changes <br/>
the names of his real friends who frequently appear in his fiction--<br/>
in this case the mystery character is anonymous and often stops by <br/>
for dinner.  Both men starve themselves for days and then share big <br/>
meals.  In another work this same character appears in a dream <br/>
sequence.  Interestingly in I AM A CAT Soseki writes long passages <br/>
about dastardly under cover police, how they are uneducated, rude <br/>
and plant evidence on people.  He lists their possible disguises as <br/>
well! Soseki, understandably was paranoid as he was blacklisted for <br/>
his liberal leanings and anti-Russo-Japanese War stance.]<br/>

[Off-Topic but of possible interest]<br/>
<br/>
someone brought up the 47 Ronin a while back...<br/>
<br/>
The MANY paintings and reproductions you see of the 47 Ronin (many <br/>
versions of the famous scenes) were amassed in a huge collection by <br/>
a guy named Ernest F.Fenollossa (1853-1908) (google name)---most of <br/>
his stuff ended up in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts or were <br/>
gradually sold to private collectors once he returned to the United <br/>
States.  Although he later severed his connection to the museum his <br/>
legacy still remains.  While in Japan, his <br/>
assistant/translator/travelling companion was Takamine Hideo (the <br/>
cousin of Takagi Tokio and friend to Goro).  Takamine himself <br/>
collected 3,000 ukiyo-e, calligraphy, ALOT of pottery and swords <br/>
(which Goro worked with in Takamine's store room).  Fenollossa also <br/>
cites Takamine Hideo in his writings.  Recently I went to my <br/>
university's historical society and read a pamphlet printed in 1905 <br/>
when part of Fenollossa's collection arrived in my city (the small <br/>
collection was purchased by a Japanese man).  Fenollossa himself <br/>
wrote the introduction and description of the paintings.  Of the <br/>
little over 20 pieces displayed, 5 were of the 47 Ronin.  Much of <br/>
Fenollossa's collection are now commonly mass reproduced ukiyo-e <br/>
posters you can purchase right off the internet. <br/>
