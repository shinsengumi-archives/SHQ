That's because "hou" isn't combined with "seki" in<br/>
this case.<br/>
<br/>
As it seems that there is an interest in the<br/>
Sekihoutai in this list, I did a quick search at<br/>
Google and found these that may be of interest:<br/>

Uh, any reason you can tell us as to why the author of the article called it "Sekibotai" then?  I know I'd never seen it spelled like that until this article.<br/>

Many thanks... I hadn't gotten as far as checking Japanese sites (stubbornly avoiding the evil fish and the gist of gist until I couldn't stand it any longer).  If you didn't know it before, now you do --- Sagara is an obsession of mine equal to the one I have for Saitou (and I've avoided Japanese sites with him, too).  I've always been curious as to the Shinsengumi connection with Suzuki (not politically or anything, just that a wolf found a place in the Sekihoutai) and I have reason to be particularly thankful he ended up with Sagara... Shinsengumi fans are definitely the best when it comes to tracking things down and sharing!<br/>

Can anyone tell me why this site is coming up in gibberish instead of kanji?  Because of that, babelfish can't translate it (apparently).  Anything I can do from my end to get it to load correctly?<br/>

 <br/>
Tried to put "out" the fire, right?  He was a Satsuma retainer by then and this would be the incident MissB included where the bakufu set fire to the Satsuma villa in retaliation? <br/>
 <br/>
I'm curious about a couple of things... the fish is too vague for me to figure out.  Are they saying that Sagara's body is actually buried where the monument in Shimosuwa is?  And what's this "Mitsuru"?  Kojima four must be Koshima Shirou (are "j" and "sh" used interchangeably like "o", "ou" and "oh" as in Saitou's name?) and they're saying he changed it to Sagara Souzou ("entire three"?), but I'm not understanding "military officer Mitsuru," which shows up several times in the article.<br/>
 <br/>
(babelfish): "Entire watch Kojima four �Y military officer Mitsuru (changed name Sagara entire three)"<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>Unfortunately, both links are in Japanese :-/<<<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I'd say that's unfortunate for morons like me... :-D  Still, as with the Shinsengumi and Saitou sites secretarytocapt3's been digging up, it is a little more than we had previously, even if we often end up speculating on the babelfish translation and then *begging* you and Masayoshi for a real translation.  And it does give me hope that struggling with babelfish may be worth it for Sagara.  I'm really grateful, SK.<br/>

In a nutshell, yes. Shirou would probably be his childhood name, as <br/>
it means "fourth son". Later he would've taken the name Masamitsu, <br/>
probably after reaching adulthood. And then of course he became <br/>
Sagara Souzou later.<br/>

If I'm not mistaken, "Sekihoutai" comes from "SEKIshin<br/>
ni MUKUiru TAI", the "Troop of the Most Loyal/Sincere<br/>
Devotion" (something like that), therefore the "hou"<br/>
has no direct relationship to "seki" :)<br/>

putting the blame on the Shogunate so that Satsuma<br/>
would have a good excuse to take up arms.<br/>

Dr. FangLang's Pavement gives "hou" being abbreviated from "hou koku," meaning "kuni ni mukuiru koto" ---- similiar to what you've given --- with the entire "Sekihoutai" meaning "Troop of Cordiality and Repaying" (though I prefer sincerity/devotion as the meaning behind seki shin (which the site gives as meaning "magokoro"... cordiality brings a different context to my mind).<br/>

<br/>
:-D  Very devious.  Maybe ol' Saigou did have reason to be concerned about him, after all.  Even though he's picking up some bad habits as we learn more (bad in the sense he wasn't so "pure" as Watsuki made him in RK), I'm liking him more and more as he becomes more real.  Sounds like he could've had a bit of the pirate in him.  (Yeah, yeah... I know... it was war.)  I can see aspects of Tsukioka Tsunan/Katsu in him.  This is *so* much fun!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>As Masayoshi already clarified, his previous name was<br/>

<br/>
So in other words, the surname is actually Kojima, NOT Koshima for any reason... that somewhere along the line someone has translated it wrong and it's been propagating as misinformation?  If I'm going to set up a site for this man, the least I can do is either stop reproducing the error or explain how it could be spelled either way.<br/>
Thanks for all the clarifications and the chance to engage in some discussion about him.  I feel so... alone... when it comes to Sagara and the Sekihoutai.<br/>
