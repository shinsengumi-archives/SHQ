As it seems that there is an interest in the<br/>
Sekihoutai in this list, I did a quick search at<br/>

Uh, any reason you can tell us as to why the author of the article called it &quot;Sekibotai&quot; then?  I know I&#39;d never seen it spelled like that until this article.<br/>

Many thanks... I hadn&#39;t gotten as far as checking Japanese sites (stubbornly avoiding the evil fish and the gist of gist until I couldn&#39;t stand it any longer).  If you didn&#39;t know it before, now you do --- Sagara is an obsession of mine equal to the one I have for Saitou (and I&#39;ve avoided Japanese sites with him, too).  I&#39;ve always been curious as to the Shinsengumi connection with Suzuki (not politically or anything, just that a wolf found a place in the Sekihoutai) and I have reason to be particularly thankful he ended up with Sagara... Shinsengumi fans are definitely the best when it comes to tracking things down and sharing!<br/>

Can anyone tell me why this site is coming up in gibberish instead of kanji?  Because of that, babelfish can&#39;t translate it (apparently).  Anything I can do from my end to get it to load correctly?<br/>

 <br/>
Tried to put &quot;out&quot; the fire, right?  He was a Satsuma retainer by then and this would be the incident MissB included where the bakufu set fire to the Satsuma villa in retaliation? <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m curious about a couple of things... the fish is too vague for me to figure out.  Are they saying that Sagara&#39;s body is actually buried where the monument in Shimosuwa is?  And what&#39;s this &quot;Mitsuru&quot;?  Kojima four must be Koshima Shirou (are &quot;j&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; used interchangeably like &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;oh&quot; as in Saitou&#39;s name?) and they&#39;re saying he changed it to Sagara Souzou (&quot;entire three&quot;?), but I&#39;m not understanding &quot;military officer Mitsuru,&quot; which shows up several times in the article.<br/>
 <br/>
(babelfish): &quot;Entire watch Kojima four �Y military officer Mitsuru (changed name Sagara entire three)&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Unfortunately, both links are in Japanese :-/&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;d say that&#39;s unfortunate for morons like me... :-D  Still, as with the Shinsengumi and Saitou sites secretarytocapt3&#39;s been digging up, it is a little more than we had previously, even if we often end up speculating on the babelfish translation and then *begging* you and Masayoshi for a real translation.  And it does give me hope that struggling with babelfish may be worth it for Sagara.  I&#39;m really grateful, SK.<br/>

In a nutshell, yes. Shirou would probably be his childhood name, as <br/>
it means &quot;fourth son&quot;. Later he would&#39;ve taken the name Masamitsu, <br/>
probably after reaching adulthood. And then of course he became <br/>
Sagara Souzou later.<br/>

<br/>
Dr. FangLang&#39;s Pavement gives &quot;hou&quot; being abbreviated from &quot;hou koku,&quot; meaning &quot;kuni ni mukuiru koto&quot; ---- similiar to what you&#39;ve given --- with the entire &quot;Sekihoutai&quot; meaning &quot;Troop of Cordiality and Repaying&quot; (though I prefer sincerity/devotion as the meaning behind seki shin (which the site gives as meaning &quot;magokoro&quot;... cordiality brings a different context to my mind).<br/>

<br/>
:-D  Very devious.  Maybe ol&#39; Saigou did have reason to be concerned about him, after all.  Even though he&#39;s picking up some bad habits as we learn more (bad in the sense he wasn&#39;t so &quot;pure&quot; as Watsuki made him in RK), I&#39;m liking him more and more as he becomes more real.  Sounds like he could&#39;ve had a bit of the pirate in him.  (Yeah, yeah... I know... it was war.)  I can see aspects of Tsukioka Tsunan/Katsu in him.  This is *so* much fun!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As Masayoshi already clarified, his previous name was<br/>

though).&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So in other words, the surname is actually Kojima, NOT Koshima for any reason... that somewhere along the line someone has translated it wrong and it&#39;s been propagating as misinformation?  If I&#39;m going to set up a site for this man, the least I can do is either stop reproducing the error or explain how it could be spelled either way.<br/>
Thanks for all the clarifications and the chance to engage in some discussion about him.  I feel so... alone... when it comes to Sagara and the Sekihoutai.<br/>
