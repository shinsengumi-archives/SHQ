<h3>Name Changes and Adoptions</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291577447">The sudden influx of information has left me with a lot of <br/>
questions...  I'll start with just a few.<br/>
 <br/>
<<While Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi was a member of the <br/>
Shinsengumi, Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa was the Head Coach <br/>
at the Shieikan.>>  Seven<br/>
 <br/>
I guess my first question is general - Why did people change their <br/>
names so much?  The answer to that may answer my next question - And, <br/>
more specifically, why did/would Souji change his name from Harumasa <br/>
to Kaneyoshi?  And, the change from Soujirou to Souji?    In NHK, he <br/>
tells Heisuke something like I changed my name to match the young <br/>
master.  Based on historical truth?  Or fiction?<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
I know I've asked questions on adoptions before, but... When Kondou <br/>
Shusuke adopted Okita Mitsu, was it so that she would not be Okita <br/>
Rintaro's "sister" so that they could marry?  What would Kondou <br/>
Shusuke get in return for doing this?  Was it as common to adopt <br/>
females?<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
I was a little confused by the "two Rintaro's."  Same man or two <br/>
separate people?  Okita Rintaro Fusamasa (or is it Kanemasa?) was <br/>
Mitsu's husband?  And - <br/>
<br/>
<<"one was Inoue Rintaro Mototsune, whom bought his samurai status <br/>
(from the Okita family) after Okita Katsujiro's death on (lunar <br/>
calendar) October 20, 1845...">>  Seven<br/>
<br/>
He paid the Okita family?  As sort of a replacement for Katsujirou?  <br/>
After he married Souji's mother, why did he take the name Okita?  Not <br/>
to be head of the family as Katsujirou had already adopted the man <br/>
that was to marry Mitsu?  Am I completely confused?<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
<<...but really you don't have to be a specialist you can be a fan <br/>

fans out there>>  secretary<br/>
<br/>
I've got many Okita related questions and would be happy to ask them <br/>
if Seven or anyone else is interested in what us Souji fans want to <br/>
know.  I'm more an expert in the area of things that are presented as <br/>
fact in fiction - be it film, anime, or manga.  Drop me a note if <br/>
you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep my questions to that for now.  : )<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724811839">Why did people change their names so much?  It was the samurai's custom!  Many samurai <br/>
changed their name twice, but Okita had only changed his name once.  Yes, a samurai <br/>
would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he changed his (full) <br/>
name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi.  Why?  I'm not sure...<br/>
<br/>
No, Okita didn't change his name from Soujirou to Souji  to match the young master. <br/>
There's a theory that he changed his name to Souji because some people around him <br/>
called him "Sou-Ji" (short for Soujirou.) <br/>
<br/>
We don't have the Okitas' family register from around 1845, but it's generally believed that <br/>
Kondou Shusuke adopted Mitsu so she wouldn't be Rintaro's sister.  <br/>
<br/>
Kondou Shusuke probably didn't get anything in return for doing this. It was common for a <br/>
female (like a merchant's daughter) to be adopted by someone in order to wed a man (like <br/>
the second son of a samurai family) she couldn't marry otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
There were two separate Okita Rintaro's. Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Kanwmasa was Mitsu's <br/>
husband.  <br/>
<br/>
Though this hasn't been fully confirmed, it's generally believed that Okita Rintarou <br/>
Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by being "adopted" into the Okita <br/>
family and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.)  He served as a retainer for <br/>
young Souji. <br/>
<br/>
The Okita family could have needed the additional financial support from Rintarou <br/>
Mototsune after Katsujirou's death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as the head of the Okita <br/>
family for a short time (not sure how short...) <br/>
<br/>
As I've mentioned before, I've only started buying books on Okita since May 2005. On top <br/>
of that, I'm not proficient in the Japanese language either. Nevertheless, I'd be happy to <br/>
answer all the questions I could.  :)<br/>

From Wikipedia:<br/>
"Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugoro in 1849, who <br/>
first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, Kondo Isami."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...What significance does the choice of name have?  I thought <br/>
perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn't already been given) a name <br/>
to honor someone in his family.  In Souji shortening his name from <br/>
Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou.  And <br/>
in Kondou's case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name, <br/>
but if he changing his family name, isn't he separating himself from <br/>
the Miyakawa family?  Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first?  Could <br/>
someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, if Katsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be head of the <br/>
Okita family because Souji was too young...what happened when Souji's <br/>
mother married Rintarou Mototsune?  RM displaced RK as head of the <br/>
family?  Then after RM's death RK was reinstated?  And what would <br/>
have happened if Souji had lived longer?  Would he have replaced RK?<br/>
Finally, if one could change their status through purchase or <br/>
adoption then it's all just a formality?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for being patient with my questions!<br/>

<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
Yes they can be adopted into one family and then adopted out into <br/>
another family---however this is rare and I've only come across one <br/>
example and it is not 100% confirmed.  <br/>
<br/>
Generally this will not occur if the child was adopted in to be an <br/>
heir of some sort.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------<br/>
Adoption scenarios <br/>
(not necessarily pertaining to Okita---just general info)<br/>
<br/>
1) in need of a male heir to continue the family name (example <br/>
Fujita Goro/Tokio adopting out their 3rd son to Tokio's cousin)<br/>
<br/>
2) in need of a male heir for the lineage (e.g. martial arts, flower <br/>
arrangement, dance, art/painting, even ceramics...and numerous other <br/>
arts which require hereditary line)<br/>
<br/>
3) favorite students are sometimes adopted (not necessarily to be <br/>
heirs of a line for an "art" but just adopted nonetheless)<br/>
<br/>
4) adopting son-in-law to be male heir for family/lineage (example <br/>
would be Nagakura Shinpachi in the Meiji Era)<br/>
<br/>
5) adopting out children in the case of "need" (family gives up son <br/>
because they cannot support all their children)<br/>
<br/>
6) another weird category---very informal adoption to Buddhist monks <br/>
or Shinto shrine priests (generally out of a unable to fulfill basic <br/>
needs scenario)---which does not require paperwork<br/>
---however there are cases where Buddhist monks will adopt "sons" <br/>
and paperwork is available<br/>
<br/>
7) females were also adopted (example Nakano Takeko, leader of the <br/>
Aizu Womens Brigade adopted out to another family)<br/>
<br/>
*not all adoptions were "secret" (as seen in the case of the Fujita <br/>
family and Numazawa family)<br/>
<br/>
*just because you were adopted out, often you could return to your <br/>
birth parents and maintain a completely normal relationship---some <br/>
cases you can also go back to your birth family as well---birth <br/>
parents or siblings can also continue to financially support the <br/>
child adopted out<br/>
<br/>
*basically adoption did not mean a severence necessarily of your <br/>
blood ties<br/>
<br/>
*the adoption scenarios above can be found during the Meiji Era and <br/>
even "modern" arts and sciences were "converted" to Japanese culture<br/>
example: there was this one guy who was a really awesome typesetter <br/>
(using more modern techniques) for a famous newspaper during the <br/>
Meiji Era, he wanted to teach his art and he adopted a young man </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977378365">Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and he took the name Kondou when <br/>
he became the 3rd master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu in 1830. Therefore, Kondou Isami was <br/>
first adopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name Kondou sometime after 1858.  <br/>
<br/>
Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji's birth (but that's not the <br/>
point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as the head of the Okita family for a short time <br/>
(possibly less than a year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head of the family. <br/>
Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family until Souji <br/>
got married.  Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa's son Yoshijirou would probably <br/>
have become Souji's heir (and would likely have married Souji's eldest daughter.) I suppose <br/>
that it would've been acceptable if Souji's son married Rintarou Kanamasa's daughter <br/>
instead.  However, considering that Souji's son would've been quite a few years younger <br/>
than Rintarou Kanamasa's youngest daughter, I don't think this would've been the case.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752583188">Yes, we were talking about if Okita had lived longer.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand what you're saying. Please correct me if I'm wrong. The samurai class was <br/>
abolished within years after the Shogunate government was overthrown and whether Okita <br/>
received Bakushin status in 1867 wouldn't have mattered at that point, would it?  Then, he <br/>
would've followed the "plan" to become the head of the family and name Yoshijirou as his <br/>
heir (he would't have a "reason" to start a Bunke of his own, wouldn't he? ) <br/>

<br/>
Is "he" Souji?<br/>
Souji don't have to be the head of Okita family since Rintaro took it.<br/>
Yoshijirou can be heir without doing nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I've read somewhere that Souji's mother sold Samurai status to Rintaro's<br/>
father.<br/>
(That's why Mistu was adopted to Kondo family to marry him?)<br/>
If so, Souji can't be the head of Okita family anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Or Souji might be adopted to Kondo family to become Shieikan dojo master.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Okita family is so complicated.<br/>
Some researchers even doubt that Souji was really Katsujiro's son or not.<br/>

Adoption was sooo common in those days.<br/>
My great great grandpa was adopted from other family, and one of descendant<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848671720">Many feudal institutions were abolished on paper but not in reality.<br/>
<br/>
People who were once of the samurai social class were generally <br/>
noted as shizoku...another example would be heimin which comprised <br/>
of the largest chunk of society (anything from artisans, merchants <br/>
and also farmers).  For instance, texts will say "The Seinan War may <br/>
be regarded as a shizoku rebellion".  Meaning former Satsuma samurai <br/>
(who still considered themselves to be samurai ofcourse).  The <br/>
Fujita Family were categorized as heimin.<br/>
<br/>
Even after 1868, your social roots still continued to be very <br/>
important.  Interestingly, many students at a school I studied <br/>
noted "shizoku" status even though their parents were engaged in <br/>
merchant work in the Meiji Era.  Thus, 1868 cannot really be <br/>
considered to be a cut off date for how people think about their <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100518256">Rintaro Mototsune (Rintarou Kanemasa's uncle) bought his samurai status from the Okita <br/>
family after Okita Katsujiro's death and he adopted Souji (Mori, p.10 -p.11).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I've read that the "plan" was for Souji to become the head of the Okita family from Oji's <br/>
book "Walking with Okita Soji" (Oji, p.39). Since Okita was the heir of the Okita Family, <br/>
Kondo Shuske wasn't able to (formally) adopt him even though Okita was raised by both <br/>
the Okita family and the Kondo family. Although the Kondo family could not adopt Okita, <br/>
Kondou Isami still named Okita to be the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu after him in <br/>
1865.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No worries. I got that.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Some researchers say Souji wasn't Katsujiro's son, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'm aware of that and I've read a few essays/articles/book chapters in regard of it. <br/>
Generally, everyone would conclude (or settle on the theory) that Souji's biological father <br/>
was indeed Katsujiro after a (very) long discussion,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >some say Souji had a child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This "theory' has been concluded to be inaccurate. (The newspaper article was written out <br/>
of curiosity.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Would he have gone to Hakodate?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do believe that Okita would've at least gone to the Tohoku region if he wasn't sick. What <br/>
I'm wondering is whether he would go with Rintarou or Hijikata. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738013493">Actually, Isami's nephew Miyagawa Yugorou became his heir. (In 1876, Yugorou married <br/>

I suppose that Souji's son could be Souji's heir. Yoshijirou could also be the head of the <br/>
family after Souji and before Souji's son. My guess is relevantly based on the Okita family <br/>
history through four generations.    <br/>
<br/>
Ten years after Rintarou Kanemasa's death, Yoshijirou died in 1895, at age 43 (by East <br/>
Asian age reckoning.) His grave is next to Souji's, by the way. Yoshijirou's heir/eldest son <br/>
Juji (sp?) died in 1910, at age 23 (by East Asian age reckoning.) After Juji's death, his <br/>
younger brother became the head of the Okita family.<br/>

all the adopting that was going on.  I've been asking all my <br/>
questions using Kondou and Okita as examples.  Yes, Yugorou became <br/>
Isami's heir, but I guess what I really want to know is - *what if* <br/>
Isami had adopted an heir.  Would that person have to go through <br/>
three adoptions (Miyagawa, Shimazaki, Kondou) to finally become <br/>
Kondou?  And why? (Since Isami had to become a Shimazaki before a <br/>
Kondou.) <br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of a book or someplace online where there is some <br/>
explanation of adoptions during this time, feel free to direct me <br/>
before I potentially drive everyone crazy with questions.  :)<br/>
