<h3>Name Changes and Adoptions</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291577447">The sudden influx of information has left me with a lot of <br/>
questions...  I&#39;ll start with just a few.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;While Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi was a member of the <br/>
Shinsengumi, Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa was the Head Coach <br/>
at the Shieikan.&gt;&gt;  Seven<br/>
 <br/>
I guess my first question is general - Why did people change their <br/>
names so much?  The answer to that may answer my next question - And, <br/>
more specifically, why did/would Souji change his name from Harumasa <br/>
to Kaneyoshi?  And, the change from Soujirou to Souji?    In NHK, he <br/>
tells Heisuke something like I changed my name to match the young <br/>
master.  Based on historical truth?  Or fiction?<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve asked questions on adoptions before, but... When Kondou <br/>
Shusuke adopted Okita Mitsu, was it so that she would not be Okita <br/>
Rintaro&#39;s &quot;sister&quot; so that they could marry?  What would Kondou <br/>
Shusuke get in return for doing this?  Was it as common to adopt <br/>
females?<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
I was a little confused by the &quot;two Rintaro&#39;s.&quot;  Same man or two <br/>
separate people?  Okita Rintaro Fusamasa (or is it Kanemasa?) was <br/>
Mitsu&#39;s husband?  And - <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;one was Inoue Rintaro Mototsune, whom bought his samurai status <br/>
(from the Okita family) after Okita Katsujiro&#39;s death on (lunar <br/>
calendar) October 20, 1845...&quot;&gt;&gt;  Seven<br/>
<br/>
He paid the Okita family?  As sort of a replacement for Katsujirou?  <br/>
After he married Souji&#39;s mother, why did he take the name Okita?  Not <br/>
to be head of the family as Katsujirou had already adopted the man <br/>
that was to marry Mitsu?  Am I completely confused?<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...but really you don&#39;t have to be a specialist you can be a fan <br/>
who joins the group and asks questions, this will help the main <br/>
writers understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of the hundreds of thousands of Okita <br/>
fans out there&gt;&gt;  secretary<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got many Okita related questions and would be happy to ask them <br/>
if Seven or anyone else is interested in what us Souji fans want to <br/>
know.  I&#39;m more an expert in the area of things that are presented as <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724811839">Why did people change their names so much?  It was the samurai&#39;s custom!  Many samurai <br/>
changed their name twice, but Okita had only changed his name once.  Yes, a samurai <br/>
would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he changed his (full) <br/>
name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi.  Why?  I&#39;m not sure...<br/>
<br/>
No, Okita didn&#39;t change his name from Soujirou to Souji  to match the young master. <br/>
There&#39;s a theory that he changed his name to Souji because some people around him <br/>
called him &quot;Sou-Ji&quot; (short for Soujirou.) <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have the Okitas&#39; family register from around 1845, but it&#39;s generally believed that <br/>
Kondou Shusuke adopted Mitsu so she wouldn&#39;t be Rintaro&#39;s sister.  <br/>
<br/>
Kondou Shusuke probably didn&#39;t get anything in return for doing this. It was common for a <br/>
female (like a merchant&#39;s daughter) to be adopted by someone in order to wed a man (like <br/>
the second son of a samurai family) she couldn&#39;t marry otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
There were two separate Okita Rintaro&#39;s. Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Kanwmasa was Mitsu&#39;s <br/>
husband.  <br/>
<br/>
Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed that Okita Rintarou <br/>
Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita <br/>
family and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.)  He served as a retainer for <br/>
young Souji. <br/>
<br/>
The Okita family could have needed the additional financial support from Rintarou <br/>
Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as the head of the Okita <br/>
family for a short time (not sure how short...) <br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve mentioned before, I&#39;ve only started buying books on Okita since May 2005. On top <br/>
of that, I&#39;m not proficient in the Japanese language either. Nevertheless, I&#39;d be happy to <br/>
answer all the questions I could.  :)<br/>

in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name, <br/>

someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>

<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
Yes they can be adopted into one family and then adopted out into <br/>
another family---however this is rare and I&#39;ve only come across one <br/>
example and it is not 100% confirmed.  <br/>
<br/>
Generally this will not occur if the child was adopted in to be an <br/>
heir of some sort.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------<br/>
Adoption scenarios <br/>
(not necessarily pertaining to Okita---just general info)<br/>
<br/>
1) in need of a male heir to continue the family name (example <br/>
Fujita Goro/Tokio adopting out their 3rd son to Tokio&#39;s cousin)<br/>
<br/>
2) in need of a male heir for the lineage (e.g. martial arts, flower <br/>
arrangement, dance, art/painting, even ceramics...and numerous other <br/>
arts which require hereditary line)<br/>
<br/>
3) favorite students are sometimes adopted (not necessarily to be <br/>
heirs of a line for an &quot;art&quot; but just adopted nonetheless)<br/>
<br/>
4) adopting son-in-law to be male heir for family/lineage (example <br/>
would be Nagakura Shinpachi in the Meiji Era)<br/>
<br/>
5) adopting out children in the case of &quot;need&quot; (family gives up son <br/>
because they cannot support all their children)<br/>
<br/>
6) another weird category---very informal adoption to Buddhist monks <br/>
or Shinto shrine priests (generally out of a unable to fulfill basic <br/>
needs scenario)---which does not require paperwork<br/>
---however there are cases where Buddhist monks will adopt &quot;sons&quot; <br/>
and paperwork is available<br/>
<br/>
7) females were also adopted (example Nakano Takeko, leader of the <br/>
Aizu Womens Brigade adopted out to another family)<br/>
<br/>
*not all adoptions were &quot;secret&quot; (as seen in the case of the Fujita <br/>
family and Numazawa family)<br/>
<br/>
*just because you were adopted out, often you could return to your <br/>
birth parents and maintain a completely normal relationship---some <br/>
cases you can also go back to your birth family as well---birth <br/>
parents or siblings can also continue to financially support the <br/>
child adopted out<br/>
<br/>
*basically adoption did not mean a severence necessarily of your <br/>
blood ties<br/>
<br/>
*the adoption scenarios above can be found during the Meiji Era and <br/>
even &quot;modern&quot; arts and sciences were &quot;converted&quot; to Japanese culture<br/>
example: there was this one guy who was a really awesome typesetter <br/>
(using more modern techniques) for a famous newspaper during the <br/>
Meiji Era, he wanted to teach his art and he adopted a young man </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977378365">Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and he took the name Kondou when <br/>
he became the 3rd master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu in 1830. Therefore, Kondou Isami was <br/>
first adopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name Kondou sometime after 1858.  <br/>
<br/>
Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s birth (but that&#39;s not the <br/>
point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as the head of the Okita family for a short time <br/>
(possibly less than a year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head of the family. <br/>
Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family until Souji <br/>
got married.  Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s son Yoshijirou would probably <br/>
have become Souji&#39;s heir (and would likely have married Souji&#39;s eldest daughter.) I suppose <br/>
that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s daughter <br/>
instead.  However, considering that Souji&#39;s son would&#39;ve been quite a few years younger <br/>
than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this would&#39;ve been the case.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed his (full)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. Why? I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; not sure...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From Wikipedia:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugoro in 1849, who<br/>
&gt; &gt; first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have? I thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been given) a name<br/>
&gt; &gt; to honor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his name from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou. And<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating himself from<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first? Could<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ****<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed<br/>
&gt; &gt; that Okita Rintarou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by<br/>
&gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; family and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.) He<br/>
&gt; &gt; served as a retainer for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; young Souji.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Okita family could have needed the additional financial support<br/>
&gt; &gt; from Rintarou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as<br/>
&gt; &gt; the head of the Okita<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; family for a short time (not sure how short...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; First, if Katsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be head of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita family because Souji was too young...what happened when Souji&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; mother married Rintarou Mototsune? RM displaced RK as head of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; family? Then after RM&#39;s death RK was reinstated? And what would<br/>
&gt; &gt; have happened if Souji had lived longer? Would he have replaced RK?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Finally, if one could change their status through purchase or<br/>

&gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family until<br/>
&gt; &gt; Souji<br/>

I understand what you&#39;re saying. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. The samurai class was <br/>
abolished within years after the Shogunate government was overthrown and whether Okita <br/>
received Bakushin status in 1867 wouldn&#39;t have mattered at that point, would it?  Then, he <br/>
would&#39;ve followed the &quot;plan&quot; to become the head of the family and name Yoshijirou as his <br/>
heir (he would&#39;t have a &quot;reason&quot; to start a Bunke of his own, wouldn&#39;t he? ) <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2006/6/26, Seven &lt;nlf7@&gt;:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and he took the name<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondou when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he became the 3rd master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu in 1830. Therefore,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondou Isami was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first adopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name Kondou sometime<br/>
&gt; &gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1858.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s birth<br/>
&gt; &gt; (but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as the head of the Okita family<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a short time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (possibly less than a year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the family.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family<br/>
&gt; &gt; until<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Souji<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got married. Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s son<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yoshijirou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have become Souji&#39;s heir (and would likely have married Souji&#39;s eldest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daughter.) I suppose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kanamasa&#39;s daughter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead. However, considering that Souji&#39;s son would&#39;ve been quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years younger<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this<br/>
&gt; &gt; would&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been the case.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If one could change their status through purchase or adoption then<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all just a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formality?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; During the Bakumatsu? more or less, perhaps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once. Yes, a samurai<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed his (full)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. Why? I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not sure...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From Wikipedia:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugoro in 1849,<br/>
&gt; &gt; who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have? I thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been given) a name<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to honor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his name from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou. And<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating himself from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first? Could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ****<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Okita Rintarou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.) He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; served as a retainer for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; young Souji.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Okita family could have needed the additional financial<br/>
&gt; &gt; support<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Rintarou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the head of the Okita<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family for a short time (not sure how short...)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, if Katsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be head of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okita family because Souji was too young...what happened when<br/>
&gt; &gt; Souji&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother married Rintarou Mototsune? RM displaced RK as head of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family? Then after RM&#39;s death RK was reinstated? And what would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have happened if Souji had lived longer? Would he have replaced RK?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, if one could change their status through purchase or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adoption then it&#39;s all just a formality?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

Is &quot;he&quot; Souji?<br/>
Souji don&#39;t have to be the head of Okita family since Rintaro took it.<br/>
Yoshijirou can be heir without doing nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read somewhere that Souji&#39;s mother sold Samurai status to Rintaro&#39;s<br/>
father.<br/>
(That&#39;s why Mistu was adopted to Kondo family to marry him?)<br/>
If so, Souji can&#39;t be the head of Okita family anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Or Souji might be adopted to Kondo family to become Shieikan dojo master.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Okita family is so complicated.<br/>
Some researchers even doubt that Souji was really Katsujiro&#39;s son or not.<br/>

Adoption was sooo common in those days.<br/>
My great great grandpa was adopted from other family, and one of descendant<br/>
of the family and I were classmates in local elementary school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848671720">Many feudal institutions were abolished on paper but not in reality.<br/>
<br/>
People who were once of the samurai social class were generally <br/>
noted as shizoku...another example would be heimin which comprised <br/>
of the largest chunk of society (anything from artisans, merchants <br/>
and also farmers).  For instance, texts will say &quot;The Seinan War may <br/>
be regarded as a shizoku rebellion&quot;.  Meaning former Satsuma samurai <br/>
(who still considered themselves to be samurai ofcourse).  The <br/>
Fujita Family were categorized as heimin.<br/>
<br/>
Even after 1868, your social roots still continued to be very <br/>
important.  Interestingly, many students at a school I studied <br/>
noted &quot;shizoku&quot; status even though their parents were engaged in <br/>
merchant work in the Meiji Era.  Thus, 1868 cannot really be <br/>
considered to be a cut off date for how people think about their <br/>
social class.<br/>

The samurai class was <br/>

overthrown and whether Okita <br/>

&gt; Many feudal institutions were abolished on paper but not in reality.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People who were once of the samurai social class were generally <br/>
&gt; noted as shizoku...another example would be heimin which comprised <br/>
&gt; of the largest chunk of society (anything from artisans, merchants <br/>
&gt; and also farmers).  For instance, texts will say &quot;The Seinan War may <br/>
&gt; be regarded as a shizoku rebellion&quot;.  Meaning former Satsuma samurai <br/>
&gt; (who still considered themselves to be samurai ofcourse).  The <br/>
&gt; Fujita Family were categorized as heimin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even after 1868, your social roots still continued to be very <br/>
&gt; important.  Interestingly, many students at a school I studied <br/>
&gt; noted &quot;shizoku&quot; status even though their parents were engaged in <br/>
&gt; merchant work in the Meiji Era.  Thus, 1868 cannot really be <br/>
&gt; considered to be a cut off date for how people think about their <br/>
&gt; social class.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes, we were talking about if Okita had lived longer.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I understand what you&#39;re saying. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. <br/>
&gt; The samurai class was <br/>
&gt; &gt; abolished within years after the Shogunate government was <br/>
&gt; overthrown and whether Okita <br/>
&gt; &gt; received Bakushin status in 1867 wouldn&#39;t have mattered at that <br/>
&gt; point, would it?  Then, he <br/>
&gt; &gt; would&#39;ve followed the &quot;plan&quot; to become the head of the family and <br/>
&gt; name Yoshijirou as his <br/>
&gt; &gt; heir (he would&#39;t have a &quot;reason&quot; to start a Bunke of his own, <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t he? ) <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and he <br/>
&gt; took the name<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondou when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he became the 3rd master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu in 1830. <br/>
&gt; Therefore,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondou Isami was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first adopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name <br/>
&gt; Kondou sometime<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1858.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before <br/>
&gt; Souji&#39;s birth<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as the head of the <br/>
&gt; Okita family<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a short time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (possibly less than a year) before Rintarou Kanamasa <br/>
&gt; became the head<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the family.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of <br/>
&gt; the family<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Souji<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got married. Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s <br/>
&gt; son<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoshijirou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have become Souji&#39;s heir (and would likely have married <br/>
&gt; Souji&#39;s eldest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daughter.) I suppose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married <br/>
&gt; Rintarou<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kanamasa&#39;s daughter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead. However, considering that Souji&#39;s son would&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; been quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years younger<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think <br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been the case.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; custom! Many samurai<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed their name twice, but Okita had only changed <br/>
&gt; his name<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once. Yes, a samurai<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle <br/>
&gt; name when he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed his (full)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. <br/>
&gt; Why? I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not sure...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From Wikipedia:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugoro <br/>
&gt; in 1849,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, <br/>
&gt; Kondo Isami.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have? I <br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been <br/>
&gt; given) a name<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to honor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his <br/>
&gt; name from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like <br/>
&gt; Katsujirou. And<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part <br/>
&gt; of his name,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating <br/>
&gt; himself from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki <br/>
&gt; first? Could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; generally believed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Okita Rintarou<br/>

I&#39;ve read that the &quot;plan&quot; was for Souji to become the head of the Okita family from Oji&#39;s <br/>
book &quot;Walking with Okita Soji&quot; (Oji, p.39). Since Okita was the heir of the Okita Family, <br/>
Kondo Shuske wasn&#39;t able to (formally) adopt him even though Okita was raised by both <br/>
the Okita family and the Kondo family. Although the Kondo family could not adopt Okita, <br/>
Kondou Isami still named Okita to be the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu after him in <br/>
1865.<br/>

&gt; Souji don&#39;t have to be the head of Okita family since Rintaro took it.<br/>
&gt; Yoshijirou can be heir without doing nothing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read somewhere that Souji&#39;s mother sold Samurai status to Rintaro&#39;s<br/>
&gt; father.<br/>
&gt; (That&#39;s why Mistu was adopted to Kondo family to marry him?)<br/>
&gt; If so, Souji can&#39;t be the head of Okita family anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or Souji might be adopted to Kondo family to become Shieikan dojo master.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Generally, everyone would conclude (or settle on the theory) that Souji&#39;s biological father <br/>
was indeed Katsujiro after a (very) long discussion,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;birth (but that&#39;s not the point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the head of the Okita family for a short time (possibly less than a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head of the family. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;family until Souji got married.  Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s son Yoshijirou would probably have become Souji&#39;s heir <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and would likely have married Souji&#39;s eldest daughter.) I suppose <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s daughter instead.  However, considering that Souji&#39;s son <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;would&#39;ve been quite a few years younger than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this would&#39;ve been the case.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If Rintaro Kanamasa was only &quot;holding&quot; the heir position for Souji <br/>
&gt; &gt; until he got married, why wouldn&#39;t Souji&#39;s son (if he had had one) be <br/>
&gt; &gt; Souji&#39;s heir?  What would Rintaro&#39;s son have to do with anything <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Souji can start &quot;Bunke&quot;, a branch family of Okita.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Souji received Bakushin status in 1967 so his Okita line could be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;higher than Rintaro&#39;s Okita line.<br/>
