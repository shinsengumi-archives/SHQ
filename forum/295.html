<div id="ygrps-yiv-945588797">Joe Odagiri is the actor portraying Saitou Hajime in the NHK TAiga <br/>
drama...so I did some online stalking...errr research and found that he <br/>
was in the following movies<br/>
<br/>
BRIGHT FUTURE dir. by Kiyoshi Kurosawa ALSO starring Tadanobu <br/>
Asano *hottie* (starred in Gohatto/Taboo and Gojoe)<br/>
<br/>
AZUMI...I can&#39;t really recommend this film because the director also <br/>
directed a film called VERSUS which was -horrible- and reviewers are <br/>
saying that AZUMI is basically VERSUS with swords...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454470792">Thanks for the heads up on that. Odagiri is also in a  film that is <br/>
recently out or is coming out about Japanese jazz musicians  right after <br/>
WWII  I can&#39;t remember the name  but there was an interview (in Japanese <br/>
of course) with a musician who is apparently crossing over into acting <br/>
with this film. They showed a brief portion with subtitles and it seemed <br/>
really good.<br/>
