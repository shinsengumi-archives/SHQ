<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979283600">Funny how just a little new info can make things you didn't <br/>
understand before so much clearer. Thanks to Momoiro-usagi, I was <br/>
FINALLY able to understand the birthdate sheet on www.toshizo.com :<br/>
<br/>
Father - Yoshiatsu (Hayato)* - 1792-1835 - 44* (age at time of death)<br/>
Mother - Etsu - 1792-1840 - 49<br/>
<br/>
Brother - Tamejirou - 1812-1883 - 72<br/>
Brother - no name - died prematurely (Oct 11, 1813)<br/>
Brother - no name - died prematurely (June 12, 1815)<br/>
Brother - Kiroku - 1819-1860 - 42<br/>
Sister - no name - died prematurely (Aug 4, 1821)<br/>
Sister - no name - died prematurely (May 5, 1822)<br/>
Sister - Shuu - 1823-1838 - 16<br/>
Brother - Daisaku (later Kasuya Ryojyun) - 1828-1877 - 50<br/>
Sister - Nobu - 1831-1877 - 47<br/>
Hijikata - 1835-1869 - 34<br/>
<br/>
*Hayato - Was this his father's "hidden" name? I just realized that <br/>
this was the name Hijikata went by for a short time. <br/>
<br/>
*I have also seen his age given as 42 I thought? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Battle of Matsumae Castle (Hakodate War) -<br/>
<br/>
Basically what I have been able to figure out from a very poor <br/>
machine translation of www.tamahito.com is that Enomoto and company <br/>
pretty much considered the feudal clan to be under their power. There <br/>
was a letter sent which may have indicated as much and did request <br/>
that they have a peaceful and cooperative existence for the good of <br/>
the Ezo Republic. The clan did not even bother to answer the letter <br/>
which made Enomoto angry and he sent Hijikata's army to deal with <br/>
them on October 27, 1868. (Recall that this would have been November <br/>
or December by the modern calender. There was already much snow on <br/>
the ground so it would not have been an easy march for them.)<br/>
<br/>
At some point the clan realized that Hijikata was on his way and <br/>
according to the translation, attempted to "assassinate" him before <br/>
his troop could reach the castle. Of course it failed. The article <br/>
did not elaborate on what they tried to do, but I did find reference <br/>
on www.toshizo.com to a surprise attack by night on Hijikata's camp <br/>
shortly before they reached Matsumae Castle.<br/>
<br/>
On November 5 he reached the castle, which has one of its sides <br/>
facing the sea. At dawn the two sides began to shell one another. <br/>
After Hijikata's men had wounded around 30 of their own, the feudal <br/>
clan was forced to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
There are two conflicting stories about how Hijikata won the battle. <br/>
The first one claims that he saw they opened the castle gate to fire <br/>
and would then shut it again. He figured out the timing of it and <br/>
sent men to sneak up on both sides of the gate. When the gate was <br/>
opened again, they were able to fire into the fort at close range and <br/>
cause they to have to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
The other story is said to come from Shimada Kai's diary and is <br/>
probably more reliable. He said that Hijikata used a ladder to sneak <br/>
people into the castle and attack the from within and this is how <br/>
they took the castle.<br/>
<br/>
After the battle many members of the Matsumae clan escaped, setting <br/>
fire "to the private house and the village". (Not sure if the bit <br/>
about "the private house" means they set their house on fire or if it <br/>
simply means they set the whole village on fire.) This action was <br/>
later condemned. Enomoto had learned international law and that it <br/>
said citizens should not be harmed who were not directly involved in <br/>
a war. It seems that he expected his own troops to go by this law <br/>
from what this is saying. It further comments that this was a new <br/>
idea for Japan and not the old feudal idea. <br/>
<br/>
One final sad note. Apparently the Matsumae clan went to the Tsugaru <br/>
clan (?) for help. They had to take a ferry to reach them and the <br/>
weather, as I have mentioned, was bad. They had a princess of the <br/>
family with them who had TB and ended up dying as a result of the <br/>
conditions at the time. She was 25 at the time.<br/>
<br/>
I recall seeing a reference to that trick with the gate in connection <br/>
with Utsunomiya Castle as well. I wonder if that could have been <br/>
where it really took place and some survivor of both battles got the <br/>
two fights mixed up? Also, I would tend to think Shimada would have <br/>
known for certain since he was Hijikata's bodyguard at the time <br/>
apparently. <br/>
<br/>
I also was reading a bit about the two people who got a letter about <br/>
Hijikata's death to his family. The man who wrote it was named <br/>
Yasutomi Saisuke and he had taught horsemanship to the Shinsengumi <br/>
when they were still in Kyoto. By the time of the Battle of Hakodate <br/>
he was Hijikata's aide and was supposed to have been with him during <br/>
his last moments. He entrusted a letter with the details of this to a <br/>
man named Tachikawa Chikara.<br/>
<br/>
Tachikawa seems to have been a later member, but I cannot tell for <br/>
sure. He also appears to have been trying to help Yasutomi to escape <br/>
just before the Ezo Republic finally collapsed and was captured. He <br/>
was sent to the Akita feudal clan to "behave". The letter was finally <br/>
delivered to the Sato house in Hino in 1872. Tachikawa was 68 when he <br/>
died in 1903.<br/>
<br/>
As for Yasutomi, he was released in Edo in 1870. However it is said <br/>
that he was murdered soon after by another original member of the <br/>
Shinsengumi. I could only make out "Abe" for sure. This is probably <br/>
Abe Juurou of Ito's group, who would certainly have a motive to kill <br/>
anyone closely connected to Hijikata. Yasutomi was 31 when he died.<br/>
