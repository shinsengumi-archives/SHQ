<h3>Got Movie Reviews?</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792225103">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Working on some stuff for the site behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
If you visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shinsengumihq.com/shq/?page_id=83">http://shinsengumihq.com/shq/?page_id=83</a><br/>
click on the link "filmography" and you'll see a very long list of Shinsengumi <br/>
films (Imdb does not list all films featuring the Shinsengumi).<br/>
<br/>
Now, we would love to post more expanded reviews of films.  So if you've <br/>
seen a film/anime featuring the guys please forward your review to: <br/>
secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com .<br/>
<br/>
We also have a list of films which already have reviews but they aren't live <br/>
yet until I reformat font/images.  So if you want to give your opinion on <br/>
more mainstream films such as Gohatto or Mibugishiden just send me an <br/>
email.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the fact that the Shinsengumi are featured in anything from rated-G <br/>
anime for kids, high brow cinema to adult films it is all right to write <br/>
clever/cynical reviews because let's face it some of these films really <br/>
deserve it. (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently figuring out an efficient way of putting things back online <br/>
because I've just determined that having Photoshop, WS/FTP, Wordpress, <br/>
Wordpress edit mode, html builder all open at the same time is really <br/>
slowing me down.<br/>
