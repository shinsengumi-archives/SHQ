 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a great site that lists places that are related to the <br/>
Shinsengumi or to people who were involved with them! It even has a <br/>
handy little map so you can locate the sites easy!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aiaiaizu.com/shinsengumi/">http://www.aiaiaizu.com/shinsengumi/</a><br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The site fails to mention this but Takizawa Go-honjin was also the HQ <br/>
for Matsudaira Katamori during the fighting. You&#39;re supposed to still <br/>
be able to see the bullet holes. It was originally a rest station. <br/>
(The temple where he officially surrendered is right across from it. <br/>
It&#39;s called Myokoku-ji.) <br/>
<br/>
Nyoraidou (Buddha Hall) - I think we determined this is where that <br/>
Sept. 4/5 battle took place?<br/>
Bonari Pass isn&#39;t mentioned on the site for some reason. <br/>
<br/>
I guess there is nothing left of them now, but the prison camps for <br/>
the Aizu samurai were at Inawashiro and Shiokawa. I think Saito was <br/>
at least originally at Shiokawa.<br/>
<br/>
Not mentioned on this site:<br/>
Nihonmatsu Monument - Dedicated to yet another boys troop who were <br/>
killed in action.<br/>
Tonoguchihara Old Battle Site - Lots of heavy fighting here.<br/>
Takeko Nakano (the leader of the women&#39;s troop) is buried at <br/>
Aizubange Town. Supposedly Horibe Yasubei&#39;s parents are also buried <br/>
there at Kitoku-ji Temple. <br/>
<br/>
Another good site to look at would be:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pref.fukushima.jp/index_e.html">http://www.pref.fukushima.jp/index_e.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the landscape around Aizu has changed a bit since the time of the <br/>
Boshin War. I forget what year it was, but Mt. Bandai blew its top <br/>
and ended up creating a bunch of lakes and marshes. I don&#39;t know if <br/>
it changed any of the Shinsengumi related sites or not.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I&#39;ll be there till February, I want to visit some<br/>
&gt; famous spots there ^^<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have traveled Aizu only once. <br/>
I went to Wakamatsu castle, Kondou&#39;s grave, Saitou&#39;s grave, Iimori <br/>
mountain, the remains of Shimizuya-inn, and Nyoraidou. <br/>
(Incidentally, I stayed at the Higashiyama hot-spring village.)^^ <br/>
<br/>
Wakamatsu castle was destroyed in Boshin war. <br/>
(Now, it is restored.) <br/>
The source materials of the time are in the museum of the castle. <br/>
<br/>
Kondou&#39;s grave is in Tennei-ji (Tennei temple) near the Higashiyama <br/>
hot-spring village.<br/>
Hijikata who got injured in the Utsunomiya war went to the <br/>
Higashiyama hot-spring village for three months. <br/>
He received the bullet in the leg. <br/>
And he built Kondou&#39;s grave, doing a hot-spring cure at this hot <br/>
spring. <br/>
Kondou&#39;s grave is in the inner part of a mountain. <br/>
There is a very steep slope there on the way. <br/>
Did Hijikata go up that slope on inconvenient one leg? <br/>
I considered such a thing and went up the slope. <br/>
<br/>
However, will Kamo-san attend Aizu in February? <br/>
The time, Japan is midwinter. <br/>
If there is much snow, you may be unable to go there. <br/>
<br/>
In passing, Aizu-bukeyashiki (Aizu Samurai house) is between the <br/>
Higashiyama hot-spring village and Tennei-ji. <br/>
This is the house in Saigou Tanomo which was Aizu&#39;s minister. <br/>
Sasaki Tadasaburou&#39;s grave is in a site. <br/>
<br/>
Saitou&#39;s grave is in Amida-ji (Amida temple) beside the Nanukamachi <br/>
station in Aizu Line. <br/>
Since it is in the very conspicuous place of the temples, you can <br/>
find it immediately. <br/>
<br/>
An Iimori mountain is the place where the boys of Byakko-tai <br/>
committed suicide. <br/>
Their grave is located in the mountain side of a mountain, and you <br/>
can sense their despair for a view from this place. <br/>
<br/>
A Byakko-tai memorial hall is located in the bottom of it. <br/>
Here, the personal effects of Hijikata or Saitou is exhibited. <br/>
And Takizawa-honjin is near this. <br/>
(I forgot to go there.)^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
There is Shimizuya-inn, if you walk along the road in front of Amida-<br/>
ji. <br/>
Hijikata stayed here. <br/>
(The signboard only stands now.) Regrettable! <br/>
<br/>
Nyoraidou has separated a few from Aizu Wakamatsu. <br/>
If you believe a map and walk, you will repent. <br/>
Nyoraidou is in a paddy field. <br/>
And a building is the old hut which is completely valueless. <br/>
However, about 20 Shinsengumi members who made Saitou the captain <br/>
here fought with the enemy. <br/>
The enemy&#39;s number changes with data. <br/>
Since an enemy&#39;s number was written to be about 300 persons, I was <br/>
very much surprised at the book which I read first.^^;;; <br/>
Saitou is truly lucky. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, Bonari Pass is located in the direction of the <br/>
Inawashiro lake. <br/>
It is far from Aizu Wakamatsu. <br/>
If you can drive a car, you can go there. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I live in Tokyo. <br/>
However, I can attend Aizu in about 5 hours from Tokyo. <br/>
If the day when you come to Aizu is known, I can go there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498630837">Kalli, you may find this interesting but 1to5.net felt uncomfortable <br/>
with taking a pictures of where his ashes/bones are kept.  Instead <br/>
the webmaster for the site took a picture of what the <br/>
headstone/grave marker is facing.  However, the headstone is shown <br/>
on the internet at various sites.  So it is up to the person.  If I <br/>
could visit Aizu and all the places I have been reading about  I <br/>
would just burn incense at their graves (E.g. Byakkotai, all <br/>
Shinsengumi related graves and members of the Women&#39;s Brigade).  It <br/>
is a Thai custom to ask permission of the deceased before taking a <br/>
picture of the headstone/grave marker I wonder if this exists in <br/>
Japanese culture.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, S.K. is reminding us all how lucky he is...... (&gt;_&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems that it becomes a quite grand event under the influence of <br/>
Taiga drama this year. <br/>
Saitou&#39;s commemorative ceremony will be held from this year. <br/>
Does Tama-san go the event? <br/>
(Iinaa--- Urayanasii.   Yousou no Hijikata mitai desu.)<br/>
I cannot go by relation between schedule and money anywhere <br/>
September ^^;;;<br/>
<br/>
About a grave, it is a sure very difficult problem. <br/>
When I traveled Aizu, the photograph of a gravestone was not taken <br/>
at all. <br/>
However, it is the problem of my feeling. <br/>
If it is those who protect fundamental manners, I will not think <br/>
that I will say bad. <br/>
It is the most important manners in Japan that you pray with your <br/>
hands joined and express respect to the dead of a grave.<br/>
(Of course, even if I do not say such a thing, Tama-san knows it <br/>
enough.) <br/>
I met the family who takes a photograph loudly in front of the grave <br/>
of Byakko-tai without protecting even it.<br/>
Next to the schoolgirl who offers an incense stick and sheds tears, <br/>
they made noise.<br/>
And without seeing a grave, they took only the photograph and <br/>
returned. <br/>
I regarded them as really deplorable. <br/>
They did not express respect to the dead but also trampled down <br/>
further the feeling of people who came there. <br/>
(I think that this will be a very special example.<br/>
Probably, most people who take the photograph of a grave think that <br/>
they are probably performing it with careful cautions.)<br/>
The dead lived the past time actually and the manners to them which <br/>
are people who are sleeping in the place now are absolutely <br/>
required. <br/>
I think that expressing respect to them is the manners which we <br/>
should do.<br/>
Everything but it is judgment of an individual.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The grave of the Fujita family is located in the very conspicuous <br/>
place of an Amida temple. <br/>
It separates from other families&#39; graves and exists only by one.<br/>
It is a very intelligible place. <br/>
Since Tokio carried out some good deeds to Aizu, the place has seen <br/>
the opinion of having been given for the prize. <br/>
However, since I have forgotten where it was seen, it may not be an <br/>
exact talk.<br/>
But it is actually in the position which the fans of Saitou who <br/>
visits the place can look for immediately.<br/>
Truly, everybody will be surprised if it is seen.^^<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although the talk changes, I get information mail from Aizu&#39;s kimono <br/>
store. <br/>
According to the mail, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; appears in Aizu recently.<br/>
It wears the clothes just like &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;. <br/>
And he is standing, making a pose. <br/>
Although he is witnessed by Aizu&#39;s people, it is unknown what is the <br/>
purpose.<br/>
It is said that the information saw him around Aizu-Bukeyashiki.<br/>
If lucky, Tama-san may also meet him. <br/>
(Deattemo betsuni uresiku nai desyou keredomo....)^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
Okiwotsukete itterashai mase.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, does Kamo-san know &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;? <br/>

Well... I think it&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t think it will<br/>
be my favorite series T_T I prefer those Shinsengumi<br/>
series/movies with more... passion, so to speak. The<br/>
drama is way more a soap opera than a jidaigeki<br/>
(Kataoka Chiezo ya Mifune Toshiro ga detekisou na<br/>

and prefer more a jidaigeki... ^^;;;<br/>

I was worried about whether the escalator of Iimori mountain is <br/>

Since Aizu is the north side in Japan, it is early that winter <br/>
comes. <br/>
Therefore, you had better do the sightseeing early.  <br/>

I will recommend you to go to Hino. <br/>
Due to Taiga drama, Hino is holding fiesta till October 31. <br/>
I think that you know this page. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.city.hino.tokyo.jp/shinsenr/">http://www.city.hino.tokyo.jp/shinsenr/</a><br/>
<br/>
Various data are gathering in Hino this year. <br/>
Furthermore, Hijikata Toshizou Shiryukan (Hijikata Toshizou data <br/>
hall) opens every day. <br/>
Till last year, it was opening only on the 3rd Sundays every month. <br/>
Furthermore, Hijikata&#39;s sword is exhibited only once every year.<br/>
It is exhibited every day till October 31. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hijikata-toshizo.jp/">http://www.hijikata-toshizo.jp/</a><br/>
<br/>
(According to the information, it seems to be closed on September 26 <br/>
and October 9.) <br/>
<br/>
From the Shinjuku station, it rides on Keio Lines and arrives at the <br/>
Takahatafudo station in about 30 minutes. <br/>
From there, if it is usual, you go to the Mangan-ji station by <br/>
monorail, but if it is the period of fiesta, you can go with a <br/>
shuttle bus. <br/>
Or if the bus which goes to the Hino station from the Takahatafudo <br/>
station is taken, you can go to the residence of Sato Hikogorou, and <br/>
Inoue Genzaburou data hall. <br/>
Please think, if you are going to come to Tokyo. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It had not written on e-mail which &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; it was. <br/>
Probably, the landlady of the kimono store thinks that she cannot <br/>
understand it. <br/>
It is a red eye and there is a tactile sense....Although she is <br/>
writing so, it is applied to almost all &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;. <br/>

<br/>
There was such a page. <br/>
It is the photograph of the Aizu autumn festival in 2003.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, when Kamo-san comes to Japan, I want you to confirm. <br/>
Probably, since you will come to Japan by an airplane, if you arrive <br/>
at an airport, please confirm what kind of smell there is. <br/>
Is there the smell of soy sauce? <br/>
There is an American dish investigator who plays an active part in <br/>
Japan, and she appeared in this front television and said such a <br/>
thing. <br/>
She says that there is the smell of soy sauce in the airport in <br/>
Japan.<br/>
I know that she does not have malice to Japan. <br/>
And I am not unpleasant even if a foreigner says that there is the <br/>
smell of soy sauce in the airport in Japan. <br/>
However, I thought that it was a very strange talk. <br/>
Therefore, I want to ask very much the foreigner who comes to Japan. <br/>
Please confirm at an airport whether there is the smell of soy sauce.<br/>

this small museum and asked if anyone has examined the sword to<br/>
determine the maker/lineage or any other identification and the answer<br/>
is no as far as he knows.... (-_-) .... but maybe I&#39;ll get more info<br/>
in the mail (let&#39;s hope)...<br/>
<br/>
As much of what we know is based on &quot;lists&quot;...lists of names...lists<br/>
of swords I was hoping that we could match the sword to its original<br/>
owner since the owner was a samurai from Aizu.  If the sword is of<br/>
value we can do some searching....and match families who had an<br/>
ancestor who posessed such and such a weapon....</div>

&gt; &gt; I will be living in Aizu Wakamatsu from<br/>
&gt; &gt; September/October till February ^^<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was it my misapprehension? <br/>
&gt; I was worried about whether the escalator of Iimori<br/>
&gt; mountain is <br/>
&gt; moving in February. <br/>
&gt; Since Aizu is the north side in Japan, it is early<br/>
&gt; that winter <br/>
&gt; comes. <br/>
&gt; Therefore, you had better do the sightseeing early. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the advice ^^ I am moving to Aizu Wakamatsu<br/>
soon (currently in Fukushima-shi), so I will have some<br/>
time to do the sightseeing ^^<br/>
 <br/>

&gt; October 31. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to, but I&#39;ll try...<br/>
October 31... thanks for all these info, by the way ^^<br/>

But most probably I will go to the Aizu Shinsengumi<br/>
matsuri<br/>

I want to attend the memorial service to Saito Hajime<br/>
(hounou enbu of Mugai-ryu) and that 4th summit on the<br/>
Shinsengumi ^^<br/>
<br/>
I want to go to the Aizu Aki Matsuri too, but I am<br/>
unsure whether I&#39;ll be able to go or not -_- I will<br/>
try to convince the person in charge to see if he lets<br/>
me go to Aizu Wakamatsu. I want to see the kenbu of<br/>
Byakkotai at the very least. And it seems that the<br/>
actor playing the role of Hijikata Toshizo will join<br/>
the Aizu parade as well.<br/>

&gt; Probably, since you will come to Japan by an<br/>
&gt; airplane, if you arrive <br/>
&gt; at an airport, please confirm what kind of smell<br/>
&gt; there is. <br/>
&gt; Is there the smell of soy sauce? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm... couldn&#39;t smell it... it was just plain air<br/>
conditioning for me ^^;;; though my nose isn&#39;t good,<br/>
so perhaps I didn&#39;t smell it because of my lack of<br/>
sensitivity ^^;;; (and I like shoyu)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33904516">click on the arrow in the upper left hand corner and you get various <br/>
views of Aizu live...some cams give you a city view (rotating), one <br/>
is just the trainstation, one is on the castle...now...the button <br/>
with the camera is [I THINK] the one which will be covering the <br/>
festival because the hours match the day&#39;s festivities 9/23 starting <br/>
at 8:50 am Tokyo time...hopefully they will save clips but it seems <br/>
that everything is live streaming<br/>
<br/>
if anyone gets a chance to watch please let me know ^_^<br/>
