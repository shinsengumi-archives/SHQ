<h3>[Post 1868] Fujita Family Info</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-64328233">Lots of stuff in the works for Shinsengumihq.com  but once everything<br/>
is online and totally done then the updates will appear on the<br/>
homepage.... <br/>
<br/>
The following post will deal with a book which will shed light on:<br/>
1) WHY FUJITA GORO & TOKIO adopted out their third son to the Numazawas<br/>
2) It explains the Numazawa family history---very tragic<br/>
3) [PERHAPS] this book WAS read by Fujita Goro, Tokio and there third<br/>
son Numazawa Tatsuo...I assure you this volume held the interest of<br/>
many survivors from Aizu<br/>
<br/>
I must humble myself before our mysterious and omnipotent fandom.<br/>
SEC ::grovels::<br/>
Thank you to Onigiri-chan and Shimizu Hitomi for their assistance in<br/>
obtaining a book deemed RARE by even serious Japanese fans.<br/>
&quot;Fandom&quot; is often underestimated---but as we have seen from fandom in<br/>
Japan it&#39;s the &quot;little&quot; people who manage to focus all their obsessive<br/>
powers on rare history--and preserve it.<br/>
<br/>
[Recap for new members]<br/>
Takagi Morinosuke 1854-1919<br/>
(sometimes spelled Morinusuke, formerly Takagi GORO)<br/>
younger brother of Takagi Tokio (Fujita Tokioko, wife of Fujita Goro)<br/>
Takagi Morinosuke was part of the last generation to complete a feudal<br/>
education at Nisshinkan (Aizu&#39;s school for samurai).  <br/>
During 1868 he was a scout and messenger as the domain was attacked by<br/>
the Imperial Army.  He later accompanied former Aizu retainer Yamakawa<br/>
Hiroshi to the Seinan War (Satsuma Rebellion) in 1877.  Morinosuke<br/>
eventually became a Chief Prosecutor and collaborated with other<br/>
prominent Aizu men in various efforts to develop their home and<br/>
preserve history.<br/>

<br/>
The book NUMASAWA MICHIKO-KUN DEN was printed in **1913** by Numasawa<br/>
Kohachiro (or Shichiro).<br/>
Tokio was 67<br/>
Fujita Goro was 69<br/>
Numasawa Tatsuo (born Fujita Tatsuo) was 26 (secretly adopted out to<br/>
Numasawa Shichiro/Kohachiro as an infant).<br/>
<br/>
The book was written by Takagi MOrinusuke and SAIGO TANOMO (one of 2<br/>
retainers who had warned MATSUDAIRA KATAMORI from accepting the post<br/>
of &quot;Protector of Kyoto&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Saigo Tanomo died in 1905 thus this book seemed to primarily be the<br/>
effort of Takagi Morinusuke.<br/>
<br/>
Numasawa Michiko was the aunt of TOKIO.  <br/>
Numasawa Michiko, her mother in law and daughters committed suicide<br/>
during the attack by the IMperial Army leaving Numasawa Shichiro to<br/>
fight at the age of 15.  <br/>
<br/>
Thus the scans are of a book Tokio would have read...surely these<br/>
words took her back to 1868 and brought tears to her eyes.  <br/>
<br/>
just sample pages<br/>

1.20 MB<br/>
<br/>
Something to consider---did TOKIO herself assist in the preparation of<br/>
this book?  I know that another major historical book prepared by<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro came about through interviews at the Matsudaira<br/>
estate in Kyoto...did this book undergo a similar process?<br/>
<br/>
To many of us just &quot;adopting out&quot; a son is jarring to our modern<br/>
sentiments---however our job is to understand WHY.  Numasawa Shichiro<br/>
and his wife requested Fujita Goro & Tokio&#39;s child (if it was a girl<br/>
they would keep her) but the Numasawas needed a BOY to continued their<br/>
lineage.  Have an heir to the family name was crucial to many 19th<br/>
century Japanese.  Numasawa Tatsuo somehow became suspicious about his<br/>
parentage and learned the truth in college from an aunt Ibuka Saku. <br/>
Understandably the news devastated him.  <br/>
<br/>
Takagi Morinusuke and Numasawa Shichiro were close.<br/>
We know that Fujita Goro often stayed at Morinusuke&#39;s home when<br/>
visiting his family&#39;s grave.  Was that how Fujita Goro and Tokio kept<br/>
track of their third son?  Did Numasawa Tatsuo&#39;s career in the field<br/>
of law come from his uncle Morinusuke&#39;s mentoring? <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, perhaps this book wasn&#39;t enough...Tokio did write a letter to<br/>
her last son 1 month before Fujita Goro died in 1915.</div>
