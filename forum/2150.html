because it was SUPER cheap on Amazon....now here is the interesting <br/>
part...my copy isn&#39;t from 2000....the seller didn&#39;t tell me that I <br/>
would be getting a book from 1902  !!!!<br/>
<br/>
Alice Mabel Bacon info can be found here, she was the daughter of <br/>
Minister Leonard Bacon and she had the opportunity to live in Japan <br/>

Sutematsu)<br/>

<br/>
The book was dedicated to<br/>
&quot;Stematz, the Marchioness Oyama<br/>
In the name of our girlhood&#39;s friendship<br/>
unchanged and unshaken by the changes<br/>
and separations of our <br/>
maturer years<br/>
this volume is affectionately dedicated&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stematz was the name used by Sutematsu in the USA and Oyama is her <br/>
last name after marrying Oyama Iwao....<br/>
<br/>
Bacon page 172<br/>
&quot;Two ladies of the finest samurai type had, with absolute loyalty to <br/>
a lost cause, aided by every means in their power in the defense of <br/>
the city of Wakamatsu against the victorious forces of the Emperor.  <br/>
They had held on to the bitter end, and had been banished, with other <br/>
family and clan, to a remote province, for some years after the end <br/>
of the war.  In 1877, eleven years after the close of the war of the <br/>
restoration, a rebellion broke out in the south which required a <br/>
considerable expenditure of blood and money for its suppression.  <br/>
When the new war began, these two ladies presented a petition to the <br/>
government, in which they begged that they might be allowed to make <br/>
amends for their former position of opposition to the Emperor, by <br/>
going with the army to the field as hospital nurses.  At that time, <br/>
no lady in Japan had ever gone to the front to nurse the wounded <br/>
soldiers; but to those two brave women was granted the privilege of <br/>
making atonement for past disloyalty, by the exercise of the skill <br/>
and nerve that they had gained in their experience of war against the <br/>
Emperor, in the nursing of soldiers wounded in his defense.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*perhaps these two Aizu women had husbands or brothers who like many <br/>
former Aizu samurai joined the police force and the army during the <br/>
outbreak of the Seinan War (SAtsuma Rebellion)<br/>
<br/>
She also writes about the warrior training of samurai women, and <br/>
ofcourse the information was from her Aizu friends.  Thus the book is <br/>
not merely a general snapshot of women in Meiji Era Japan, but women <br/>
during the end of feudalism and provides valuable insight into the <br/>
lives of those who lived in Aizu.  There is even a painting of a <br/>
woman using a chain and sickle against another woman wielding a <br/>
naginata.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784993737">go to FILES and look for &quot;Japanese Girls and Women.htm&quot;<br/>
<br/>
the book is incredibly detailed, more info than I wanted to know on <br/>
childcare, weddings, funerals and lots of little stories....<br/>
<br/>
the notes you will see are focused on samurai women because Alice <br/>
Bacon was connected to women of that very social class.  Generally, <br/>
she felt that peasant women had more freedoms.  <br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-2181">&gt;</a> Census Info</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-175087623">my university has subscriptions to all the Federal Census and info <br/>
and I was learning how to use it...so the easiest example was<br/>
&quot;Yamakawa Sutematsu&quot;<br/>
<br/>
sure enough<br/>
<br/>
Stemats Yamakawa shows up on the New Haven Connecticut census<br/>
but notice that her American sister calls her &quot;StematZ&quot;<br/>
<br/>
similarly, there are many many &quot;Fujita&quot; immigrants and &quot;Fugita&quot; as <br/>
well...in all cases many hits for the 1879 birth year for Tsutomu and <br/>
I&#39;m guessing he changed his name a couple of times<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How they came up with Stemats/z out of Sutematsu is beyond me. But I <br/>
imagine an name as &quot;difficult&quot; to pronounce on sight as Tsutomu became <br/>
something entirely different my guess something beginning with &quot;S&quot; or  I <br/>
see a US census taker making him &quot;Tom&quot; Fuj(g)ita<br/>
