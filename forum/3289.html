<h3>Close Encounters with Shinsengumi History in AMERICA</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579522615">Dear members:<br/>
<br/>
These past few days have been indeed interesting for me, both as a<br/>
scholar and as a Shinsengumi fan. During my seemingly never-ending<br/>
travels, I had the opportunity to see an exhibit on the famed artist<br/>
couple, Ike Taiga and Tokuyama Gyokuran, at the Philadelphia Museum of<br/>
Art. The couple, natives of Kyoto, lived in the mid to late 1700s, and<br/>
were skilled artists of the nanga genre. That&#39;s nanga, not manga--<br/>
nanga are &quot;southern drawings,&quot; manga are &quot;sequential drawings.&quot;<br/>
Anyway, I went to this exhibit, and after several hours inside, I saw<br/>
something that made my jaw drop.<br/>
<br/>
It was a set of doors, depicting West Lake, a traditional topic for<br/>
Chinese and Japanese artists alike, painted by Gyokuran, Taiga&#39;s wife.<br/>
Now, that would all be fine and good, except these doors came from<br/>
Konkai-komyoji, her family temple. Now what, you may ask, is the<br/>
significance of Konkai-komyoji?<br/>
<br/>
It was the headquarters for the Aizu clan in Kyoto. Shinsengumi,<br/>
especially Kondou, went there OFTEN.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. These doors were probably seen when Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori, lord of Aizu, entered the place, and may have been mute<br/>
witnesses to the decision to take Shinsengumi under Aizu command.<br/>
Nagakura, when he went to the temple to appear before Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori and censure Kondou, might have sat next to them. Kondou<br/>
himself might have walked right through them. Kondou also may have sat<br/>
near them when receiving the formal awards from Lord Matsudaira, in<br/>
recognition for Shinsengumi&#39;s work at Ikedaya. Or they might have been<br/>
in a less prominent place, but perhaps still seen as our boys passed<br/>
by. Or not seen at all, though I doubt that the doors, painted as they<br/>
were by a famed artist, would be in a place that was not prominent.<br/>
<br/>
It was unreal. A security guard walked up to me and commented that I<br/>
looked like I really loved the exhibit, because apparently I&#39;d been<br/>
inside for hours. I was so moved that I had to go two days in a row,<br/>
just to look at it again and picture our boys. They probably saw it<br/>
with their own eyes. This set of 4 doors, now hanging on a wall in<br/>
Philadelphia...<br/>
<br/>
I will never forget those visits to the art museum as long as I live.<br/>
When I lived in Japan I got to see places where Shinsengumi had been,<br/>
such as Matsushima Bay, Nijo Castle, the Imperial Palace, Hiroshima,<br/>
Osaka...but seeing those doors was different. They weren&#39;t a place,<br/>
they were a thing. A tangible object, that had crossed the ocean and<br/>
which I had encountered without even knowing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad the exhibit closed on Sunday. It would have been so nice<br/>
if it was more permanent, so those of you (predominantly in the US)<br/>
able to do so could make the trip to Philadelphia to see the doors.<br/>
<br/>
In short, the history came alive in that set of somewhat<br/>
unremarkable-looking, painted, sliding doors. And that is why, dear<br/>
members, history compels me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776992487">You guyz.. are verrrry lucky person !!!<br/>
  I never had a chance to see anything (untill now). But I wish I will..<br/>
   <br/>
  Im living in Indonesia.<br/>
  Here, I never met any person who knows Shinsengumi, so I never share and get anything.<br/>
  I never met peole who love Japanese history either.<br/>
  Here also, I can find ONLY one book bout Shinsengumi, so I have to order it and ask my sensei or my friend to send me from Japan. T__T<br/>
  The only one I can talk, ask and share with.. is just my (japanese) friend.<br/>
  (Umm.. sometimes I call him as my rekishi no sensei)<br/>
   <br/>
  Untill (fortunately), I found you guyz.. people who admire history and Shinsengumi of course.<br/>
  Thank God Im not alone ... he he he<br/>
   <br/>
  Although I know Shinsengumi from anime, but I start to admire them since I read lots of their story of life and struggle.<br/>
  The only moment I feel sooooo much influenced by them was.. when I read Kondo&#39;s poem.<br/>
  ( I appreciate them-and this poem- in my site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cyborg13.multiply.com/">http://cyborg13.multiply.com/</a> )<br/>
   <br/>
  And now, even I never watch any (un)remarkable thing, even I stil now nothing bout Shinsengumi, even I can&#39;t talk english and japanese fluently, I try to make people know them from simply things, such as in speech contest, paper writings, sites, or by teaching and pushing my junior in campus to learn more bout history ..ha ha ha ( eventhough it seems useless cause theyre all more interesting in japanese society class T__T ).<br/>
