I suppose that solves the mystery of the school....apparently Saitou was the <br/>

How d-dare you spread such rumors!!!! (I&#39;m not mad)<br/>
...I&#39;m disappointed in you...LOL<br/>
<br/>
O.K. from the Japanese sites out there (yes I know they are all based<br/>
on the same books and stuff) they indicate he was more of an<br/>
administrator...paper pusher, number crunching, traffic directing guy<br/>
(when it rains---much to the glee of his female fans by the way).<br/>
<br/>
Tokio on the other hand was a dorm inspector and teacher which made<br/>
sense when you take her more &quot;upper class&quot; background into<br/>
consideration.  Weren&#39;t you the one who shed some light on the school<br/>
that it was an all girl&#39;s education school (school for teachers?).<br/>
<br/>
The school was close to home and I speculate that Tokio wanted to keep<br/>
him working rather than staying at home.  #1 killer of retirees is<br/>
boredom:)<br/>
<br/>
Cool site by the way. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he taught the students directly.  I mean what would he<br/>
teach?  &quot;Self-defense for young women of dating age&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496796990">(Speculation bubble appears over head)<br/>
I&#39;m sure many of the prisoners had martial arts related skills already<br/>
(yakuza, construction workers, horse thieves all had their own set of<br/>
street fighting skills).<br/>
Martial arts has, from what I hear, been associated with character<br/>
building and refinement of the mind.  Since I don&#39;t think these<br/>
prisoners were the type to sit down in a classroom and learn how to<br/>
read and write...martial arts seems to be a good way for them to get<br/>
some exercise and have law&order and discipline beaten into them if<br/>
need be.  A perceptive guard can also gauge the<br/>
attitude/character/ability of his students/prisoners as well(weed out<br/>
troublemakers and do some serious will breaking).  I don&#39;t have any<br/>
info on this prison where N.S. worked at...was it a prison of 100%<br/>
pure &quot;street&quot; felons or political prisoners who would be released<br/>
after a while anyways?  In any case,  from the later rebellions and<br/>
conflicts abroad I figure the government wouldn&#39;t mind having men of<br/>
&quot;draftable&quot; age fit and ready to fight.  I&#39;m sure the guards had<br/>
rifles handy so even if it does seem counterproductive to instruct<br/>
them in martial arts I&#39;m sure the guards in the towers were ready to<br/>
shoot.<br/>
<br/>
highly recommended in assisting us from getting into the &quot;male&quot;<br/>
swording wielding mind<br/>

(kenjutsu) seems to be the most widely accepted (mentioned on many<br/>

I&#39;m sure his bosses within the department knew all about who he was and they might have been the once he taught kendo for. Or maybe he got certified throught the Shinsengumi somehow? Kondou had been the master of a dojo after all. I&#39;m sure he could have arranged it. But this is all just speculation.<br/>
<br/>
As to the origins of the rumor that he taught kendo after the war, I know of one site that mentions this. The Hiten Misurugi Ryuu site states that he was a kendo instructor for a time, but not where: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
However, they also state that he didn&#39;t join the police force right away. They list the year he became a policeman as 1877. But we know he joined sooner than that. Perhaps they got confused about his leaving for the Senian War and thought that meant this is when he joined? The Saitou Watcher&#39;s Tea Room interestingly enough seems to make this same mistake, also listing the year he joined the police as 1877.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah yeah I know the following is probably all fictional but when Saitou first pops up in the NHK drama in his incarnation as Yamaguchi Hajime he&#39;s working for a dojo---collecting over due fees (that&#39;s how he meets Kondou who came to collect off a wayward student)<br/>
<br/>
While trying to collect more of these fees at a later date the non-payee pulls his sword, cuts Saitou and regrets it permanently. Of course the cops end up going after him for murder. He appeals to Kondou to help him get away and Kondou end sup taking him to Serizawa who both had met during that earlier encounter. Kondou suspects Serizawa had a hand in aiding the escape of some of those involved in the assassination at the Sakurada Gate so he finagles him into using hs connections to get Saitou out of town. <br/>

<br/>
*good point!  I&#39;m assuming that yes they would want to know where he<br/>
was coming from--from a martial arts P.O.V...the answer can be found<br/>
if the history of kendo itself is examined.  Mainstream kendo books<br/>
-do- mention its early days in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police<br/>
Department & Army but no dates are given (some say 19XX was when the<br/>
gov. actually invited a couple of lineages to come up with a<br/>
curriculum)...if the tournaments utilized modern rules/regulations I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if the school/lineage of the practitioner was important.  I&#39;m<br/>
repeating what I&#39;ve heard over and over again on martial arts boards<br/>
(so I deeply apologize if I&#39;m wrong) but distinctions are always made<br/>
between modern kendo (categorized as a sport with rules and scoring<br/>
system) and kenjutsu (its relative/ancestor). So perhaps the<br/>
tournaments and kendo in general within the police dept. may have<br/>
served as a unifying element it&#39;s kind of like saying &quot;wherever you<br/>
guys are from you will now play by a new set of rules&quot; at least as far<br/>
as the tournament is concerned.  Like I said a closer examination of<br/>
the history of kendo itself is needed (sigh)<br/>
<br/>
*even by the time he participated in his first tournament he was no<br/>
longer just a cop on the beat...but already an assistant inspector [1877]<br/>
the tournament takes place in [1882] at least 5 years after getting<br/>
the position...so I&#39;m assuming somewhat respected in his dept.  I<br/>
think out of courtesy they wouldn&#39;t try to pry into his background if<br/>
he already held a respectable position in the dept....I&#39;m personally<br/>
surprised he didn&#39;t participate *more* or -not- at all<br/>

only has hirotaka suzuoki&#39;s voice work?...man I love his voice<br/>
<br/>
Warg3791 However, they also state that he didn&#39;t join the police force<br/>
right away. They<br/>
list the year he became a policeman as 1877. But we know he joined<br/>
sooner than<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
*yep, on the 3-hajime.com basic chronology 1877 is mentioned as the<br/>
first year connecting S.H. to the police [but] in other places of her<br/>
website such as the mystery of the 1st wife -1871- the webmaster<br/>
speculates this mystery woman may have had a hand in his affiliation<br/>
with the pol. dept. which pushes the policework timeline way back.  To<br/>
me S.H. may have had alot of side jobs and travelled which prevents<br/>
nosy historians from finding a definate paper trail<br/>
