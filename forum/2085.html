<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616226238"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is where I get confused. You say that Sadakichi<br/>
&gt; was Shusaku&#39;s <br/>
&gt; brother? But I saw one website that listed him as<br/>
&gt; his nephew. To make <br/>
&gt; matters even more confusing, Hillsborough states<br/>
&gt; that Sadakichi was <br/>
&gt; the master of one of the &quot;three greatest fencing<br/>
&gt; schools in Edo&quot; and <br/>
&gt; Ryoma was the &quot;head&quot; of this school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tama-san explained that better than I :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The problem is that if you look up these two,<br/>
&gt; Shusaku&#39;s Genbukan Dojo <br/>
&gt; is listed as one of the &quot;three greatest&quot; in Edo.<br/>
&gt; [The other two were <br/>
&gt; Shunzo Momonoi&#39;s Shigakukan Dojo (Kyoshin Meichi<br/>
&gt; Ryu) and Saito <br/>
&gt; Yakuro&#39;s Renpeikan Dojo (Shindo Munen Ryu).] <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s right. And sometimes, Iba dojo of<br/>
Shingyoto Ryu is also included in the list, making the<br/>
&quot;four greatest&quot; in Edo.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it&#39;s &quot;Shinto Munen&quot;, not &quot;Shindo Munen&quot; :)<br/>
Dang Japanese names :D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This<br/>
&gt; might fit since <br/>
&gt; Hillsborough calls the other two dojo by the names<br/>
&gt; of the <br/>
&gt; swordmasters rather than their official name. (He<br/>
&gt; calls <br/>
&gt; them &quot;Momonoi&quot; and &quot;Saito&quot; schools.) But then Ryoma,<br/>
&gt; to be &quot;head&quot; <br/>
&gt; of &quot;Chiba Dojo&quot; would have had to study under<br/>
&gt; Shusaku rather than <br/>
&gt; Sadakichi?! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. &quot;Chiba dojo&quot; could either mean Chiba Shusaku&#39;s and<br/>
Chiba Sadakichi&#39;s. Ryoma was the &quot;jukutou&quot;, the &quot;head<br/>
student&quot;, who represented the dojo, but the real<br/>
&quot;owner&quot; of the dojo, so to speak, was Chiba Sadakichi.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another curious thing, I note that on Serizawa&#39;s<br/>
&gt; site it is stated <br/>
&gt; that Yamanami studied at the Genbukan? So it becomes<br/>
&gt; more likely then <br/>
&gt; that Ryoma and Yamanami would have known each<br/>
&gt; other?! Even if it -was-<br/>
&gt;  another school, they would have met each others<br/>
&gt; students I would <br/>
&gt; assume?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Tama-san did put it, it is possible that they had<br/>
met, but not certain, unfortunately. The same goes<br/>
with Toudou Heisuke. Likewise, it is possible, but not<br/>
likely, that Nagakura met Serizawa before the<br/>
Shinsengumi and all.<br/>
<br/>
As for the chrysanthemum dolls that appeared in a<br/>
previous post, they are NOT from Bange, AFAIK. Bange<br/>
is a place next to Aizu Wakamatsu, but not famous by<br/>
its dolls. The &quot;kikuningyo&quot; is from Nihonmatsu and its<br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
