<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that's right. And sometimes, Iba dojo of<br/>
Shingyoto Ryu is also included in the list, making the<br/>
"four greatest" in Edo.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it's "Shinto Munen", not "Shindo Munen" :)<br/>
Dang Japanese names :D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. "Chiba dojo" could either mean Chiba Shusaku's and<br/>
Chiba Sadakichi's. Ryoma was the "jukutou", the "head<br/>
student", who represented the dojo, but the real<br/>
"owner" of the dojo, so to speak, was Chiba Sadakichi.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As Tama-san did put it, it is possible that they had<br/>
met, but not certain, unfortunately. The same goes<br/>
with Toudou Heisuke. Likewise, it is possible, but not<br/>
likely, that Nagakura met Serizawa before the<br/>
Shinsengumi and all.<br/>
<br/>
As for the chrysanthemum dolls that appeared in a<br/>
previous post, they are NOT from Bange, AFAIK. Bange<br/>
is a place next to Aizu Wakamatsu, but not famous by<br/>
its dolls. The "kikuningyo" is from Nihonmatsu and its<br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
