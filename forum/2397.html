<h3>ADMIN: For All Members Please Read (long)</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082814283">I'm sure we can all agree that no group can be all things to all<br/>
members all the time. This is especially for mailing list type groups<br/>
 devoted to specific areas. I belong and even own writing related<br/>
groups and many times there are topics and discussions I have no<br/>
interest in at that particular time so I pass over or ignore those<br/>
subjects.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would never think to tell the interested parties that "no one else<br/>
cares" or is "disgusted" by the off topic chatter and that they should<br/>
stop it because I don't like it. And yet that is what happened behind<br/>
the scenes here recently. "Many" anonymous members apparently too<br/>
timid to speak up allegedly contacted one member to be their<br/>
spokesperson and present their concerns---they wanted non Shinsengumi<br/>
specific discussion to stop.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This led to self imposed silence from some of our more active members<br/>
which was certainly not fair to them or to those of you who were<br/>
interested in some of the topics presented.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When one member came out of their reluctant lurkdom to participate<br/>
again they felt they were demeaned in a subsequent post, replied and<br/>
then were publicly belittled in return. As a result as list owner I<br/>
asked both parties to please cease and desist, one member apologized<br/>
on list  and the other. sent me a long scathing private email. As a<br/>
result I removed them as moderator and set their posts to be screened.<br/>
An attempt was made to spout all sort of false claims and accusations<br/>
publicly.  I will not approve that post for public viewing as it<br/>
serves no purpose other than to wreck havoc and destroy friendships. I<br/>
advise any of you who may be contacted off list with angry claims to<br/>
take it all with a grain of salt.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This list was and always will be a meeting place for Shinsengumi FANS.<br/>
We are all fans even if our tastes begin to lead us in other related<br/>
directions. ALL Bakumatsu/Meiji/Shinsengumi topics are WELCOMED HERE.  ALL MEMBERS are welcomed here.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Granted, all discussions will not be to everyone's liking but NO ONE<br/>
will be asked or expected to stop posting because everyone is not 100%<br/>
interested in that particular subject at that particular time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you don't like a topic then skip over or delete. I do.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now let's get back to SHARING fun and info!<br/>
