 </span></blockquote>I guess my favorite tale on Nagakura Shinpachi is that<br/>
incident he had with the local yakuza when he was<br/>
already a grandpa ^^<br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know the story, it goes like this:<br/>
it's said that once Nagakura and his little grandson<br/>
were strolling around to enjoy the weather and all.<br/>
Nagakura was quite old by then, walking with the help<br/>
of a walking stick and his back was already curved<br/>
thanks to his age.<br/>
<br/>
During the stroll, a bunch of local yakuza bumped on<br/>
Nagakura, who almost fell. The yakuza laughed a lot<br/>
but Nagakura was willing to let go. However, his<br/>
grandson got enraged and yelled "what do you think you<br/>
are doing to my grandpa?!" to the yakuza, who, in<br/>
their turn, got enraged and said in a menacing voice,<br/>
"who do you think you are, shrimp?!". The boy got<br/>
frightened and hid himself behind Nagakura. The<br/>
yakuzas said, "out of the way, old man, or else you<br/>
too will suffer the consequences!". Then, Nagakura<br/>
raised his eyebrow, tossed the walking stick away,<br/>
straightened up his back and, without saying anything,<br/>
glared in such a manner to the yakuza that they got<br/>
frightened and ran away. Then, Nagakura calmly got his<br/>
stick from the ground, curved his back again and he<br/>
resumed the stroll with his grandson.<br/>
<br/>
By far, this is my favorite story on Nagakura (though<br/>
there are many interesting stories about him) ^^ And<br/>
it reminds me of Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid :D<br/>

:-D  I *liked* that story!!  Got any more???<br/>
 <br/>
Doesn't this say something about chi/ki?<br/>
 <br/>
As always, I return to RK Saitou... can you just imagine the look in *HIS* eyes in such an encounter!  He'd probably paralyze them where they stood (kind of like Udou Jin'eh).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes S.K.!!! Thank you so much for that wonderful tale! It's so hilarious! Does that sort of remind anyone else of the famous scene in RK where Kenshin goes to rescue Yahiko and the Yakuza boss realizes he "has the eyes" of a REAL manslayer? I wonder if that's what those Yakuza creeps were thinking when Nagakura stared them down?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many of those Shinsengumi members thought directly after that "You know, fighting those Ishin dogs was less of a headache than this!" -grin-<br/>
