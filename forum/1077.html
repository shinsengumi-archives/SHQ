<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770767324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Based on Momoiro&#39;s post about Grampa Nagakura...<br/>
&gt; If you were grandson/daughter who would you choose<br/>
&gt; to spend your<br/>
&gt; Sundays with<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a) Grampa Nagakura Shinpachi...every now and then<br/>
&gt; during the movie<br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll ask you what the heck is going on in the plot<br/>
&gt; (his memory/vision<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t so good anymore)...its either the same movie<br/>
&gt; over and over<br/>
&gt; again or the same story about the Shinsengumi over<br/>
&gt; and over<br/>
&gt; again...you choose your own form of torture ^_^<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess my favorite tale on Nagakura Shinpachi is that<br/>
incident he had with the local yakuza when he was<br/>
already a grandpa ^^<br/>
<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know the story, it goes like this:<br/>
it&#39;s said that once Nagakura and his little grandson<br/>
were strolling around to enjoy the weather and all.<br/>
Nagakura was quite old by then, walking with the help<br/>
of a walking stick and his back was already curved<br/>
thanks to his age.<br/>
<br/>
During the stroll, a bunch of local yakuza bumped on<br/>
Nagakura, who almost fell. The yakuza laughed a lot<br/>
but Nagakura was willing to let go. However, his<br/>
grandson got enraged and yelled &quot;what do you think you<br/>
are doing to my grandpa?!&quot; to the yakuza, who, in<br/>
their turn, got enraged and said in a menacing voice,<br/>
&quot;who do you think you are, shrimp?!&quot;. The boy got<br/>
frightened and hid himself behind Nagakura. The<br/>
yakuzas said, &quot;out of the way, old man, or else you<br/>
too will suffer the consequences!&quot;. Then, Nagakura<br/>
raised his eyebrow, tossed the walking stick away,<br/>
straightened up his back and, without saying anything,<br/>
glared in such a manner to the yakuza that they got<br/>
frightened and ran away. Then, Nagakura calmly got his<br/>
stick from the ground, curved his back again and he<br/>
resumed the stroll with his grandson.<br/>
<br/>
By far, this is my favorite story on Nagakura (though<br/>
there are many interesting stories about him) ^^ And<br/>
it reminds me of Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid :D<br/>

:-D  I *liked* that story!!  Got any more???<br/>
 <br/>
Doesn&#39;t this say something about chi/ki?<br/>
 <br/>
As always, I return to RK Saitou... can you just imagine the look in *HIS* eyes in such an encounter!  He&#39;d probably paralyze them where they stood (kind of like Udou Jin&#39;eh).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes S.K.!!! Thank you so much for that wonderful tale! It&#39;s so hilarious! Does that sort of remind anyone else of the famous scene in RK where Kenshin goes to rescue Yahiko and the Yakuza boss realizes he &quot;has the eyes&quot; of a REAL manslayer? I wonder if that&#39;s what those Yakuza creeps were thinking when Nagakura stared them down?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many of those Shinsengumi members thought directly after that &quot;You know, fighting those Ishin dogs was less of a headache than this!&quot; -grin-<br/>
