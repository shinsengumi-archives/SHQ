Suzuki Mikisaburou<br/>
<br/>
Born in the Shizuki domain of Hitachi Province (modern-day Ibaraki <br/>
Prefecture, Niihari Ward, Chiyoda City). Born on Tenpo 8 (1837), July <br/>
12, the 2nd son of the Shizuki domain chief inspector Suzuki <br/>
Sen&#39;emon. His elder brother was Itou Kashitarou, whose original name <br/>
was Suzuki Ookura.<br/>
<br/>
His childhood name is rather obscureSuzuki Tamon (the kanji <br/>
for &quot;mon&quot; is misspelled, and is inconsistent with the rest of the <br/>
article). His older brother, while protecting the mansion (?), <br/>
changed his name to Settsu. Only after the Restoration did he change <br/>
his name from Miki Izumi to Suzuki Mikisaburou. He trained in Shintou <br/>
Munen Ryuu, but Itou Kashitarou (his older brother) had to force him <br/>
(?). He was better at quoting the Chinese classics (?).<br/>
<br/>
After their father took part in the Heimon Incident, the his family <br/>
name was abolished and he was exiled from his domain. Following this, <br/>
they went to Sakura mura (present Yasato ward), the village their <br/>
father&#39;s grandmother was from, and stayed in the house of Sakurai <br/>
Shirou Saemon.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, they were pardoned, but were not allowed to return to <br/>
the domain. So they established themselves at Takahama village, near <br/>
Todai bridge (modern Ishioka city). They opened a school of Chinese <br/>
studies called &quot;Shunjuku&quot; at Mitsui Temple.<br/>
<br/>
The father&#39;s fame spread rather quickly, and soon several students <br/>
from Sawayama joined, seeming to indicate that the family&#39;s fortunes <br/>
were headed in a good direction.<br/>
<br/>
In February 1852, the father died. After this, Okura (the older <br/>
brother) joined the Itou dojo, allowing Tamon to continue running the <br/>
school at Mitsui Temple.<br/>
<br/>
However, Tamon was able to finish his studies incredibly quickly, <br/>
writing &quot;A man should strive toward excellence in the martial arts&quot;, <br/>
and &quot;Kusunoki Tamonmaru&quot; (an allusion to the famous warrior Kusunoki  <br/>
Masashige?) on flags.<br/>
<br/>
Every day, he would tell stories of battles to the children and skip <br/>
teaching altogether. The children&#39;s parents found out, and they began <br/>
to pull their children out of the school one by one, and gradually <br/>
the school failed.<br/>
<br/>
After this, Terauchi Souzaemon of the Shizuki domain wanted to adopt <br/>
Tamon. Terauchi was 80 years old and had no wife or children. <br/>
Apparently his mother had suggested it to him. Terauchi&#39;s house was <br/>
on the site of the old Suzuki house, so his mother apparently wanted <br/>
him to adopt Tamon.<br/>
<br/>
After his adoption, Tamon was director of Yamabayashi. But, as he was <br/>
accustomed to drinking in Terauchi&#39;s house, he drank more and more <br/>
until he began to skip work. He was scolded, and in order to avoid a <br/>
scandal was kicked out of the house.<br/>
After this, he took the name Miki Arajirou, just to make the <br/>
separation final. But, since he couldn&#39;t kick the habit of drinking, <br/>
it came to the point where he was shirking his duty to the domain, <br/>
and he got in trouble. The lord spared Miki of being kicked out of <br/>
the domain, and gave him a small stipend.<br/>
Thinking of his brother in Edo, he started thinking of national <br/>
affairs. It came to the point where he was part of the Tenka Shishi <br/>
(proto-Ishin Shishi) for a time.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, Perry arrived, the Ansei Purge occurred, and the Sakurada <br/>
Gate and Sakashita Gate incidents occurred, one after the other after <br/>
the other. Miki came under suspicion in these days and feeling a <br/>
sense of danger left Edo with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
In Sakurada-shi in Sendai, they were about to head to Tamura at Taga-<br/>
gun in Hitachi, but they got the news that &quot;traveling deep into the <br/>
countryside is dangerous.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This being the case, he went to the home of Uno Kuratsukuri (wrong <br/>
reading of the kanji, I think). Miki Arajirou stayed at the Uno house <br/>
for several years, teaching literature and fencing. One day, when he <br/>
tried returning to his mother, his mother appeared from Edo quickly <br/>
and returned just as quickly, since the older brother was serving the <br/>
nation (government?).<br/>
<br/>
FIRST YEAR OF GENJI<br/>
<br/>
At age 28, Kashitarou assisted in leading the Tengu party (which <br/>
Serizawa was also in), in accordance with the advice of the ronin <br/>
Komatsu Kanni of the Kurume domain. But because Shizuki han is close <br/>
to Mt. Tsukuba (north of Edo), Okura (Kashitarou) was worried because <br/>
of the havoc they caused and how it would affect his home domain. <br/>
Around this time he found Arajirou in Shizuki han. Miki and Tsuchiura <br/>
ate at an inn in Shizuki han, where the Tengu party (Tanaka&#39;s <br/>
brigade?) happened to be present,  but had entered Shizuki without <br/>
permission. Miki tried to clear their presence in the domain, saying <br/>
that they had arrived there through the efforts of his uncle Kawamata <br/>
in Edo (?)<br/>
He was given a residence, and patrolled the domain with several <br/>
people and worked around the inner gates.<br/>
It worked for awhile, however, he escaped  the fall of the Tengu <br/>
party, making it back to Edo just in time.<br/>
When he arrived in Edo, his elder brother Itou Okura had been <br/>
accepted into the Shinsengumi by Toudou Heisuke. That same year, <br/>
Okura&#39;s disciples and the entire Itou dojo entered the Shinsengumi.<br/>
At this time, he changed his name to Itou Kashitarou, and his younger <br/>
brother became Mikisaburou.<br/>
Suzuki Mikisaburou was the captain of the ninth unit and involved in <br/>
kansatsu operations (observations/spying, like Yamazaki Susumu).<br/>
The Satsuma clan now followed/enlisted him as a double agent <br/>
(DEFINITELY not sure the kanji are vaguely familiar to me, and <br/>
Babelfish says &quot;prohibited reverse side&quot;).<br/>
After his older brother&#39;s assassination on November 18th, he started <br/>
thinking of ways to kill Kondou in revenge. On December 9th, he was <br/>
attacked on Kondou Street in Kyoto and injured.<br/>
He took part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and then joined the <br/>
Sekihoutai as 2nd unit captain. Shinsengumi revenge(can&#39;t understand <br/>
the rest of this sentence).<br/>
<br/>
In the Meiji era, he became the chief of police of Tsuruoka, and <br/>
contributed funds to the construction of a hospital. He retired to <br/>
his hometown in Ishioka, and lived to 1919, dying at age 83.</div>
