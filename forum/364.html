<h3>www.the-shinsengumi multimedia</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153201348">www.3-hajime.com has a link called<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-shinsengumi.com">http://www.the-shinsengumi.com</a><br/>
what makes this site soo different is that there are mini video<br/>
downloads. For example there is a clip of a Shinsengumi re-enactment<br/>
which to me looks like the one which occurred during a parade at Aizu.<br/>
There is a young female host (at one point attempts and Okita<br/>
impersonation) takes you on a tour of a museum (or location connected<br/>
to the Shinsengumi). Then in another clip she interview someone. All<br/>
files are for windows media player and my computer would only play the<br/>
first few seconds before "dying" so I haven't see the entire files.<br/>
<br/>
How do you find the link when babelfish cannot/will not translate this<br/>
page? Go to the sword and click on the link right in the middle of the<br/>
blade that should take you to the list of vids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you think of it maybe they meant Saitou was "being policed" and that <br/>
while he didn't commit any crimes per se he did something others found <br/>
"Bad enough to detain him for"--fighting for the losing side.<br/>
