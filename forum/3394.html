my attention. <br/>

This film is better known to fans as SHINSENGUMI: BAND OF ASSASINS or <br/>
just SHINSENGUMI (1969) starring Toshiro Mifune <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066372/)">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066372/)</a><br/>

--------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
For fans who have not seen this film yet, you may ask &quot;is this worth <br/>
my time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes and No.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see an interesting characterization of Serizawa Kamo <br/>
then yes.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to see what has got to be one of the worst <br/>
portrayals of Okita in cinema then stay far far away from this film.<br/>
<br/>
But like many Shinsengumi films this production has some kitsch, some <br/>
camp and excessive violence.<br/>
<br/>
[fun fact] Serizawa Kamo in this film is played by Rentaro Mikuni who <br/>
is the father of Koichi Sato who has played 2 members of the <br/>
Shinsengumi (1) Serizawa Kamo in the NHK &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; series and <br/>
(2) Saito Hajime in MIBUGISHIDEN</div>
