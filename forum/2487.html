<h3>Question Re: Unit Patch</h3>
by <i>michaelcarcana</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865396595">I'm having trouble getting to the photos section right now, but if I <br/>
remember correctly there was a photo of the uniform shoulder patch.  If <br/>
I also remember correctly, it was essentially the usual "makoto" ala <br/>
the Shinsengumi flag.  Does anyone know the dimensions of said patch?  <br/>
If so, what are they?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mike</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191682472">It is a tie on piece of cloth and the photo was originally scanned <br/>
from the Kyoto Museum Exhibition book on the Shinsengumi (all in <br/>
Japanese) ... I gave this book to someone ... we will have to double <br/>
check and see if the book mentions the dimensions (please give us some <br/>
time)<br/>
<br/>
If the photos section is not working properly please see the sleeve <br/>
insignias here<br/>

<br/>
I have seen cosplayers make their own imitations however they add more <br/>
onto the design such as a line on the bottom...since this photo is <br/>
from a prestigious museum very likely it is a totally real article (as <br/>
is the case with the other artifacts)<br/>
