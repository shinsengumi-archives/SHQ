<h3>SHQ.com Updates + Film Review</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-889204578">New RK Saitou Fanart at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> from artist AI <br/>
(outstanding!)<br/>
<br/>
I give a very brief review for Okita Soji (1974) there are different <br/>
versions of the title due to the spelling---it is the one starring <br/>
KUSAKARI MASAO who looked perfect for the role<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
this film -may- be discussed at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ninjadojo.com">http://www.ninjadojo.com</a> in <br/>
September or later. Ninjadojo is a very active community.<br/>
<br/>
As you may know there is more than one Dai-bosatsu Toge (based on <br/>
the novel of the same name) the most popular and easy to find is the <br/>
one starring Tatsuya Nakadai directed by Kihachi Okamoto...the other <br/>
version is called Satan's Sword directed by Kenji Misumi, which <br/>
sticks to the novel more which means it will cover more ground <br/>
during the Shinsengumi "arc".  Satan's Sword is in the process of <br/>
being re-subbed right now and will be sold unofficially.<br/>
<br/>
for our new members the novel (which is SUPER hard to find in <br/>
English) can be downloaded <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Dai-bosatsu%20Toge/DBT.zip">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Dai-bosatsu%20Toge/DBT.zip</a><br/>
6mb<br/>
even if you don't have time to read it -now- just please download <br/>
while I can still host the file---when the novel discusses Shimabara <br/>
the author kind of goes off on a tangent but he does provide some <br/>
valuable info<br/>
------------------<br/>
Off-topic<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kurotokagi.com/">http://www.kurotokagi.com/</a>  (also offers ASSASSINATION--on Kiyokawa <br/>
Hachiro)<br/>
is selling a film called BURAIKEN (about a bunch of misfits in a <br/>
kabuki troupe) which is not only rare but one of the most <br/>
extensively discussed films by western critics<br/>
I have never purchased a film from kurotokagi--but I will probably <br/>
do so just because they offer BURAIKEN</div>

Shogun's Most Dreaded Samurai Corps: The Bloody Legacy Of The <br/>
Shinsengumi (Hardcover)<br/>
by Romulus Hillsborough<br/>
someone went to a bookstore to inquire about the status of this book <br/>
and was told that Tuttle Publishing "dropped" this book---which <br/>
doesn't mean that it well never ever be published but simply this <br/>
company won't do it---there goes our solitary beacon of historical <br/>
info on the Shinsengumi in *ENGLISH*<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
Very cool 7 page article <br/>
"Lost in History: Aizu and the Meiji Restoration"<br/>
https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/LostInHistoryAizu.pdf<br/>
please pay really close attention to pages 6-7<br/>
MANY texts especially those written in the first half of the 20th <br/>
century emphasize how *peaceful* the Restoration/1868 was<br/>
similarly, the special enthronement book of Emperor Hirohito 1928 did <br/>
not place any emphasis on 1868 (it was simply the Tokugawa Shogunate <br/>
and Meiji Era)---when one reads the section on Kyoto's history there <br/>
is no mention of any "conflict" at all<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
Thank you Hirotada Tokugawa for finding this page<br/>
http://homepage3.nifty.com/naitouhougyoku/sub14.htm<br/>
<br/>
TRANSLATION by a volunteer<br/>
http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/YHFGtranslation.htm<br/>
Contains....<br/>
*Hijikata Toshizo<br/>
*Yamakawa Hiroshi & Sagawa Kanbei both matchmakers for Fujita Goro and <br/>
Tokio<br/>
<br/>
PROBLEM I think my volunteer, who is a law student may be way too busy <br/>
to translate 2 of the most critical parts of this page<br/>
1) Yamakawa Hiroshi's comment on the BYAKKOTAI<br/>
2) Fujita Goro "talking" at Yamakawa Hiroshi's mansion in the Meiji Era<br/>
<br/>
of side interest the page also contains Yamakawa Hiroshi's encounter <br/>
with a Tosa samurai sporting one of those special really really long <br/>
swords<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to volunteer and translate please go ahead---it is <br/>
only a total of 4-6 lines<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16051736">I just got a message the other day (the 3rd so far) saying that the <br/>
delivery date had been moved to the end of August.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this happened with one of his other books too.<br/>

Sigh.....oh well, it is not as though I do not have a pile of other <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623666505">Has anybody read this man's other books? I somehow have misgivings if this <br/>
book is being postponed so much...after all, we did hear that he "changed" <br/>
certain things not too long ago, right? (Ninja Dojo board, I think, was the <br/>
place where that bit of news was divulged)<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately the man's not a trained historian, so I question the authority <br/>
and "formality" of this work...and as for trained historians? I question <br/>
*their* work even more.<br/>

<h3>Re: The Hillsborough Book</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-516141565">It's just a bit frustrating, I have been waiting for this book since <br/>
the first half of last year. I wanted to give it as a gift to <br/>
someone to a few months ago but alas the January release never came <br/>
and my pre-order on Amazon... Well at least it is on pre-order or <br/>
does that mean nothing at all? ^^;;<br/>
<br/>
I think it's been discussed a long time ago in this list about how <br/>
the book might be ridden with innacuracies and or generalities <br/>
because Hillsborough was not really an "authority" and because he <br/>
did a speech and made mistakes? I don't remember which thread it was <br/>
since it's been almost a year... But all I can say is if this book <br/>
ever gets released I'd still buy it since it is in English and I do <br/>
like the feel of a book in my hands. Although I think SHQ research <br/>
is probably more thorough on certain subjects... <br/>
