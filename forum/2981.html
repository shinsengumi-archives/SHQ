<h3>Kyu Bakufu and the first wave of Shinsengumi & Bakumatsu Information</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>

<br/>
Kyu Bakufu is a truly unique achievment in the realm of the<br/>
historiographical rehabilitation of not only the Edo Period, but the<br/>
Tokugawa Shogunate itself. Written by the very men who had formed its<br/>
ranks, the magazine was first published in 1898, and featured in its<br/>
editorial staff such famous names as Enomoto Takeaki, Katsu Kaishu,<br/>
Otori Keisuke, Ogasawara Naganari, and Inoue Masanao. Every square<br/>
inch of this magazine is filled to the brim with facts, numbers,<br/>
dates, photographs, calligraphy, paintings, commentary, memoirs, and<br/>
more. Now largely ignored, it sits on the shelves of major Asian<br/>
Studies research libraries around the world, waiting to be rediscovered.<br/>
<br/>
Q. You mentioned Enomoto, Katsu Kaishu and Otori Keisuke.<br/>
Can you please explain the significance of those three men and any<br/>
possible connections to the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
Certainly. Enomoto Takeaki (1836-1908) was a senior officer in the<br/>
Shogun's navy, as was Katsu Kaishu (1823-1899). Otori Keisuke<br/>
(1833-1911) was an Infantry Magistrate in the Shogunate Army. All<br/>
three were members of the new nobility during the Meiji era, and all<br/>
of them, despite their background in the Shogunate, held high<br/>
positions in the Meiji government. Later on in life they wrote at<br/>
length on their experiences in the decades leading up to the<br/>
Restoration; some of these writings appear in "Kyu Bakufu"<br/>
<br/>
As for connections to the Shinsengumi, these men are directly<br/>
connected to them, on a face-to-face basis. Otori Keisuke fought<br/>
alongside Hijikata, from Edo, to Utsunomiya, to Aizu, all the way<br/>
north to Hakodate. Enomoto was the one who carried Otori and Hijikata<br/>
and many others by sea to Hakodate, where they set up the Ezo<br/>
Republic. Enomoto became president, Otori was Army Minister, and<br/>
Hijikata was Vice-Army Minister. Katsu Kaishu was associated with<br/>
Shinsengumi during its time in Edo immediately after the Battle of<br/>
Toba-Fushimi (late January 1868 by the western calendar). Katsu Kaishu<br/>
was the one who dispatched Shinsengumi, then renamed Koyochinbutai, to<br/>
Kai Province, to take posession of Kofu Castle, which was in theory to<br/>
become the seat of a 100,000 koku domain ruled by Kondou Isami.<br/>
<br/>
Q. Are there biographies in this work? Anything of interest to us<br/>
Shinsengumi fans?<br/>
<br/>
"Kyu Bakufu" has biographies or biographical notes in every single<br/>
issue. Of note to Shinsengumi fans is "Kondou Isami-den," quite<br/>
possibly the first biography of Kondou Isami which did not depict him<br/>
as a criminal. The biography of Kumoi Tatsuo, Nagakura Shinpachi's<br/>
acquaintance from Yonezawa, is also worthy of note. The biography of<br/>
Nagai Naoyuki, a Shogunate official in constant contact with<br/>
Shinsengumi from their very inception, is also present, as is<br/>
extensive data on the Aizu domain, Shinsengumi's supervisors and<br/>
Shogunate-approved patrons.<br/>
<br/>
Q. Which members of the Shinsengumi were still alive to read this<br/>
magazine?<br/>
<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, Saitou Hajime, Nagakura Shinpachi, Takagi<br/>
Teisaku, Yamawaki Hayatarou, Hieda Rihachi, and Abe Jurou were still<br/>
alive in 1898, as well as others whose names I either don't know or<br/>
can't recall.<br/>
<br/>
Q. Do you know the cost of the magazine (per issue) and perhaps how it<br/>
was established given the pervasive bias against many who were on the<br/>
"wrong side" of the civil war in 1868?<br/>
<br/>
While I don't know what the cost per issue was, I can tell that<br/>
without Enomoto Takeaki and Katsu Kaishu's assistance, it never would<br/>
have existed. These men, being in high positions in the Meiji<br/>
Government, had established the fact that they were men of importance<br/>
and loyalty, and so for them to patronize this magazine effectively<br/>
was what brought it into being.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing this text. Although we do not yet know details<br/>
like the people who actually contributed financially to the<br/>
establishment of the magazine we must assume that having it published<br/>
would be difficult. Perhaps most telling is -if- the list of<br/>
acknowledged supporters who were less politically powerful than the<br/>
men you mentioned does not exist.<br/>
I asked about the cost as a way of exploring the possible readership<br/>
demographics. If the magazine was very expensive, I'm sure the<br/>
circulation would have been very low. Even the location of its<br/>
publication (perhaps Tokyo) would be interesting to note.<br/>
<br/>
Just as in the present, fictional portrayals of the Shinsengumi were<br/>
more popular. The year 1898 was several years before the epic<br/>
DAIBOSATSU-TOGE <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/DBT.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/DBT.htm</a> was published.<br/>
That was the first truly public and modern method of introducing the<br/>
Shinsengumi in novel form during the late Meiji Era. The novel would<br/>
have easily overshadowed this first formal attempt of recording<br/>
Shinsengumi history.<br/>
