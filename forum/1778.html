<h3>the takagis</h3>
by <i>otakuvidel</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-751440731">I posted this on LJ and got absolutely no response, much like my other two <br/>
posts there, so perhaps someone here could help me? What I'm looking for is <br/>
reliable information on the Takagi family. Anything you've got, I'd like to hear. <br/>
Names (I've seen inconsistent information on just Tokio's brother's name for <br/>
crying out loud), dates, importance, etc, etc. Please. With sugar on top. Thank <br/>
you.<br/>
