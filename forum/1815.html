<h3>Aizawa Theses in PDF</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141514873">Heh... I found a site where some of the New Theses are available to the curious.<br/>

 <br/>
The Prefatory Remarks, the third part of the the First Thesis (What is Essential to a Nation (Kokutai) III), Third Thesis (The Barbarians' Nature), and Fourth Thesis (National Defense) as published in Wakabayashi's book are available in PDF format.<br/>
 <br/>
And imagine my initial shock when in looking for information on Aizawa, I began running into Fujita TOKO.  Of course, it's late at night and my eyes saw "Tokio" and I clicked on the link (which promised "letters from") and up came an original document.  Excitement was short-lived when I saw my mistake.  Shoot... ;-D  Fujita is another Mito scholar, contemporary of Aizawa (and someone else to investigate).<br/>
