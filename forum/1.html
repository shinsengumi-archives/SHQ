<h3>Youkoso!</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-475025882">Youkoso, minna-sama! On behalf of everyone on the Miburo list, I would<br/>
like to welcome all Miburo veterans and new members to SHQ! Though<br/>
"our" guys may have departed from this world in a blaze of glory, they<br/>
have been condemned to relative ignominy. It would seem, however, that<br/>
the Japanese public is rediscovering their value, and we who are<br/>
outside of Japan have learned of their reknown. This group will, among<br/>
other things, help to further the knowledge of the Shinsengumi in the<br/>
world. Although, as the description indicated, we also enjoy simply<br/>
being Shinsengumi otaku...^_^<br/>
<br/>
--Shimazu Masayoshi<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Irony of ironies, huh? A Shimazu in a Shinsengumi group...but<br/>
we'll leave that for the historical details that'll be posted soon.</div>

Actually, I think that if I'm the second post and Barb is Kondou, then I'm <br/>
Okita and you're Shinpachi.... <br/>
So I'm both Okita and Saito?! O.o" I have my work cut out for me!!!<br/>
