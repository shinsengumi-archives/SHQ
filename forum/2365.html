<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265144661">I was looking up info. about Ryoma Sakamoto and came across another perosn that is mentioned with him (maybe only because the two were assassinated together).   A Nakaoka Shintaro, but I can't seem to find any information about Shintaro.   Can anyone tell me anything about this man?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71705369">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I don't have much info on him yet because I have yet to finish reading that <br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma book. I can tell you a little bit about him up until about <br/>
autumn of 1863... (Please note that the book does make mistakes, so some of this <br/>
could possibly be wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
-Called "Shinta" by his friends.<br/>
-1st son of a powerful village headman in the mountainous district of Aki. His<br/>
 family had been rewarded with the right to wear two swords and have a <br/>
surname years before.<br/>
-He was one of the leading disciples of Takechi Hanpeita. (commonly referred <br/>
to as Zuizan). This is how he orginally knew Ryoma, who had started out as <br/>
Takechi's right-hand man in his Tosa Loyalists Party.<br/>
-Began his formal education early in childhood under a Buddhist priest.<br/>
-Later studied under a doctor of Chinese medicine and taught at this man's <br/>
academy at age 14.<br/>
-Then moved to Kochi and entered Takechi's dojo. At age 20 he was studying <br/>
literature, philosophy, and fencing under "Master Zuizan".<br/>
-By the end of August, 1863 he realized that it was no longer safe for <br/>
Loyalists in Tosa. He urged Takechi to get their men out of the han, but the other <br/>
refused to believe that Lord Yamanouchi Yodo was not on their side. Nakaoka <br/>
then made up an excuse that he wanted to see what the situation in Choshu was and <br/>
left the han. (Choshu had just that month been driven out of the Imperial <br/>
court by the Satsuma-Aizu alliance.)<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure how he hooked back up with Ryoma later on. Again, I have yet to <br/>
read that far. It was fairly well known though that Ryoma was working at the <br/>
Kobe Naval Academy under Katsu Kaishu however. I do know that they worked very <br/>
closely together on several schemes later on and he was indeed assassinated <br/>
with Ryoma. He lingered for two days and was able to give some account of what <br/>
happened that night, but did not know the identity of the men who had attacked <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the Shinsengumi were blamed for the murders and Kondo was later <br/>
executed for this crime. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A word about who Takechi was - He ran a dojo in Kochi, taught Japanese and <br/>
Chinese history and philosphy with an emphasis on Confucianism, and was the <br/>
leader of the Tosa Loyalist Party. He was also a good friend of Ryoma's. In fact <br/>
he was the one who introduced him to Katsura and Takasugi of Choshu clan. But <br/>
Ryoma had a very unique way of thinking for a man of his era and this caused <br/>
him to eventually abandon Tosa han. He and Takechi never really saw eye to eye <br/>
after that.<br/>
<br/>
Takechi went on to have han regent Yoshida Toyo murdered. At this time the <br/>
proper lord, Yamanouchi Yodo, was still under housearrest from the Ansei Purge <br/>
of Ii Naosuke, so this was the official running things in Tosa. Through <br/>
manipulating the replacement officials he became almost the defacto leader of the <br/>
han. Later when the clan was in Kyoto he ordered a great many of the <br/>
assassinations (often carried out by the infamous hitokiri Okada Izo) that had the Bakufu <br/>
so terrified that they eventually called up a group of ronin from Edo to deal <br/>
with the problem...<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for Takechi, Yamanouchi eventually took back control of his han <br/>
in April, 1863 and ordered everyone back to Tosa. Once the Bakufu was in <br/>
charge at the Imperial Court again he began hunting down those he felt was <br/>
responsible for the death of Regent Yoshida. Despite numerous warnings Takechi <br/>
refused to believe that Yamanouchi was not a Loyalist at heart and remained in the <br/>
han, confident that the murder could not be traced back to him or his men. He <br/>
was arrested in September of 1863. Again, I have yet to read that far into the <br/>
book,  but I believe he was executed not too long after this.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823979">Thank you so very beyond much Miss B.   This is indeed a ton more then I've been able to find on the internet.   Now I have to get my lil paws on that book to see what else I can get out of it...<br/>
 <br/>
Ya, anyways, as far as the Mimawarigumi, I don't believe that there has been any discription of a unifrom (if any at all).   The best thing you could probably do is make them wear a the same color hakama and/or gii.   The gii would probably have a distinctive pattern on it (common, but distinctive).   Mmm... thats the best thing you can do ^^;;;;<br/>
