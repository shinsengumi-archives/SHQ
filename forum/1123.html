<h3>NHK characterization</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-242885720">Ever since I saw my first episode of the NHK Shinsengumi drama I felt <br/>
that a lot of it was very true to life especially the way the characters <br/>
are portrayed.  Well, Tama told me that the scriptwriter Koki Mitani <br/>
gave the actors historical information on their characters.<br/>
<br/>
*pokes Miss Behavin*  I _told_ you your man Hijikata was a skirt <br/>
chasing  playboy. LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kondou is shown as a pretty good guy but he really hasn&#39;t had a &quot;taste <br/>
of power&quot; yet. but in these past episodes (it&#39;s #24 this week, I <br/>
believe) you can see that he&#39;s not happy taking a back seat to the pushy <br/>
Serizawa....So I&#39;m sure in time he&#39;ll show that pushy side Nagakura and <br/>
the others objected to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230016968">Even though many folks complain about the &quot;historical&quot; <br/>
innaccuracies...what the viewers ~can~ enjoy are the <br/>
characterizations...(sigh) I&#39;m glad we got a bit of Koichi Sato&#39;s <br/>
interview posted at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> but I [must] know <br/>
what Jo thinks of his character ^_^...they are lucky to get these <br/>
parts and I would think that each actor would put in some time doing <br/>
just a little bit of independent reading/research...wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>
awesome if one of them stumbled onto our messageboard/site...at <br/>
least they can make out the word f-u-n-d-o-s-h-i...<br/>
I think that Kondou&#39;s portrayal in NHK is for the <br/>
writer&#39;s &quot;investment&quot; in the audience inevitably being brought to <br/>
tears when Kondou gets executed...and about hist. Kondou vs. NHK <br/>
Kondou...we are all studying human beings so we can&#39;t expect them to <br/>
be perfect ^_^<br/>
<br/>
***according to the ladies at 3-hajime.com there was an amusing <br/>
scene where Saitou and Shimada charge at a riceball offered at the <br/>
Yagi residence or something along those lines...is this true <br/>
Barbara?  I guess being perpetually hungry is the lot of ronin LOL!  <br/>
When I get more of the series...I am going to have to see this in <br/>
slow motion ^_^...in the case of Saitou it should be like fighting <br/>
over the last bottle of sake<br/>

Harada and Shimada.(in the episode from last Sunday) definitely dove at <br/>
the food. Those guys together near food are scary!! LOL<br/>

For anyone whose seen at least the first couple episodes you will recall <br/>
what a dweeb Todo Heisuke is--well when he wasn&#39;t looking Harada reached <br/>
over and stole his riceball right out of his hand!!  To make matters <br/>
worse when Okita later spurns the food young Miss Hide saved for him <br/>
Shimada snags that and there&#39;s poor Heisuke with that lok on his face of <br/>

who stand up and charge at her are Saito and Shimada.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t notice it at the first view, and couldn&#39;t believe after reading <br/>
the blog of a friend which mentions about it, because it wasn&#39;t Saito&#39;s a <br/>
ttitude for me, I watched the tape again...And I saw Saito doing it.(laugh)<br/>
Even Nagakura go straight toward Hide&#39;s riceballs and no one seems to be <br/>
interested in Mrs.Yagi&#39;s.<br/>

something of a mob scene. I guess I was too busy waiting for Harada to <br/>
show off his underwear again. I wish our vcr was working right. so I <br/>
could rewatch it.<br/>
