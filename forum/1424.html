<h3>Possibly new photo?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-175022912">Ok,this is not confirmed info at all, but I think putting this one could <br/>
rouse interest of many people here.<br/>
<br/>
I found this info in a Shinsengumi related journal page of the person who <br/>
attended &quot;Souji Ki&quot;( Commemorative ceremony of Okita Souji&#39;s) of this year( the <br/>
20th June).<br/>

<br/>
The author says that this ceremony was followed by a lecture about <br/>
Shinsengumi, given by a well known specialist. (who discovered Kai Shimada&#39;s journal)<br/>
Just before the lecture, there was introduction of some direct descendants of <br/>
Shinsengumi related person attending the ceremony and the lecture, like <br/>
posterity of Mitsu Okita, Hajime Saito, and Takeaki Enomoto.<br/>
At this time, Mr,Fujita( Goro Fujita&#39;s descendant indeed) said, &quot;I found a <br/>
photo of Hajime, and I&#39;ve given a copy of it to Shinjinbutsu Ourai Publisher( <br/>
famous publisher of many Shinsengumi books and organizer of the ceremony).&quot;<br/>
Appearently, Mr.Fujita didn&#39;t give detailed info any more, however the author <br/>
of the journal wondering if it meant a new photo of Hajime Saitou, other than <br/>
that unique photo of him ever known. <br/>
<br/>
Does it mean we could see an unknown photo of Saito soon?<br/>
We can wait for the sequel.<br/>

this photo--and soon--we must scrimp and save and dig deep into the<br/>
furniture cushions to send a delegate (preferably one of our manly sword<br/>
wielding members there to &quot;convince&quot; them to do so! LOL<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Imagine....a nice clear photo of our man Hajime in his TMPD<br/>
uniform would e ever so nice...or maybe a nice formal family pose in a<br/>
western suit...maybe there was another portrait taken with their son<br/>
when Tokio had hers done....<br/>
<br/>
Tama please keep us posted--- maybe you will find out more when you go home.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seeing the information from Tama san, momoiro carried out such a <br/>
misapprehension. <br/>
&quot;At last, does the Metropolitan Police Department exhibit secret <br/>
data?&quot; <br/>
.......It was different though it was regrettable. <br/>
<br/>
But this seems to be large discovery. <br/>
According to the information of the person who participated in this <br/>
lecture meeting, it is the photograph of the Fujita Gorou&#39;s second <br/>
son&#39;s marriage ceremony. <br/>
Since marriage of Fujita Gorou&#39;s second son (Tsuyoshi) is Taisho 3 <br/>
(1914), Fujita Gorou is 71 years old. <br/>
Probably, I think that he will be the old man of sharp eyes. <br/>
<br/>
Although some Fujita Gorou&#39;s photographs existed, they have burned <br/>
with the earthquake disaster etc. <br/>
It seems that the Metropolitan Police Department has his photograph <br/>
according to the rumor. However, it is a state secret and, generally <br/>
is not exhibited. <br/>
(There is the rumor. There is an opinion that he is related to <br/>
establishment of the public security division. Although the <br/>
Metropolitan Police Department has his detailed curriculum vitae, it <br/>
does not open to the public.)<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the misapprehension of momoirom in the information from <br/>
Tama san. ^^;;;<br/>
Since it had written that the posterity of Enomoto Takeaki came to <br/>
the lecture meeting, I thought that Ishiguro Ken (The actor who is <br/>
performing Katsura Kogorou in the Taiga drama) came. <br/>
In practice, he is someone else. (momoiro no obakasan.)<br/>
The actor who is performing Katsura Kogorou in the Taiga drama is <br/>
Enomoto Takeaki&#39;s posterity. It is said that his mother&#39;s ancestor <br/>
is Enomoto Takeaki. When the cast of &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; was decided, it <br/>
became news slightly among fans. <br/>

I am just confused as to why Fujita Gorou&#39;s photographs are top <br/>

come out in the open and it has been around 100 years, I do not see <br/>

I understand that it is just rumor and not confirmed fact.<br/>
Perhaps Public Security Division [originated] in 19th century Japan<br/>
and the division continued to change over time to meet the new needs<br/>
of the country.  Maybe after WW2 during the occupation the division<br/>
had to redefine itself so that it could continue to exist.<br/>

Public Security Division perhaps *transformed* into Public Security<br/>

<br/>
I also think that this talk is strange.^^;; <br/>
I think that this rumor is believed by people since there are many <br/>
mysteries about Saitou. <br/>

It seems that however, there was the same organization as it from <br/>
Kawaji Toshinaga time, and main members did not change also after <br/>
dissolving by GHQ. <br/>
(Probably, it will be better not to say unnecessary things, since I <br/>
am ignorant about this.) <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, although this is that even many Japanese have mistaken, <br/>
Kawaji&#39;s first name is not &quot;Toshiyosi&quot; but &quot;Toshinaga&quot;.<br/>
I also got to know just recently.^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
Saitou&#39;s posterity believed that his art-of-fencing style was Ittou-<br/>
ryuu. <br/>
However, Akama Shizuko sensei who is  Saitou Hajime&#39;s researcher <br/>
announced that his style was Mugai-ryuu.<br/>
She said that she found it from the data of the police. <br/>
Probably, I think that there is a rumor from the episode.<br/>
<br/>
There is a strange talk about Saitou&#39;s sword style. <br/>
Nagakura was teaching the art of fencing to one time which became <br/>
Meiji Era in the Tennenrishin-ryuu exercise hall which Kondou&#39;s <br/>
nephew inherited.<br/>
The student of the exercise hall has questioned Nagakura about <br/>
Saitou&#39;s style. <br/>
Nagakura&#39;s answer.<br/>
&quot;Since I and Saitou-kun seldom talked, I do not know it.&quot;<br/>
Though association of Nagakura and Saitou is only the Shinsengumi <br/>
age, it is for five years. <br/>
Didn&#39;t Nagakura care about a strong swordsman&#39;s sword style like <br/>
himself? ^-^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778089954">We always love to talk about Saitou&#39;s sword style...<br/>
I think that Nagakura did wonder of Saitou&#39;s sword style but perhaps <br/>
Saitou never answered &quot;clearly&quot; ^_^<br/>
Thank you for informing us that the name is Toshinaga...all books in <br/>
English follow the Japanese incorrect example Toshiyoshi...<br/>
<br/>
I believe that many government organizations change names and labels <br/>
all countries since ancient times have similar ideas on <br/>
security...so I believe that during Toshinaga&#39;s time indeed Public <br/>
Security Division slowly became PSIA 100 years later.<br/>

(I will not include the info in my write up...I&#39;ll just concentrate <br/>
on the more concrete stuff, concerning inspectors and working with <br/>
the royal family, since Fujita Goro&#39;s possible connection to the <br/>
Public Security Division is a rumor)<br/>
<br/>
I have found references to the Public Security Division in the 19th <br/>
century but there role is never ever defined clearly...usually it <br/>
appears on organizational trees as a subsection of some other <br/>
division...<br/>
<br/>
The most clear definition of the PSD comes from Ralph Rinalducci&#39;s <br/>
THE JAPANESE POLICE ESTABLISHMENT Tokyo: Obun Intereurope limited, <br/>
1972.<br/>
<br/>
*very BORING book but gives details about the Imperial Guard the <br/>
structure of the IMperial Guard in modern times emulates the Meiji <br/>
structure<br/>
<br/>
Again this book comes out of the 70s when many scholars flocked to <br/>
Japan to study the police system <br/>
<br/>
I need to point out again that after the OCCUPATION the system <br/>
became &quot;recentralized&quot; and emulated the Meiji/Taisho model a couple <br/>
of labels changed but many things stayed the same<br/>
<br/>
excerpt from &quot;Police Law Enforcment Regulations&quot; proclaimed 1954 and <br/>
revised continuously to this day ofcrouse<br/>
<br/>
Article 38-4 the PUBLIC SAFETY section shall administer the following <br/>
duties 1 crime prevention, 2 public safety police 3 guarding and <br/>
patrolling 4 security in congested areas 5 traffic police<br/>
<br/>
***directly under the Public SAfety category is the Public Security <br/>
Division and Foreign Affairs section (omitted)***<br/>
<br/>
Article 38.6 The PUBLIC SECURITY DIVISION shall administer the <br/>
following affairs 1. security police (excluding cases involving <br/>
foreigners) 2 enforcement of security measures, excluding the <br/>
guarding of congested places 3 compilation of plans to cope with <br/>
emergencies and their execution to meet any contingency 4 affairs <br/>
other than those mentioned in the preceding items, not under the <br/>
jurisdiction of other sections<br/>
<br/>
*so I guess the PSD is defined by saying that it does things other <br/>
sections do not handle....nice and clear (^_^)</div>
