<div id="ygrps-yiv-625502701">Hello Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Hope the Subject didn’t scare you ^_^ I just wanted to get everyone’s <br/>
attention and give a big official list owner WELCOME to all the folks <br/>
who’ve joined us recently. I didn’t realize how many new members we had <br/>
until I took a glance at the members section on the yahoogroups page.<br/>
<br/>
You guys have been awfully quiet so I think it would be super if we went <br/>
through a little bit of an intro/re-intro period. So here are a couple <br/>
questions I hope you’ll all take a moment to answer (even you “Old <br/>
timers” from the late lamented Miburo list0<br/>
<br/>
1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you would like us to <br/>
know about you)<br/>
<br/>
2) How did you “discover” the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>
think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>
particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
<br/>
Your ever-loving list&quot;mom&quot;<br/>

I am a graduate student with a special focus on Thailand, because I am<br/>
fully bilingual (English is my first language but with all the typos<br/>
you can never tell)...I study almost every aspect of the kingdom<br/>
<br/>
I am sadly, the originator of our old &quot;fundoshi&quot; joke due to<br/>
babelfish&#39;s translation of Fujita Goro washing his &quot;lower headband&quot;<br/>
everyday.  Serizawa Kamo<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html)">http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html)</a>, a member of<br/>
our list pointed out that the word was not &quot;headband&quot; but in fact<br/>
underwear.  Due to this error we have developed a fascination with<br/>
fundoshi and its fashion possibilities here in the west...read my idea<br/>
here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/demonscircular/4427.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/demonscircular/4427.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I am also deeply interested in studying law enforcement...a little<br/>
from the Tokugawa but mostly during the Meiji era and a little of the<br/>
modern police.  I have side interests in things related to Aizu, the<br/>
Joushitai especially.  I&#39;ve always loved persimmons I&#39;m so happy there<br/>
are persimmons in Aizu...should I ever visit Aizu I&#39;ll be eating<br/>
dozens upon dozens of this fruit.  My dream is to visit various<br/>
Shinsengumi related locations, Aomori included, and experience the<br/>
locations during the exact day/time variuos events occurred.  I would<br/>
even want to camp out at Buddha Hall and walk around the castle at<br/>
various times of the day.  AND walk the Kyoto patrol route during the<br/>
hours the Shinsengumi worked.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rurouni Kenshin...I fell in love with Saitou&#39;s voice, BODY, his way of<br/>
life and how he slipped his most deepest secret....the existence of<br/>
TOKIO ::gasp::<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve loved Saitou since the late 1990s and revived my interest in<br/>
2003 at the now gone saitou-hajime.com before coming here<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Saitou Hajime, Nakajima Nobori, Yamazaki Susumu, Shimada Kai and<br/>
Habutae Miki.  Saitou is a very complex man with *issues* and<br/>
ultimately I believe he tried his best in every role he assumed or<br/>
ordered to perform.  To top it off...he married a woman of Aizu.  I<br/>
think that he stayed in Aizu for more reasons than just blind loyalty<br/>
(or the widely accepted theory that he was their spy)...there is more<br/>
to the story.  I think Saitou had a reserve of not only physical<br/>
strength as a warrior but mental strength as well from the description<br/>
of his death.<br/>
<br/>
Nakajima Nobori similarly was a man of many talents and his decision<br/>
to join the Shinsengumi affected his family life.  The love and skill<br/>
poured into the production of his paintings is his expression of<br/>
sincerity towards comrades he lost.  Yamazaki Susumu like some members<br/>
of the Shinsengumi had other options besides joining a police<br/>
troop---but he obviously put his skills to good use.  The information<br/>
gathering arm in the shinsengumi is most complex and sadly reduced to<br/>
simple cross dressing and ninja stereotypes.  <br/>
<br/>
Shimada Kai is to me loveable...his wife was lucky he COULDn&#39;T DRINK<br/>
even if he wanted to!  I want to learn more about everyone but until<br/>
we get a translation company together to publish these books we&#39;ll<br/>
never have access to details.<br/>
<br/>
I do love Hijikata Toshizo however my interest is very superficial (I<br/>
saw the picture ---end of story) I can&#39;t think of him beyond his good<br/>
looks.<br/>
<br/>
Miki, was a good man caught up in circumstances beyond his control. He<br/>
also had a charitable side and prayed for the men who murdered his<br/>
brother, yes he tried to exact revenge (which was a ok under the<br/>
circumstance) ....simply he had more strength than we can even gauge.<br/>
Miki is the butt of our jokes and even his guardian fangirl<br/>
accidentally be-littles him...quote from PHIL....(^_^)<br/>
(Suzuki may have been sent to the Tokaido, the eastern road connecting<br/>
Edo and<br/>
Kyoto... not sure about that yet... no big deal since his Second<br/>
Patrol was disbanded two weeks after it was created.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all the ones Barb mentioned<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s Fujita Goro to me is how I imagine historical Fujita<br/>
Goro when he was at work. From my readings on police mentality...they<br/>
divide work and home and adopt almost different personalities in each<br/>
sphere.<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Keppuroku = Hijikata, Okita (both characters HIGHLY<br/>
believable)...a series which at times captures the complexity of the<br/>
situation better than NHK<br/>
<br/>
MIbugishiden = OKita (for his dark portrayal), Saitou is a bit too<br/>
rude/rough which actually flies against my own view of historical<br/>
Saitou...Mibugishiden was too keen on contrasting Saitou with<br/>
Yoshimura...but Koichi Saitou is too darn SEXY<br/>
<br/>
Mibugishiden Nagakura...that face those eyes...we NEED MORE NAGAKURA<br/>
and I can imagine this actor to be more sociable like historical<br/>
Nagakura too!<br/>
<br/>
NHK = Hijikata (has the looks but not the *presence), Serizawa Kamo<br/>
(PERFECT), Saitou (good but why make up the carving detail while<br/>
LEAVING OUT his practice time with Yamazaki Susumu?) but I love JO<br/>
ODAGIRI, Yamanami Keisuke (superior acting, and the thoughtful<br/>
narrowing of eyes) he carries the drama of the series ....ITOU +<br/>
TAKEDA  Itou is sooo cold blooded, devious and hot...and Takeda is<br/>
just funny<br/>
<br/>
NHK has sacrificed historical detail (which can be presented in an<br/>
interesting way) because they don&#39;t have faith in the audience.  I<br/>
have said to myself many times that a time of hardcore fans could<br/>
write better scripts using this cast.  The series is uneven and is<br/>
rescued by some of the stronger actors (thankfully).  But now it will<br/>
take a while for new fans to work past the fictional devices to get to<br/>
the really good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>
&gt; particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too many to post<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very open minded and for every *positive interpretation for a<br/>
person or situation I have a *dark interpretation as well.  I have my<br/>
own vision of a Shinsengumi narrative set in modern times which does<br/>
not simply &quot;modernize&quot; them superficially.  The struggles of the<br/>
Shinsengumi is also a matter of social class, and ultimately universal<br/>
,tragic and are participants in history as well as victims.  We have<br/>
overlooked their lives as martial arts practitioners and people who<br/>
*think and *change.  I frequently imagine the survivors reflecting on<br/>
their tumultuous youth and the pain of having to keep their past to<br/>
themselves from new families and friends who would never be able to<br/>
understand.</div>

 <br/>
What!!??  I wasn&#39;t belittling him with that.  How much could he have realistically done in a mere 13 days?  Stupid Imperialists...  I have *no* doubt that Miki would&#39;ve been as successful as Sagara was (and Sagara was successful, which was part of the problem for the Imperialists) if he&#39;d been allowed to do the job.  From what I&#39;ve understood from texts, it was the men in the Second Patrol who wanted him as their captain.  There had to be a reason. (And it wasn&#39;t his fault he had a domineering, overprotective big brother in the Shinsengumi. *pinching Barb*)<br/>

<h3>Re: [SHQ] Re: Admin: Important Shinsengumi Business</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810364399">1) Name/Nickname/Screenname: Warg3791 on AIM. I go by MissBehavin (MissB) on <br/>
the list. <br/>
<br/>
2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi? The first time I saw the <br/>
Shinsengumi was in the RK OVA. <br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why? Anyone here can tell you I <br/>
am completely obsessed with the Shinsengumi Fukuchou (Vice-Commander) <br/>
Hijikata Toshizo. His strength of character, his conviction to follow his own <br/>
beliefs, and his loyalty to his cause are inspiring to me. Over time it has become <br/>
clear to me that his character has been much maligned by history and the media. <br/>
He was not the evil &quot;demon&quot; that some would have people believe.  Rather he <br/>
was a man dedicated to both his friends and his followers, who willingly rode <br/>
into danger in a futuile attempt to save his &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The accounts we have of him actually suggest that he was very well liked and <br/>
respected by the Shinsengumi members. Many followed him all the way to <br/>
Hakodate, despite their cause being hopeless. An account one of them left behind said <br/>
they &quot;cried like babes who had lost their mother&quot; when they were later told <br/>
of his death.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most intriguing thing about him was the fact that he was born a <br/>
mere farmer. By law he should have never held a sword or any position of <br/>
authority. However it was his dream to become a samurai and through a strange mix of <br/>
luck and sheer determination he and Kondo both rose to unheard of heights of <br/>
power for men of their class. By the end Hijikata was leading the army in Ezo. <br/>
Those who fought with him said he &quot;died more samurai than the real samurai&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Katsu Kaishu summed his life up best when he said Hijikata was &quot;one <br/>
man of great caliber.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen? I have seen the RK OVA and <br/>
anime and I am reading the Viz version of the manga now. I have seen PMK and most <br/>
of NHK. Saw Gohatto, Sword of Doom, and Shinsengumi Keppuroku. I would love to <br/>
get my hands on one of those Shinsengumi video games, but that is probably a <br/>
pipe dream...<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think <br/>
captured your favorite members(s) the best and why?<br/>
So far, I think that Shinsengumi Keppuroku did the best job of presenting <br/>
Hijikata Toshizo&#39;s character. He did not come across to me as unnecessarily cruel <br/>
or &quot;grumpy&quot;, nor does he seem blinded to all else by his convictions. Case in <br/>
point, he tells Okita after Yamanami&#39;s &quot;escape&quot; that &quot;if you -don&#39;t see him-, <br/>
come back and report.&quot; Okita presses him by saying &quot;you mean let him escape?&quot; <br/>
Hijikata replies &quot;I mean if you -don&#39;t see him- come back and report.&quot;  While <br/>
it is made perfectly clear that he must and will uphold the beliefs of the <br/>
Shinsengumi even against a friend, it is equally clear that he does in fact care <br/>
about his friend and has no intention of hounding him mercilessly to his <br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular <br/>
Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
I would love to find out exactly what happened at Utsunomiya. I know that <br/>
Hijikata was injured there, but not much else. I would also love to find out more <br/>
about the famous Sanjo bridge incident. Any information about Hijikata&#39;s <br/>
various lovers would be nice too. The only one I have heard anything about is the <br/>
woman he was supposed to marry back in Tama...<br/>

(his Aikido instructor in Osaka was also a shihan in Tennen Rishin <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Saito Hajime.  No one argues that he was one of the strongest <br/>
swordsmen in the group.  I&#39;ve also got a soft spot in my heart for <br/>
kenshi who liked to drink.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>

Mifune, Gohatto, Mibu Gishiden.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally really liked Mifune as Kondo.  I also liked the Saito <br/>
portrayal in Mibu Gishiden, though it sent me into a rage that they <br/>
put his swords on his right hip instead of the left. I&#39;ll buy that <br/>
Saito had a left handed thrust or may have been naturally left <br/>
handed, but the conventions of the time had everyone growing up <br/>
right handed.  Wearing his swords on the right hip woulda had him <br/>
knocking saya with and having to fight everyone he came across.  It <br/>
just didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Saito swords on the right hip thing.  Outside of that no real <br/>
beefs with any of the Shinsengumi or their portrayals.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-524628012">Well, yes and no.  At the Aikido dojo my sensei trained at in Osaka <br/>
there were teachers from 4 groups of classical Heiho, of which <br/>
Tennen Rishin Ryu was only one.  He ended up training in Yagyu <br/>
Shinkage Ryu, which is what he brought back with him and I train in <br/>
now.  However, because he was in so tight with Yoshida Sensei he got <br/>
the chance to learn some of TRR&#39;s kihon (which he often reminds me <br/>
ins&#39;t much).<br/>
Tennen Rishin Ryu uses very thick, heavy bokken.  Much larger than <br/>
other styles like Jigen Ryu or Jikishinkage Ryu (the bokuto we use <br/>
in Yagyu Ryu is a twig by comparison).  It&#39;s techniques are very <br/>
indicative of the &quot;Beater&quot; styles that became popular at the end of <br/>
the Edo Jidai.  Most of the techniques seem to involve bashing the <br/>
opponent&#39;s sword aside and thrusting into his throat.  The style was <br/>
described to me as something to get people reasonably good with a <br/>
sword very fast.  <br/>
By contrast Yagyu Shinkage Ryu can best be described as a &quot;Baiting&quot; <br/>
style, where you offer up an apparent opening to get an opponent to <br/>
attack the way you want him to and cut him down when he does.  Can <br/>
be very formidable once you have it down, but you&#39;re not going to <br/>
get it fast at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a lurker here for a while and have enjoyed all the obscure <br/>
info dug up here.  Thanks all for the warm reception.<br/>

Shinsengumi was in Rurouni Kenshin. <br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?:<br/>
I like Okita Souji because he was one of the skilled swordsmen in the Shinsengumi and because he&#39;s rumored to have a good attitude. I also like Hijikata Toshizo and Saitou Hajime.  <br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?:<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin TV/OAV, Kaze Hikaru, NHK Shinsengumi!, Shinsengumi Keppuroku, Various other Shinsengumi movies.<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think <br/>
captured your favorite members(s) the best and why?:<br/>
I&#39;m with MissB on Hijikata from Shinsengumi Keppuroku. I also like Saitou from the NHK drama because of his cool attitude. <br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular <br/>
Shinsengumi members or events?:<br/>
Hmm...this is a hard one, I&#39;ll get back to you all on that. <br/>

reynardine.  I&#39;m mostly interested in ancient Japanese history, but<br/>
the Shinsengumi caught my attention and so now I&#39;m enjoying learning<br/>
about the late Tokugawa/early Meiji eras as well.  I&#39;ve been lurking<br/>
for quite awhile (actually used to lurk on the Miburo list as well<br/>
&lt;g&gt;, but rarely post.  Enjoy reading what people have to say, though.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) How did you &quot;discoverEthe Shinsengumi?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rurouni Kenshin.  The manga, actually--that flashback picture of the<br/>
guys just caught my attention and I&#39;ve been devoted ever since.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Saitou was my first love.  I think the fact that he survived and<br/>
had to live out his life in the new era is poignant.  It&#39;s one thing<br/>
to go out in a blaze of glory.  It&#39;s quite another to have to live<br/>
having been defeated.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing the NHK version, I&#39;ve become interested in Yamanami<br/>
Keisuke.  He seems to have been an honorable man and it&#39;s hard to<br/>
understand the circumstances of how he died, especially considering<br/>
the rank he held.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  Lesseee:<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Keppuroku: not my favorite, thought it was kinda stilted<br/>
<br/>
the entire NHK series:  Loved it!!!<br/>
<br/>
PMK manga/anime:  I&#39;ve only seen what&#39;s been released so far in the<br/>
US.  Have enjoyed it, especially the anime.<br/>
<br/>
Kaze Hikaru manga: entire series so far--the style is girly, but it&#39;s<br/>
a really well-written story.  Glad it&#39;s being released here in North<br/>
America, hopefully Viz won&#39;t screw up the translation too badly. :-P<br/>
<br/>
Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage:  see here<br/>

for my spoiler-filled review of this immortal work ;-D  <br/>
<br/>
Always looking for more Shinsengumi-related manga.  <br/>
<br/>
I so very much want to see Mibu Gishiden, but am holding out to see if<br/>
there will be a region 1 DVD release.  I&#39;m a great fan of (the actor)<br/>
Sakai Masato and can&#39;t wait to see his portrayal of Okita!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the NHK series really captured the feelings I had about some members<br/>
(although I know it wasn&#39;t exactly historically accurate in places). <br/>
Sakai Masato&#39;s portrayal of Yamanami Keisuke was brilliant.  Through<br/>
small things (narrowing his eyes, his formal movements, his hesitant<br/>
speaking at times) he was able to convey a lot of what the character<br/>
was feeling.  I also really liked Fujiwara Tatsuya&#39;s portrayal of<br/>
Okita (he&#39;s not a favorite of mine, but Fujiwara-kun did a fantastic<br/>
job!).  Oh, and Sato Koichi as Serizawa Kamo.  I don&#39;t know much about<br/>
Serizawa, but the angle of a man bent on his own self-destruction was<br/>
interesting, and Sato-san did a remarkable job.  <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174523780">1) Name/Nickname/SN: <br/>
 I don&#39;t have AIM like everyone else, my e-mail is name is the way to find me on MSN messanger (except that instead of yahoo. com it&#39;s hotmail.com ^^;;).   I normally go by the name WhiteRabbit/ Bunneh anywhere I go, but seeing as how common this is I ended up using the name Eeni for just about everything I do online now a days.<br/>
<br/>
2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi?:<br/>
First saw them on Rurouni Kenshin and wondered for the longest time wether the lil character called &quot;Okita&quot; was a girl (I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only who ever thought this).   A few years later, I started doing a lil research for my Kenshin fanfic and I ran across the Shinsengumi once again.   Being the ignorant person I was, I was amazed to find out that they in fact were a real group of people.   I read a lil more about them and was even more amazed.   So to this day, I&#39;m still trying to read as much about them as I can.<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?:<br/>
Serizawa Kamo and Okita Souji.   Oktia because he&#39;s always said to have been a guy who would rather have a good laugh then be serious ^_^   As for Kamo, I was reading about him on the Kamo biography page and just thought, this guy didn&#39;t take shit from anyone.   Kondou forgot to count him into the number of people staying at an inn, it&#39;s ok with him... but if he can&#39;t sleep comfortably, no one else will.   BONFIRE!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?:<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin (manga/anime), NHK Shinsengumi!, and PeaceMaker (manga only)<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think captured your favorite members(s) the best and why?:<br/>
I have no idea... <br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular Shinsengumi members or events?:<br/>
How did Saitou end up marring the daiymo(sp?)&#39;s sister.   From what I understand he was a no one by birth and a pretty much the inside hitman of the Shinsengumi... so what were the politics (if any) behind this marrage???? <br/>

In fact, the first-ever spanish translation about<br/>

del Shinsengumi. Al parecer era una mujer muy<br/>
valiente, no sólo conocida por sus habilidades con la<br/>
espada sino también por su buena apariencia..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which more or less means: &quot;Okita was the captain of<br/>
Shinsengumi&#39;s first squad. She seemed to be a brave<br/>
woman, and was know not only for her good swordman<br/>
skills, but for her good looks&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Forgive my poor English ^^Uu)<br/>
<br/>
It was amazing! My fourteen year old fangirlish mind<br/>
was fascinated at Okita-sama (and continues<br/>
fascinated, now that I&#39;m 20 xD) I even wrote a fanfic<br/>
of &quot;her&quot; xD And the extremely girlish Okita from PMK<br/>
didn&#39;t help me to change my mind xDDDD Imagine my face<br/>

HAHHA, I knew I wasn&#39;t the only one!   And to be as honest as I can, I even thought that Soujiro in RK was also a girl (and when I first watched the sieres I thought that Soujiro and Okita were the same character, damn you Watsuki, you tricked me!).   Did anyone else have this problem?   Or am I just to dumb to not notice the obvious?   <br/>

I think I didn&#39;t phrase it correctly... what I meant to say was why was Saitou chosen to be her husband?   If there is any particular reason as to why those two were married.<br/>
