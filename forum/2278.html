<div id="ygrps-yiv-625502701">Hello Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Hope the Subject didn’t scare you ^_^ I just wanted to get everyone’s <br/>
attention and give a big official list owner WELCOME to all the folks <br/>
who’ve joined us recently. I didn’t realize how many new members we had <br/>
until I took a glance at the members section on the yahoogroups page.<br/>
<br/>
You guys have been awfully quiet so I think it would be super if we went <br/>
through a little bit of an intro/re-intro period. So here are a couple <br/>
questions I hope you’ll all take a moment to answer (even you “Old <br/>
timers” from the late lamented Miburo list0<br/>
<br/>
1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you would like us to <br/>
know about you)<br/>
<br/>
2) How did you “discover” the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>
think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>
particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>

I am a graduate student with a special focus on Thailand, because I am<br/>
fully bilingual (English is my first language but with all the typos<br/>
you can never tell)...I study almost every aspect of the kingdom<br/>
<br/>
I am sadly, the originator of our old "fundoshi" joke due to<br/>
babelfish's translation of Fujita Goro washing his "lower headband"<br/>
everyday.  Serizawa Kamo<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html)">http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html)</a>, a member of<br/>
our list pointed out that the word was not "headband" but in fact<br/>
underwear.  Due to this error we have developed a fascination with<br/>
fundoshi and its fashion possibilities here in the west...read my idea<br/>
here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/demonscircular/4427.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/demonscircular/4427.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I am also deeply interested in studying law enforcement...a little<br/>
from the Tokugawa but mostly during the Meiji era and a little of the<br/>
modern police.  I have side interests in things related to Aizu, the<br/>
Joushitai especially.  I've always loved persimmons I'm so happy there<br/>
are persimmons in Aizu...should I ever visit Aizu I'll be eating<br/>
dozens upon dozens of this fruit.  My dream is to visit various<br/>
Shinsengumi related locations, Aomori included, and experience the<br/>
locations during the exact day/time variuos events occurred.  I would<br/>
even want to camp out at Buddha Hall and walk around the castle at<br/>
various times of the day.  AND walk the Kyoto patrol route during the<br/>
hours the Shinsengumi worked.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2) How did you "discover" the Shinsengumi?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rurouni Kenshin...I fell in love with Saitou's voice, BODY, his way of<br/>
life and how he slipped his most deepest secret....the existence of<br/>
TOKIO ::gasp::<br/>
<br/>
So I've loved Saitou since the late 1990s and revived my interest in<br/>
2003 at the now gone saitou-hajime.com before coming here<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Saitou Hajime, Nakajima Nobori, Yamazaki Susumu, Shimada Kai and<br/>
Habutae Miki.  Saitou is a very complex man with *issues* and<br/>
ultimately I believe he tried his best in every role he assumed or<br/>
ordered to perform.  To top it off...he married a woman of Aizu.  I<br/>
think that he stayed in Aizu for more reasons than just blind loyalty<br/>
(or the widely accepted theory that he was their spy)...there is more<br/>
to the story.  I think Saitou had a reserve of not only physical<br/>
strength as a warrior but mental strength as well from the description<br/>
of his death.<br/>
<br/>
Nakajima Nobori similarly was a man of many talents and his decision<br/>
to join the Shinsengumi affected his family life.  The love and skill<br/>
poured into the production of his paintings is his expression of<br/>
sincerity towards comrades he lost.  Yamazaki Susumu like some members<br/>
of the Shinsengumi had other options besides joining a police<br/>
troop---but he obviously put his skills to good use.  The information<br/>
gathering arm in the shinsengumi is most complex and sadly reduced to<br/>
simple cross dressing and ninja stereotypes.  <br/>
<br/>
Shimada Kai is to me loveable...his wife was lucky he COULDn'T DRINK<br/>
even if he wanted to!  I want to learn more about everyone but until<br/>
we get a translation company together to publish these books we'll<br/>
never have access to details.<br/>
<br/>
I do love Hijikata Toshizo however my interest is very superficial (I<br/>
saw the picture ---end of story) I can't think of him beyond his good<br/>
looks.<br/>
<br/>
Miki, was a good man caught up in circumstances beyond his control. He<br/>
also had a charitable side and prayed for the men who murdered his<br/>
brother, yes he tried to exact revenge (which was a ok under the<br/>
circumstance) ....simply he had more strength than we can even gauge.<br/>
Miki is the butt of our jokes and even his guardian fangirl<br/>
accidentally be-littles him...quote from PHIL....(^_^)<br/>
(Suzuki may have been sent to the Tokaido, the eastern road connecting<br/>
Edo and<br/>
Kyoto... not sure about that yet... no big deal since his Second<br/>
Patrol was disbanded two weeks after it was created.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>
> 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all the ones Barb mentioned<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin's Fujita Goro to me is how I imagine historical Fujita<br/>
Goro when he was at work. From my readings on police mentality...they<br/>
divide work and home and adopt almost different personalities in each<br/>
sphere.<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Keppuroku = Hijikata, Okita (both characters HIGHLY<br/>
believable)...a series which at times captures the complexity of the<br/>
situation better than NHK<br/>
<br/>
MIbugishiden = OKita (for his dark portrayal), Saitou is a bit too<br/>
rude/rough which actually flies against my own view of historical<br/>
Saitou...Mibugishiden was too keen on contrasting Saitou with<br/>
Yoshimura...but Koichi Saitou is too darn SEXY<br/>
<br/>
Mibugishiden Nagakura...that face those eyes...we NEED MORE NAGAKURA<br/>
and I can imagine this actor to be more sociable like historical<br/>
Nagakura too!<br/>
<br/>
NHK = Hijikata (has the looks but not the *presence), Serizawa Kamo<br/>
(PERFECT), Saitou (good but why make up the carving detail while<br/>
LEAVING OUT his practice time with Yamazaki Susumu?) but I love JO<br/>
ODAGIRI, Yamanami Keisuke (superior acting, and the thoughtful<br/>
narrowing of eyes) he carries the drama of the series ....ITOU +<br/>
TAKEDA  Itou is sooo cold blooded, devious and hot...and Takeda is<br/>
just funny<br/>
<br/>
NHK has sacrificed historical detail (which can be presented in an<br/>
interesting way) because they don't have faith in the audience.  I<br/>
have said to myself many times that a time of hardcore fans could<br/>
write better scripts using this cast.  The series is uneven and is<br/>
rescued by some of the stronger actors (thankfully).  But now it will<br/>
take a while for new fans to work past the fictional devices to get to<br/>
the really good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too many to post<br/>
<br/>
I'm very open minded and for every *positive interpretation for a<br/>
person or situation I have a *dark interpretation as well.  I have my<br/>
own vision of a Shinsengumi narrative set in modern times which does<br/>
not simply "modernize" them superficially.  The struggles of the<br/>
Shinsengumi is also a matter of social class, and ultimately universal<br/>
,tragic and are participants in history as well as victims.  We have<br/>
overlooked their lives as martial arts practitioners and people who<br/>
*think and *change.  I frequently imagine the survivors reflecting on<br/>
their tumultuous youth and the pain of having to keep their past to<br/>
themselves from new families and friends who would never be able to<br/>
understand.</div>

 <br/>
What!!??  I wasn't belittling him with that.  How much could he have realistically done in a mere 13 days?  Stupid Imperialists...  I have *no* doubt that Miki would've been as successful as Sagara was (and Sagara was successful, which was part of the problem for the Imperialists) if he'd been allowed to do the job.  From what I've understood from texts, it was the men in the Second Patrol who wanted him as their captain.  There had to be a reason. (And it wasn't his fault he had a domineering, overprotective big brother in the Shinsengumi. *pinching Barb*)<br/>

<h3>Re: [SHQ] Re: Admin: Important Shinsengumi Business</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810364399">1) Name/Nickname/Screenname: Warg3791 on AIM. I go by MissBehavin (MissB) on <br/>
the list. <br/>
<br/>
2) How did you "discover" the Shinsengumi? The first time I saw the <br/>
Shinsengumi was in the RK OVA. <br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why? Anyone here can tell you I <br/>
am completely obsessed with the Shinsengumi Fukuchou (Vice-Commander) <br/>
Hijikata Toshizo. His strength of character, his conviction to follow his own <br/>
beliefs, and his loyalty to his cause are inspiring to me. Over time it has become <br/>
clear to me that his character has been much maligned by history and the media. <br/>
He was not the evil "demon" that some would have people believe.  Rather he <br/>
was a man dedicated to both his friends and his followers, who willingly rode <br/>
into danger in a futuile attempt to save his "Shinsengumi".<br/>
<br/>
The accounts we have of him actually suggest that he was very well liked and <br/>
respected by the Shinsengumi members. Many followed him all the way to <br/>
Hakodate, despite their cause being hopeless. An account one of them left behind said <br/>
they "cried like babes who had lost their mother" when they were later told <br/>
of his death.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most intriguing thing about him was the fact that he was born a <br/>
mere farmer. By law he should have never held a sword or any position of <br/>
authority. However it was his dream to become a samurai and through a strange mix of <br/>
luck and sheer determination he and Kondo both rose to unheard of heights of <br/>
power for men of their class. By the end Hijikata was leading the army in Ezo. <br/>
Those who fought with him said he "died more samurai than the real samurai".<br/>
<br/>
I believe Katsu Kaishu summed his life up best when he said Hijikata was "one <br/>
man of great caliber."<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen? I have seen the RK OVA and <br/>
anime and I am reading the Viz version of the manga now. I have seen PMK and most <br/>
of NHK. Saw Gohatto, Sword of Doom, and Shinsengumi Keppuroku. I would love to <br/>
get my hands on one of those Shinsengumi video games, but that is probably a <br/>
pipe dream...<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think <br/>
captured your favorite members(s) the best and why?<br/>
So far, I think that Shinsengumi Keppuroku did the best job of presenting <br/>
Hijikata Toshizo's character. He did not come across to me as unnecessarily cruel <br/>
or "grumpy", nor does he seem blinded to all else by his convictions. Case in <br/>
point, he tells Okita after Yamanami's "escape" that "if you -don't see him-, <br/>
come back and report." Okita presses him by saying "you mean let him escape?" <br/>
Hijikata replies "I mean if you -don't see him- come back and report."  While <br/>
it is made perfectly clear that he must and will uphold the beliefs of the <br/>
Shinsengumi even against a friend, it is equally clear that he does in fact care <br/>
about his friend and has no intention of hounding him mercilessly to his <br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular <br/>
Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
I would love to find out exactly what happened at Utsunomiya. I know that <br/>
Hijikata was injured there, but not much else. I would also love to find out more <br/>
about the famous Sanjo bridge incident. Any information about Hijikata's <br/>
various lovers would be nice too. The only one I have heard anything about is the <br/>
woman he was supposed to marry back in Tama...<br/>

 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2) How did you "discover" the Shinsengumi?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it was a combination of my sensei mentioning them in passing <br/>
(his Aikido instructor in Osaka was also a shihan in Tennen Rishin <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Saito Hajime.  No one argues that he was one of the strongest <br/>
swordsmen in the group.  I've also got a soft spot in my heart for <br/>
kenshi who liked to drink.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
<br/>

Mifune, Gohatto, Mibu Gishiden.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally really liked Mifune as Kondo.  I also liked the Saito <br/>
portrayal in Mibu Gishiden, though it sent me into a rage that they <br/>
put his swords on his right hip instead of the left. I'll buy that <br/>
Saito had a left handed thrust or may have been naturally left <br/>
handed, but the conventions of the time had everyone growing up <br/>
right handed.  Wearing his swords on the right hip woulda had him <br/>
knocking saya with and having to fight everyone he came across.  It <br/>
just didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Saito swords on the right hip thing.  Outside of that no real <br/>
beefs with any of the Shinsengumi or their portrayals.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-524628012">Well, yes and no.  At the Aikido dojo my sensei trained at in Osaka <br/>
there were teachers from 4 groups of classical Heiho, of which <br/>
Tennen Rishin Ryu was only one.  He ended up training in Yagyu <br/>
Shinkage Ryu, which is what he brought back with him and I train in <br/>
now.  However, because he was in so tight with Yoshida Sensei he got <br/>
the chance to learn some of TRR's kihon (which he often reminds me <br/>
ins't much).<br/>
Tennen Rishin Ryu uses very thick, heavy bokken.  Much larger than <br/>
other styles like Jigen Ryu or Jikishinkage Ryu (the bokuto we use <br/>
in Yagyu Ryu is a twig by comparison).  It's techniques are very <br/>
indicative of the "Beater" styles that became popular at the end of <br/>
the Edo Jidai.  Most of the techniques seem to involve bashing the <br/>
opponent's sword aside and thrusting into his throat.  The style was <br/>
described to me as something to get people reasonably good with a <br/>
sword very fast.  <br/>
By contrast Yagyu Shinkage Ryu can best be described as a "Baiting" <br/>
style, where you offer up an apparent opening to get an opponent to <br/>
attack the way you want him to and cut him down when he does.  Can <br/>
be very formidable once you have it down, but you're not going to <br/>
get it fast at all.<br/>
<br/>
I've been a lurker here for a while and have enjoyed all the obscure <br/>
info dug up here.  Thanks all for the warm reception.<br/>

Shinsengumi members or events?:<br/>
Hmm...this is a hard one, I'll get back to you all on that. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm Maria.  Online I tend to go by the screen names szabotage or<br/>
reynardine.  I'm mostly interested in ancient Japanese history, but<br/>
the Shinsengumi caught my attention and so now I'm enjoying learning<br/>
about the late Tokugawa/early Meiji eras as well.  I've been lurking<br/>
for quite awhile (actually used to lurk on the Miburo list as well<br/>
<g>, but rarely post.  Enjoy reading what people have to say, though.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2) How did you "discoverEthe Shinsengumi?<br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rurouni Kenshin.  The manga, actually--that flashback picture of the<br/>
guys just caught my attention and I've been devoted ever since.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
> <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Saitou was my first love.  I think the fact that he survived and<br/>
had to live out his life in the new era is poignant.  It's one thing<br/>
to go out in a blaze of glory.  It's quite another to have to live<br/>
having been defeated.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing the NHK version, I've become interested in Yamanami<br/>
Keisuke.  He seems to have been an honorable man and it's hard to<br/>
understand the circumstances of how he died, especially considering<br/>
the rank he held.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  Lesseee:<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Keppuroku: not my favorite, thought it was kinda stilted<br/>
<br/>
the entire NHK series:  Loved it!!!<br/>
<br/>
PMK manga/anime:  I've only seen what's been released so far in the<br/>
US.  Have enjoyed it, especially the anime.<br/>
<br/>
Kaze Hikaru manga: entire series so far--the style is girly, but it's<br/>
a really well-written story.  Glad it's being released here in North<br/>
America, hopefully Viz won't screw up the translation too badly. :-P<br/>
<br/>
Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage:  see here<br/>

for my spoiler-filled review of this immortal work ;-D  <br/>
<br/>
Always looking for more Shinsengumi-related manga.  <br/>
<br/>
I so very much want to see Mibu Gishiden, but am holding out to see if<br/>
there will be a region 1 DVD release.  I'm a great fan of (the actor)<br/>
Sakai Masato and can't wait to see his portrayal of Okita!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the NHK series really captured the feelings I had about some members<br/>
(although I know it wasn't exactly historically accurate in places). <br/>
Sakai Masato's portrayal of Yamanami Keisuke was brilliant.  Through<br/>
small things (narrowing his eyes, his formal movements, his hesitant<br/>
speaking at times) he was able to convey a lot of what the character<br/>
was feeling.  I also really liked Fujiwara Tatsuya's portrayal of<br/>
Okita (he's not a favorite of mine, but Fujiwara-kun did a fantastic<br/>
job!).  Oh, and Sato Koichi as Serizawa Kamo.  I don't know much about<br/>
Serizawa, but the angle of a man bent on his own self-destruction was<br/>
interesting, and Sato-san did a remarkable job.  <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174523780">1) Name/Nickname/SN: <br/>
 I don't have AIM like everyone else, my e-mail is name is the way to find me on MSN messanger (except that instead of yahoo. com it's hotmail.com ^^;;).   I normally go by the name WhiteRabbit/ Bunneh anywhere I go, but seeing as how common this is I ended up using the name Eeni for just about everything I do online now a days.<br/>
<br/>
2) How did you "discover" the Shinsengumi?:<br/>
First saw them on Rurouni Kenshin and wondered for the longest time wether the lil character called "Okita" was a girl (I'm sure I'm not the only who ever thought this).   A few years later, I started doing a lil research for my Kenshin fanfic and I ran across the Shinsengumi once again.   Being the ignorant person I was, I was amazed to find out that they in fact were a real group of people.   I read a lil more about them and was even more amazed.   So to this day, I'm still trying to read as much about them as I can.<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?:<br/>
Serizawa Kamo and Okita Souji.   Oktia because he's always said to have been a guy who would rather have a good laugh then be serious ^_^   As for Kamo, I was reading about him on the Kamo biography page and just thought, this guy didn't take shit from anyone.   Kondou forgot to count him into the number of people staying at an inn, it's ok with him... but if he can't sleep comfortably, no one else will.   BONFIRE!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?:<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin (manga/anime), NHK Shinsengumi!, and PeaceMaker (manga only)<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think captured your favorite members(s) the best and why?:<br/>
I have no idea... <br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular Shinsengumi members or events?:<br/>
How did Saitou end up marring the daiymo(sp?)'s sister.   From what I understand he was a no one by birth and a pretty much the inside hitman of the Shinsengumi... so what were the politics (if any) behind this marrage???? <br/>

In fact, the first-ever spanish translation about<br/>

del Shinsengumi. Al parecer era una mujer muy<br/>
valiente, no sólo conocida por sus habilidades con la<br/>
espada sino también por su buena apariencia.."<br/>
<br/>
Which more or less means: "Okita was the captain of<br/>
Shinsengumi's first squad. She seemed to be a brave<br/>
woman, and was know not only for her good swordman<br/>
skills, but for her good looks"<br/>
<br/>
(Forgive my poor English ^^Uu)<br/>
<br/>
It was amazing! My fourteen year old fangirlish mind<br/>
was fascinated at Okita-sama (and continues<br/>
fascinated, now that I'm 20 xD) I even wrote a fanfic<br/>
of "her" xD And the extremely girlish Okita from PMK<br/>
didn't help me to change my mind xDDDD Imagine my face<br/>
when I discovered the truth!! ;o;<br/>

HAHHA, I knew I wasn't the only one!   And to be as honest as I can, I even thought that Soujiro in RK was also a girl (and when I first watched the sieres I thought that Soujiro and Okita were the same character, damn you Watsuki, you tricked me!).   Did anyone else have this problem?   Or am I just to dumb to not notice the obvious?   <br/>

I think I didn't phrase it correctly... what I meant to say was why was Saitou chosen to be her husband?   If there is any particular reason as to why those two were married.<br/>

lo mío con Okita fué más fuerte, porque yo me emocioné<br/>
con el hecho de que era una chica xDD<br/>
<br/>
Dije: "Woooo!! Una mujer guerrera! *_*" Y ya te digo,<br/>
el hecho de ver a la Okita de Peacemaker (porque<br/>
diooos es una tía xDDDD) no ayudó mucho a mi mente de<br/>

I confused Soujirou with Okita too. But my thingie<br/>
with Okita was more powerful, since I truly believed<br/>
he was a "she" I thought: "OMG! A woman warrior!!!<br/>

help much my fangirl mind lol <br/>
