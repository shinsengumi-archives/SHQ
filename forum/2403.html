They mentioned about the possible color, material, the period they would wear <br/>
that haori and so forth.<br/>
There are also mention about asagi color used for Seppuku ceremony. It would <br/>
be historically accurate that samurai would wear asagi colored kimono for <br/>
seppuku ceremony.<br/>
If you saw NHK, that pale green Kamishimo worn by Yamanami or Kawai for their <br/>
seppuku is also asagi color as there are many nuance of that color.<br/>
Dispite the difference of the tone, if speaking of Asagi color in bakumatsu <br/>
it would be blue but slightly greenished close to cyan or peacock in western <br/>
color.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with TV drama or film is sometimes they choose deliberately <br/>
different color for that uniform rather than authentic asagi, by esthetic or <br/>
technical reason.<br/>
For exemple, NHK staff told that authentic asagi color becomes less clear <br/>
through the camera and they had to choose more vivid blue.<br/>
About Gohatto, Takeshi Kitano said that was good choice if they used black <br/>
color uniform instead of blue, because Shinsengumi appeared often in many skits <br/>
with that blue costume and if Kitano who had been known as a comedian appeared <br/>
in such uniform, that would make laugh the people. <br/>
They could avoid too popular image.<br/>

Thanks for the link to that site and the information, especially about why they change the colors for TV and movies. <br/>
