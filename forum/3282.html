<h3>Why Do You Like the Shinsengumi?</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-12526714">I just posted a call for all moviemakers here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/message/845">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/message/845</a><br/>
<br/>
and ask all fans to consider submitting an mp3 where they answer the <br/>
question<br/>
"Why do you like the Shinsengumi?"<br/>
<br/>
the file can be sent using megaupload or yousendit to my email <br/>
secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com<br/>
<br/>
and you should include a pen name<br/>
<br/>
I want to compile all these answers into one audio file and mix it <br/>
with other multimedia...there is no deadline because I can <br/>
continuously add more and more mp3 files together.<br/>
<br/>
All you need is a microphone and a basic soundrecorder (if you can <br/>
record as .wav that's fine I can convert it into mp3).<br/>
<br/>
In other words this will be a massive audio tagboard.<br/>
<br/>
One of the issues with the internet for many is it usually lacks  <br/>
real human contact (traditional concepts of human contact, face to <br/>
face, audio or visual)---but ofcourse technology is gradually <br/>
changing that.  What's clear to me from just the number of visitors <br/>
to SHQ is that we have people who want to read and learn about the <br/>
group from ALL OVER THE WORLD and it would neat to hear from some <br/>
friends we've never met before.  So your message can be in any <br/>
language (as long as you submit a translation, that way I can put up <br/>
a slide in English and we can read it).<br/>
<br/>
I think that anywhere from one sentence to a 5 minute comment is fair <br/>
because the goal is to capture the variety of reasons people have for <br/>
having an interest in the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
So I hope to get a couple of responses (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I know you all are out there...and we well eternally need your help <br/>
in making the site better and better.  So by contributing your voice <br/>
you are encouraging some of our researchers to keep up their work and <br/>
keep sharing it with the world.<br/>
