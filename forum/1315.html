<h3>Ishida Powdered Medicine Experiment</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-985747684">Found a site last night that was fairly interesting. Someone was <br/>
apparently recreating the medicine Hijikata sold to see if it really <br/>
worked or not. Unfortunately the translator refused to make clear <br/>
what the results were! Oh well... One thing of interest that did come <br/>
up was the fact that the method for making the medicine was supposed <br/>
to have been given to the family by a kappa through a dream. (Oddly <br/>
enough there are many tales in the Faery lore of Western Europe that <br/>
have people learning medicine from river-dwelling faery.)<br/>
The site is:<br/>

<br/>
There was another site I glanced through that seems to have info on <br/>
the Shinsengumi&#39;s movements during various battles (like Toba-<br/>
Fushimi), but the translator didn&#39;t make enough sense of them for me <br/>
to know who was doing what or why. Perhaps someone else can make <br/>
heads or tails of it, so I&#39;ll include the link here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039480437">Yep, just like martial arts lineages &quot;oh, a tengu transmitted these <br/>
profound techniques to me&quot; sounds so much better than &quot;my buddies <br/>
and I had a bit too much sake and decided to fight over the last <br/>
bottle&quot;...besides tengu stories there are &quot;after meditating for <br/>
months and maintaining my purity a god finally appeared to me in a <br/>
vision&quot; <br/>
