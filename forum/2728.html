account which features relevant artwork please send your link to<br/>

there are so many communities out there and we can't keep up with all<br/>
of them...so please help us<br/>
<br/>

Before They Became the Shinsengumi: Roshigumi<br/>
translated by Hirotada TOkugawa<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/roshigumi.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/roshigumi.htm</a><br/>
on the page is a link to Serizawa Kamo's page which provides<br/>
a really good narrative on how the Shinsengumi emerged from this<br/>
group<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
Blood and Makoto:<br/>
The Story of the Shinsengumi Told in Three Volumes<br/>
(WORK IN PROGRESS)<br/>
<br/>
is a proposal/outline/model for anyone "out there" whether they be<br/>
fans, writers, researchers and academics who visit the site<br/>
<br/>
* basically the goal is to address the historical and pop-cultural<br/>
impact of our Miburo in a logical multi-facted way. "Blood and Makoto"<br/>
a fantasy project will approach the Shinsengumi in detail and in a<br/>
very *calm and *cool fashion--the aim should be information [not]<br/>
propaganda.<br/>
<br/>
*Hillsborough's Shinsengumi book is ok with info but because it didn't<br/>
occur to him how important his work would be to any reader and<br/>
especially us fans who waited forever to get our hands on it, his tone<br/>
was inappropriate---"Blood and Makoto" is an attempt to EXPAND on his<br/>
work and build a respectable knowledge base for all future fans.<br/>
<br/>
* the outline will have dimensions previously unexplored like "THE<br/>
TAMA NETWORK" because I myself have placed great emphasis on the post<br/>
1868 Aizu network (which was relevant specifically to Saitou Hajime or<br/>
FUJITA GORO) when in fact the TAMA NETWORK (including the sworn<br/>
brother of Kondou Isami), relatives on the side of Hijikata's family<br/>
and many gono or wealthy farmers not only provided financial support<br/>
but even tried to contribute MANPOWER (nohei) to the dispersing and<br/>
reorganizing Shinsengumi after the battle of Toba & Fushima<br/>
<br/>
The reason why the TAMA NETWORK has not been discussed is because it<br/>
is much more difficult to resaerch in English than the Aizu Network.<br/>
<br/>
Only William M. Steele's work (noted right on the outline) explores<br/>
the mighty TAMA NETWORK. I have notes on these families now I gotta<br/>
find them...<br/>
<br/>
* WE NEED YOUR HELP---this "model" is by fans [for] fans. What would<br/>
you like to know about the Shinsengumi?  Let us know so we can list it<br/>
on the outline.  What ANGLE or APPROACH would you like to see in<br/>
Shinsengumi research?  <br/>

  <br/>
  ~In the first volume of PeacMaker Imon, the story starts off in  March of 1864 (don't know what calender is being used).  In  Chrono's world Tatsunosuke had already been hired as an accountant when  Tetsu became Hijikata's page.    <br/>
