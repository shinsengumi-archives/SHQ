account which features relevant artwork please send your link to<br/>
shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com<br/>
there are so many communities out there and we can&#39;t keep up with all<br/>
of them...so please help us<br/>
<br/>

Before They Became the Shinsengumi: Roshigumi<br/>
translated by Hirotada TOkugawa<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/roshigumi.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/roshigumi.htm</a><br/>
on the page is a link to Serizawa Kamo&#39;s page which provides<br/>
a really good narrative on how the Shinsengumi emerged from this<br/>
group<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
Blood and Makoto:<br/>
The Story of the Shinsengumi Told in Three Volumes<br/>
(WORK IN PROGRESS)<br/>
<br/>
is a proposal/outline/model for anyone &quot;out there&quot; whether they be<br/>
fans, writers, researchers and academics who visit the site<br/>
<br/>
* basically the goal is to address the historical and pop-cultural<br/>
impact of our Miburo in a logical multi-facted way. &quot;Blood and Makoto&quot;<br/>
a fantasy project will approach the Shinsengumi in detail and in a<br/>
very *calm and *cool fashion--the aim should be information [not]<br/>
propaganda.<br/>
<br/>
*Hillsborough&#39;s Shinsengumi book is ok with info but because it didn&#39;t<br/>
occur to him how important his work would be to any reader and<br/>
especially us fans who waited forever to get our hands on it, his tone<br/>
was inappropriate---&quot;Blood and Makoto&quot; is an attempt to EXPAND on his<br/>
work and build a respectable knowledge base for all future fans.<br/>
<br/>
* the outline will have dimensions previously unexplored like &quot;THE<br/>
TAMA NETWORK&quot; because I myself have placed great emphasis on the post<br/>
1868 Aizu network (which was relevant specifically to Saitou Hajime or<br/>
FUJITA GORO) when in fact the TAMA NETWORK (including the sworn<br/>
brother of Kondou Isami), relatives on the side of Hijikata&#39;s family<br/>
and many gono or wealthy farmers not only provided financial support<br/>
but even tried to contribute MANPOWER (nohei) to the dispersing and<br/>
reorganizing Shinsengumi after the battle of Toba & Fushima<br/>
<br/>
The reason why the TAMA NETWORK has not been discussed is because it<br/>
is much more difficult to resaerch in English than the Aizu Network.<br/>
<br/>
Only William M. Steele&#39;s work (noted right on the outline) explores<br/>
the mighty TAMA NETWORK. I have notes on these families now I gotta<br/>
find them...<br/>
<br/>
* WE NEED YOUR HELP---this &quot;model&quot; is by fans [for] fans. What would<br/>
you like to know about the Shinsengumi?  Let us know so we can list it<br/>
on the outline.  What ANGLE or APPROACH would you like to see in<br/>
Shinsengumi research?  <br/>

  ~In the first volume of PeacMaker Imon, the story starts off in  March of 1864 (don&#39;t know what calender is being used).  In  Chrono&#39;s world Tatsunosuke had already been hired as an accountant when  Tetsu became Hijikata&#39;s page.    <br/>
