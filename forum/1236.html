<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that's right. I don't know who chooses them, though.<br/>
<br/>
As for what the Japanese Emperor is known as, it's important to understand <br/>
something else first-- era names bear the Emperor's reign name, but this <br/>
only started with Meiji. Before then, the ruling military government, such <br/>
as the Minamoto, Ashikaga, or Tokugawa shogunates, chose the era name so <br/>
that it would be an auspicious one, and would change it at a whim. However, <br/>
for example, if one era ended on June 6th, and the next era began the next <br/>
day, the next day would not be January 1st-- the next day would be June 7th, <br/>
but it would be June 7th of the first year of the new era.<br/>
<br/>
That being said (phew) as far as emperors from Meiji onwards go, let's take <br/>
the current one (Akihito) as an example.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, "Akihito" is his personal name. However, the era name is called <br/>
"Heisei". The Japanese people, however, do NOT call him "Akihito"-- now, as <br/>
it will be after his death, tehy call him the "Heisei tenno" ("Heisei <br/>
Emperor").<br/>
<br/>
Simple as that.<br/>
