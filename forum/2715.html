<h3>Some Minor SHQ updates</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391124934">[Saitou Info]<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa translated something interesting from the book<br/>
Saitou Hajime no Subete (I couldn't access a database which would have<br/>
the author's name in English but I will do so later) <br/>
and the detail is on this page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>
please see the chronology at the bottom for the year [1868] and look<br/>
for Matsumoto Ryojun issuing a certificate to "Yamaguchi Jiro"<br/>

I still need to set aside a block of time to add to the monstrous and<br/>
colorful timeline<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a> and I<br/>
also am currently working on a model for a Shinsengumi book.  No I'm<br/>
not writing this book but I want to present it publicly as a proposal<br/>
anyways to show future authors out there what fans want to know.<br/>
<br/>
I already got some suggestions especially on how to make the index<br/>
easy to understand.  For example, capitalizing the last names to<br/>
prevent confusion and so forth.  This is actually a fun project.<br/>
<br/>

it is a work of fiction ofcourse (^_^) but we tried to work in some<br/>
info or linked to pages which can provide more details --- cases of<br/>
stretching the truth are noted--- for example we noted that Hijikata<br/>
wasn't a tailor exactly but he did work in a kimono shop when he was<br/>
younger<br/>

soundclips recorded separately and pasted together so if you have<br/>
online friends living several states away or in another country you<br/>
can in fact make your OWN Shinsengumi audio skit! And submit it as an<br/>
mp3 or wav file.<br/>

Luke Skywalker "you ARE?" ::shocked::<br/>
Darth Vader "No I am really your third cousin, secretly adopted into<br/>
your father's household as his official heir to the male patriarch one<br/>
generation older than your father so technically I am your ~grandfather~" <br/>
Luke Skywalker "you lost me there"<br/>
Darth Vader "That's not important---the point is we will destroy the<br/>
Northern Alliance with our Imperial banner and forged edict and search<br/>
and destroy the Shinsengumi and capture Princes Leah---ummm I mean<br/>
Aizu's Princess Teru"<br/>
<br/>
see it can be as lame and corny as you like---or DRAMATIC---OR you can<br/>

Re: How to speculate like a professional fangirl by<br/>
Secretary. <br/>
<br/>
I was intrigued by the fact that your friends would<br/>
argue for an Aizu conspiracy to split up Denpachi and<br/>
Yaso. As you stipulated in your previous essay, and I<br/>
do agree with you, when Goro married Tokio, Tokio had<br/>
lost practically everything, what had he to gain? What<br/>
many people don't like about old-fashioned Japanese<br/>
love stories (they are thinking from a modern<br/>
perspective on such things) is that Japanese love<br/>
stories were often of illicit relationships. A man and<br/>
his geisha mistress. A lady separated from her true<br/>
love to be married to a lord. But infidelity in any<br/>
form, I suppose, is not our 'modern' ideal concept of<br/>
true love. Japanese people, as in many other countries<br/>
back then, did not marry for love, but for<br/>
practicality, especially among the samurai classes.<br/>
That's not saying that married couples didn't love<br/>
each other, but I know, even from my own grandparents'<br/>
experiences, that love had little to do with the<br/>
actual concept of marriage back then. Even now,<br/>
matchmaking (o-miai in Japanese) is common. When I<br/>
described my story as old-fashioned Japanese<br/>
romanticism, I was taking these factors into account.<br/>
*Then again, I may be biased because I have my own<br/>
fictional* interpretation of why Tokio was adopted by<br/>
the Kurasawa family, and how the eventual marriage of<br/>
Goro and Tokio came about and how Yaso fit into the<br/>
picture.(Though whether anyone here is actually<br/>
following the story, I just don't know.) <br/>
<br/>
*lurks back into the shadows, but with the very best<br/>
wishes for all* <br/>
