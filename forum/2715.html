<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391124934">[Saitou Info]<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa translated something interesting from the book<br/>
Saitou Hajime no Subete (I couldn&#39;t access a database which would have<br/>
the author&#39;s name in English but I will do so later) <br/>
and the detail is on this page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>
please see the chronology at the bottom for the year [1868] and look<br/>
for Matsumoto Ryojun issuing a certificate to &quot;Yamaguchi Jiro&quot;<br/>

I still need to set aside a block of time to add to the monstrous and<br/>
colorful timeline<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a> and I<br/>
also am currently working on a model for a Shinsengumi book.  No I&#39;m<br/>
not writing this book but I want to present it publicly as a proposal<br/>
anyways to show future authors out there what fans want to know.<br/>
<br/>
I already got some suggestions especially on how to make the index<br/>
easy to understand.  For example, capitalizing the last names to<br/>
prevent confusion and so forth.  This is actually a fun project.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
it is a work of fiction ofcourse (^_^) but we tried to work in some<br/>
info or linked to pages which can provide more details --- cases of<br/>
stretching the truth are noted--- for example we noted that Hijikata<br/>
wasn&#39;t a tailor exactly but he did work in a kimono shop when he was<br/>
younger<br/>

AS ALWAYS WE TAKE SUBMISSIONS---this little skit was a series of<br/>
soundclips recorded separately and pasted together so if you have<br/>
online friends living several states away or in another country you<br/>
can in fact make your OWN Shinsengumi audio skit! And submit it as an<br/>
mp3 or wav file.<br/>
<br/>
For example a spoof on Star Wars... &quot;HAN WARS&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Darth Vader ::with trademark labored breathing:: &quot;Luke, I am your<br/>
father...&quot;<br/>
Luke Skywalker &quot;you ARE?&quot; ::shocked::<br/>
Darth Vader &quot;No I am really your third cousin, secretly adopted into<br/>
your father&#39;s household as his official heir to the male patriarch one<br/>
generation older than your father so technically I am your ~grandfather~&quot; <br/>
Luke Skywalker &quot;you lost me there&quot;<br/>
Darth Vader &quot;That&#39;s not important---the point is we will destroy the<br/>
Northern Alliance with our Imperial banner and forged edict and search<br/>
and destroy the Shinsengumi and capture Princes Leah---ummm I mean<br/>
Aizu&#39;s Princess Teru&quot;<br/>
<br/>
see it can be as lame and corny as you like---or DRAMATIC---OR you can<br/>
get your friends to perform your own fanfic!!!!!<br/>

alot of things will begin to make sense once you understand the<br/>
historical context---the more you read the more your speculation will<br/>
change over time---to remain static in your opinion when texts point<br/>

Re: How to speculate like a professional fangirl by<br/>
Secretary. <br/>
<br/>
I was intrigued by the fact that your friends would<br/>
argue for an Aizu conspiracy to split up Denpachi and<br/>
Yaso. As you stipulated in your previous essay, and I<br/>
do agree with you, when Goro married Tokio, Tokio had<br/>
lost practically everything, what had he to gain? What<br/>
many people don&#39;t like about old-fashioned Japanese<br/>
love stories (they are thinking from a modern<br/>
perspective on such things) is that Japanese love<br/>
stories were often of illicit relationships. A man and<br/>
his geisha mistress. A lady separated from her true<br/>
love to be married to a lord. But infidelity in any<br/>
form, I suppose, is not our &#39;modern&#39; ideal concept of<br/>
true love. Japanese people, as in many other countries<br/>
back then, did not marry for love, but for<br/>
practicality, especially among the samurai classes.<br/>
That&#39;s not saying that married couples didn&#39;t love<br/>
each other, but I know, even from my own grandparents&#39;<br/>
experiences, that love had little to do with the<br/>
actual concept of marriage back then. Even now,<br/>
matchmaking (o-miai in Japanese) is common. When I<br/>
described my story as old-fashioned Japanese<br/>
romanticism, I was taking these factors into account.<br/>
*Then again, I may be biased because I have my own<br/>
fictional* interpretation of why Tokio was adopted by<br/>
the Kurasawa family, and how the eventual marriage of<br/>
Goro and Tokio came about and how Yaso fit into the<br/>
picture.(Though whether anyone here is actually<br/>
following the story, I just don&#39;t know.) <br/>
<br/>
*lurks back into the shadows, but with the very best<br/>
wishes for all* <br/>
