<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, the whole story as it is generally told could well be a <br/>
lie. We know that Yamanami died, but it is not clear -why- he died. <br/>
This information was orginally posted by Momoiro-usagi on the SHQ mb <br/>
if I recall correctly...<br/>
<br/>
The only source which mentions "Akesato" is the work of a researcher <br/>
named Shimozawa Kan. No one can find any data relating to her outside <br/>
of his papers. <br/>
<br/>
It's the same situation with the "Five Dreaded Articles". The rules <br/>
that were made after the Ikeda-ya Affair are real enough, but there <br/>
is a lot of debate over whether the first five existed. I think it <br/>
has been mentioned before that if they did exist, they were not as <br/>
harshly enforced as legend would have us believe.<br/>
<br/>
It is also not clear whether or not there was actually any bad blood <br/>
between Hijikata and Yamanami. And several different versions of his <br/>
death have been given:<br/>
<br/>
-He was caught after he deserted because he wanted to die.<br/>
-He wanted his death to be a warning to Kondo.<br/>
-He was not happy about the Shinsengumi being subordinates of the <br/>
Shogun and abandoning the "original" purpose of Sonno-joi.<br/>
-That he was actually seriously wounded in a fight with an enemy. <br/>
-That he killed himself because he was suffering from some sort of <br/>
neurosis.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that was the gist of what we were told? Anyone have any new <br/>
info about this? <br/>
<br/>

I'm extremely amused by how Itou is the only one that looks somewhat normal in that second set and how Joe Odagiri's Saitou bears a passing likeness to Michael Jackson. <br/>
