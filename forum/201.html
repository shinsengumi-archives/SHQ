<br/>
By the way, don&#39;t these kind of sound like the Shinsengumi code, esp. #2 and <br/>
#3? #6, of course, we all know is not true-- and we should know-- most of <br/>
the active members of this group are women-- very wise and prone to fundoshi <br/>
fantasies...^_^<br/>

HOUSE CODE OF THE AIZU CLAN<br/>
<br/>
1. Serve the shogun with single-minded devotion. Do not measure your loyalty <br/>
by the standard of other domains. If any Aizu daimyo is disloyal to the <br/>
Tokugawa house, he is no descendant of mine, and on no account are you to <br/>
obey him.<br/>
<br/>
2. Do not neglect military readiness.<br/>
<br/>
3. Take as fundamental the Way of the Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
4. Do not confuse the duties of higher and lower ranks.<br/>
<br/>
5. Older brothers should be respected and younger brothers loved.<br/>
<br/>
6. The words of women should be totally disregarded.<br/>
<br/>
7. Lawbreakers should not be treated with leinience.<br/>
<br/>
8. Other than elders (&quot;karo&quot;-- high-ranking retainers), no one should have a <br/>
voice in determining punishments and rewards.<br/>
<br/>
9. If a retainer acts beyond his station, he should be dealt with strictly.<br/>
<br/>
10. The money and rice set aside for emergencies are to be used for the <br/>
common people, and only in times of famine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654619550">I don&#39;t have the book in front of me right now but the author <br/>
mentioned somewhere about &quot;not talking to girls&quot; as being a rule for <br/>
the local school he attended as well...in any case I&#39;ll delete this <br/>
post if I can&#39;t find it in the book...preliminary conclusion: these <br/>
poor Aizu boys they probably harbored many misconceptions about the <br/>
opposite sex...I find it interesting that the samurai class women <br/>
played a role in the heroic defense of their domain (halberd <br/>
brigade) and basically acquitted themselves gloriously as the author <br/>
felt his mother would&#39;ve if she didn&#39;t have to take care of her <br/>
small children and elderly family members... perhaps the Aizu men <br/>
just couldn&#39;t stand these assertive women LOL  I imagine Aizu men <br/>
conversing amongst themselves &quot;man, their fathers train them to be <br/>
warriors and now they think they are running the show&quot;<br/>
all of which may lend validity to the fanfics of Tokio:)<br/>
