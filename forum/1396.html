 </span></blockquote>Ohh i just found a better summary<br/>
<br/>
In the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, there was a cute warrior, <br/>
Souji Okita, who belonged to the armed police of the shogunate in <br/>
Kyoto. Very few knew that Souji was not a boy, but a woman. Souji <br/>
loved the vice-leader of the armed police, Toshizou Hijikata. Souji <br/>
suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and coughed up blood during a <br/>
battle. Toshizou helped her but said that he did not care for the <br/>
girl with a smell of blood. Souji had a real talent for swordsmanship <br/>
and no one but Ryouma Sakamoto could compete with her. Ryouma was a <br/>
liberal intellectual and tried to carry out a revolution without <br/>
blood. However, the bloody Meiji Restoration broke out and Souji <br/>
killed Ryouma who lost his dream. Because a friendship had sprung up <br/>
between Toshizou and Ryouma, Toshizou got angry and slashed at Souji <br/>
with a sword. Unwillingly, she unsheathed her sword and thought that <br/>
she might get love if she was killed by the man she loved.</div>
