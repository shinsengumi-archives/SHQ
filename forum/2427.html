<h3>New Itou info/Takeda Assassination & soem Ishin stuff</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676710936">A BIG thank you to Tama for the following:<br/>
<br/>
Shinohara did, in fact participate in the assassination of <br/>
Takeda.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s said also Shinohara and Takeda had been good friends. So <br/>
Takeda trusted Shinohara. [and why he took that after dinner walk with him, <br/>
ne?]<br/>
 <br/>
That was written by Kenbun Nishimura, the guardian samurai of <br/>
Nishihonganji<br/>
temple. In NHK he was the man for whom Kawai told his story <br/>
before dying<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
There was a former Satsuma samurai called Toyama Yahei who committed <br/>
murder and was banished from Satsuma clan.. He ask Kondo to join <br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
 Kondo was leery of the guy but  Itou supported this Toyama and <br/>
convinced Kondo to accept him.<br/>
<br/>
Itou then made Toyama be something of a spy and to report to Satsuma <br/>
clan what Kondo was doing.<br/>
<br/>
Through Toyama, Itou met Okubo. He met  often with him and  participated <br/>
to other meetings to overthrow Bakufu. [Not sure if this was just with <br/>
Okubo or with other high Ishin figures, my guess is it was]<br/>
<br/>
 In his diary Itou wrote that everything went as he expected. Except <br/>
after leaving the Shinsengumi he couldn&#39;t find a suitable place to stay....<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
Itou was promoted to the court rank of Ju-goi on November 18 ( his death <br/>
anniversary) Taisho 7 (1918) &quot;Ju&quot; means &quot;Vice&quot; and the rank comes just <br/>
after Sho-go-i.<br/>
 <br/>
Jugo-i rank, it&#39;s lower than Sagara&#39;s, but we don&#39;t know why. It comes <br/>
just after Shogo-i which is Sagara&#39;s.. Itou was enshrined in Yasukuni <br/>
Shrine and became a kami on April ( no mention for the date) Showa 4 ( <br/>
1929) [same shrine as Sagara]<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Note about court ranks<br/>
The &quot;Ikai&quot; or court rank system has been existed since 1400 years ago in <br/>
Japan.<br/>
There are miner changing of the system but since Taisho era, the court <br/>
rank has had the number 1 to 8 and each rank number has its &quot;vice&quot; <br/>
therefore 16 ranks in total.<br/>
<br/>
So it has &quot;Sho-ichi (1)- i &quot; at the summit and &quot;Ju-ichi-i&quot; comes next, <br/>
then Sho-ni(2)-i , Ju-ni-i and so forth. (sho-go-i means 5th)<br/>
Those rank are given to the people contributed to the country and except <br/>
Imperial family and Korean royal family.<br/>
Sometimes, the promotion is posthumous and the highest rank <br/>
&quot;Sho-ichi-i&quot;has never been given before one&#39;s death.<br/>
This rank always exists but after W.W.II  the promotion became <br/>
posthumous only.<br/>
