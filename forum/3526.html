<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079417847"><div dir="ltr">Hi Sarah - I'm not sure what kind of info you need or what assistance I can provide, but I have a lot of stuff up on Kido Koin/Katsura Kogoro up at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://red-bird.org/meiji2">http://red-bird.org/meiji2</a> . (I have recently updated the archive to include some information I picked up from another text I acquired a few years bcak.) <div>
<br></div><div>If you have a particular need to understand Choshu - I can also recommend you pick up Thomas Hubers, " The Revolutionary Origins of Modern Japan" which really is just about Choshu - specifically covering Shoin, Kido, Takasugi, Genzui, and other political factions within Choshu.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Hope this helps... </div><div><br></div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1079417847gmail_extra"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1079417847gmail_quote">On Tue, Sep 24, 2013 at 6:55 PM, Sarah LoBue <span dir="ltr"><<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pilgrimscribe@...">pilgrimscribe@...</a>></span> wrote:<br>
