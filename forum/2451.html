<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112638443">This seems to be a festival float depicting Ikedaya??? Note man on the<br/>
stairs...how many Shinsengumi films have you seen with a guy falling<br/>
down the stairs during the raid?<br/>

*Rough* Draft<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shinsentimeline.htm">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shinsentimeline.htm</a><br/>
the final draft which will appear on the website will have (2) views<br/>
1) strictly Shinsengumi info<br/>
2) national/political timeline so visitors can see how the Shinsengumi<br/>
fit in with everything going on during those years<br/>
<br/>
I made the rough draft a really long time ago<br/>
(ALL YEARS ARE ACCORDING TO THE WESTERN CALENDAR--as far as I know)<br/>
---there may be mistakes, if you find them or would like to contribute<br/>
(we seriously need some SAtsuma, Choshu and Tosa info) please contact<br/>
secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com<br/>
