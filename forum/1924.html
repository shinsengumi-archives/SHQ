<h3>Streamload account?</h3>
by <i>serizawakamo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-308316864">I remember that Sec has deactivated her Streamload<br/>
account and another person has taken up the task to<br/>
offer a free(?) storage service of Shinsengumi-related<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I have captured the video of the Shinsengumi play that<br/>
is still running at the Toei Uzumasa Eiga-mura about<br/>
the Ikeda Inn Affair. Went last week there and filmed<br/>
it. For those who don't know, Eiga-mura ("Movie<br/>
village") is a place maintained by Toei where many<br/>
historical soap operas (doramas) are filmed. The<br/>
entrance of the Shinsengumi headquarters in the NHK<br/>
Taiga dorama is in the Eiga-mura, as is the Ikeda Inn.<br/>
<br/>
The quality is poor to save some space and to ease its<br/>
download. Even so, it is around 30MB.<br/>
<br/>
So, if someone is kind enough to provide the data of<br/>
the Streamload account, I can send the movie ^^<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could subtitle it, but I can't convert here<br/>
the format to .avi -_-<br/>
