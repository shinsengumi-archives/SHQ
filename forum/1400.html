<div id="ygrps-yiv-333784212">He is only part of the second half of the movie. He is one among many <br/>
villains, but it is an important role. He is far from doing only a <br/>
walk-on part...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you see this movie only for Odagiri for an aim, it may very be <br/>
tedium the first half of a movie. Furthermore, you will be irritated <br/>
by the childishness of the heroine&#39;s words if you can understand <br/>
Japanese. <br/>
But I think that Odagiri&#39;s performance is comparatively good. <br/>
What he is playing is the samurai who likes the murder of the name <br/>
of Bijyomaru. Incidentally the portion of &quot;Bijyo&quot; in a name means a <br/>
beautiful woman.  <br/>
He wears a pure white kimono, speaks about the words which a woman <br/>
uses, and does feminine behavior. <br/>
Although he does not seem to be a homosexual, he is surrounded by <br/>
hooligans and receives indecent word. ^^;;;<br/>
The fight of a sword is also comparatively good. <br/>
However, as I wrote before, to those who like a legitimate classic <br/>
sword fight play, it is disreputable. <br/>
