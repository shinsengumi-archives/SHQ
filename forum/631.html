<div id="ygrps-yiv-407226142">They used the letter of recommendation system it seems, but my<br/>
examples come from early 19th century in regards to young men being<br/>
sent to study at schools far from home and the martial arts world<br/>
used, and still uses this system today.  In Remembering Aizu, which I<br/>
don't have on me this moment, I believe the author as a young man had<br/>
guardians, he had a couple of people who were kind to him, who wrote<br/>
letters on his behalf for him to carry.  Miss B, you have this book<br/>
right?  Do you remember?<br/>
<br/>
What an interesting question:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's good to know that the idea that came to me when I first considered <br/>
the question wasn't so far off, but now I wonder if that was for women <br/>
as well as men or did women have to have a man (husband, father, <br/>
brother) vouch for them as it were.<br/>
<br/>
And I would suppose it's safe to assume that if you were asked to <br/>
produce your documentation and didn't have it that you were in serious <br/>
trouble?<br/>

families kept more than one copy of these things...like every adult<br/>
had an official copy or something...anyways the article/post is really<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry it took me so long to reply. EVIL JOB. Anyway, I've only had a chance to glance through the book, but it mentions that he got two men to act as his "guarantors". Then he had to go to the prefectural branch office to fill out some sort of forms that would allow him to go to Tokyo. <br/>

<h3>Re: Identification and aliases</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281317866">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
If you have access to "Blade of the Immortal", I would suggest <br/>
reading vol. 7 & 8, for more information on that topic. The story <br/>
happens a few years before the Bakumatsu, although the specific time <br/>
is not given.<br/>
<br/>
In those volumes, the main characters have to leave their province <br/>
to go to another one, and they can't pass the check points if they <br/>
don't have the right authorisations provided by an official. <br/>
Although, it seems that you could try to steal someone else's <br/>
authorisation or you could go through the check points without <br/>
showing any papers if your house was located near the border. <br/>
<br/>
Such people could hence come and go freely. Apparently, still <br/>
according to "Blade of the Immortal", these citizens could also try <br/>
to help , in exchange of money, others to cross the border, <br/>
pretending that they were their nephew or brother in law, and help <br/>
them get through the check points without having to provide any <br/>
papers. But it was very risky<br/>
<br/>
But apparently, as long as you remained on the same side of the <br/>
border, no one would ever ask you your papers. So, the risky thing <br/>
was mainly the check points.<br/>
<br/>
That's what you can see in "Blade of the Immortal", but I don't know <br/>
if the information is 100% reliable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I don't think he'd be very happy about vouching for someone who did that. In fact, he might even decide to put in a bad word for her! You could have her mention Yamanami maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how far back it's supposed to be set, but in the movie Seven Samurai one of the men was not a true samurai. He had stolen papers from someone else to try to convice others that he was though. The problem he encountered was that the papers in question belonged to a ten year old boy!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose she could do the same thing Barb. Just make sure she swipes the papers of someone her own age! Wait! Better yet, have her swipe some papers, get caught by Okita and taken to Hijikata, and he examines them and informs her they're recipes! That would be my luck! <br/>
