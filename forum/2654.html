<h3>Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi - Fansite now open!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280573103">Last year in Japan a new game for the PS2 was released - Bakumatsu Renka<br/>
Shinsengumi.  Not a fighting game, but a dating game!  While this might<br/>
be an unconventional portrayal, it's a lot of -fun-, and not simply<br/>
because the bishonen factor is high...  :)  The story focuses on<br/>
Sakuraba Suzuka, a young girl from Aizu who has trained in kendo.<br/>
Wanting to prove herself, she gets Teruhime's help and joins the<br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
 <br/>
The point of the game is to talk to and eventually gain the interest of<br/>
one of the guys.  Except for Suzuka, all of the characters in the game<br/>
are actual historical figures - even including Shinsengumi members that<br/>
aren't as well known in the English fandom.  There has been one volume<br/>
of manga released, in addition to novels and a variety of merchandise.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kizu and I have made a site dedicated to this game, "Bakumatsu Renka<br/>
Shinsengumi no Koibito" at  <<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://brs.hajimenokizu.com/">http://brs.hajimenokizu.com/</a>><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://brs.hajimenokizu.com">http://brs.hajimenokizu.com</a>  Whether you heard of this game last year<br/>
as news came from Japan or this is the first you've seen of it, visit<br/>
the site to learn more!  We have a lot of information, and yes,<br/>
pictures.  ^__^  <br/>
