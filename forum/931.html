<h3>Notes + Pics + Pdf hosting</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-703936382">1) I completed my notes from M. William Steele's <br/>
"Alternative Narratives in Modern Japanese History"<br/>
The book is just great BUT everything is arranged thematically not<br/>
chronologically and there are typos here and there...so I had to do<br/>
some serious re-arranging so that everything "makes sense"<br/>
<br/>
Steele is also the author of the Shogitai article Kev. uploaded<br/>
<br/>
My notes are in FILES as htm<br/>
here is my pitch for these notes:<br/>
<br/>
Its about 2 guys (Kojima+Ishizaka) who were both very close to Kondo<br/>
Isami one was a sworn brother to Kondo....both guys were patrons to<br/>
the Shinsengumi and were just very active in rural politics (I'm<br/>
impressed with how hard these men worked to look after their villages<br/>
they had some pretty "modern" ideas too~real men of action not just talk)<br/>
<br/>
Village defense forces >>> later involves Shinsengumi<br/>
just keep reading<br/>
<br/>
Discusses Battle of Ueno Hill <br/>
<br/>
Katsu's Diary describing events<br/>
<br/>
Pro-Tokugawa newspapers<br/>
<br/>
Political Satire<br/>
<br/>
Quick blurb on one of Kondo's fencing students...this guy had a <br/>
pretty long/complex political career<br/>
<br/>
[Masayoshi] some info on Ee ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka <br/>
<br/>
Satsuma involvement in lawlessness in Edo <br/>
<br/>
2) I scanned/uploaded  pics from <br/>
"Shinsengumi Perfect Guide" isbn 4533050344 (borrowed from someone)<br/>
the pics are of Kondo and Saitou from NHK go to<br/>
