<h3>Watsuki&#39;s sources</h3>
by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211930952">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
So here they are: Watsuki&#39;s sources. There are four main books listed <br/>
in the Kaden, along with a short summary of each of them. A more <br/>
completely list is then enclosed in the Kaden but quite <br/>
unfortunately, only a French translation of the original titles was <br/>
given and the authors&#39; names were not mentioned. As none of these <br/>
books were published in French, it&#39;s quite useless information, so <br/>
it&#39;s a little hard to do research to check if they had been published <br/>
at least in English.<br/>
<br/>
I would particularly have enjoyed learning more about the following <br/>
book<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Recueil de photographies sur le Shinsengumi&quot; published by <br/>
Shinjinbutsu ourai-sha. In English, it would be something <br/>
like: &quot;Collection of pictures of the Shinsengumi&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is a description of the four main sources of information.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mary-Ann (^-^)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Moeyo ken&quot;  2 volumes  by Ryotaro Shiba<br/>
<br/>
&quot;According to the sayings, when they were in private, Isami Kondo <br/>
called Toshizo Hijikata by saying &quot;Hey Toshi!&quot;  that&#39;s how this <br/>
Bakumatsu novel, which relates the life of Toshizo Hijikata, starts.<br/>
<br/>
The author is Ryotaro Shiba, one of the greatest historical writers <br/>
in Japan, who sadly left this world in February 1996.<br/>
<br/>
In this remarkable book. The readers can follow Hijikata from his <br/>
birth in a peasant family in de town of Ishida-mura (now a the Tama-<br/>
ku district in Kyoto), to his childhood where he used to fight a lot <br/>
and during which he already showed a great potential for organisation <br/>
and as a strategist, to different phases of his life, always a sword <br/>
in his hand and with a strong unbreakable will (as the Ikedaya <br/>
incident, the Toba-Fushimi battle, the Aizu battle and all the <br/>
heartbreaking events where he lost his two best friends: Isami Kondo <br/>
and Soushi Okita). The story goes on until the battle of Hakodate at <br/>
the end of the Boshin war, where he died under the enemy&#39;s bullets, <br/>
still a sword in his hand. Either they first read it for the man <br/>
itself, or to learn more about the Shinsengumi, many people declared <br/>
having become a Shinsengumi fan after having read this book! Watsuki <br/>
himself consider this book as his &quot;bible&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it is, sooner or later, an essential book for every <br/>
Kenshin fan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sugata Sanshiro&quot; (&quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot;)  3 volumes  by Tsuneo Tomita<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s after having read this book that Watsuki decided to set his <br/>
story in the Meiji era. The story takes place during the fifth year <br/>
of the Meiji era, at a time when the popularity of traditional <br/>
Japanese martial arts was rapidly declining, due to the social <br/>
changes underway. Sanshiro Sugata, a young man who&#39;s a real judo <br/>
prodigy, is then slowly becoming a very mature fighter. There are a <br/>
lots of sports manga featuring Sanshiro learning judo, karate or even <br/>
boxing: fans of that category of manga among our readers will <br/>
probably know what we are talking about. Even those who never heard <br/>
Sanshiro&#39;s name probably heard about his unbeatable technique &quot;yama <br/>
arashi&quot; (mountain&#39;s storm). Look for drawings of fights where&#39;s there <br/>
a sensation of speed, as if the characters where going to come out of <br/>
the book, and you&#39;ll probably find something<br/>
<br/>
To learn more about the Meiji era this is an essential book for every <br/>
Kenshin fan.<br/>
<br/>
The author, Tsuneao Tomita, was the Ghokugi award&#39;s first winner <br/>
after WW2.<br/>
<br/>
One of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s movies is based on this book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shinengumi keppuroku&quot;  by Ryotaro Shiba<br/>
<br/>
After having introduced the Shinsengumi in his previous work, &quot;Moeyo <br/>
ken&quot;, Ryotaro Shiba then published a book consisting of many short <br/>
novels. The main difference between the two books is that, instead of <br/>
keeping the same point of view as in &quot;Moeyo ken&quot;, &quot;Shinsengumi <br/>
keppuroku&quot; explores different Shinsengumi&#39;s members&#39; point of view, <br/>
each short novel staring one of them. The novels are not linked <br/>
together, which allows a wide diversity of styles. Kenshin fans will <br/>
be happy to learn that Saito is one of the main characters of &quot;Yari <br/>
wa hozoin ryu&quot;. Kanryusai Takada, makes an apparition in &quot;Kamogawa <br/>
zenitoribashi&quot; (episode where he is murdered by Saito). The most <br/>
popular Shinsengumi member, Soushi Okita, is the main character of a <br/>
whole chapter &quot;the love of Soushi Okita&quot;. Be sure not to miss this <br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
There is a TV series based on this book and there is also another one <br/>
based on &quot;Moeyo ken&quot;, which are both remarkable, especially the one <br/>
based on &quot;Shinsengumi keppuroku&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Katsura Kogoro&quot;  2 volumes  by Kaoru Furukawa<br/>
<br/>
This is a biography of Kagoro Katsura, who was Kenshin&#39;s superior <br/>
during the Bakumatsu in the manga, and who was one of the three most <br/>
important men of the Meiji restoration. This is the story of his life <br/>
and of the man who had to changed his name to Takayoshi Kido during <br/>
the restoration, to finally die of sickness in the tenth year of the <br/>
Meiji era. The author himself, Kaoru Furukawa, says that between the <br/>
Bakumatsu and his life as a politician, Kido/Katsura not only changed <br/>
his name, but his personality as well, loosing all of this vitality. <br/>
We can see different aspects of his personality throughout the book. <br/>
For those who wants to learn more about a man who was close to <br/>
Kenshin in the manga.</div>

Can you give the French to English translations of these titles too? <br/>
There are many Japanese sites which record their book resources and<br/>
I&#39;m sure that we can match the titles.....<br/>
