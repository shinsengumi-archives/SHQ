<h3>The ULTIMATE BOSHIN WAR ARTICLE</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612443532">Please see "Files" and look for Downloads.htm<br/>
I have listed articles of interest including the very hard to find <br/>
first novel in English featuring the Shinsengumi Dai-bosatsu Toge <br/>
(watch the newly released DVD SWORD OF DOOM).   The novel discusses <br/>
Shimabara/Mibu and more details on Hijikata/Kondou as well.<br/>
The articles near the bottom are not directly connected to the <br/>
Shinsengumi so they are more supplemental in nature.  Please <br/>
download stuff when you can even though you can't read the novel <br/>
right away.  Remember it was written a long time ago so the language <br/>
takes a while to get used to.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this "ULTIMATE BOSHIN WAR ARTICLE" as I call it (^_^) has a <br/>
real title called "Female Combatants and Japan's Meiji Restoration: <br/>
the case of Aizu" by Diana Wright 22 pages long (BUT) if you want <br/>
*THE BEST* maps you will ever see on the Boshin War then this is the <br/>
article to download.  It is also really easy to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the women who kicked ass---for REAL!<br/>
(Learn more at and see their pics <br/>

<br/>
[Quick Recap For the new people]<br/>
In NHK Shinsengumi! You will see a guy named Matsudaira Katamori (he <br/>
goes to the sumo event at Mibu in disguise).  Matsudaira Katamori is <br/>
the daimyo or lord of Aizu, the guy in charge of security in Kyoto <br/>
and he basically sanctioned the Shinsengumi.  Without Aizu, the <br/>
Shinsengumi would've all had to go home or hangout in Kyoto without <br/>
a paycheck. Remember, that episode where Kondou went to talk to <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori?<br/>
<br/>
When the Boshin War, 1868 started, Aizu was on the hit list for <br/>
supporting the Shogunate.  Satsuma, Choshu etc also wanted to "pay <br/>
back" Aizu for prior military and political actions.  Aizu was <br/>
defended by lots of samurai included a small number of the <br/>
SHINSENGUMI and JOUSHITAI (Women's Brigade).  It was one member of <br/>
the Joushitai, Yamamoto Yaeko the gun expert, who gave testimony of <br/>
TAKAGI TOKIO's whereabouts during the siege and her role in the <br/>
castle.  If you want to visit Shinsengumi graves you go to Kyoto, <br/>
Aizu and Hakodate (battles occured at Sendai but Japanese fans never <br/>
listed graves there).  You want to visit Fujita Goro's grave you <br/>
visit Aizu.  Aizu is super important basically to the Shinsengumi <br/>
and specifically to Saitou Hajime/Fujita Goro as he is widely <br/>
believe to be Aizu's spy in the Shinsengumi.  In the world of <br/>
Kenshin you DO have a woman from Aizu looking for her <br/>
family...MEGUMI! (^_^).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045001301">When I got the article I knew ofcourse it would be about the <br/>
Joushitai/Joushigun of Aizu however I didn't expect it to mention <br/>
TAKAGI TOKIO!  It seems that she beat out her husband and her full name <br/>
is in an academic article...whereas "Shinsengumi" is just a footnote <br/>
all over the place (-_-).  Our Tokio really was a "capable" woman.  So <br/>
far all our info on Tokio is translated from Japanese, mentions the <br/>
hair cutting, nursing of wounded soldiers, her role in the Meiji Era, <br/>
but (not) -specifically- BODYGUARD TOKIO!<br/>
<br/>
If you are short on time, download the article and flip to [page 413] <br/>
to find her and make note of all the places in which *Teruhime* is <br/>
mentioned in the entire text.  Logically, Tokio would be by her side <br/>
almost all the time.  I know atleast 2 great fanfic writers have worked <br/>
in the Joushitai in their writings (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Hirotada Tokugawa for being the first known Joushitai <br/>
fanguy this side of the Pacific and for introducing them to our <br/>
Shinsengumi fandom.<br/>

<h3>Nakano Takeko illustration, part of CCG series</h3>
by <i>onigiribeanie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-87290767">(sorry about the last forward, hit the send button by accident!)<br/>
<br/>
Friend Veleda pointed this out to me - for those with a particular interest in Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
Illustration by Drew Baker as part of the Anachronism card game series:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trikinggames.com/HTML_ENG/downloads.html">http://www.trikinggames.com/HTML_ENG/downloads.html</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trikinggames.com/download/Nakano_Takeko_800x600.zip">http://www.trikinggames.com/download/Nakano_Takeko_800x600.zip</a> (direct link to 800x 600 version, other versions also available)<br/>
<br/>
His portfolio is worth looking through as are the other images on the site (they have a Japanese warriors series in this card deck).  Also, apparently for the artistically inclined there were some links suggesting an illustration contest was in the works.<br/>
