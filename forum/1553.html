<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058930663">I finally had a chance to explore this wonderful resource at my university's <br/>
library called  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/search">http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/search</a><br/>
If you are student at any college please check with your librarian.  I *think* that <br/>
a link through a university library webpage will allow unlimited searches.<br/>
Some dissertations require a fee for example $27 some are FREE PDF <br/>
downloads ^_^<br/>
[WARNING] enter in "Meiji" or related terms and you'll get DOZENS of <br/>
dissertations.  Based on something I found the other night I understand that a <br/>
Japanese student in the USA DID write a thesis on the Shinsengumi.  <br/>
However I could not find his or her work...it may have been an M.A. paper and <br/>
so it is not on this database :(<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
This article IS NOT Free :( but I skimmed the first couple of pages and it is <br/>
fascinating...I did chat with an SHQ member about how Aizu is considered to <br/>
be "underdeveloped" for various reasons...this article addresses that issue <br/>
and how the lack of development has turned Aizu into a center for cultural/<br/>
historical nostalgia.<br/>
<br/>
Politics of furusato in Aizu, Japan: Local identities and metropolitan <br/>
discourses<br/>

<h3>Re: More Articles...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-740308024">Toshiyoshi/Toshinaga Kawaji's secret to hunting down "bad subjects" or<br/>
the prevention of crime...<br/>
"Koe naki ni kiki, ktachi naki ni miru" = hearing voiceless voices and<br/>
seeing formless forms<br/>
<br/>
From Kesatsu Shugen the policeman's textbook prepared by<br/>
Toshiyoshi/Toshinaga Kawaji "Policemen should not sleep nor sit<br/>
comfortable.  Rather, they should tiptoe without rest day and night"<br/>
"[their tasks are] to endure the unendurable and bear the unbearable,<br/>
and accomplish the things that ordinary people cannot accomplish."<br/>
<br/>
I have always believed that the police system was tailored for the<br/>
former samurai and indeed the article confirms this....<br/>
Toshiyoshi/Toshinaga Kawaji= police = dry nurse for the people, or an<br/>
expression of "jin" = benevolence a samurai ideal<br/>
<br/>
Those of you interested in the Nagaoka domain...see page 160<br/>
<br/>
Want to learn more about Hokkaido see page 223 ONWARDS....<br/>
[Hijikata devotees know this stuff...just bringing this up for the new<br/>
folks]<br/>
<br/>
Hokkaido was regarded as free from political control...conjured up<br/>
utopian images "The Palace of the Dragon King" ryugu no onchi or the<br/>
Buddhist Paradise<br/>
<br/>
Hokkaid=Ezoshi "a place for Ezo"<br/>
Ezo=people who are not "subject" >>> The Ainu<br/>
<br/>
***The articles goes into great detail about the prison system****<br/>
