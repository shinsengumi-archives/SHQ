<br/>
something about NHK&#39;s Mitani writing in the Asahi Shimbun<br/>
<br/>
rather than finding this detail at the hino-shinsengumi board I <br/>
found this tidbit here<br/>
<br/>
the collection of signatures for the NHK Shinsengumi! sequel is <br/>
actually a petition to have NHK create a new year&#39;s drama/play for <br/>
2006 depicting Aizu....at first I clearly read at hino-shinsengumi <br/>
that they wanted to focus on Hakodate but it seems that they want <br/>
Aizu (greedy greedy fans) (^_^)<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
Many of you who have read the rough translations from 3-hajime in <br/>
the FILES section will recall Fujita Goro mentioning the beauty of <br/>
Emperor Meiji&#39;s mother (Queen Mother)<br/>
<br/>
here are some details from a post <br/>
<br/>
nifty.com/globalgate says...<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Saito saw Mikage of Empress Akinori of having admired the <br/>
beauty, in a 2 or 3 days before certain program. It was the woman as <br/>
whom the touch Japanese style Audrey Hepburn ? acted valiantly. Did <br/>
it seem to be being wise and the advanced one? Mr. Saito -- the <br/>
Empress -- a dress figure [ like ] -- admiring -- the time -- the <br/>
tail -- &quot;-- make it Western style of dress -- is it having said in &quot; <br/>
etc. (*^_^*) . <br/>
ÅÍB<br/>
then<br/>
<br/>
ok so we know maybe he saw her 2-3 days before an important event of <br/>
some sort.  Menion of &quot;the time the tail&quot; which is, usually, nifty&#39;s <br/>
way of saying TOKIO.  This person probably wonders if she wore <br/>
Western wear?  But I HIGHLY DOUBT IT because I think older women <br/>
rarely chose to do so.  Only the new generation, Emperor Meiji&#39;s <br/>
Queen and what I call the Yamakawa/Oyama Sutematsu Generation <br/>
(Rokumeikan circle) would have given western fashion a chance.  <br/>
Remember, those dresses were not comfortable.  Ofcourse all this <br/>
info could be totally wrong if for some reason there was some kind <br/>
of confusion between &quot;which&quot; Empress?  emperor Meiji&#39;s mother [or] <br/>
his wife the queen who was considered by many to be a very <br/>
progressive woman. <br/>
 <br/>
------------------------------<br/>
off-topic...there seems to be a steroid controversy in the world of <br/>
baseball right now...so I was thinking<br/>
<br/>
What would PMK Harada think of all this?<br/>
<br/>
PMK Harada &quot;Steroids???? HA!&quot; (rips off shirt)<br/>
&quot;check out these abs---100% Harada!  Harada never uses steroids!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and that is an example of how my mind works</div>
