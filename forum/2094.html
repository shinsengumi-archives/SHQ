<br/>
Sutematsu Oyama (YAMAKAWA)attended Vassar College (class president <br/>
and VALEDICTORIAN) and was later afiliated with Rokumeikan.<br/>
<br/>
she married Iwao Oyama the minister of war (major figure in the <br/>
Russo Japanese war of 1904-5)<br/>
<br/>
***BARB*** the other woman who went to the USA was UMEKO TSUDA (who <br/>
is frequently compared to Sutematsu Oyama)<br/>
<br/>
UMEKO TSUDA later founded Tsuda College (easy to remember ^_^ )<br/>
<br/>
Sutematsu Oyama (YAMAKAWA) was a sister of Yamakawa Kenjiro (later <br/>
president of University of Tokyo)<br/>
<br/>
There was also a Yamakawa Taizo who became the principal of Tokyo <br/>
Higher Normal School <br/>
<br/>
(another graduate of Aizu's Nisshinkan, Hideo Takamine became <br/>
principal of Women's Higher Normal School)<br/>
<br/>
if you think there is somehow a connection to Takagi Tokio then you <br/>
may be right....because there is even more people from Aizu who <br/>
established or managed schools during the Meiji Era...I am guessing <br/>
that these people pulled some strings to allow Tokio, a well <br/>
educated woman, to get the job at the school<br/>
<br/>
***there is also info on Nisshinkan, Byakkotai, fall of Aizu I will <br/>
post at the messageboard...the book is extremely valuable because <br/>
like Dr. Baelz's writings, this book is based on personal letters <br/>
between Sutematsu Oyama and Alice Bacon<br/>

kanji. He was a MAJOR figure at the Battle of Aizu.<br/>

<h3>Re: Sutematsu Oyama (YAMAKAWA) + Wakamatsu Maru</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-693913684">he changed his name to Hiroshi during the move to Tonami<br/>
<br/>
and just so I don't clutter the list anymore....<br/>
I'm -not- sure if Fujita Tsutomu, army major, served in the Russo-<br/>
Japanese War (he would've been 28)....his ship the Wakamatsu <br/>
Maru "Wakamatsu 65" *something like that* (this is my guess on the <br/>
name from the translations from the info pages)...but the Wakamatsu <br/>
Maru was reported sunk in 1944 in Simpson Harbor,<br/>
Rabaul (info from someone over at the Russo-Japanese War list).<br/>
