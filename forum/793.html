<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783623091">don't you love how I come up with subject lines which attracts<br/>

Okay...at this link<br/>

are pics from Hino<br/>
now...I ~think~ the woman is the same woman I've seen in books and<br/>
other Japanese sites who is a descendent (?) of Hijikata...the<br/>
pictures are of the ceremony acknowledging the anniversary of<br/>
Hijikata's passing.<br/>
<br/>
My question is...why is there a pic of those cute chickens?  I<br/>
mean...the even it for Hijikata I'm pretty sure (I've seen the exact<br/>
same pics on pages the fish has translated)...and now there are<br/>
these...chickens.<br/>
There are newspaper articles which you can click to enlarge and read.</div>

-Sigh- Don't you people remember he was a farm boy?!  What kind of farmer <br/>
doesn't have chickens?!  The family is OBVIOUSLY just reminding him of his <br/>
origins so he doesn't get too full of himself in the afterlife with all us fangirls <br/>
drooling over him. <br/>

-MissBehavin (Grew up on a farm. Doesn't like chickens unless they're fried. <br/>
Thinks that's the REAL reason Hijikata advocated the consumption of the nasty <br/>
fowls by the Shinsengumi.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's his descendant all right. Her name appears to be Hijikata Fumi. One <br/>
of the other pages also had a female descendant of Satou Hikogorou (Kondou's <br/>
old buddy), but I couldn't make out her given name.<br/>
