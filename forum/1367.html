<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847844532">Since I fried my brain watching movies this weekend (due to a 2 for 1<br/>
rental rate at the store) I watched 2 movies by the Chinese director<br/>
King Hu, "A Touch of Zen" and "Legend of the Mountain" both films have<br/>
a character who is both a scholar and an artist (portrayed by the same<br/>
actor too).  King Hu is one of those directors who can direct very<br/>
"real" looking action scenes, capture turtles basking and somehow<br/>
manage to get sparrows to fly a certain way too it seems.<br/>
<br/>
I did some screencaps of scenes which have close ups of paintings,<br/>
painting equipment used in the East Asian art.  In one of the screen<br/>
caps you will lots of different size brushes.  If you recall<br/>

Nakajima Nobori us shown drawing with only one brush.  However, I took<br/>
a closer look at the paintings of Saitou and Hijikata and noticed that<br/>
to draw their hair he must have had a fine or small brush.  In the<br/>
screen caps you will also note that an artist likes to have his/her<br/>
teapot and teacup nearby because when you use waterbased paints you<br/>
will in general have to work fast and you don't want to have to get up<br/>
and run to the kitchen for tea.  I also wonder if he used stick<br/>
charcoal to sketch first too.  Lastly, I happen to have 2 screencaps<br/>
of a woman, the demoness in "Legend of the Mountain" painting and<br/>
preparing paints during the daytime and at night.  Now, I figure while<br/>
Nakajima Nobori was on his "best behaviour" I figure they government<br/>
must have had the prisoners do some simple manual labor and not just<br/>
have them sit there the whole day then perhaps he painted at night by<br/>
candle light which may explain why he loves to use the color black<br/>
even though in his self-portrait he had primary colors on the table<br/>
---easier to see the color black in low light situations (alternate<br/>
theory is that every artist at the time liked to use black). Keep in<br/>
mind that NN is not a professional he drew the portraits for himself.<br/>
I'm impressed how he drew Hara Gorou's sister's feet...  <br/>
<br/>
Screencaps are a great learning tool ^_^<br/>
