<h3>Pictures in the text files</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428681136">There are three Saito pictures uploaded in the files section. While I <br/>
appreciate a good pic of the Wolf as much as the next fangirl, I <br/>
would like to remind everyone that the files section is for text <br/>
files only. Pictures take up much needed space in the files section <br/>
and we have folders in the photo section for Saito pics. Please <br/>
remove the pics and place them there within the next couple of days. <br/>
This is the last warning that will be given. The next pics found in <br/>
the text files will be forced to follow Shinsengumi law and be made <br/>
to commit seppuku. (In other words they will be deleted without <br/>
warning.)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so harsh, but one of us moderators has to do it. I guess <br/>
I've just spent too much time reading up on Hijikata-sama. He's <br/>
beginning to influence me...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061097110">FYI : I moved the pictures to the photos section to the folder The Many <br/>
Incarnations of Saitou and put the original contributor's name with the <br/>
description.<br/>
