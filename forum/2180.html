<h3>Pro-Tokugawa Papers +Meiji Literature</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-231160431">I used to find an entire excerpt of a dialogue between 2 people, <br/>
printed in a Pro-Tokugawa newspaper, I believe it was in a book <br/>
written by STEELE (can&#39;t remember exactly).  Basically the dialogue <br/>
addressed the common people&#39;s frustration with both sides of the <br/>
conflict and used word play to poke fun of some of the leaders of <br/>
the Ishin and Tokugawa factions...but it was still noticeable Pro-<br/>
Tokugawa.<br/>
<br/>
but I found another reference in this book....<br/>

&quot;The first items of journalism banned by the new government were <br/>
handbills and woodblock color printes (nishikie) that evinced a pro-<br/>
Tokugawa bias in depicting the military skirmishes against the <br/>
Bakufu forces.  This was in May of 1868.  In that same month, the <br/>
demand for military news led to the establishment of some of Japan&#39;s <br/>
first newspapers, a half-dozen irregularly issued publications <br/>
printed from wood blocks on few sheets of rice paper.  One of these, <br/>
Fukuchi Gen&#39;ichiro&#39;s KOKO SHIMBUN, became the first newspaper to be <br/>
prohibited from publishing, also for its pro-Tokugawa (or rather, <br/>
anti-Satsume-Choshu) bias.  Its final issue, the twenty second, <br/>
appeared on July 11, 1868.  When it was banned, Fukuchi was jailed <br/>
for eight days and his woodblocks were confiscated.  On July 27 the <br/>
government temporarily wiped out all newspapers by requiring them to <br/>
obtain the same &quot;official permission&quot; to publish required of books.&quot;<br/>

1942 an army major expressed admiration for a magazine called <br/>
REVERE THE EMPEROR EXPEL THE BARBARIANS<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
Mori Ogai, a very famous writer during the Meiji and one of Higuchi <br/>
Ichiyo&#39;s closest guy pals (books on Higuchi Ichiyo will include <br/>
Mori&#39;s picture), was not only a friend of Natsume Soseki but also a <br/>
competitor in a sense.  Mori and Natsume met formally on at least 3 <br/>
occasions and sought advice with one another in terms of <br/>
publications.  Threads on all three of these writers can be found in <br/>
the MEIJI section of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Mori Ogai attracted controversy with his book VITA SEXUALIS 1909<br/>
usually simplified to be the sexual biography of a professor<br/>

<br/>
Tokio &quot;I just finished reading Mori Ogai&#39;s novel&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro ::gasp:: &quot;Tokio! Why are you reading that smut?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tokio &quot;I heard from the school that all the young ladies are reading <br/>
Mori&#39;s work&quot;<br/>
*historically accurate by the way, Mori Ogai had the same exact fan <br/>
base as Higuchi Ichiyo<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro (snatches novel from Tokio&#39;s hands and skims some of the <br/>
pages Tokio folded for *re-reading later)<br/>
<br/>
Tokio &quot;see, its not that bad&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro &quot;My friend Harada could do a better job writing about <br/>
his sex life&quot;<br/>
