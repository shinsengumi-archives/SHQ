<h3>The Suppression of Information</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-846721099">In the past we have discussed how, especially during the Meiji Era, it <br/>
would not have been wise for survivors of the Shinsengumi to discuss <br/>
their early careers and likewise many of their children, family and <br/>
friends would likely not talk about Boshin War related topics in front <br/>
of outsiders.  For example FUjita Goro would probably keep his opinions <br/>
within his circle of close friends and some of his Aizu related <br/>
associates.<br/>
<br/>
In our modern times you would think that we all should be comfortable <br/>
with tackling these issues as long as we were careful in citing our <br/>
resources (to prevent plaigiarism, encourage transparency and develop a <br/>
traceable paper trail), refrain from outright lying or racism etc.<br/>
<br/>
In other words we thought that if we maintain a degree of integrity we <br/>
would be &quot;safe&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
There is a *B*ook about the *S*hinsengumi.  { I&#39;ll call it and the <br/>
author &quot;BS&quot; for short}<br/>
<br/>
I cannot name the writer of the book nor the researcher who accurately <br/>
pointed out egregious errors in that text out of respect to both <br/>
parties involved.  I ask this post stay here on our mailing list as <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason is because &quot;BS&quot; exerted pressure on a separate community to <br/>
ensure that the errors in the text, presented in a post, were DELETED.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good day for us fans that a researcher from our ranks <br/>
was &quot;honored&quot; to garner the attention of BS in such a way!<br/>
<br/>
The writer of that post, in an effort to protect this community also <br/>
asked me, a mod here, to delete a thread.  I deleted the thread which <br/>
had 21 related messages attached to it.  You see who knows what BS will <br/>
do next?  Will BS try to intimidate us poor consumers of manga, anime <br/>
and movies? (^_^) <br/>
<br/>
WE BOUGHT BS, WE SUPPORTED BS, WE LINK TO BS AND YET WE CANNOT <br/>
CRITICIZE IT?  Odd.  For BS to blatantly &quot;fanboy&quot; over the founding of <br/>
the Meiji Era, this person sure acts &quot;feudal&quot;.  Ain&#39;t that ironic?<br/>
<br/>
If you go to a movie, pay for the ticket, watch the movie, aren&#39;t you <br/>
allowed to praise it, slam it say it was &quot;so-so&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
I had a front row seat to a case involving free speech so yes &quot;I get <br/>
it&quot;, the value of the speech should not be judged, just that it should <br/>
be allowed.  However LIES and SLANDER and RACISM should not be <br/>
tolerated.  Such things should be labeled as &quot;lies, slander and racism&quot; <br/>
and not &quot;this is my glorious free speech&quot; in other words don&#39;t elevate <br/>
trash to something higher.  There is a time and place for everything <br/>
and even those who sell pornography put it in a place out of the reach <br/>
of minors.  In other words people exercise self-censorship.<br/>
Is it right for BS to try to censor someone who OWNS THE BOOK and put <br/>
money in his/her pocket?  I don&#39;t think so!<br/>
<br/>
In this matter, the researcher NEVER LIED NOR SLANDERED BSinstead the <br/>
researcher went point by point through a section of BS.<br/>
<br/>
And yet the review was SUPPRESSED by BS!<br/>
<br/>
In other words a little known truth or differing information was <br/>
SUPPRESSED.<br/>
<br/>
You see &quot;BS&quot; (and yes I chose this acronym on purpose) is feeling <br/>
awfully intimidated that someone else who can read Japanese was able to <br/>
find errors and cases of revisionism in the work.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;BS&quot; had an intro claiming that it cannot present a wholly factual <br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
So if someone else, a researcher, found errors in &quot;BS&quot; and also found <br/>
conflicting information, shouldn&#39;t BS be happy that someone was able to <br/>
add to the work?<br/>
<br/>
Nope.  BS is scared.  BS even failed to use the standard book in <br/>
English, Conrad Totman&#39;s COLLAPSE OF THE TOKUGAWA SHOGUNATE (which <br/>
discusses Aizu, the Shinsengumi and even the Mimawarigumi).  To even <br/>
overlook this book shows BS is choosing what should be presented to <br/>
further a certain point of view.  OR BS is utterly clueless on how to <br/>
do research.  TOtman&#39;s work is THE BOOK you go to about the bakufu my <br/>
friends. The sources used for BS were remarkably limited as well given <br/>
the fact that there are in fact some interesting books written on the <br/>
Shinsengumi in Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
BS was never even peered reviewed.  Look carefully, a FAMILY MEMBER <br/>
REVIEWED THE MANUSCRIPT (BS has a different pen name---but they are <br/>
family I assure you).  Unless that family member has a strong command <br/>
of the history, or language then it would be more suited for the work <br/>
to be reviewed by historians (yes there are a couple of professors who <br/>
even specialize in the shogunate still very much alive).<br/>
<br/>
WHy was BS never peer reviewed, and why weren&#39;t these specialists <br/>
consulted to suggest other sources?  Can it be because BS is BS?<br/>
<br/>
BS was so intimidated by a review by a careful researcher he asked and <br/>
got the censorship he WANTED even though he should&#39;ve argued with the <br/>
Japanese texts which were cited as having different information.<br/>
<br/>
BS thought it was logical to &quot;SHOOT THE MESSENGER&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In the real world, books are reviewed very critically.  Anyone here who <br/>
has read a review of a work of non-fiction or even fiction knows that <br/>
glowing reviews are rare.  Usually reviews are mixed.  I guess BS is <br/>
not part of the real world and has never read how academics (for the <br/>
sake of the discipline) will point out even the smallest errors in <br/>
another work (that&#39;s why it&#39;s called PEER REVIEW).<br/>
<br/>
Book go through multiple printings like 1st 2nd or 3rd edition and the <br/>
author kindly notes in the intro the correction of errors.  All this is <br/>
common practice.  Authors don&#39;t go around saying &quot;Oh no!  Someone <br/>
caught my screw upI must ask the forum owner to delete my work.&quot;  No <br/>
professional does this!<br/>
<br/>
What do we make of all this nonsense?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that BS cannot argue with the FACTS presented in the <br/>
review and chose the easy (or rather COWARDLY) way out: and that <br/>
is &quot;delete it please&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My friends this is just a taste of the suppression, twisting of the <br/>
truth and revisionism which has plagued not only the history of Japan <br/>
but of all humanity.<br/>
<br/>
The more they sweep things under the carpet, the more YOU SHOULD DO <br/>
EVERYTHING TO break their brooms (preferably over their heads).  (^_^) <br/>
(I&#39;m just kidding)<br/>
<br/>
Again I really had to vent about this issue publicly because I find it <br/>
to be very fascinating.  That person cannot get mad at me for posting <br/>
this unless he/she admits that the work is in fact the referenced &quot;BS&quot; <br/>
I noted in the rant above. HA!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear the writer insist &quot;My work IS BS.  I must now try to <br/>
scare these little fans and keep them quiet for having the brains to <br/>
prove me wrong. DEAD WRONG.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shame on this writer from benefiting from the $upport of Shinsengumi <br/>
fandom and then turning around and attacking one of us for pulling the <br/>
mask off this book!</div>
