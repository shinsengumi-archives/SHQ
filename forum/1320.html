Would this explain the reason why Nagakura and Saitou never met in <br/>

Saitou "being on best behavior?" What about his laments over <br/>
everything that happened with his brother in law? Guilt???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636536161">Thank you, Sec!  My first reaction was "WAIT a minute!  That's wrong!  Saitou was never in charge of a police force!"  Not even in RK.  :-D  <br/>
 <br/>
Let's face it... 1868 seems to have been the year when BOTH sides were doing some weeding and the likes of Kondou and Sagara may have gotten plucked for what some people thought was for the good of the garden.  I agree with Sec that Matsudaira may have let them take Kondou... to alleviate some trouble and put himself in a better position to save others if he could... but not that there was any malicious intent on his part.  He was tough, but I've never seen Matsudaira in that light.  As always, that's just my reaction to things.<br/>

<br/>
Acutally there is something to this. From what I understand, not all of Hijikata's guilt over Kondo's fate was based on his friend being captured while the rest of them escaped. Some of it seems to have come  from the fact that he was unable to stop the execution. He went to Edo under the name "Hayato Naito" to appeal for Kondo's rescue. Who did he appeal to? The obvious choice would be Matsudaira. <br/>
<br/>
I doubt that Matsudaira's decision not to do anything would have been based on trying to secure others a better position. At that point he must have realized he was on shaky ground himself. This is about the time he went back to Aizu and began making appeals for a lenient decision against his domain if I'm not mistaken. He had power still, but he also knew it was only a matter of time before the new government passed judgement on him. Probably he didn't attempt to stop Kondo's execution because such an action might have made him look guilty to the few sympathetic eyes out there. People would have been like "So! Still trying to throw your weight around, are you?!" It was better to stay silent and comply with the new government's decisions. At least until they started to hit home...<br/>
<br/>
I can easily see elements of the Choshu group wanting to snatch up Kondo for a new police force however. This would have been great for them for a number of reasons.

Actually now that you've mentioned that (since I really don't think <br/>
and just jump the gun on everything), if Kondou was a good loyal man <br/>
then he'd choose death than get some hand me down position to justify <br/>
the current regime and lower the morales of those still fighting the <br/>
new govt. If he gave in (if there was ever a chance to), I mean it <br/>
would be like his whole life and this fight would've been for <br/>
nothing... Un-samurai like...<br/>

all of Hijikata's guilt over Kondo's fate was based on his friend <br/>
being captured while the rest of them escaped. Some of it seems to <br/>
have come  from the fact that he was unable to stop the execution. He <br/>
went to Edo under the name "Hayato Naito" to appeal for Kondo's <br/>
rescue. Who did he appeal to? The obvious choice would be Matsudaira. <br/>

been based on trying to secure others a better position. At that <br/>
point he must have realized he was on shaky ground himself. This is <br/>
about the time he went back to Aizu and began making appeals for a <br/>
lenient decision against his domain if I'm not mistaken. He had power <br/>
still, but he also knew it was only a matter of time before the new <br/>
government passed judgement on him. Probably he didn't attempt to <br/>
stop Kondo's execution because such an action might have made him <br/>
look guilty to the few sympathetic eyes out there. People would have <br/>
been like "So! Still trying to throw your weight around, are you?!" <br/>
