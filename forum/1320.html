<div id="ygrps-yiv-104154917">If this is true did Saitou become an &quot;opportunist&quot;? I think HIjikata <br/>
would consider that treachery, about not helping save Kondou... I <br/>
don&#39;t want to believe it&#39;s true but I though Matsudaira was loyal to <br/>
Aizu till the end or was this another instance of you&#39;re not a real <br/>
samurai because of your farmer roots?<br/>
<br/>
Would this explain the reason why Nagakura and Saitou never met in <br/>
person? What about that prison that Sec was talking about with <br/>
Saitou &quot;being on best behavior?&quot; What about his laments over <br/>
everything that happened with his brother in law? Guilt???<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe this... My two favorite guys might&#39;ve actually butted <br/>
heads this intense? Ummm... Please Barb find out from Michael as this <br/>

I don&#39;t know any more than you at this point but somehow I don&#39;t think <br/>
Saitou was an opportunist--I DO think that he had some well placed <br/>
friends who wanted to see him advance since it would be in their _mutual <br/>
best interest_ ,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no doubt that he was loyal to  his Aizu people BUT I think he was <br/>
also smart enough to know that it would be a wise move indeed to get <br/>
Saitou the job considering how he may have _owed Aizu big time_ for past <br/>
favors and such....And of course the whole not our social class thing <br/>
didn&#39;t help matters.<br/>

1) what do you mean by &quot;new police troop/force&quot; (the new police system<br/>
headed by Kawaji)...I do not think so Fujita Goro&#39;s official rank was<br/>
inspector and sometimes sites translated by will say assistant<br/>
inspector...his rank was MUCH lower than let&#39;s say Miki<br/>
<br/>
2) Fujita Goro&#39;s rank in the military during the Seinan War was<br/>
captain (also translated at times as semi-captain)...it was after his<br/>
return from Seinan that he got &quot;probationary&quot; duties as inspector it<br/>
seems...although I am surprised that he commanded 107 guys in this war<br/>
and captured 2 cannons from the enemy...captain is not a very high rank<br/>
<br/>
*both 1to5.net and 3-hajime.com (which uses the same books as sources)<br/>
say he was affiliated with the police much earlier in terms of secret<br/>
recruitment and who knows what kind of assignments he got...in any<br/>
case the nature of his work does not seem to be public leadership at all<br/>
<br/>
*I do find it interesting that he may not have met with Nagakura in<br/>
person but we may have to leave the door open that they wrote<br/>
letters...who knows later generations...&quot;geez look at these stacks of<br/>
old papers, I&#39;ll go leave them by the curb&quot;...so just because they did<br/>
not meet in person (besides the fact that Nagakura lived far away) did<br/>
not mean they were on bad terms<br/>
<br/>
*However I do believe that Matsudaira may have &quot;let&quot; Kondou die...but<br/>
chances are Ryoma Sakamoto&#39;s murder (long believed to have been the<br/>
work of the Shinsengumi) and all the other &quot;crimes&quot; committed by the<br/>
Shinsengumi towards the revolutionaries had already sealed Kondou&#39;s<br/>

position advance (also consider the likely possibility that the job as<br/>
the head of security at a museum may have paid more).  I am also<br/>
thinking of momoiro mentioning how his life was in danger (due to past<br/>
Shinsengumi related activities or Meiji era cop duties) as well.<br/>

Barb, are you sure this info isn&#39;t from the Toshiro Mifune [movie]<br/>
&quot;Shinsengumi:Band of Assasins&quot; where the revolutionaries (some pounded<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636536161">Thank you, Sec!  My first reaction was &quot;WAIT a minute!  That&#39;s wrong!  Saitou was never in charge of a police force!&quot;  Not even in RK.  :-D  <br/>
 <br/>
Let&#39;s face it... 1868 seems to have been the year when BOTH sides were doing some weeding and the likes of Kondou and Sagara may have gotten plucked for what some people thought was for the good of the garden.  I agree with Sec that Matsudaira may have let them take Kondou... to alleviate some trouble and put himself in a better position to save others if he could... but not that there was any malicious intent on his part.  He was tough, but I&#39;ve never seen Matsudaira in that light.  As always, that&#39;s just my reaction to things.<br/>

still had political power.<br/>
<br/>
*I have a theory though as to why Fujita Goro was just an<br/>
inspector...umm if he had public leadership duties that would kind of<br/>
detract from other more secretive assignments...imagine the following<br/>
scenario...officials meet for a banquet with local police Chief Fujita<br/>
&quot;wait we had an appointment...why isn&#39;t he here?  This is an<br/>
insult&quot;...police &quot;Chief Fujita is undercover fighting Shishio---I mean<br/>
he had an appointment&quot; (yes I purposefully mixed history + fiction)<br/>

Acutally there is something to this. From what I understand, not all of Hijikata&#39;s guilt over Kondo&#39;s fate was based on his friend being captured while the rest of them escaped. Some of it seems to have come  from the fact that he was unable to stop the execution. He went to Edo under the name &quot;Hayato Naito&quot; to appeal for Kondo&#39;s rescue. Who did he appeal to? The obvious choice would be Matsudaira. <br/>
<br/>
I doubt that Matsudaira&#39;s decision not to do anything would have been based on trying to secure others a better position. At that point he must have realized he was on shaky ground himself. This is about the time he went back to Aizu and began making appeals for a lenient decision against his domain if I&#39;m not mistaken. He had power still, but he also knew it was only a matter of time before the new government passed judgement on him. Probably he didn&#39;t attempt to stop Kondo&#39;s execution because such an action might have made him look guilty to the few sympathetic eyes out there. People would have been like &quot;So! Still trying to throw your weight around, are you?!&quot; It was better to stay silent and comply with the new government&#39;s decisions. At least until they started to hit home...<br/>
<br/>
I can easily see elements of the Choshu group wanting to snatch up Kondo for a new police force however. This would have been great for them for a number of reasons. For one thing, a former Bakufu supporter leading THEIR police force? That might have convinced others (like Hijikata) that it was pointless to continue fighting. It would also have halted some of the hositlities by showing that their enemies would be treated fairly. And they already knew from experience the man&#39;s capabilities. On the conspiracy note, one might specutlate that by advocating him they were hoping to curb some of Satsuma&#39;s influence in the new administration. However Satsuma was out to grab as much personal power as possible and, as a former enemy of the new government, any argument in Kondo&#39;s favor was doomed from the start.<br/>

Actually now that you&#39;ve mentioned that (since I really don&#39;t think <br/>
and just jump the gun on everything), if Kondou was a good loyal man <br/>
then he&#39;d choose death than get some hand me down position to justify <br/>
the current regime and lower the morales of those still fighting the <br/>
new govt. If he gave in (if there was ever a chance to), I mean it <br/>
would be like his whole life and this fight would&#39;ve been for <br/>
nothing... Un-samurai like...<br/>
