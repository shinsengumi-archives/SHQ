has info we already know...such as the Tenmaya Inn<br/>
business+chainmail...from nifty it mentions that he wanted to take off<br/>
the protectors on his hand (attached to one his fingers)...because it<br/>
interfered with (uncomfortable) when you picked up a cup...and it was<br/>
hot...this is what I surmise from nifty<br/>
<br/>
please direct your attention near the bottom of the page... <br/>

This song is stored in the anthology &quot;the grass to bear&quot; of the Sakawa<br/>
ç§¦å­, and is sung in memory of Goro Fujita in the past. ç§¦å­ is the<br/>
daughter of the Takagi çä¹è¼&quot; and is Sakawa official Hyoe&#39;s son, and<br/>
the wife of ç´è«&#39;. A niece is asked for Goro Fujita.<br/>
(the fish was never able to handle this song---I&#39;m not sure if this<br/>
woman is Tokio+Goro&#39;s daughter in law?)</div>

Here is a rough translation of Taiko( or Yasuko, I&#39;m not sure for the <br/>
pronunciation) Sagawa&#39;s tanka (31-syllables poem) in memory of Fujita.<br/>
<br/>
 KONO NIOI KORENO TSUKURI TO ROUJIN HA FURUKI TSURUGI NI HITORI KOCHITSUTSU<br/>
&quot;This one has such a scent, such a workmanship...&quot;, the aged man with an old <br/>
sword is talking to himself.<br/>
<br/>
It says Taiko is a daughter of Morinosuke Takagi, became wife of Naoaki who <br/>
is a son of Kanbei Sagawa. For Goro Fujita, she is a niece.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496628290">^_^ Thank You!<br/>
Taiko is the niece of Tokio technically then...and again for people <br/>
who read Saitou info you will notice that the family is, generally <br/>
speaking closer to the Takagi side...there is little info from the <br/>
Yamaguchi side.<br/>
This also proves Saitou&#39;s interest in swords or as translated by <br/>
software &quot;connoiseur of the sword&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Secretarytocapt3<br/>
still screaming about the Jo Odagiri card...hmmm I wonder how many <br/>
young ladies out there have his pic in their purse ^_^<br/>
