<div id="ygrps-yiv-972086501">Off the top of my head, I remember the following styles of swordsmanship in <br/>
the Shinsengumi:<br/>
<br/>
Tennen Rishin Ryuu (Kondou, Hijikata, Okita, Inoue)<br/>
Shintou Munen Ryuu (Serizawa, Nagakura)<br/>
Hokushin Ittoryuu<br/>
Mugai Ryuu (Saitou)<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that since Kondou was the head of Tennen Rishin Ryuu, the most <br/>
prevalent style would naturally be Tennen Rishin Ryuu-- Shinsengumi members <br/>
from other styles trained with its techniques regularly, so I suppose it was <br/>
somewhat of a common training.<br/>

style of martial arts that were to be kept hidden in<br/>
secrecy, without being spread out to other places. In<br/>
the Aizu area, it was the Mizoguchi-ha Itto ryu. In<br/>
Tosa, the Muso Jikiden Eishin ryu (battojutsu style).<br/>
In Satsuma, the Jigen ryu. And so on.<br/>

nowadays, they practice some of the techniques<br/>
supposedly trained at the Shinsengumi dojo. It is said<br/>
that those techniques were taught by Nagakura<br/>
Shinpachi and Saitou Hajime to some Tennen Rishin<br/>
practitioners who kept those techniques alive till<br/>
today.<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-522">&gt;</a> S.H.&#39;s Sword styles/schools (continued)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-197608631">To understand these guys...we have to understand that they identified<br/>
themselves with their martial arts lineages as well.<br/>
<br/>
Recall momoiro-usagi&#39;s info [post # 792] <br/>
&quot;Supplement:<br/>
Why Yamaguchi Hajime chose Saitou as the assumed name does not remain<br/>
in record.<br/>
In a report, the expert of the sword of a family name called Saitou is<br/>
in sword style &quot;Mugai-ryuu&quot; which he studied,<br/>
and it is said that it became a basis.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mugai Ryu<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinjinkai.org/mugaihist.html">http://www.shinjinkai.org/mugaihist.html</a><br/>
things I noticed from the link above...(this speculation is left out<br/>
of the shinsengumimb.com post)<br/>
1) Gettan, the founder of the lineage (he had more than one name), is<br/>
described as &quot; the sharp eyes of a fencing master shining&quot;.this seems<br/>
to be a &quot;stock phrase&quot; as on Japanese sites S.H. had &quot;eyes from which<br/>
light shown&quot;that is good eyesight to gauge the situation? Intuition?<br/>
Both?  <br/>
What I found to be very difficult in kendo is to look at the<br/>
opponent&#39;s entire body while not focusing on just one spothis/her<br/>
eyes (through the metal face guard), hands, feet etc even though many<br/>
of us in the club are hardly executing the basic strikes correctly,<br/>
the instructors are always telling us to keep our eyes on the<br/>
opponent&#39;s entire frame (many such as myself keep checking on my own<br/>
wrist etc etc).  This is similar to drivingjust try to get a wide<br/>
field of vision without losing focus on anything.<br/>
<br/>
2) &quot; Gettan passed away peacefully while deep in meditation, his<br/>
rosary in his left hand, his hossu (Zen Master&#39;s whisk)  in his<br/>
right.&quot; Remember how hist. S.H. died?<br/>
<br/>
3) &quot; Famous techniques of Mugairyu include the upward cut from the<br/>
draw (gyaku-kesagiri), the horizontal cut across the heart<br/>
(yoko-ichimonji) and DEEP THRUSTS (TSUKI) MADE WHILE SUPPORTING THE<br/>
BACK OF THE BLADE WITH ONE HAND. Mugairyu students master the twenty<br/>
basic kata of the style, and then go on to learn deeper and secret<br/>
kata, including kumitachi (two-person forms) with both the long and<br/>
short swords.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So from reading other books own martial arts I realized that<br/>
practitioners, especially during that time period not only studied the<br/>
art/science of combat but its spiritual dimension AND became very much<br/>
acquainted with its &quot;lore&quot; the stories of the founders and previous<br/>
students are always handed downif indeed S.H. was part of Mugai Ryu<br/>
then he was more than aware of these stories. <br/>
<br/>
Sekiguchi Shin Shin Ryu Jujutsu (bare handed technique)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bushinjuku.com/arts/bushinarts/sgrjj/sekiguchijj.htm">http://www.bushinjuku.com/arts/bushinarts/sgrjj/sekiguchijj.htm</a><br/>
Just pretty cool to read how it was associated with the Tokugawas..<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://p199.ezboard.com/fsamuraibujutsufrm36.showMessage?topicID=8.topic">http://p199.ezboard.com/fsamuraibujutsufrm36.showMessage?topicID=8.topic</a><br/>
&quot;Sekiguchi Ryu was a favored martial arts system of the Tokugawa<br/>
Shogunate.&quot;<br/>
Yes we all know the Tokugawas favored Yagyu Shinkage ryu (messed up<br/>
spelling) but this lineage was also highly favored as well<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least one of the sword lineages S.H. practiced grouped<br/>
its katas into sets of 5Go in Goro?<br/>
Okay I&#39;m being stupid againmany lineages have their own ways to group<br/>
katas and I&#39;m sure it changesjust lost control there with the<br/>
speculating:D<br/>
<br/>
I added all the  links at <br/>

.topic<br/>
the links all deal with many of the lineages S.H. supposedly<br/>
studied/practiced...<br/>
