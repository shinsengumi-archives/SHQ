if you click on FULL SEARCH and go to Commercial Realeses and type in<br/>
&quot;Okita&quot; you will find hundreds of texts/mediait seems that if the 2<br/>
webmasters aren&#39;t updating their insane collection of doujinshi at<br/>

the most comprehensive Shinsengumi database in internet history<br/>

IZO mini review posted at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377079/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377079/</a><br/>
IZO directed by Takashi Miike. Two Shinsengumi, one is clearly Okita<br/>
Souji and another Kondou Isami? make cameo appearances in this<br/>
extremely episodic art film featuring multiple dimensions, vengeful<br/>
ghosts, images of modern wars, strong sexuality, hell and time travel<br/>
which examines the nature of VIOLENCE and the irrationality of seeking<br/>
justice (you shall be treated with screams of TENCHU often too). The<br/>
two Shinsengumi and the main character have a little scuffle on a<br/>
modern highway. Our boys, completely oblivious that their magical<br/>
appearance caused a truck to swerve off the road, then deliver some<br/>
interesting philosophical lines before giving the &quot;hero&quot; some trouble.<br/>
 The Shinsengumi fight scene happens to be the best choreographed.<br/>
Interestingly, another scene in the film takes Izo back to the<br/>
Bakumatsu where he fights hordes of black clad special ops military<br/>
men from modern times, and in another scene Edo era cops, doshin and<br/>
the hero fight in a modern setting. This film is not for everyone<br/>
especially if the only calm scene involves elementary school kids<br/>
giving thought provoking definitions on nation and democracy shortly<br/>
before the hero massacres the school staff. Many of the &quot;aristocrats&quot;<br/>
the target of Izo, purposefully resemble notorious figures in Japanese<br/>
history. The film also stars NHK Shinsengumi&#39;s Harada Sanosuke,<br/>
Yamamoto Taro as a cleaver wielding, real estate selling vampire.<br/>
<br/>
*fortunately after seeing this film I erased the image of gallons of<br/>
blood from my brain with the witty masterpiece POM POKO (The Racoon<br/>
WArs) from STudio Ghibli<br/>

some new stuff<br/>
  do an edit &quot;find&quot; in your interent browser for &quot;diamond&quot; to see the<br/>
school song presented to the school by the Meiji Empress<br/>
  do and edit &quot;find&quot; in your internet browser for &quot;provisional&quot; to<br/>
read a detailed account of Nara Women&#39;s Normal School dorm---Nara was<br/>
the sister school of Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal school, thus the schedule of<br/>
both school would be similar if not exactly the same<br/>
  BRAND NEW SECTION &quot;Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School in the world of fiction&quot;<br/>
  BRAND NEW SECTION &quot;Forbidden Books&quot;<br/>
  Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School and ROKUMEIKAN see the chronology year<br/>
1886 and look for the novelist ***Miyake Kaho and note the interaction<br/>
between males and females which was allowed before the school was<br/>
asked to stop.  Also note the females and navy officers (think Nishino<br/>
Midori and Fujita Tsutomu/o)<br/>
  See the section &quot;[Other Aizu Women]&quot; and see the 2 links for<br/>
Yamakawa Futaba<br/>
<br/>
[footnote] <br/>
the school took quiet a beating in the newspapers and prior to finding<br/>
all this new info I had no idea that the word &quot;tensai&quot; (which can mean<br/>
anything from bright girl, genius girl, Girl professor) was a<br/>
*sarcastic term applied not to schoolgirls in GENERAL but specifically<br/>
to the students at Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School <br/>
<br/>
a similar situation where school&#39;s appear in a negative light can be<br/>
found in Natsue Soseki&#39;s BOTCHAN<br/>
<br/>
male and female interaction at the school a good 10 years before<br/>
Fukuzawa Yukichi printed his book on Greater Learning for Women can<br/>
come from 2 people:<br/>
<br/>
Takamine Hideo, the director who controlled both Normal Schools for<br/>
men and women and who participated in similar activities at Oswego<br/>
Normal school in N.Y. State---the American host family he lived with<br/>
was the only household which allowed men and women to dance together<br/>
(not to mention allow male and female boarders under one roof).<br/>
<br/>
Takamine Sen(ko) his wife who was friends with Rokumeikan&#39;s leader,<br/>
Yamakawa/Oyama Sutematsu and Tsuda Ume(ko)</div>
