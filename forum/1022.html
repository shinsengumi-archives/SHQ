<div id="ygrps-yiv-863398331">In episode 2 of the NHK drama  I&#39;m pretty sure that Nagakura mentions<br/>
that he is on a journey of &quot;musha shugyo&quot; (shugyo itself should mean<br/>
training) in which bushi/ronin/commoners would travel around and<br/>
engage in quests/duels with wood swords with other noted swordsmen. <br/>
Should the challenger lose he would become the student of the victor.<br/>
 Musha shugyo was popular during the Muromachi period but was revived<br/>
during the late Tokugawa.  <br/>
<br/>
My info is from Hurs, G. Cameron. Armed Martial Arts of Japan:<br/>
Swordsmanship and Archery USA: Yale University, 1998.<br/>
