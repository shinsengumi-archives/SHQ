<h3>OT: Phil&#39;s On-going Problems With Yahoo</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026325277">I'm currently fed up with having to delete somewhere around 30 <br/>
repeated messages every hour or so... to the point I don't even want <br/>
to log on anymore.  Yahoo says they're working on the problem, but <br/>
have no estimate of how long it's going to take.  (And, yes, I turned <br/>
off getting mail from all of my lists, haven't opened any unexpected <br/>
attachments (as a strict rule, I don't), scanned all attachments I've <br/>
opened from friends, and done virus scans on my computer... it's a <br/>
problem somewhere within Yahoo.) Not only do I get multiple copies of <br/>
everything (including updates from Yahoo - ha!), it's started to <br/>
bounce messages back and sends me multiple copies of the mail <br/>
delivery failure. Apparently it's even beginning to fail to deliver <br/>
messages into my inbox. I give up!  :-D<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, do **NOT** send me any email to the spiritus_saitou account.  <br/>
If you should need to contact me, even if it's to tease me, send <br/>
messages to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:philalexandros@...">philalexandros@...</a> .  I should be able to read list <br/>
messages, probably even continue to post, just by logging on to <br/>
Yahoogroups, but I'm not going to be surprised if I can't.  If I go <br/>
silent, you have to know I can't get onto the list site --- when have <br/>
I ever been able to shut up???  Anyway, it doesn't mean I "vant to be <br/>
alone."<br/>
<br/>
Since I haven't heard of any problems from others, I'm hoping that <br/>
means it's just *me* who is having the problem.<br/>

mostly the really silly ones)</div>
