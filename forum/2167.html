<h3>Sea of Fire in the Battle of Aizu</h3>
by <i>sherlinelee</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014266267">I was mulling over a Rurouni Kenshin reference to the Battle of Aizu <br/>
and looked at the two pages on the SHQ site by M and Sec. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/aizunotesbf.htm)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/aizunotesbf.htm)</a><br/>
<br/>
What I couldn't get a sense of from the summaries was how the fires <br/>
were set and why.... not so much with the defense of the castle, but <br/>
with the general area and how widespread they were.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in looking over the site, I noted that there are some refs to <br/>
the the Meiji three.  I did recently check out the diaries of Katsura <br/>
Kogoro which cover 1868 until the time of his death and was planning <br/>
to compile notes on various historical personages as well as what <br/>
thoughts he had about various things.<br/>
<br/>
No mention of Shinsengumi or Ryoshingumi as far as I could tell from <br/>
the indexes. <br/>
<br/>
What sort of interest (if any) do the folks here have with respect to <br/>
this material? What persons or events do you think would be of <br/>
interest to this list or the mirror site?   Just wanted to ask before <br/>
I started taking notes.   (Already extracted references and personal <br/>
thoughts w.r.t  to Takasugi Shinsaku...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035642678">Itagaki Taisuke, was in charge of the first Meiji government army into the <br/>
area (the one which stormed Bonari Pass). It was his men who set the fires that <br/>
destroyed the samurai homes which surrounded the castle. Pillaging and burning <br/>
obviously are a common part of war, but they might have also been trying to <br/>
remove anything that would keep their cannon from striking the castle since <br/>
they fired on it day and night after that. And these blazes had to be pretty <br/>
intense because it began to rain around the same time. According to witness Shiba <br/>
Goro, it looked like a "sea of fire".<br/>

there are "clouds" to divide the different battle scenes but if you <br/>
click on the image to zoom in you will also see a gate on fire and <br/>
houses on fire.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also 2 narratives connected to the Byakkotai regarding <br/>
fire.  1) the Byakkotai saw the smoke/flames around the castle which <br/>
was set by the Aizu defenders themselves OR 2) the fires were set by <br/>
the enemy ofcourse the fires regardless of who set them resulted in <br/>
their mass suicide...I've read both these 2 different versions in <br/>
published texts.<br/>
<br/>
The heavy downpour MissB mentioned in her post also resulted in <br/>
extremely muddy conditions.<br/>
