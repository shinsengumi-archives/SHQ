<h3>Ikedaya, 1864 Choshu terrorism, and &quot;Heaven&#39;s Punishment&quot;</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779580813">Some of us have heard &quot;tenchu&quot; (heaven&#39;s punishment) from manga such<br/>
as Rurouni Kenshin. It was the campaign through which supporters of<br/>
the shogunate were &quot;punished&quot; (by murder), and by which the &quot;glorious&quot;<br/>
Meiji &quot;order&quot; was brought into being. However, the victims of this<br/>
campaign of &quot;heaven&#39;s punishment&quot; were by no means all &quot;corrupt<br/>
officials.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the 18th of the 4th month of Genji 1 (23 May 1864), one such murder<br/>
occurred. This was during the buildup to Ikedaya.<br/>
<br/>
Now who was killed in this attack? Was it some corrupt tax official? A<br/>
repressive police inspector? A government stool pigeon?<br/>
<br/>
None of the above.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may know of Prince Nakagawa-no-miya Asahiko, one of<br/>
Satsuma and Aizu&#39;s supporters at the court during this time. He&#39;s also<br/>
in Barbara Sheridan&#39;s Bakumatsu/Shinsengumi novel &quot;Mirror, Mirror.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These victims were the mother and young child of Prince Asahiko&#39;s<br/>
chief steward.<br/>
<br/>
One cannot help but wonder...what guilt do an old woman and a young<br/>
child have in national politics? Maybe it&#39;s just my opinion, but to<br/>
answer &quot;guilt by association&quot; is simply irresponsible.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another &quot;tenchu&quot; victim who died because of &quot;guilt by<br/>
association&quot;: on the 6th of the 5th month (June 9, 1864), an artist by<br/>
the name of Reizei Tamechika, who served another pro-Shogunate noble,<br/>
was assassinated by Oraku Gentaro-- the man later protected by<br/>
Kawakami Gensai (this act on Gensai&#39;s part was what condemned him to<br/>
death). Reizei had known his life was in danger, and had fled to<br/>
various places around the Kamigata (Kyoto-Osaka) area before Oraku got<br/>
him. Reizei was not only killed, his head was also displayed in a<br/>
prominent place for passers-by to see.<br/>
<br/>
Think of these events, if you would: an old woman, child, and an<br/>
artist, connected to people with the &quot;wrong&quot; sympathies-- hunted down<br/>
like animals and murdered in cold blood.<br/>
<br/>
The Shinsengumi were fully aware of these events. Put yourselves in<br/>
their place, raiding an inn full of arsonists (Ikedaya). However, also<br/>
keep in mind that Shinsengumi was conceived and intended to do &quot;dirty&quot;<br/>
work. They interrogated, even tortured people for information. The<br/>
leadup to Ikedaya alone saw at least 5 or 6 Choshu men brutally<br/>
tortured before Furutaka Shuntaro&#39;s infamous beat-down. Shinsengumi,<br/>
as we know, also assassinated people at times. They also had their<br/>
fair share of cruel men, swindlers, and murderers.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, I&#39;d like to leave you with a piece of Reizei Tamechika&#39;s<br/>
art. Remember, this is the innocent man whose head was a blood-stained<br/>
symbol of &quot;heaven&#39;s punishment&quot;:<br/>
