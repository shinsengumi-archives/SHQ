<h3>Tokugawa Yoshinobu&#39;s last words</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995753677">(Quoted from "The Last Shogun", by Shiba Ryuutarou)<br/>
<br/>
"Just before he died, his physician leaned over the pillow and asked,<br/>
"Are you in pain?" Yoshinobu answered faintly, in an extremely<br/>
accurate description of his condition: "No, I am just weak. The pain<br/>
is gone." Those were his last words. A few minutes later, at 4:10 PM<br/>
on November 21, 1913, he was gone."<br/>
<br/>
I was stunned when I read this.<br/>
<br/>
"No, I am just weak. The pain is gone."<br/>
<br/>
I know that he was sick, but these words, in my opinion, have a deeper<br/>
meaning as well. As someone who is currently writing a book that is<br/>
partly about the Tokugawa and what _might_ have been, it hurt to read<br/>
these words. What hurt and stung even more was reading what Emperor<br/>
Meiji said to Ito Hirobumi (the Prime minister), after having received<br/>
Yoshinobu at the new Imperial Palace (formerly Edo Castle), and having<br/>
bestowed upon him the rank of Koshaku (marquis):<br/>
<br/>
"Yesterday I was finally able to do something to show my gratitude to<br/>
Yoshinobu. I ought to be grateful; after all, I took the country away<br/>
from him!"<br/>
<br/>
Arrogant little snot....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read a very deep meaning into those words myself especially when I <br/>
think of what happened to those in Aizu and Nagaoka.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Meiji being an arrogant snot. He might very well have been, <br/>
being a "child of privilege",  but I have a feeling the portrayal of him <br/>
the Last Samurai might not be too far off. When his father died he was <br/>
only 16 or so, correct?<br/>
<br/>
 I can very much see him pushed and bullied-- excuse me--"advised" by <br/>
older stronger men who told him what he wanted to hear as long as he <br/>
publicly backed their personal agendas which they no doubt insisted was <br/>
for the "good of the people and nothing more."<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know. That portrayal in "The Last Samurai" was rather moving,<br/>
actually. Plus, Nakamura Shichinosuke (the actor who played him) is a<br/>
real Kabuki actor, so it felt all the more realistic.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry if I flew off the handle. It's just that...for some reason,<br/>
I feel acutely aware of the pain and humiliation that the Tokugawa and<br/>
their retainers must have felt at being "outcasts" and "enemies of the<br/>
Court", when it really had nothing to do with the Court, and<br/>
everything to do with Choshuu and Satsuma's efforts for<br/>
self-advancement. Again, I'm sorry I lost control. As a<br/>
historian-in-training, it's OK to feel emotional, but I realize that I<br/>
have to train myself to be able to better keep my cool.<br/>
<br/>
( :::Hugs imaginary Ayu-nee plushie::: ) I'm much better now...^_^<br/>
