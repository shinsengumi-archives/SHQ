<h3>2 Questions</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472533600">I looked through the FAQ and SHQ site, but couldn't seem to find it -<br/>
were *all* of the Shinsengumi members of the Samurai class, or did<br/>
they have a sort of "open enrollment" (Or part two - were there any<br/>
notable non-samurai members?). And, where can I find a good detailed<br/>
floorplan of the Ikedaya?  The Shinsengumi book I have here has a<br/>
small floorplan, but I'm looking for a little more detail.</div>

 </span></blockquote>There were people who were of non-samurai background in Shinsengumi, for <br/>
sure. Even some people who were on record as ronin such as Kondou originally <br/>
came from peasant/farmer or other backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
p. 254 of "Shinsengumi" by Oishi Manabu actually has a chart answering the <br/>
question you just posed, covering at least some of the more notable members. <br/>
In the "Commoner" section, under "farmers", for instance, are Inoue <br/>
Genzaburo, Kano Michinosuke, Hijikata Toshizou, Miyagawa Shinkichi, Motoi <br/>
Kazusaburo, and Yokokura Jingoro. I know, I know, Hijikata did go around <br/>
"selling" stuff (merchant), but his family had peasant/farmer roots, too.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, there were even some former religious figures in <br/>
Shinsengumi, such as Ando Hayataro.<br/>

Is this "Shinsengumi no Jidai" I assume? Seems to be out of print on<br/>
amazon.co.jp, and seems to be the only book the UH library doesn't<br/>
have on the Shinsengumi.  I don't suppose you have any ideas on any<br/>
other books where a similar list could be found?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328010263">Thank you to both Kitsuno and Seven for these images; they are perfectly <br/>
timed for an adventure that I am putting together for my role-playing <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a couple of questions, though. The first concerns the labeling <br/>
on Kitsuno's map. The rooms have labels such as "6巾占" (hopefully the <br/>
message encoding allows the kanji to display; if not, I'm referring to <br/>
the labels with a number followed by a three-stroke and a five-stroke <br/>
kanji). I'm familiar with the convention of expressing room sizes by the <br/>
number of tatami, but I learned that as 6-jou (6 畳) and could not find <br/>
the map's notation in my dictionaries. Does the notation on the map mean <br/>
the same thing? If so, what is the distinction between the two?<br/>
<br/>
The two maps are clearly derived from the same original source. Is this <br/>
known to be a historically accurate map of the Ikedaya, or drawn from <br/>
typical inns of the period (or perhaps the set of one of the Shinsengumi <br/>
films)?<br/>
<br/>
What would the exterior grounds look like (other than the rear garden)? <br/>
Narrow alleys between the<br/>
adjacent buildings or a larger lot, potentially with a fence or wall <br/>
around the whole property?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in the interest of giving due credit, what are the sources for <br/>
these two maps?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

finally let me get my head around the structure) and even a few photos, <br/>

able to ascertain whether they will ship outside of Japan (their old <br/>
site would not allow it, but they have recently changed hosting <br/>
providers and their email from the new site bounces).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760573677">Thanks, I guess this is about the best I can hope for - it looks like<br/>
the size is going to mostly have to be estimated based on the size of<br/>
the rooms and little things like the size of "standard" shoji tracks<br/>
and things like that.  It should work, though.  And I've seen the site<br/>
with the info on who went where, so I am going to incorporate that<br/>
info into one version of the floorplan as well.<br/>
