<h3>Shinsengumimb.com is now open</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-980189903">shinsengumimb.com is an ezboard messageboard which will serve our<br/>
community and attract new members.  The long term goal is to keep<br/>
everyone united and drive visitors to our homebase at<br/>
shinsengumihq.com...if this board is successful I will send invites to<br/>
Japanese messageboards <br/>
<br/>
If you would for me to include a link to your site let me know and<br/>
provide a button as well.<br/>
<br/>
There may be a few problems with the messageboard (I can't detect<br/>
anything because there have only been 2 posts)...if so just email me<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:secretarytocapt3@...">secretarytocapt3@...</a> and I will get to them Saturday<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can VIEW the messageboard<br/>
however you must register at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ezboard.com/">http://www.ezboard.com/</a> to POST<br/>
My rules are: <br/>
1) you must be atleast 18 just because recommendations for yaoi<br/>
stories may be posted<br/>
2) to please be respectful and abstain from the use of profanity<br/>
3) whenever possible include a link to wherever you got your info...if<br/>
you can't remember then it should go in the "folktales" section which<br/>
will house rumors<br/>
4) strict adherence to the code of bushido<br/>
<br/>
*Personal Icon to 10x10 px <br/>
You have to upload your own icon and type in the URL exactly in your<br/>
profiles<br/>
Please do not steal other people's bandwidth...you can get an account<br/>
at www.geocities.com to host images<br/>
<br/>
*Limit Personal Photo to 60x60 px I believe this will appear only on<br/>
your profile page<br/>
<br/>
*Ranks/Titles<br/>
I can also designate ranks for you such as Daimyo, Chief, Captain,<br/>
Secretary, Accountant, Fundoshi Washer, Historian, Kenjutsu Teacher,<br/>
Jiujutsu Teacher, Harada's girl etc.  You'll just have to register<br/>
then send me a personal message or email me at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:secretarytocapt3@...">secretarytocapt3@...</a><br/>

How to Bold Text Within a Post<br/>
Sometimes you'll want to emphasize a word or phrase within a post.<br/>
Making the text bold is often a great way to do this.<br/>
<strong> this is bold text </strong><br/>
Result: this is bold text<br/>

How to Create a Link That Opens in a New Window<br/>
Linking somewhere else will take them away from a post. Adding the<br/>
target="_blank" parameter will open a new window so that they never leave.<br/>
<a href="<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ezboard.com/"">http://www.ezboard.com/"</a>  target="blank"> this link will<br/>
pop-up a new window</a><br/>
 Result: this link will pop-up a new window<br/>
[if you notice on all the links at the top of the messageboard...I<br/>
made it so that a new page will be opened for everyone's convenience]<br/>
<br/>
How to Add an Image to Your Post<br/>
Perhaps one of the most popular tags used within posts.<br/>
<img src="<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ezboard.com/image/csc_goldcommunity.gif"">http://www.ezboard.com/image/csc_goldcommunity.gif"</a>></div>
