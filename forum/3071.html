by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-486634172">Historically, the first work of fiction to be published in English <br/>
was:<br/>
<br/>
Dai-bosatsu Toge printed in 1929<br/>

<br/>
and now we have...<br/>
MIRROR MIRROR<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MirrorMirror.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MirrorMirror.htm</a><br/>
which was written by Barbara Sheridan who for many years has <br/>
supported Shinsengumihq.com financially and oversaw this list with <br/>
her awesome omnipotence and wisdom<br/>
<br/>
I would like to congratulate her on this historical mark in Western <br/>
Shinsengumi fandom (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
We will post news on MIrror Mirror here on the mailing list and on <br/>

MIRROR, MIRROR<br/>
by Barbara Sheridan<br/>
<br/>
Emiko &quot;Emmi&quot; Maeda didn&#39;t plan to spend the last summer vacation<br/>
before college kidnaping the future Emperor of Japan. And she didn&#39;t<br/>
expect to be chased, attacked, or seduced by sword wielding samurai or<br/>
put on the marriage market by an ancestor who died a century before<br/>
she was born, but she was. And it all started with a shabby old mirror<br/>
she found after publicly humiliating herself...</div>

<br/>
Anyway, the multi-talented Child #2 has designed the very cool manga <br/>
style cover for said book and the publisher has deemed it to be <br/>
&quot;Perfect&quot; so I give you the Official Website!!!<br/>
<br/>
You can see the cover under the About the book link at the site below. <br/>
At the Characters link you can find out which Shinsengumi members appear <br/>
and get the low down on some other historically inspired stuffs...<br/>
