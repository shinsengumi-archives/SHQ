<br/>
go to the PHOTOS folder, click on Shinsengumi + Related Peopled...the<br/>
3 new images should show up last<br/>
<br/>
all 3 images have the magazine ISBN # on them...I think if you are<br/>
going to make a purchase you should list the books you want or music<br/>
cds you want and buy everything at once to save on shipping.<br/>
<br/>
I secretly pray that KON ICHIKAWA&#39;s (director of MANY great films such<br/>
as Burmese Harp and the KEY) ANIMATED FILM &quot;SHINSENGUMI&quot; is released<br/>
on DVD so I can buy everything at once....</div>
