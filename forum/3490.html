<br/>
Seems like this site has died out, how very sad.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I was wondering if there were ever any ukiyo-e prints of the shinsengumi made... I don't mean modern ones, but something made back in the day they were alive or even sometime after there disbandment... I was particularly interested in finding one of Saitou Hajime.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
