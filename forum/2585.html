[updated timeline]<br/>
still contains mixture of lunar+solar calendar dates, grammar errors,<br/>
last name first name reversals, typos (too tired to double check now)<br/>

just use the timeline to get an "idea" of the order of events--but do<br/>
not quote it (except in the case of actual quotes from decent sources<br/>
incorporated into the timeline.  List of sources at the bottom of the<br/>
page)<br/>

[boring stuff on textual sources]<br/>
Please take the time to review Romulus Hillsborough's book <br/>
Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</a><br/>
My review has not posted in a week now. I gave it 3 stars and<br/>
everything ::shrugs::<br/>
<br/>
aha!  I figured out why the title was changed to include "Last<br/>
Samurai" the book turns up in searches related to the Tom Cruise movie* <br/>
<br/>
XD<br/>
<br/>
love it, hate it, or completely neutral the book will be the only<br/>
source of info on the Shinsengumi for years to come<br/>
<br/>
hence my dismay at Hillsborough's unprofessional approach to the<br/>
controversial group.  Let's say a serious student or researcher<br/>
searches for anything with the word "Shinsengumi" all they'll get is<br/>
this book and the occasional 1 sentence mentioned in some academic<br/>
journal article.  Thus, writers must try to be as responsible as<br/>
possible and think beyond their own personal agenda before publishing<br/>
anything remotely related to non-fiction.  Hillsborough ofcourse noted<br/>
that his work is not entirely non-fiction (I mentioned this in my<br/>
review) but that doesn't mean he shouldn't give this project his best<br/>
effort.  We all know the Shinsengumi have long since entered the world<br/>
of folk tales.<br/>
<br/>
Hillsborough was missing many many good sources to use for his book.<br/>
<br/>
as I was working on some stuff for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> I<br/>
turned to arguably the best book on why the shogunate system<br/>
fell...after using it for a doorstop for many months<br/>
<br/>
Totman, Conrad. The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu 1862-1868 Hawaii:<br/>
The University of Hawaii Press, 1980. ISBN: 082480614X<br/>
<br/>
both the Shinsengumi, Kondou Isami and Mimwari (Not indexed) are<br/>
mentioned...more importantly Totman included the end note on Kondou's<br/>
report given to Kyoto officials on Oct 9 1867.  <br/>
<br/>
This report is was reproduced in Kitahara Masanaga's book SHICHINENSHI<br/>
printed in 1904.<br/>
<br/>
see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a> <br/>
do an 'edit' and 'find' for "Oct 9"<br/>
<br/>
The Shichinenshi (SNS) was used by Totman alongside the Dai Nihon<br/>
Ishin Shiryo kohon (Manuscript of historical materials on the<br/>
restoration) DNISK "by far the greatest collection of historical<br/>
materials relating to the Meiji restoration but has been almost unused<br/>
by western scholars" (Totman 549).<br/>
<br/>
The Shichinenshi was the first attempt to understand the politics of<br/>
1868 from the shogunate's point of view, but more specifically the<br/>
side of Aizu.  Totman used SNS alongside KYOTO SHUGOSHOKU SHIMATSU<br/>
(the story of the Kyoto Protector) written by Yamakawa Hiroshi printed<br/>
by Numazawa/Numasawa Shichirou adopted father of Tokio+Goro's third son.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I can only hope that both these works (used by many<br/>
researchers) discussed Aizu's most famous security group, the<br/>
Shinsengumi.  Yamakawa Hiroshi, an Aizu samurai, was a personal friend<br/>
of Fujita Goro (we know Hiroshi best as the guy who put Goro and Tokio<br/>
together).  Hiroshi's younger brother, Kenjiro, wrote Aizu boshin<br/>
senshi (several hundred pages, perhaps in collaboration with others).<br/>
  The "status" of the Shinsengumi in these 2 works by the Yamakawa<br/>
brothers should reveal some interesting details.  AFterall both<br/>
brothers knew a former captain of the Shinsengumi, not to mention<br/>
numerous other survivors from Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
Aizu Beyond 1868<br/>

is a study of the domain's Tokyo network, note the publication dates<br/>
and who was still alive to read many of the works...</div>
