The Big Deal about the "shed"<br/>
<br/>
[<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm%5d">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm%5d</a><br/>
Fuijita Midori (wife of Fujita Tsutomu) told her daughter in law<br/>
Fujita Natsuko (wife of Fujita Minoru) that there was a magnificent<br/>
shed in [Hideo Takamine's] homestead, and it was full of treasures<br/>
such as swords or arts treasures. Although the shed was always<br/>
locked, only Goro was allowed to enter this freely. Since Goro was<br/>
good at judging swords, he was often asked to judge or repair<br/>
swords.<br/>
<br/>
"shed" is KURA or what westerners call a "godown"....<br/>

(anyone here with a bio or medical background who would like to <br/>
contribute to this essay please let us know...no we're not asking <br/>
for doctors just someone who knows more science than the author of <br/>
this essay  ^_^)<br/>

I [think] in this film Okita Souji 1974 <br/>

Okita dies with his eyes open...<br/>
<br/>
There is a real life basis for this.  <br/>
Often TB patients die of asphyxiation and during their last moments <br/>
gasp for air.  This is noted in the novel THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN (cited <br/>
in the Okita + TB essay) and also implied in the biography of TB <br/>
patient, Emma Dickerman Straight (American teacher at Tokio's <br/>
school) when her friend watched as the light left her eyes (Emma <br/>
died before her friend found her).<br/>
<br/>

Ellison, David L. Healing Tuberculosis in the Woods: Medicine and <br/>
Science at the End of the Nineteenth Century. Connecticut: Greenwood <br/>
Press, 1994. <br/>

and this book...<br/>

<br/>
ARE TOTALLY CONNECTED...because one of [TAKAGI TOKIO's] cousins Saze <br/>
Hidesabro's death from TB contracted from an American woman <br/>
*convinced* ALFRED L. Loomis (state level medical official and <br/>
recognized authority on respiratory illnesses) that TB was <br/>
not "inherited" (in the family) but infectious and can jump from one <br/>
race to another.  Doctors Loomis and Trudeau later became the most <br/>
notable American pioneers in TB research in the United States.  <br/>
Trudeau is often listed right under that of Dr. Koch (German) who <br/>
actually discovered the tuberculosis bacterium.<br/>
