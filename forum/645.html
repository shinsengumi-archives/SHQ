<h3>At long last --- Saitou spying on Kenshin?</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-615259">Some time ago, MissB made note on the messageboard of a guy who <br/>
looked like Saitou among Raijuta&#39;s henchmen (the episode in Izu where <br/>
we meet Yutaro --- I&#39;ve forgotten the specifics, but I think it&#39;s <br/>
episode 20?).  Unfortunately, Black Faery never got my &quot;HELP&quot; email, <br/>
but she&#39;s come through for us after I resent the info to her last <br/>
night.  She sent me two screenshots, which I&#39;ve put in the Photos <br/>
section in a folder titled &quot;Saitou in Disguise.&quot;  I don&#39;t think MissB <br/>
or I are crazy --- that&#39;s got to be Saitou! (Keep in mind that in the <br/>
anime, when Saitou and Kenshin meet again after 10 years at Kaoru&#39;s <br/>
dojo, Saitou makes a comment about how Kenshin let a fool like <br/>
Raijuta wound him in battle... hinting at maybe he was there to see <br/>
the fight.)  What do the rest of you think, hmmm?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to put the screenshots up on my shrine site (Let&#39;s Hear It <br/>
For the Boy!) and will post a link to them on shinsengumimb.com.  <br/>
Give me a couple days, though, okay?  :-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746920262">Good going Phil! Thanks Black Faery for me too... The first picture <br/>
definitely reminds me of RK Saitou... The second well I guess he <br/>
just looks more menacing and psycho... I&#39;m going to need to find <br/>
those discs and watch that episode again.. <br/>
