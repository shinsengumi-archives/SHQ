<h3>People Talk: RK Fujita</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610046055">I&#39;ve been busily and happily (obsessively?) capturing images from the <br/>
RK manga (thanks to Grace!) of Saitou (up to 880, maybe 2/3 of the <br/>
way through the Jinchuu arc) and ran into this.  This is the first <br/>
time I&#39;ve seen the manga in its original format and I&#39;m running into <br/>
things that either I hadn&#39;t noticed before or had forgotten.  I don&#39;t <br/>
remember the men in the Tokyo jail gossiping about who Fujita really <br/>
is.  Reminded me of discussions we&#39;ve had about whether or not people <br/>
in the department knew his true identity.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve uploaded that portion of page 19 from chapter 218 <br/>
(volume 25) of the manga into the Photos section.  Wasn&#39;t sure if it <br/>
was appropriate to any of the folders, so it&#39;s just sitting there on <br/>
its own.  Sweet little scene.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412368652">Glad to hear you&#39;ve been having a good time Phil... I myself have <br/>
never read the manga only because I have the untranslated manga and <br/>
am studying Nihon-go (little progress though). <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s kind of interesting that they&#39;d know about Fujita... Who <br/>
leaked it? I wonder if it&#39;s a mistake by Watsuki since if those kind <br/>
of rumors were up and about, being an undercover agent would be no <br/>
good. Come to think of it, Fujita going about as a policeman by day <br/>
and then also going undercover on the side, it&#39;s a little weird for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if at this point in the manga, did it still matter? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657403403">Fujita by day is the squinting/smiling Fujita we all know and love.<br/>
Saitou the spy is different.  Unlike Kenshin he can control his two<br/>
&quot;personas&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you read the timeline at 3-hajime.com there seems to be some<br/>
overlapping (or multitasking?) involved with his job in the<br/>
police...because it will say &quot;inspector&quot;, &quot;inspector probationary<br/>
duties&quot; and so on and so forth with slightly different labels.<br/>
<br/>
So in the RK world maybe the police know him as Lt. Fujita but have<br/>
absolutely no idea about the other stuff...it be between Lt. Fujita<br/>
and Kawaji.<br/>
