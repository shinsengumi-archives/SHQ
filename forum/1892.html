<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179432577">This is a training costume for Yamabushi, a Buddhist ascetic in the <br/>
mountain.<br/>
As for inscriptions, I see the name of Oomine san, (Oomine mountain) <br/>
nearby Nara where is a sanctuary and the training place for <br/>
Shugendo.(Bouddist ascetic in the mountain), and still now women are not <br/>
allowed to enter the place. ( Like Mount Athos )<br/>
I can notice also some Bonji ( Sanskrit inscriptions). I think one means<br/>
Boudda Achala (or Fudou in Japanese, someone could remember the tattoo <br/>
on someone's back... grin) and some of his representations.<br/>
I can recognize also inscription of Hannya Shingyo the essence of the <br/>
Prajna-paramita Sutra.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071341412">I would like to try to elaborate on the important point TAma gave to us<br/>
Prajna-paramita Sutra<br/>
Prajna (Praj) is wisdom<br/>
Paramita is "reaching the other shore" (its a simile where<br/>
dhamma/dharma (the way) is your raft which allows you to reach the<br/>
"shore"/nippana/nirvana/release/emptiness...paramita is "perfection"<br/>
so<br/>
Prajna-Paramita Sutra is the [Perfection of Wisdom] (a book which uses<br/>
similes to illustrate the path of the Bodhisattva)<br/>
<br/>
The "essence" of the Perfection of Wisdom is also called "Prajna<br/>
paramita hrdaya sutra"<br/>
<br/>
And to understand the nature of "emptiness" I guess you need to spend<br/>
alot of time in the forest alone and meditate.... (^_^)<br/>

<h3>Saitou Hajime/Sherlock Holmes Crossover Fic Contest</h3>

<h3>Re: Mission Impossible (Mugai ryu)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908992894">[The following is a theory]<br/>
maybe the discussion on the Prajna-paramita Sutra is not so off topic<br/>
after all.  <br/>
Mugai ryu is the dominant lineage practiced by Saitou Hajime (he<br/>
practiced more than one)<br/>
This is based on what Mugai ryu "sounds" like and not the actual<br/>
characters (I don't know Japanese).<br/>
[MU-Gai-Ryu]<br/>
ryu = as we know from RK is lineage<br/>
<br/>
Gai (1 syllable word) = [sounds] like Gaay or Kaya (2 syllable words)<br/>
which is "body" "shape" or "form" (the word has indic origins) when<br/>
either pali or sanskrit gets transferred into another language such as<br/>
Japanese some basic phonological changes take place<br/>
<br/>
*for example the last syllable in pali or Sanskrit words is dropped<br/>
when the word enters Thai (a Southeast Asian language) and the word<br/>
gaay in Thai today still means "body"<br/>
<br/>
So I made a parallel comparison and try to better understand the name<br/>
of the lineage<br/>
<br/>
Mugai ryu according to NIfty's crude translation is "NO OUTER FORM"<br/>
<br/>
the lack of form is related to...formlessness/emptiness and<br/>
"tracelessness" a major point in the Prajna Paramita Hrdaya Sutra or<br/>
Heart Sutra<br/>
<br/>
so in a nutshell....the Ebay item actually may have shed some light,<br/>
for me atleast, on the meaning of "Mugai"<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
who finds these possible connections so cool :)<br/>
Ebay is turning out to be a great learning tool<br/>

This is not Haori. <br/>
Correctly, it is Kimono called Joue. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www5.ocn.ne.jp/~room884/joue.html">http://www5.ocn.ne.jp/~room884/joue.html</a><br/>

Formal clothes of Yamabushi.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www9.ocn.ne.jp/~sanjyuin/">http://www9.ocn.ne.jp/~sanjyuin/</a><br/>
<br/>
Joue was an aristocrat's everyday wear at first. <br/>
It is made of cotton, it is white and there is no family crest. <br/>
In the subsequent time, the Shinto priest and the mountain priest <br/>
(Yamabushi) wore it.<br/>
(Although it is not related to Shinsengumi, many Yamabushis appear <br/>
in Taiga drama next year.) <br/>
<br/>
Although it is written that this Joue is the thing of Meiji Era, it <br/>
is wonderful if it is true. <br/>
Although it is said that Kimono remains for 100 years, it is rare <br/>
that it is truly existing. <br/>
(If a material is hemp, it is still more so.) <br/>
Of course, when expensive Kimono is preserved carefully, it remains <br/>
finely.<br/>
A granddaughter is able to wear Kimono which the grandmother wore. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, this is Haori. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.craft.ne.jp/muromachi/kate1/page6.html">http://www.craft.ne.jp/muromachi/kate1/page6.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This store is producing the same Haori as Haori of Taiga drama.^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is Happi with the clothes similar to Haori. <br/>
It is the clothes worn at the time of a festival. <br/>
Although it resembles Haori and is very cheap, it is the clothes <br/>
with which a use is different. <br/>
Although Happi of Shinsengumi is sold at tourist resorts, such as <br/>
Asakusa, please do not mistake it for Haori.^^;;; <br/>
Since Haori folds and wears a collar, it is made very finely.<br/>
