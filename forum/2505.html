<h3>One last question Re: Sleeve Insignia</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425464432">Ok, I&#39;ve kind of given up on getting the actual dimensions.  Just one<br/>
last request if someone can actually get the exhibit book.  I&#39;d like a<br/>
high res scan of the page whenever it could be had (since my<br/>
interpretation of my translated search implies I can&#39;t get a copy of<br/>
the book myself).  I&#39;d just like a really, really sharp version of it<br/>
without the pixelation.  Maybe like 600 DPI or so.  If it can be done,<br/>
awesome.  If not, thanks for taking the time to read this post.<br/>

Michael, I didn&#39;t forget, please be patient<br/>
the explanation for the sleeve insignia, in English, did not mention<br/>
dimensions<br/>
<br/>
none of the images were scanned with that kind of resolution<br/>
<br/>
you can get a copy of the book yourself---I did (^_^) and I&#39;m in the<br/>
states.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820204809">Thanks, to both you and Barbara.  =)  I wasn&#39;t being<br/>
impatient.  I did some thinking and for what I would<br/>
like the insignia for, actual size isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Barbara, if you&#39;re reading this the screencap would be<br/>
awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I just found out my old friend from JHS is in Japan<br/>
doing JET.  I&#39;m going to see if I can get him to pick<br/>
up the book in person for me - if he&#39;s up to a trip to<br/>
the museum, that is.<br/>
