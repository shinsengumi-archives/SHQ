<h3>Historic Nagakura&#39;s Personality...Shimazuryu?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842173768">I was reading a Japanese site and people had to fill out a <br/>
questionaire like who would you want to have as your brother...and <br/>
many said Nagakura Shinpachi...is there something about historic <br/>
Nagakura Shinpachi that makes him soo attractive in this way?  <br/>
<br/>
I understand the PMK Nagakura version is very cute but the site I <br/>
went to was obviously referring to the historic people because (many <br/>
references to historic S.H.) although the women were attracted to <br/>
Hijikata they were kind of &quot;afraid&quot; of him.</div>
