<h3>More 3-hajime Translation and Fujita Kamon in LS</h3>

<br/>
the details of the third son&#39;s adoption is much more clear...and<br/>
Fujita Goro&#39;s career or should I say careerS...he also had a rank in<br/>
the army as well and was dismissed...in terms of his job as an<br/>
inspector...he ended up being the chief inspector...and his 1st<br/>
granddaughter Motoko died when whe was 3 years old...and Midori&#39;s<br/>
(Tokio+Goro&#39;s daughter in law) story is much more clear too<br/>
<br/>
I had to watch the 2nd disk of LAST SAMURAI and I found this...<br/>

so it makes sense that a family&#39;s crest is not unique at all but I<br/>
wonder since the 9 bamboo leaves can be used by many folks I wonder<br/>
what businesses they had and so forth too...</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113622536">I asked some questions and got some answers...you have to read the <br/>
new translations to understand the following...<br/>
<br/>
[QUESTION]&quot;dismissed&quot; so he was fired?  Because it is a very short <br/>
period form  January to September and because I do not know what <br/>
GOYOOGAKARI means in  relation to sergeant...this part is confusing <br/>
sergeant in the army or police?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he was fired.  Maybe, I should have used the word <br/>
&quot;discarged&quot;? First, I looked up dictionary, and Goroo means to <br/>
arrest criminals or the position to arrest criminals.  So, the job <br/>
has something to do &quot;sergeant,&quot; and to be a sergeant from <br/>
Goyoogakari seems to be promotion.  Since Saitoo <br/>
Hajime was appointed to be a sergeant just 2 months after his <br/>
discharge from Goyoogakari, it seems that he quit Goyoogakari for <br/>
the promotion to be a sergeant. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[QUESTION]About the adoption of the third son is something my <br/>
friends are interested in because adoption was so common and the son <br/>
was related Tokio...why should it be a secret?  It is strange.  <br/>
There is no reason to keep adoption secret in Japanese culture?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In Japanese culture, it is very common to make adoption secret.  One <br/>
of the reason is we think the blood boundary is extremely <br/>
important.  The idea was much stronger in old times.<br/>
Maybe, there is an idea that if the child knows he is not real child <br/>
of his parents, the family cannot keep their solidarity.  Also, we <br/>
have respected the blood or genealogy.  Still now, adoption is not <br/>
common like the U.S. and some people want to make it secret in Japan.<br/>
It is interesting, I&#39;ve never thought about it...<br/>
<br/>
[QUESTION] Also Tokio was like a dorm inspector at the school.  So <br/>
the school had a dormitory for students but in the translation it is <br/>
mentioned that students can stay at her home too or just to visit <br/>
her home?  <br/>
<br/>
It means that Tokio let some students live at her house.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know the system of dorm at that time, but I think not everybody had <br/>
to live in dorm.<br/>
<br/>
[secretarytocapt3 thinks]  Poor inspector Fujita, after a long hard <br/>
day at work catching criminal scum, writing reports he had to come <br/>
home to a house full of....girls LOL!</div>

Maybe it&#39;s understandable why there may have been a caveat to the adoption.... he&#39;d seen enough of what it&#39;s like living with teenage girls (depending on when she started taking in boarders, of course).  :-D<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-1437">&gt;</a> Dating during the Meiji Era</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-452823463">Imagine yourself to be a decent, nice young man...you would like to<br/>
date one of the eligible educated ladies who is staying at the Fujita<br/>
family&#39;s home.  What if you had the misfortune of having to wait for<br/>
your girlfriend in the living room and Mr. Fujita happened to be home<br/>
that day...<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro, not one to engage in chit chat, stares at would be suitor<br/>
(who is sweating beads), gets bored, brings out sword collection and<br/>
examines a blade while asking...<br/>
&quot;so young man, what&#39;s your name, where are you from, where are your<br/>
parents from, how old are you, what are you studying, do you have a<br/>
job, do you know martial arts, and when can we expect our young lady<br/>
home? Hmmm?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Suitor [thinking] &quot;why do I feel like I&#39;m being interrogated---oh wait<br/>
he is a cop---what am I thinking?!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tokio walks by room [thinking] &quot;uh oh, this young man is going to<br/>
crack under pressure and Goro is already showing off some of his<br/>
weapons&quot; Tokio rushes off to remind young lady (who still can&#39;t decide<br/>
what to wear ^_^) to hurry up.<br/>
