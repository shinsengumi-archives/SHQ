<h3>Media news!</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-526240708">I have some very interesting information passed on to me by one of our <br/>
more quiet members Tama, (originally from Tokyo, btw)<br/>
# # # # # #<br/>
&quot;There is a new anime series now broadcasted in Japan called &quot;Shura no <br/>
toki&quot;based on a manga of same title.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know very much about the series, and it&#39;s not only focused on <br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
But I know that the story talks about a special martial arts technique <br/>
transmitted in the northern region of Mutsu( or Ohshu) and it&#39;s succsesors.<br/>
<br/>
There is three parts of story which takes place in different periods.<br/>
<br/>
First part is related with Musashi Miyamoto, second with Yagyu Jubee, <br/>
and the third one with Okita Souji (in Bakumatsu section).<br/>
<br/>
 From infomation of official site, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/syuratoki/,">http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/syuratoki/,</a> now the section of Yagyu <br/>
Jubee is broadcasted, so Bakumatsu section will be coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
Other thing; Jiro Asada the author of &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; published his new <br/>
novel on Shinsengumi, called &quot;Wachigaiya Itosato&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The story talks about the mistery of assassination of Serizawa Kamo. <br/>
Heroine is Itosato, a geiko in Wachigaiya who fall in love with Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
As the author is very populer in Japan, I expect that this novel would <br/>
be adapted on the screen like Mibugishiden.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4163229507/ref=sr_aps_b_/250-3197124-5159453&quot;">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4163229507/ref=sr_aps_b_/250-3197124-5159453&quot;</a><br/>
# # # # #<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s _that_ for very cool Shinsengumi related information?<br/>
<br/>
And you all thought I was just the resident hopeless fangirl. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, the world definitely NEEDS another film featuring Koichi Sato <br/>
and the still unknown (to me) wonderful actor who played Nagakura.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Tama was kind enough to send me a brief clip of the &quot;Hijikata <br/>
sings&quot; scene from last week&#39;s NHK show and it appears that the song in <br/>
question is a traditional folk song from the region where <br/>
Kondou/Hijikata grew up.<br/>

Do you know, is this the same film as the one with Sagara, or is this another film, a Korean film, with the same title?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523632377">I just opened up the first file (Volume 1, Chapter 1) and it&#39;s a manga from Korea set in the present day.  It isn&#39;t a movie at all.  I hesitated opening it right away because my computer is not cooperating with video files lately and I&#39;ve got stuff on my desktop I wasn&#39;t ready to put to bed, but didn&#39;t want to have to save.  Too curious, so I took the chance it wouldn&#39;t freeze everything up.  What a surprise to find jpgs.  :-)<br/>

Wounds, your heart was exactly in the right place.  It just wasn&#39;t cooperating and tried to fool you.  :-D  Thanks for trying.  And thanks for the hints for identifying the film, Kevin.<br/>
