<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128295024">I think we have questions (^_^)<br/>
but if we know which member of the Shinsengumi it would be better so we <br/>
know what to ask<br/>
<br/>
and ofcourse we understand if he or she cannot answer immediately <br/>
<br/>
thank you so much for keeping us in your thoughts Nefrut we really <br/>
appreciate it !<br/>
