I think they'll take the NHK site for Shinsengumi down soon. I've<br/>
saved the character pictures but I suggest anyone wanting them go save<br/>
them too  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/f_midokoro.html">http://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/f_midokoro.html</a><br/>

Or maybe he's made up and they blended "Kojima SHIrou," "KANO Sozaburou" and "Sagara SanoSUKE."  :-D  Now there's a frightening combination to contemplate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kojima Shikanosuke is the leading farmer of Onoji village, and is <br/>
the sponsor of Tennen Rishin Ryuu. <br/>
And he was Hijikata's distant relative. <br/>
(They are not blood relation. The Hashimoto families which are <br/>
Hijikata's grandmother's parents' home were Kojima and a relative.) <br/>
Kojima Shikanosuke was a farmer and a scholar. <br/>
There were many books in his house. <br/>
Kondou and Hijikata borrowed and studied the book from him. <br/>
Their thought has the large influence from Kojima.<br/>
After becoming Meiji Era, Kojima collected the data about <br/>
Shinsengumi. <br/>
They are preserved carefully and are in the Kojima data hall which <br/>
his posterity manages now. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/">http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/</a><br/>
<br/>
Moreover, he edited a book called "Ryoyuuden", in order to restore <br/>
the honor of Kondou and Hijikata. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Kojima" is the family name which many people have.^^ <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456316556"><for the new members> Please visit "Files" and go to "Steele.htm" I <br/>
have notes about Kojima Tamemasa from the book by William M. <br/>
Steele "Alternative Narratives in Modern Japanese History"<br/>
<br/>
The Kojima family in general is a good example of well educated <br/>
farmers...please see my notes<br/>
<br/>
If you keep reading you will learn about KOndou's fencing student who <br/>
later becomes a leader in a grass-roots political movement in the area<br/>
<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
who is reading Higuchi Ichiyo/Natsuko's very VIVID descriptions about <br/>
Masago-cho/town Hongo/Bunkyo area (where the Fujita Family lived at <br/>
the same exact time)...(literature folks please research English <br/>
language translations of Higuchi Ichiyo's works---she wrote so much I <br/>
can't read it all!)<br/>
<br/>
please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> go to the "meiji Era" forum <br/>
and read my thread on Higuchi Ichiyo....her dad worked in the Tokyo <br/>
Metropolitan Police Department...Ichiyo/Natsuko herself was very shy <br/>
and clearly states in her diary that she was not friendly to her <br/>
neighbors....<br/>
