<h3>Manga mini-reviews</h3>
by <i>niwashi_1</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-594022606">I've recently bought a sampling of several of the Shinsengumi based manga that are available.  I just received most of these a couple weeks ago, and haven't read any of them all the way through yet.  I've read the first few chapters of Getsu Mei Sei Ki, but most of these I've only skimmed through briefly to get a rough idea of what they're about.  I thought people here might be interested in getting an idea of some of what's available though, so I decided to write up a little mini-review giving my initial impressions of each of them.  Once I get a bit farther into really reading them, I hope to post better reviews, but it will probably take a while before I get through all of them.  In the meantime, take my comments with a grain of salt.<br/>
<br/>
I also scanned a few sample images from each of the books so you can get an idea of what the artwork looks like.  (Personally, I find one of the disadvantages of buying manga online to be the fact that I don't get to see what the art looks like until after I've bought it.)  I've also listed what volumes are available in the series and a link to their listing on Amazon.  (The preference given to Amazon isn't entirely intentional, even though that's where I bought most of these.  I was hoping to include links to a couple of places you could buy them, but was distressed to find out that Sasuga Books doesn't carry any of these volumes.  They have some of the later volumes of Kaze Hikaru, but nothing from any of the other series.)<br/>

Shinsengumi Iroku Burai : by Iwasaki Youko (ISBN:4253177670)<br/>
(Some websites list this under just the last portion of the title: "Burai".)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4253177670">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4253177670</a><br/>
<br/>
This manga focuses primarily on Saitou.  The stories in it seem to mostly be made up rather than historical, but there may be some of each, and the major characters are all real.  I like its overall artistic style, which is fairly detailed and designed to make all the major characters beautiful.  My only objection to its artwork is that a few too many of the characters are blonde (most notably Serizawa, Okita, and Harada).  Harada Sanosuke's mane of long curly blonde hair takes some getting used to, but at least his personality seems to be intact.  Hijikata's good looks and gruff personality suit the character well (and he's got such intense piercing eyes - sugoi).  Serizawa and Niimi play a larger role in this than in most of the others.  The lead character, though, is Saitou.  I like this Saitou, but perhaps due to his place as the central figure here, he seems more expressive and less reticent than most depictions I've seen of him.<br/>

Ten made Agare : by Kihara Toshie (ISBN:4253174876)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4253174876">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4253174876</a><br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't care as much for the artistic style of this one.  (The sparkle in everyone's eyes that's bigger than the eyes themselves just started to bug me after a while.)  As a result, I haven't read enough yet to get a clear idea of the storyline.  There's a girl named Koyori who seems to be the central figure of the book.  Okita is the most prominent of the Shinsengumi members, though most of the other well-known figures put in an appearance.  That's about as much as I've picked up so far by just skimming through it.<br/>
<br/>
(I found the Japanese in this book rather difficult to read.  Most words are just spelled out phonetically in kana without the kanji characters they would normally be written in.  I'm sure this is done to make it easier to read for Japanese kids fluent in the language but still learning to read kanji, but it makes it a lot harder to read for adults learning both the language and its writing together.)<br/>

Shinsengumi Okita Souji - Kirameki no Zanzou : (various authors - see below) (ISBN:4056033609)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4056033609">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4056033609</a><br/>
<br/>
This book is a collection of six short stories that all feature Okita Souji.<br/>
<br/>
Sakuduki no Natsu (summer moon-conjunction?) : by Hattori Ayumi<br/>
The simple act of escorting a young lady to her sister's house turns deadly when Okita finds the place under attack, and the girl he escorted may not be what she seemed.  The artwork varies from highly detailed to chibi, but very expressive in each.<br/>
<br/>
Enrai (distant thunder) : by Suzuhara Shino<br/>
This is a very short (only eight pages) story involving a conversation between Okita Souji and Saitou Hajime about Okita's difficulty in dealing with Yamanami Keisuke's seppuku.  The artwork in this story is detailed and realistic (in places incorporating photographic backgrounds).<br/>
<br/>
Kumo no Kirema ni (a break in the clouds) : by Kujou Tomoyodo <br/>
Although Okita figures heavily into the story, this one is really more about Yamazaki Susumu.  A lot of stuff about the importance of protecting those you love, and when is killing justified.  Okita eventually convinces Susumu that some things are worth taking up a sword for.<br/>
<br/>
SOLDIER - Tou (soldier - grieve) : by Mizushima Tooru<br/>
The murder of Serizawa Kamo and some of what led up to it.  The artwork has quite a range from detailed to chibi, but overall is quite good.  (Serizawa has really weird looking hair, though.)<br/>
<br/>
Sekka (snow-flower) : by Himeki Kaori<br/>
In a quick glance through this one, I didn't pick up much of what the story is about, but the artwork is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Katakage ni Saku Kekka (blood-flower blooming in the shade) : by Hayami Yoku<br/>
This one has more conversation than action, so it's harder to pick up on the story by just skimming through it, but there's a scene where Okita was getting mad at a young Shinsengumi member until he finds out that that day was the first time the young man had killed.  That member and one other then get transferred to Okita's unit, but problems with them continue and it turns out that they're... well, I won't give away the ending, but Okita has to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the six manga stories, there's a two page illustrated essay by Nakamura Rie, and a timeline of significant events for the Shinsengumi and its leading members.<br/>

Kaze Hikaru : by Watanabe Taeko (ISBN:4091373518)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4091373518">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4091373518</a><br/>
<br/>
This series already has fan sites in English dedicated to it, which can describe it a lot better than I can after just getting and briefly skimming through the first volume, so I'm not going to say a whole lot here.  The basic premise is about a girl who disguises herself as a guy in order to join the Shinsengumi.  The simplistic artistic style gives the book a somewhat childish feel to it, although from what little I picked up by skimming through it, the writing seems to be better than the artwork, and it may have a good story to it.<br/>
<br/>
This is also soon to be available in English translation from VIZ.  It's just starting to be serialized in their new "Shojo Beat" magazine along with five other manga, and should hopefully be available in book form soon.<br/>

Getsu Mei Sei Ki - Sayonara Shinsengumi : by Morita Kenji (ISBN:409152754X)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/409152754X">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/409152754X</a><br/>
<br/>
I think this may well turn out to be one of my favorites.  Though I wouldn't be qualified to judge its historical accuracy even once I've read enough of this to do so, this has a more historical tone to it than most of the others (with the exception of Hokusou Shinsengumi - the other of my favorites).  The central figure here is Hijikata, though Kondou and Okita are also major characters.  The artwork is realistic and detailed.<br/>
<br/>
About the first two-thirds of chapter 1 takes place in Kyoto in 1864, at the height of the Shinsengumi's popularity.  Many new members are joining the Shinsengumi, but not all of them live up to the Shinsengumi's standards, and Hijikata Toshizou ends up ordering several members to commit seppuku for cowardice.  Kondou and Okita think he's being overly strict, and are concerned about the "demon" reputation he's getting, but Hijikata is resolute, determined to maintain his idealistically pure vision of bushidou as a requirement for the unit.<br/>
<br/>
Then the story jumps back thirteen years and to the Tama district, where a young Toshizou is studying kendo with Shimazaki Katsuta (later to be known as Kondou Isami).  Toshizou is at this point a rather angry young man, obsessed with the idea of becoming a warrior despite his birth, though he's appalled at the actions of many of the men he's seen with that position as a birthright.  By the end of chapter 3, Katsuta invites him to come to Edo with him and study at the Shieikan dojo there, run by Katsuta's adoptive father, Kondou Shuusuke.  There he meets the school's young prodigy, a ten-year-old kid named Okita Soujirou.  They don't exactly hit it off well, as Toshizou is annoyed that this bratty young kid can best him at kendo, and Soujirou is annoyed at being so brusquely dismissed as a "kid".  By chapter 7, affairs in the rest of the country start intruding into the storyline with the arrival of the American black ships, but then chapters 8 and 9 return to a more personal focus as Toshizou's family call him home to attend to business.  They want him to spend a bit more time on earning a living than on learning swordsmanship, and he becomes a medicine seller.<br/>
<br/>
Though not slow-paced in terms of the storytelling (as there's quite a lot going on), the series is quite slow in advancing through the timeline.  I'm hoping this means it's intended to be a long and detailed account of the next 13 years or more.  Once I get the next few volumes I'll let you know if that's the case.<br/>

Hinata no Ookami  --Shinsengumi Kidan-- : by Saitou Misaki (ISBN:4344804538)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4344804538">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4344804538</a><br/>
<br/>
I've actually had this book longer than the others, but haven't gotten very far into it.  I find it rather confusing, and I don't think it's entirely due to the language (although the Japanese in this one seems a bit more advanced than in some of the others).  I think in some respects the book is trying to be confusing.  For instance, through nearly the entire first chapter, it avoids specifically identifying the lead character.  Fairly early on, he's referred to as a Miburou, but it's not until page 35 that Kondou finally addresses him as Toshi-san, and a couple of pages later he introduces himself properly as Hijikata Toshizou.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the well known Shinsengumi members as well as some other well-known historical figures from the era are in this book.  (Saitou is a surprising omission, though.  Maybe he appears in later volumes.)  As I said, I didn't get very far into this book, so I can't say much about the story, but it takes place in Kyoto sometime after the group's name change to "Shinsengumi" (at least I think so - in places the names "Roushigumi" and "Shinsengumi" seem to be used interchangeably) and before Serizawa was killed.<br/>
<br/>
The artwork is realistic and relatively detailed with no chibi moments, etc.  My only problem with the artwork is that it isn't varied enough for such a large cast of characters.  Some of them end up looking enough alike that it can get hard to tell who's who (another source of the confusion with this book).<br/>
<br/>
I wish this book were less confusing, because I think I would really like it if I didn't keep getting lost.  The characters are realistically presented and rounded out with a broad range of interests.  It's got a predominantly dramatic tone, but that doesn't preclude occasional funny moments.  It seems to be quite well written.  One of these days I'm going to have to give this one another chance and try reading it again.<br/>

Bakumatsu Seishin Densetsu, Shinsengumi Hen ~ Toki wo Kaketa Shoujo-tachi : by Kayama Yumi (ISBN:4063652726)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4063652726">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4063652726</a><br/>
<br/>
This one is part of a historical romance series.  The volume about the Shinsengumi has three stories in it, each about women who fell in love with leaders of the Shinsengumi.  The first involves a love triangle between Kondou Isami and two of the women who fall for him, Miyuki and Okou.  The second is a tragic love story between Yamanami Keisuke and Akesato, ending when Yamanami has to commit seppuku.  The third is a love story about Teruhime and Matsudaira Katamori.  I haven't really read much of this one yet, just skimmed enough to figure out who's who, so I can't give a very good review, but the artwork is pretty, and seems well suited to the tone of the stories.<br/>

Volumes:<br/>
This is part of the "Toki wo Kaketa Shoujo-tachi" series, which all focus on women's stories in history, but from various different eras.  It came out in numbered volumes for a while, but then switched to naming individual volumes to each focus on a particular point in history.  So in this case, rather than starting from the beginning, I picked the volume focusing on the Shinsengumi, which was actually the eighth volume of the series.<br/>

Hokusou Shinsengumi : by Kan'no Aya (ISBN:4592188101)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4592188101">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4592188101</a><br/>
<br/>
This book has a very historical tone to it, and features a later period of the history than any of the other manga I've got.  It starts as the Bakumatsu ends, and is about the remnants of the Shinsengumi that fought during the Boshin war.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata is of course a central character, and Kondou appears for a few pages at the beginning of a book that both begins and ends with tragedies.  The other characters are people I've never heard of before, although for a number of them I get the impression I would have if I really knew the history better.  Besides Hijikata, the other two prominent characters the story focuses on are Nomura Risaburou and Souma Kazue.  (Surprisingly, Saitou - or I guess he would be known as Yamaguchi Jiro at this point - does not appear.  I don't know why not.  Even if the book is focusing on the more tragic stories, I would think he would still have to be at least a significant supporting character in any tale of the Shinsengumi during this period.)  The book is divided into three sections, each of which ends with the death of one of the leading characters, first Nomura, then Souma, and finally Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
The artwork is realistic and filled with a lot of historical detail.  (The only non-realistic element to it is the number of blonde or brown-haired Japanese characters.  I guess I can forgive that though, since it does help in making realistically drawn characters distinguishable from each other.)<br/>
<br/>
Though I haven't gotten into really reading much of this one yet, I think it's going to be one of my favorites - a poignant, beautifully drawn and written historical tragedy.<br/>
<br/>

Shinsengumi Mokushiroku :<br/>
by author: Miyazaki Masaru, illustrator: Inui Yoshihiko (ISBN:4253148719)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4253148719">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4253148719</a><br/>
<br/>
While skimming through about the first quarter of this book I didn't think I was going to like it much.  The first chapter seems to be nothing but one fight scene after another without any actual storytelling going on.  To compound this, the fight scenes spend a lot more space on showing mutilated body parts than on showing the actual fight.  After that, it gets a bit better though, in that the (still brutally gory) fight scenes are at least interspersed with dialogue and character building sections.  By the end of the volume, even the fight scenes are more than just a series of mutilated corpses, but involve a lot of action and drama as well.  They're actually rather well done, showing a dramatic improvement in artistic storytelling from how the fight scenes at the beginning of the book were done.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought it was interesting how the book used the juxtaposition of idyllic and brutal scenes.  For instance, the book opens with a scene of Okita Souji playing hide and go seek with a couple of young children, then cuts immediately to a scene of Captain Okita searching for an enemy who's trying to hide from him.  The exact same "Aha.  I've found you!" line from Okita gets rather different results in the two scenes.  Later there's a scene of Okita playing a version of tag called "oni" (demon) with some of the kids, and he calls out to Hijikata to join in the game and be the demon, alluding to how Hijikata is actually going to be a far different sort of demon.  (This one comes up during the interrogation of Furutaka Shuntarou.)<br/>
<br/>
Certainly a brutal look at the Shinsengumi, but I'll have to actually read more of it before I can decide whether it's going to turn into a good one.<br/>
<br/>
As to the artistic style, it's very detailed.  In some respects it's realistic, though there's also a lot of exaggeration.  Not a very pretty style, but it's expressive.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples of the artwork:  (Warning: If you hadn't guessed it by the review, some of these are rather graphic.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790823158">I must say these are great reviews Niwasa. I think I'm going ahead to <br/>
get Hokusou and Bakumatsu Densetsu for it's historical overtones (and <br/>
romance!). I actually have Burai and Okita-Kirameki no Zanzou but I'll <br/>
be honest, aside from the beautiful artwork I cannot make a lot of <br/>
sense to it by just trying to figure out what's happening through the <br/>
images.<br/>

Thanks for the scans and descriptions!<br/>

your reviews really made my day<br/>

Enrai (distant thunder) : by Suzuhara Shino<br/>
This is a very short (only eight pages) story involving a <br/>
conversation between<br/>
Okita Souji and Saitou Hajime about Okita's difficulty in dealing <br/>
with Yamanami<br/>
Keisuke's seppuku. The artwork in this story is detailed and <br/>
realistic (in<br/>
places incorporating photographic backgrounds).</div>

 </span></blockquote>I'm thinking of setting up a fan site for some of these.  While full<br/>
translations seem a bit too daunting, I might put up detailed chapter by<br/>
chapter (or story by story in the case of Okita-Kirameki no Zanzou) plot<br/>
descriptions along with a "who's who" gallery with images of each<br/>
significant character.  Perhaps after reading a full summary, the books'<br/>
images would make more sense.  It would take me a while to get something set<br/>
up, but then I'll probably start with Getsu Mei Sei Ki and some of the<br/>
stories from Okita Souji - Kirameki no Zanzou, to be followed by Hokusou<br/>
Shinsengumi and later Burai and perhaps some of the others.  I'll post a<br/>
link once I have something to point it to.<br/>
<br/>
Niwashi<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  I just ordered Shinsengumi Hijikata Toshizou Mibu no Ginrou (the<br/>
companion volume to Shinsengumi Okita Souji Kirameki no Zanzou), the next<br/>
couple volumes of Getsu Mei Sei Ki, and the first volume of Onikami Shinsen.<br/>
With ground shipping from halfway around the world, I won't get them for a<br/>
month or so, but eventually I'll have a few more reviews to add.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855921273">That's a great idea.  I can't wait till you have those fansites up. <br/>
I know a few people who buy manga just -because-, and it doesn't <br/>
even matter if they can't read them since they are fans (myself <br/>
included). A place where we can at least read a summary per chapter <br/>
or volume is great than having nothing at all (except beautiful <br/>
images *snicker*). Let me know if I can help you in anyway and <br/>
goodluck!<br/>

Speaking of which, for those of you who are interested, I'm ghostwriting a <br/>

it'll help if I write about my trip from outside my own point of view as <br/>
