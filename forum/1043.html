<h3>You know you&#39;re obsessed when....</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-553356979">Believe it or not I have no lame fundoshi joke to toss in here...not yet <br/>
anyway :-D  However I received a sales flyer in the mail today from <br/>
JoAnn fabrics and their online store offers a "Make your own 'Opoly'" <br/>
game kit and of course the first thing I thought was creating <br/>
Shinsengumi-oploy!<br/>
<br/>
For our members outside the US who may not know it Monopoly is a board <br/>
game that's been around forever and a day and I'm sure every American <br/>
kid has played it at least once. You buy property spaces on a board and <br/>
try to own more than everyone else, charge them outrageous rental fees <br/>
when they land on your spaces etc--It's American capitalism at it's <br/>
finest--or worst-- which is why it's been selling copies for half a <br/>
century!!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Can you see it? Saitou glaring at you in the "Go Directly to Jail" <br/>
space, Boardwalk and Park place can be Nijo Castle and the Imperial <br/>
Palace. The "bad part of town"spaces at the game's beginning can be <br/>
Shimabara. Instead of  railroads and utility companies and railroads <br/>
there can be a soba shop, fundoshi emporium, a branch of the Sheiken <br/>
Dojo and the Kyoto residences of Choshu, Satsuma and Tosa which of <br/>
course no one would want to buy...You could even mix and match the <br/>
various universes and toss in the Kamiya Dojo, the Aoiya and Katsu's <br/>
newspaper office...the possibilities are endless.<br/>

 <br/>
Great... now I'm going to be thinking of all the possibilities.  I think we should have a kind of contest here... give ourselves a couple weeks or so to come up with a Shinsengumi version of the game, then post them on a specific day so everyone can see what others came up with.  I'm sure a template of the board could be created for people to download and fill out as well as space for things the little cards might say.  Is anyone "game" for it?<br/>
