<h3>Kitsuno&#39;s questions</h3>
by <i>tanner_hatley</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-528826651">only to answer a few of his questions, just from what i learned,<br/>
Serizawa Kamo was assasinated by Hijikata, Okita, Yamanami, Harada<br/>
(and another one that I forget or my memory is getting bad), basically<br/>
for Kondo to take control over the group.  They were fighting over the<br/>
groups name and this was one of the reasons.  Group politics play a<br/>
huge role on the front but in secret it was to get Kondo as the<br/>
group's leader.  But Hijikata made rules that you can find at this<br/>
site that explains a bunch:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsengumi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsengumi</a> <br/>
<br/>
the rule that was broken was: not to deviate from the bushido code and<br/>
Kamo was doing a bunch.  That was the front that was put up but that<br/>
was not the real motive.  That and to get rid of the ronin that come<br/>
with Kamo.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for the Shinsengumi was to pretty much keep the peace in<br/>
Kyoto.  That and the answered directly to the Aizu and Tokugawa. <br/>
Choshu , Satsuma and Tosa clans were the enemies.  <br/>
<br/>
Ikedaya incident:  Shinsengumi were tipped off by their spy that the<br/>
Choshu were going to meet there.  Kondo let the group with Okita that<br/>
reached the inn first.  Huge battle.  Also, the first time Okita<br/>
coughed up blood.  Many Choshu men were killed.<br/>
<br/>
What would cause a ronin to join the Shinsengumi rather than<br/>
anyof the other factions? What type of person would join the<br/>
Shinsengumi?   My guess and opinion, Shinsengumi were noble and fought<br/>
for truth.  That would be a great cause.<br/>
<br/>
What was Kiyokawa Hachiro's ulterior motive for leading the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Roshigumi and going to Kyoto? I think from rumors that the Choshu<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were amassing there in secret and Kastura Koguru. <br/>
<br/>
