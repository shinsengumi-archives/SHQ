<h3>OT: FF Net new rules...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642508782">I think I might as well rant a bit, and while I&#39;m at it, give a warning to my fellow authors...  I found this little &#39;pearl&#39; in the main page of ff net today:<br/>
<br/>
 April 19th, 2004 -- Please note that FanFiction.Net&#39;s content guidelines apply to the entire story. For example, if you have chat or keyboard dialogue in author notes but not the story, the entire story will be considered for removal. To sum it up, everything you upload is subject to the content guidelines and TOS. <br/>
<br/>
Where is  the &#39;Unleash your imagination&#39; thingy went?  first they forbade the NC 17, then they external links to our NC17 chapters (which of course can be circumvent with little effort, btw) and/or recourses about history or culture related to our stories, later the Author Notes as separate chapters, and now this. Next time, what? Is  just me or I detect a more and more repressive trend here? I mean, I don&#39;t write such kind of things in the Author&#39;s notes, but they have to control EVERYTHING we decide to express?<br/>
I&#39;m SOOOOOO fed up with them. It&#39;s a real pity that Media Miner hadn&#39;t gotten more popular, because this place sucks more and more with each passing day. &gt;.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, so you are warned, beware of FF net new adding to their censor&#39;s scissors. They are out there just for you.<br/>
