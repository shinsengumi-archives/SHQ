<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002117554">And now for something completely different...<br/>
 <br/>
Do we have an image for the mon Saitou Hajime would've used?  I have two possible designs for Saitou, but don't know which, if either.  I take it that the one used by...uh... "sec" on the message board is the one he used as Fujita?  Just out of curiosity, where did that image come from and are we sure it's the design he used?  (I thought I remembered a post either here or the mb about accessing images of mon... where did it go??)<br/>
 <br/>
phil (currently overhauling one of my sites... finally)<br/>
P.S.  secretarytocapt3, you can delete the senna pics.  I'm going to take down the entry and repost when we get things cleared up with our isp.  The anniversary is passed and the need less urgent.  Many, many thanks!<br/>

The pic of Fujita Goro's 2nd son also has the son wearing a haori with<br/>
the same kamon as well and the haori which belonged to Fujita G. also<br/>
has the same design (you have to scan the pic and zooooom in to see it).  <br/>
MissB/Warg and I discussed the possible symbolic meaning of the bamboo<br/>
leaves, the number 9 and the three diamonds which appear in the<br/>
designs negative space at www.shinsengumimb.com.<br/>
I'm pretty sure Fujita G. used the kamon because of the reasons<br/>
mentioned above and it is also one of the symbols used in a<br/>
Shinsengumi chapter newsletter (and we all know how serious those<br/>
people are).<br/>

I'm going to use one of the two designs for "Saitou" until someone can tell me it's something else and also the one you use for Fujita.  (I was wondering why the mon was bamboo and not wisteria... will have to hunt up that discussion... )  Anyway, the mon are part of the new layout for the Visions site.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356214839">I'll check Shinsengumi Keppuroku, I believe in the ep that Hijikata sends Saitou to infiltrate the Itou group you see a shot of his mon. I'll see if I can screencap it later. I checked my volumes of Kaze Hikaru manga and it seems that it's the bamboo design as well. I'll scann that and out it up. Oddly enough, Kaze Hikaru has shots of almost every captain's mon which is where I initially found the mon for Okita. Harada's mon is similar to Kondo's but with only one horizontal bar.  <br/>
<br/>
Out of curiosity, why would his kamon have been wisteria? <br/>
<br/>
Note: Oddly enough, the biohazard sign used in our modern world was actually a family crest according to this small book I have.  <br/>

  Okita, I posted those 2 links you added over at shinsengumimb.com<br/>
  I skimmed Kaze Hikaru (just whatever we have translated so far and the<br/>
  steamy Saitou Hajime Love Story) and it shows a kamon on his haori but<br/>
  no close ups ... is this from later issues?<br/>
<br/>
  It does seem weird for Saitou not to have a kamon...so thanx for doing<br/>
  the research for us :P<br/>

My understanding is that "fuji" means "wisteria." That's why I connected wisteria with the Fujita mon... simply because of the meaning of the name itself.<br/>

Thanks for all the info!!!<br/>

<h3>Definition of Saitou from Momoiro-usagi more info</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968738038">[from momoiro-usagi via email]<br/>
<br/>
This mail is about [Question on meaning "Saitou"].<br/>
 <br/>
I worry about the ability to explain to you well.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Many friends study meaning of family name "Saitou" Definition is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>"divine wisteria".  True?<br/>
 <br/>
It of the meaning of kanji is a correct answer.<br/>
However, a family name of Japan may have the historical origin.<br/>
A Japanese kanji has the pronunciation from which some kinds are<br/>
different in one character.<br/>
"wisteria" has the pronunciation of "tou" and "fuji".<br/>
Although you will probably know, "tou" of "Saitou" and "Fuji" of<br/>
"Fujita" are the same characters(=wisteria).<br/>
 <br/>
First of all, please bear it in mind.<br/>
 <br/>
There are many family names which "tou" attaches in Japan.<br/>
Saitou, Satou, Katou, Itou, etc.<br/>
(A character called this "tou" is changed into "dou" depending on the<br/>
case.<br/>
"dou" of "Kondou" is also "wisteria". There are other family names,<br/>
such as Andou, Shindou, and Kudou.)<br/>
The family name of these "tou" is considered to be the posterity of<br/>
Fujiwara of the aristocrat of<br/>
the Heian period (From A.D. 794 to A.D. 1192) . "Fuji" of "Fujiwara" =<br/>
"wisteria".<br/>
The Fujiwara clan had huge power in the Imperial Court. And they got<br/>
various court ranks.<br/>
There was a status called "Saiou".<br/>
This is the duty which serves the goddess of the Ise Shrine as the<br/>
Emperor's representative.<br/>
The Emperor family's unmarried woman is chosen and she becomes "Saiou".<br/>
The castle in which "Saiou" lives was called "Saiguu".<br/>
There, it was also the public office for "Saiou".<br/>
The director general of "Saiguu" was called "Saiguu no kashira".<br/>
The origin of the family name of "Saitou" is "Fujiwara" which acquired<br/>
the status of "saiguu no kasira".<br/>
"Sai" of "Saiguu no kashira" + "Fuji(=tou)" of "Fujiwara".<br/>
 <br/>
However, since Saitou Hajime changed the family name, it is not<br/>
applied to this.<br/>
"Yamaguchi" which is the true family name of Saitou means it as the<br/>
entrance of a mountain.<br/>
Yama = Mountain + guchi(=kuchi) = Although it is originally the<br/>
meaning of a "mouth", it is an "entrance" in this case.<br/>
Probably, his ancestor would be related to the land.<br/>
<br/>
[secretarytocapt3 read somewhere that his mother was a<br/>
farmer...perhaps totally unrelated]<br/>
<br/>
It was easy to change a family name a long time ago.<br/>
Now, the family name of "tou" is hardly related to "Fujiwara".<br/>
 <br/>
Supplement:<br/>
Why Yamaguchi Hajime chose Saitou as the assumed name does not remain<br/>
in record.<br/>
In a report, the expert of the sword of a family name called Saitou is<br/>
in sword style "Mugai-ryuu" which he studied,<br/>
and it is said that it became a basis.<br/>
 <br/>
[secretarytocapt3 reminder...babelfish translates mugai-ryu as No<br/>
outer form or "Outside style nothing"  as Serizawa Kamo used to<br/>
mention the iaido of mugai-ryu is active today (they have websites)] <br/>
 <br/>
Although remembered in the talk of a family name, it sometimes sees<br/>
analyzing the kanji of the name of characters at the site of RK.<br/>
In fact, if it is Japanese RK fan, there is a certain fact which all<br/>
the members almost know.<br/>
Most family names of the characters who appear in RK originate in the<br/>
name of a place of Niigata Prefecture which is the hometown of Watsuki<br/>
Nobuhiro.<br/>
 <br/>
Kamiya, Nagaoka, Sanjyou, Tsubame, Tsukioka, Tsunan, Isurugi,<br/>
Makimachi, Mishima, Kashiwazaki, Kujiranami, etc.<br/>
These are a city in Niigata Prefecture, and the name of an area.<br/>
 <br/>
"Yuukyuuzan" is the Yuukyuu mountain.<br/>
 <br/>
"Sadojima" is the Sado island.<br/>
 <br/>
"Yahiko" is the Yahiko shrine.<br/>
"myoujin" which is the family name of Yahiko is the title of God of<br/>
Shintoism.<br/>
