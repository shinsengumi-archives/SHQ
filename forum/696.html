<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002117554">And now for something completely different...<br/>

Do we have an image for the mon Saitou Hajime would&#39;ve used?  I have two possible designs for Saitou, but don&#39;t know which, if either.  I take it that the one used by...uh... &quot;sec&quot; on the message board is the one he used as Fujita?  Just out of curiosity, where did that image come from and are we sure it&#39;s the design he used?  (I thought I remembered a post either here or the mb about accessing images of mon... where did it go??)<br/>

P.S.  secretarytocapt3, you can delete the senna pics.  I&#39;m going to take down the entry and repost when we get things cleared up with our isp.  The anniversary is passed and the need less urgent.  Many, many thanks!<br/>

Shizuko Akama&#39;s book.  <br/>
The pic of Fujita Goro&#39;s 2nd son also has the son wearing a haori with<br/>
the same kamon as well and the haori which belonged to Fujita G. also<br/>
has the same design (you have to scan the pic and zooooom in to see it).  <br/>
MissB/Warg and I discussed the possible symbolic meaning of the bamboo<br/>
leaves, the number 9 and the three diamonds which appear in the<br/>
designs negative space at www.shinsengumimb.com.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure Fujita G. used the kamon because of the reasons<br/>
mentioned above and it is also one of the symbols used in a<br/>
Shinsengumi chapter newsletter (and we all know how serious those<br/>
people are).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356214839">I&#39;ll check Shinsengumi Keppuroku, I believe in the ep that Hijikata sends Saitou to infiltrate the Itou group you see a shot of his mon. I&#39;ll see if I can screencap it later. I checked my volumes of Kaze Hikaru manga and it seems that it&#39;s the bamboo design as well. I&#39;ll scann that and out it up. Oddly enough, Kaze Hikaru has shots of almost every captain&#39;s mon which is where I initially found the mon for Okita. Harada&#39;s mon is similar to Kondo&#39;s but with only one horizontal bar.  <br/>
<br/>
Out of curiosity, why would his kamon have been wisteria? <br/>
<br/>
Note: Oddly enough, the biohazard sign used in our modern world was actually a family crest according to this small book I have.  <br/>

  Okita, I posted those 2 links you added over at shinsengumimb.com<br/>
  I skimmed Kaze Hikaru (just whatever we have translated so far and the<br/>
  steamy Saitou Hajime Love Story) and it shows a kamon on his haori but<br/>
  no close ups ... is this from later issues?<br/>
<br/>
  It does seem weird for Saitou not to have a kamon...so thanx for doing<br/>
  the research for us :P<br/>

My understanding is that &quot;fuji&quot; means &quot;wisteria.&quot; That&#39;s why I connected wisteria with the Fujita mon... simply because of the meaning of the name itself.<br/>

<h3>Definition of Saitou from Momoiro-usagi more info</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968738038">[from momoiro-usagi via email]<br/>
<br/>
This mail is about [Question on meaning &quot;Saitou&quot;].<br/>
 <br/>
I worry about the ability to explain to you well.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Many friends study meaning of family name &quot;Saitou&quot; Definition is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;divine wisteria&quot;.  True?<br/>
 <br/>
It of the meaning of kanji is a correct answer.<br/>
However, a family name of Japan may have the historical origin.<br/>
A Japanese kanji has the pronunciation from which some kinds are<br/>
different in one character.<br/>
&quot;wisteria&quot; has the pronunciation of &quot;tou&quot; and &quot;fuji&quot;.<br/>
Although you will probably know, &quot;tou&quot; of &quot;Saitou&quot; and &quot;Fuji&quot; of<br/>
&quot;Fujita&quot; are the same characters(=wisteria).<br/>
 <br/>
First of all, please bear it in mind.<br/>
 <br/>
There are many family names which &quot;tou&quot; attaches in Japan.<br/>
Saitou, Satou, Katou, Itou, etc.<br/>
(A character called this &quot;tou&quot; is changed into &quot;dou&quot; depending on the<br/>
case.<br/>
&quot;dou&quot; of &quot;Kondou&quot; is also &quot;wisteria&quot;. There are other family names,<br/>
such as Andou, Shindou, and Kudou.)<br/>
The family name of these &quot;tou&quot; is considered to be the posterity of<br/>
Fujiwara of the aristocrat of<br/>
the Heian period (From A.D. 794 to A.D. 1192) . &quot;Fuji&quot; of &quot;Fujiwara&quot; =<br/>
&quot;wisteria&quot;.<br/>
The Fujiwara clan had huge power in the Imperial Court. And they got<br/>
various court ranks.<br/>
There was a status called &quot;Saiou&quot;.<br/>
This is the duty which serves the goddess of the Ise Shrine as the<br/>
Emperor&#39;s representative.<br/>
The Emperor family&#39;s unmarried woman is chosen and she becomes &quot;Saiou&quot;.<br/>
The castle in which &quot;Saiou&quot; lives was called &quot;Saiguu&quot;.<br/>
There, it was also the public office for &quot;Saiou&quot;.<br/>
The director general of &quot;Saiguu&quot; was called &quot;Saiguu no kashira&quot;.<br/>
The origin of the family name of &quot;Saitou&quot; is &quot;Fujiwara&quot; which acquired<br/>
the status of &quot;saiguu no kasira&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Sai&quot; of &quot;Saiguu no kashira&quot; + &quot;Fuji(=tou)&quot; of &quot;Fujiwara&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
However, since Saitou Hajime changed the family name, it is not<br/>
applied to this.<br/>
&quot;Yamaguchi&quot; which is the true family name of Saitou means it as the<br/>
entrance of a mountain.<br/>
Yama = Mountain + guchi(=kuchi) = Although it is originally the<br/>
meaning of a &quot;mouth&quot;, it is an &quot;entrance&quot; in this case.<br/>
Probably, his ancestor would be related to the land.<br/>
<br/>
[secretarytocapt3 read somewhere that his mother was a<br/>
farmer...perhaps totally unrelated]<br/>
<br/>
It was easy to change a family name a long time ago.<br/>
Now, the family name of &quot;tou&quot; is hardly related to &quot;Fujiwara&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Supplement:<br/>
Why Yamaguchi Hajime chose Saitou as the assumed name does not remain<br/>
in record.<br/>
In a report, the expert of the sword of a family name called Saitou is<br/>
in sword style &quot;Mugai-ryuu&quot; which he studied,<br/>
and it is said that it became a basis.<br/>
 <br/>
[secretarytocapt3 reminder...babelfish translates mugai-ryu as No<br/>
outer form or &quot;Outside style nothing&quot;  as Serizawa Kamo used to<br/>
mention the iaido of mugai-ryu is active today (they have websites)] <br/>
 <br/>
Although remembered in the talk of a family name, it sometimes sees<br/>
analyzing the kanji of the name of characters at the site of RK.<br/>
In fact, if it is Japanese RK fan, there is a certain fact which all<br/>
the members almost know.<br/>
Most family names of the characters who appear in RK originate in the<br/>
name of a place of Niigata Prefecture which is the hometown of Watsuki<br/>
Nobuhiro.<br/>
 <br/>
Kamiya, Nagaoka, Sanjyou, Tsubame, Tsukioka, Tsunan, Isurugi,<br/>
Makimachi, Mishima, Kashiwazaki, Kujiranami, etc.<br/>
These are a city in Niigata Prefecture, and the name of an area.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Yuukyuuzan&quot; is the Yuukyuu mountain.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Sadojima&quot; is the Sado island.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Yahiko&quot; is the Yahiko shrine.<br/>
&quot;myoujin&quot; which is the family name of Yahiko is the title of God of<br/>
Shintoism.<br/>
