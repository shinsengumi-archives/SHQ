<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977011156">from my study of the TMPD in the 19th century I get the idea that <br/>
the system attempted to make people entirely dependent on the <br/>
police...the police became walking phone books filled with info, <br/>
they gave references and basically monitored daily life in their <br/>
jurisdiction...there is no aspect of your daily as a citizen which <br/>
in some way did not intersect with that of the police...in fact the <br/>
more stuff I come across the more obvious it is that to have the job <br/>
of &quot;inspector&quot; made your life somewhat public...everyone viewed you <br/>
as a moral authority (and that is what the government wanted)...they <br/>
became the &quot;dry nurse&quot; of society as Toshiyoshi Kawaji put it...we <br/>
all understand the idea of LAW and ORDER...the TMPD greatly <br/>
emphasized the ORDER part as well...now what is the TMPD doing today <br/>
to reach out to youth you ask?<br/>

<br/>
and does anyone know WHAT the mascot is...to me it looks like a <br/>
mouse with an antenna...the country who has given us Hello Kitty and <br/>
Keropi (the frog) and Tuxedo Sam could do better than this ^_^ it is <br/>
not cute enough<br/>
