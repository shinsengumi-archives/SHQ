<h3>fujita family tree</h3>
by <i>kallipygia13</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038438573">Hi!  <br/>
<br/>
I was interested in the graphic of the Fujita Family Tree located in <br/>
the Photos section of this group.  I&#39;m working on a fic that it <br/>
would be helpful for.  Unfortunately, the pic is just a wee bit too <br/>
small for me to make out any of the writing, either on the computer <br/>
screen or when I print it out.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a larger copy of this file somewhere online?  Or would it <br/>
be possible for me to get a larger copy from the author?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Kalli</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61027476">Did you click on the &quot;full size&quot; link at the top right hand corner (just above the picture)?<br/>
 <br/>
Also, keep in mind that it hasn&#39;t been corrected since we realized that Tatsuo (the third son) was adopted OUT of the Fujita family, not IN.<br/>
