&quot;Sword of Doom&quot; starts in about an hour on IFC (5:00a.m. PST), repeats again at 10:15a.m.PST and one last time on early Sunday morning at 3:00 a.m. PST.  Information on the film can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060277/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060277/</a> .  For those new to the list, this film contains little tidbits concerning the formation of the Shinsengumi (look for Kondou & Serizawa at the tournament) and the ending is... wow!  A definite samurai classic, very much worth watching, directed by Okamoto Kihachi (director of two of my favorites, &quot;Kill&quot; and &quot;Red Lion&quot;) and starring Mifune Toshiro and Nakadai Tatsuya.<br/>
