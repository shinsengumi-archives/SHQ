<h3>Weird Shinsengumi Mdse and Ishida Sanyaku</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007368254">If you think the stuff we've shown you has been weird so far, just <br/>
wait till I get the next "Shinsengoodies" finished. You would not <br/>
believe how much "Shinsengumi" sake is on the market. Saitou I am <br/>
sure would have been pleased. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I am not so sure how Hijikata would have felt about being stuck on a <br/>
bag of pickles in soy sauce...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am hoping to have this done in time for the SHQ's one year <br/>
anniversary, but I am currently working on a report about Ishida <br/>
Sanyaku. This was the medicine that Hijikata used to wander about <br/>
selling. Rumor has it that it was also used to treat the injuries of <br/>
the Shinsengumi. I won't tell anything about it here, but I will give <br/>
you some idea of what the report will discuss:<br/>
<br/>
-Will mention that there were in fact TWO medicines that Hijikata <br/>
sold.<br/>
-How the medicine was used, what it was used for, and where did <br/>
Hijikata go to sell it.<br/>
-Information about the plant the medicine comes from: name, blooming <br/>
season, where it likes to grow, etc.<br/>
-How Ishida Sanyaku was made: what time of year it was gathered and <br/>
the process by which it was turned into medicine.<br/>
-The creature that supposedly taught the family how to make it. What <br/>
exactly is a kappa? <br/>
<br/>
I had already heard of kappa long before I knew about the Hijikata <br/>
family's connection to the water imp. However I was very surprised by <br/>
a bit of info that turned up during my research. As has been stated <br/>
on this list in the past, saying that a kappa had taught them the <br/>
secret was just an advertising gimmick, but my research into the <br/>
critter was very revealing about why this particular supernatural <br/>
being was chosen...<br/>
