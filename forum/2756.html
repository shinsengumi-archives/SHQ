<h3>More information on Okita&#39;s swords.</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595650816">Hello. For those of you who have wondered about okita's swords <br/>
please dont worry too much about what happened to them but wonder if <br/>
the swords he had was his. I found a website talking about Okita's <br/>
swords and what happened. I shall qoute the paragraphs."Reproduction <br/>
of Souji Okita's Sword<br/>

<br/>
In fact, a famous sword Okita used at Ikeda-ya (one supposedly made <br/>
by Kojiki Kiyomitsu) is said to have broken. This is the sword I've <br/>
seen on most websites being sold as "Okita's favorite".<br/>
<br/>
According to some sources, after that sword broke, he used a sword <br/>
made by Yamatonokami Yasusada. The sword was 2.2 shaku long <br/>
according to a source at www.n-p-s.net/aitoh.htm , but my <br/>
photocopied page from a swordbook (name of book lost long ago) says <br/>
it was 2 shaku, 3 sun, and 6 bu long.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, OishiKuwajiro (known by the nickname" <br/>
hitokirikuwajiro) also used a sword made by Yamatonokami Yasusada <br/>
that was 2 shaku 5 sun in length according to this site <br/>
www.bakusin.com/jiten41.html<br/>
<br/>
Okita's most famous sword, though, was the "Kikuichimonji", which <br/>
was 2 shaku 4 sun 2 bu in length. There is some speculation as to <br/>
whether he actually owned such a valuable sword, but we will <br/>
probably never know if he really owned it since it was supposedly <br/>
lost after he died. If you are interested in reading more about it, <br/>
I recommend Shinsengumi Keppuroku by Shiba Ryotaro.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the swords being accurate, for sure Hijikata's is <br/>
accurate. Unfortunately the model on that page is the "affordable <br/>
model". The exact replica which is listed on Ozawa swords Japan is <br/>
quite a bit more. <br/>
<br/>
Okita's replica is in what they call handachi (han-dachi)mounts, <br/>
literally "half tachi" mounts, which come from the pre-edo periods <br/>
where there was a transition from tachi to katana. Unfortunately, <br/>
i've seen conflicting data on if his Ichimonji blade was mounted in <br/>
handachi mounts. He owned one other sword besides the Kiku Ichimonji <br/>
and that one could have been the one mounted handachi style." I hope <br/>
this will help you think better and to tell ya we might not ever <br/>
find his swords. Thanks for reading this and I hope that someone <br/>
will find them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788621976">This is somewhat connected to the conversation James and I had.  <br/>
So I wanted to answer his question here.<br/>
That is, how can someone in the modern world possibly study swords? <br/>
Reading lots of books can help, attending conventions would be great<br/>
and so forth.  Getting a doctorate in metallurgy and becoming fluent<br/>
in Japanese would be ideal too. (^_^) ::kidding::<br/>
<br/>
In Japan ofcourse one may learn more by visiting a sword museum such<br/>
as this one seen here<br/>

I would also like to take this opportunity to mention that James<br/>
contributed Okita fanart here:<br/>

<br/>
Wanda recently contributed some timeline entries from Hillsborough's<br/>
Shinsengumi book<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a><br/>
and remember everyone, on page xix, Hillsborough states: "I...have<br/>
used the Chinese calendar rather than the Gregorian one to preserve<br/>
the actual feeling of mid-nineteenth-century Japan.  For clarity's<br/>
sake, Japanese dates and era names are generally accompanied by the<br/>
corresponding years in the WEstern calendar."<br/>
<br/>
I think that books which cover this topic should always include lunar<br/>
dates first and gregorian dates in [[brackets]] right next to it to<br/>
prevent confusion.  <br/>
<br/>
It will be a while before the timeline is "complete" <br/>
::secretarytocapt3 sighs::<br/>
<br/>
We encourage people who know other languages such as French, Spanish,<br/>
African languages, Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, Thai and so forth to<br/>
please find books on the Bakumatsu.  Very likely researchers in<br/>
different cultures will have a unique view of this part of Japanese<br/>
history.  Most of what we have is -just- from the American and British<br/>
perspective. Please share, we want to learn from you (also include the<br/>
book title, author, publisher and publication date).  <br/>
<br/>
For example, we know there were French soldiers, such as Jules Brunet,<br/>
in Hakodate RIGHT THERE WITH HIJIKATA....so perhaps between 1869 and<br/>
2006 a French researcher may have written an article about the French<br/>
involvement in 1869 at the Republic of Ezo.  All these teeny tiny<br/>
details add up and help us understand the conditions in which the<br/>
Shinsengumi (former Shinsengumi technically) fought.<br/>
<br/>
Another good example is Ernest Satow.  He wasn't everywhere, nor did<br/>
he see everything himself but he did mention ""Aidzu had occupied the<br/>
castle of Yodo, a few miles south of Kioto on the direct road, with<br/>
500 of his own troops, and 300 of the Shinsen-gumi, a recenty raised<br/>
body of Tokugawa infantry, had also proceeded thither, while all along<br/>
the road small detachments were stationed." (Satow 305)<br/>
<br/>
That isn't a big deal---but don't you feel ~better~ that -someone-<br/>
bothered to note the "Shinsen-gumi" (^_^).  Ok so his perfectly round<br/>
number of Shinsengumi may not be accurate...he couldn't go and count<br/>
himself.<br/>

history of the critical years in the evolution of Japan when the ports<br/>
were opened and the monarchy restored, recorded by a diplomatist who<br/>
took an active part in the events of the time, with an account of his<br/>
personal experiences during that period. London, Seeley, Service, 1921.<br/>
