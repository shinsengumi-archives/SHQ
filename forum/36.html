<h3>SHQ Spy Division</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203588550">A new office... uh... list has been created to give us maximum space for information and fiction/art.  There is still some organization to be done, so I ask that files not be posted into the files sections yet, but I extend a very warm and big invitation for as many people here to join so we can continue our fun.  The address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/</a> .  When you join, in addition to the usual yahoo greeting, you&#39;ll get a second message that contains the submission template for fiction (still working on art) and list rules/guidelines.  That document is also available in the folder &quot;List Business&quot; in the Files section.<br/>
 <br/>
Please remember, you can set your membership preferences to receive no mail and check out fiction from the list site if you don&#39;t want it cluttering your mailbox.  See?  That means you have no excuse not to join.  :-)  Take a place around the table --- someone is bound to pour you a cup of sake --- and enjoy the stories that will be told, the pictures that will be passed around.<br/>
