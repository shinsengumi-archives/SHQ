<h3>SHQ Spy Division</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203588550">A new office... uh... list has been created to give us maximum space for information and fiction/art.  There is still some organization to be done, so I ask that files not be posted into the files sections yet, but I extend a very warm and big invitation for as many people here to join so we can continue our fun.  The address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/</a> .  When you join, in addition to the usual yahoo greeting, you'll get a second message that contains the submission template for fiction (still working on art) and list rules/guidelines.  That document is also available in the folder "List Business" in the Files section.<br/>
 <br/>
Please remember, you can set your membership preferences to receive no mail and check out fiction from the list site if you don't want it cluttering your mailbox.  See?  That means you have no excuse not to join.  :-)  Take a place around the table --- someone is bound to pour you a cup of sake --- and enjoy the stories that will be told, the pictures that will be passed around.<br/>
