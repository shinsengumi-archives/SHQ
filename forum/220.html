<h3>Sorta OT: Highlight of today</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173257613">Ah, the wonderful Japanese literature class, with the professor who<br/>
dislikes samurai...<br/>
<br/>
Today, I read one of my favorite poems from Matsuo Basho: Summer<br/>
Grass/All that remains/of warriors&#39; dreams. I told the teacher that<br/>
this was the first Basho poem I&#39;d read, and knowing my pro-samurai<br/>
stance, he laughed and said, &quot;Ah, so this is what got you started!&quot;<br/>
And I was like, &quot;What, with Basho or samurai?&quot; and then, a guy I<br/>
hardly know, said &quot;Freak&quot; from the other side of the classroom. We<br/>
stared each other down for so long that the teacher had to step in...<br/>
<br/>
What is up with these people? Why do they hate samurai so much? I<br/>
realize they weren&#39;t _all_ wonderful-- I mean, people like Kato<br/>
Kiyomasa were good generals, but brutal and utterly heartless-- but<br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that ALL samurai were bad, right? It&#39;s like Victor<br/>
Harris said in the conclusion of his biography of Miyamoto Musashi--<br/>
&quot;The aim of this cruel, headstrong man was evidently most humble and<br/>
honest.&quot; These people were warriors-- it was their business to fight.<br/>
But ultimately, all most of them really wanted was to acheive true<br/>
strength, to bring stability (and consequently, peace) to the realm,<br/>
and also to better themselves in the knolwedge of both literary and<br/>
martial arts-- after all, like Lord Hojo Soun said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hold literary skills in your left hand, martial skills in your right.<br/>
This is the law from ancient times. Never neglect it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

were are based on all the cheezy movie/video game depictions they&#39;ve <br/>
seen much like your professor&#39;s impression that the WWII kamikaze pilots <br/>
are his version of samurai..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because they don&#39;t understand that samurai are ~people~ and people are<br/>
all different and unique not all evil not all good...they only see<br/>
stereotypes.  Close-mindedness is very common in the academic setting,<br/>
wait I should add <br/>
close-mindedness+advanced degree= stubborn people who hand out your grades</div>
