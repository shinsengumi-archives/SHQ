<h3>[SHQ] Any idea what this might be?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135051044">This is a little off topic, but I got this gift from a friend who went to <br/>
Japan ages ago, and it&#39;s super awesome and all, but I have no idea what it <br/>
is and neither does my friend.<br/>
So I scanned it to show you, maybe you&#39;ll know what it is.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The little round thing in the middle is made out of porcelin (I&#39;m guessing <br/>
it is, anyway), and it&#39;s attached to the 21st page, poking out through the <br/>
pages before the twenty first. It is a book, and there&#39;s some writing on the <br/>
cover as you can see, though I can&#39;t read it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And this is what it looks like after the 21st page, again there&#39;s some <br/>
writing in the top right, and it&#39;s the same on all of the other pages, but <br/>
again, I can&#39;t read it. That in the middle is a printed copy of what&#39;s on <br/>
the twenty first page, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
So I have no idea what this is and what it&#39;s for...if you know, could you <br/>
please tell me? My curiousity is killing me!!<br/>
