<h3>New Japanese Site</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717185298">Many Japanese fandom sites have gone semi-dormant now but<br/>
this is what seems to be a new site.  Very sleek and we can hope for <br/>
some nice updates.  It combines Aizu with the Shinsengumi as you can <br/>
tell from the address<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
they need fanart!  (^_^)<br/>
and fanfic pronto!<br/>
<br/>
as for SHQ website info we just decided on the search engine logic <br/>
this Saturday and apparently the slow progress is because I can&#39;t <br/>
keyword all the images and webpages fast enough...::nervous laugh::  <br/>
it&#39;s very tedious work</div>
