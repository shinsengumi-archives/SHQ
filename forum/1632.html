<h3>Things to Note Women Warriors in Art</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882682379">After carefully examining all the paintings portraying women in the<br/>
Seinan War (Satsuma Rebellion) I have noticed a few things...<br/>
1) with the exception of [1] woman (she wore a buttoned western shirt<br/>
and hakama)...all wore kimono<br/>
2) no visible body armor, no handguards, armguards nor helmets<br/>
3) no shoes...no straw sandals barefeet<br/>
4) women were not shown being killed...in one case only restrained and<br/>
tied up<br/>
5) their big toe on their feet would appear "separate" from the 4<br/>
other toes...due to the wearing of sandals since childhood (all the<br/>
men had socks/shoes and sandals to obscure this detail)<br/>
