<h3>Picture of women&#39;s brigade</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-108818406">I was wrong about the picture of the 2 women that Sec so graciously scanned <br/>
for us-- it turns out, they -are- Nakano Takeko and Nakano Yuuko, but listed <br/>
under their alternate names of Tamagi Yuna (Yuuko), and Akaoka Chikujo <br/>
(Takeko).<br/>
<br/>
Am currently compiling a list of all the fighting women of Aizu, Joushigun <br/>
(Women&#39;s Brigade) or otherwise. Will let you all know when I&#39;m done.<br/>
