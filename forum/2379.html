<h3>Wearing White for Seppuku</h3>
by <i>jiaxin_nyo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175325591">This may (or may not) have roots in the Chinese custom of wearing white <br/>
for funerals (where white symbolizes mourning, death, etc.). It makes <br/>
sense, since many of Japan's customs -- including language, writing, <br/>
clothing, government, and the arts -- are borrowed and/or influenced by <br/>
the Chinese, particularly the Tang dynasty (618-907).<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, foreigners are often referred to as "foreign devils" <br/>
(quai loh, Cantonese). Could this have the slightest connection to <br/>
Sonnou-Joui?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147931197">Hm. That's sort of what I thought. I was planning to eventually pry deeper <br/>
into both the 47 ronin story and seppuku. Maybe I will find out more then...<br/>
<br/>
As for the foreign devil thing... Perhaps a little? "Sonno-joi" literally <br/>
means "Revere the Emperor" and "expel the barbarians." Everything I have read <br/>
about the slogan so far points to it having originated in Mito. (Possibly from <br/>
Tokugawa Nariaki himself?) But both "barbarians" and "foreign devils" were terms <br/>
commonly used to decribe foreigners at the time so it could have just as <br/>
easily been worded the other way.  The feeling behind all of it was the same at <br/>
any rate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844955298">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to comment on what you said about death garb privately. I'm a <br/>
student of Japanese history in college, so I've read authoritative sources <br/>
on the topic. Death garb is usually white because white is the Buddhist <br/>
color of death. However, everyone thinks the Shinsengumi haori was blue <br/>
because of the 47 Ronin's seppuku kimono. This is incorrect, as the blue <br/>
seppuku kimono for the 47 ronin comes from kabuki plays, as does the black <br/>
haori with the white triangles. So Shinsengumi were inspired more by the <br/>
kabuki 47 ronin than the real ones-- because as you said, dating back to the <br/>
Chinese origins of that custom, death colors are white, not blue.<br/>
<br/>
As much as the 47 ronin are heroes, their history is as murky as that of the <br/>
Shinsengumi if not murkier. Another thing to consider about the 47 ronin is <br/>
the black uniform, brand-new armor, etc. that they're always portrayed with. <br/>
It makes no logical sense for 47 men with no income from a liquidated domain <br/>
to be able to afford all of that.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you have  any additional questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<h3>Sonno Joi (Was: Re: Wearing White for Seppuku)</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-228918758">My understanding is that while the term *sonno joi* may have been <br/>
coined in Mito with the writing of the charter of Nariaki's school <br/>
(the Kodokan) in ca. 1841, the philosophy behind it is actually very <br/>
old and having to do with imperial might/duty in vanquishing Japan's <br/>
enemies.  The Mito Tokugawa were famed for their loyalty to the <br/>
emperor and kokugaku (Japanese studies) one of the leading <br/>
intellectual pursuits. Unfortunately, because of the political and <br/>
intellectual climate of Mito (and elsewhere) prior to the bakumatsu, <br/>
it became a rallying cry and lost much of its original meaning, <br/>
becoming confused with tobaku (overthrow the bakufu).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684360442">Sonno Joi, to my knowledge, was coined by the radical court noble Takenouchi <br/>
Shikibu, who was repressed by the Bakufu leader Matsudaira Sadanobu in the <br/>
late 1700s.<br/>
