***The name of Saitoo Hajime is written on the back of the memorial<br/>
monument.  It says: A promoter*: Matsumoto Ryoojun, Nakakura<br/>
(Nagakura), and Saitoo<br/>
It means that Saitoo was also concerned with erecting this monument.<br/>
In short, Saitoo, at least, kept company with Nagakura Shinpachi in<br/>
the Meiji era.<br/>
(secretarytocapt3 thinks...*promoter=contributed some money no doubt)<br/>
<br/>
*various possibilities regarding SAitou&#39;s timeline from Nagarayema to<br/>
Aizu...MIss B this is where I read about the transport of injured<br/>
soldiers etc<br/>
<br/>
*the possibility of Saitou as having a &quot;sweet and beautiful voice&quot;<br/>
@_@ and the woman who recalled this remembered a bearded man (who has<br/>
time to shave during a war)...she incorrectly estimated his age (a<br/>
note to the guys out there--facial hair makes you look older) but he<br/>
called himself Yamaguchi &quot;something&quot; (he would have gone by Yamaguchi<br/>
Jiro at this point)<br/>
<br/>
*A man named Torii Kason interviewed Shimada Kai...Torii Kason learned<br/>
of Fujita Goro&#39;s address from Shimada Kai...Shimada Kai was in touch<br/>
with guys like Nakajima Nobori...<br/>
<br/>
*However, according to the letter which Kondoo Hoosuke wrote to<br/>
Takahashi Masatsugu in 1906 (Meiji 39), it seems that he exchanged<br/>
letters with Saitoo.<br/>
<br/>
Now that should get some of interested in these translations ^_^<br/>
keep in mind that the person who translated spells people&#39;s names<br/>
different e.g. Toudou Hosuke for instance or Saitoo...</div>

Although this has the meaning of &quot;sweet&quot;, there is a meaning <br/>
of &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;cute&quot;.<br/>
Saitou&#39;s kawaii koe .....I cannot imagine. lol <br/>
<br/>
This woman regarded Yamaguchi as their being about 35 years old. <br/>
However, Yamaguchi of those days was 25 years old. <br/>
(This is the episode in 1868.) <br/>
It seems that she was mistaken in his age. <br/>
I am surmising that she probably heard his voice very youthfully. <br/>
Therefore, I rather think that it would be high voice. <br/>

because soft spoken from where I come from meant Priest in the white <br/>
robes... Now Saitou garbed in a priest robe scares me...</div>

<h3><a href="#msg-1406">&gt;</a> Sweet Voice+personality (Re: 3-hajime.com &quot;nazo&quot; pages 1-10 TRANSLATED)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-735024441">****Another**** interpretation from the translator (who just replied)<br/>
don&#39;t we all love these varied meanings ^_^<br/>
<br/>
1) secretarytocapt3 asks &quot;what does SWEET VOICE mean to Japanese <br/>
people?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[Answer]  &quot;Literal translation is cute voice (momoiro told us this <br/>
too), so I think his voice might be higher than usual guys.  Or the <br/>
discription says that he had beautiful voice, so <br/>
it might mean his voice was like the one of singers and a <br/>
penetrating voice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
20 secretarytocapt3 asks &quot;good-natured person&quot; is given in the <br/>
software translation <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate</a> do you see this <br/>
word in the Japanese?  &quot;Good personality&quot; also appears in Nakajima <br/>
Nobori&#39;s portrait.  To Japanese people what is &quot;good-natured or good <br/>
personality?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[Answer] &quot;The literal tranlation is &quot;he looks like the person who is <br/>
liked by many people.&quot; So, it might indicate that he looks like a <br/>
respected person or an important person. Also, a good personality <br/>
means he looks very kind and gentle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
@_@ Kind? Gentle? This cannot possibly be Saitou (or in this case <br/>
the bearded Mr. Yamaguchi)<br/>
