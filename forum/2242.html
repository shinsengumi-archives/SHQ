<h3>Example of Seinan War coverage</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732616827"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/EiriShimbunAug1877.zip">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/EiriShimbunAug1877.zip</a><br/>
from the Eiri Shimbun newspaper Aug 1877 (I couldn&#39;t read the days <br/>
ofcourse just using info on the microfilm divider slides)<br/>
<br/>
and even found a pic of a guy shooting from a tree MissB (^_^)<br/>
in fact that seems to be the preferred way of sniping at the enemy <br/>
(because there&#39;s alot of artwork depicting it)<br/>
I scanned one very short article for people who study Japanese so <br/>
they can see the change in the language and one pic needs no <br/>
translation at all<br/>
<br/>
I picked Aug 1877 just to get a feel for the coverage coming in that <br/>
month (it was also when the article mentioning Fujita Goro was <br/>
printed in the Tokyo Nichinichi but the battle occurred in July---<br/>
telegraph lines were cut so communication back to Tokyo was real <br/>
slow).</div>
