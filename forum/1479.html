pictures of Kaoru's funeral procession (when they thought she was dead) from <br/>
Volume 24 (I think) of the French version of the Kenshin manga. That'll give <br/>
you some idea, I hope...I'm not quite sure on the details, myself. I'm a bit <br/>
more familiar with Heian and Edo-era mourning customs.<br/>

<br/>
It seems that a customary change started many in the middle of Meiji <br/>
Era. <br/>
(Probably, I think that it is about Meiji 30 years.)<br/>
I think that it seldom changes to the custom of the Edo period <br/>
around Meiji 10. <br/>
<br/>
People wore the white kimono as a mourning dress till the middle of <br/>
Meiji Era. <br/>
The present mourning dress is black.<br/>
This imitated Occidental custom and the Imperial Household began it <br/>
in Meiji 30. <br/>
Now, if I wear white dress and attend a funeral, I will be scolded <br/>
certainly. <br/>
Incidentally, this custom has a difference at the time which changed <br/>
in the city section and the locality section. <br/>
It is a talk in the city section that people's mourning dress <br/>
changed in the middle of Meiji Era. <br/>
There is a place which wore the white mourning dress till the time <br/>
of the beginning of Showa Era locally. <br/>
<br/>
Moreover, people were holding the ceremony of "Tamayobi" till the <br/>
middle of Meiji. <br/>
This was the ceremony which calls back a soul in this world, and <br/>
when someone died, it was performed. <br/>
In order to revive the dead, the people with the duty of Tamayobi <br/>
climb a roof and call the dead's name. <br/>
Or they look at the bottom of a well and call the dead's name. <br/>
If I perform this now, I will be taken to the police.^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
It is the year of the beginning of Meiji that the company which <br/>
holds a funeral was founded. <br/>
And this is the talk of the city section. <br/>
The group which helps ceremonial occasions in a village was made <br/>
locally, and it helped each other to each other. <br/>
