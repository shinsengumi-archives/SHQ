According to "The Satsuma Rebellion of 1877 From Kagoshima Through <br/>
the Siege of Kumamoto Castle" by James H. Buck<br/>
Monumenta Nipponica, Vol 28 no. 4 (Winter 1973) 427-446<br/>
<br/>
[my summary]...will appear in my Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept. <br/>
write up too...I'm just so happy that hours of research turned up <br/>
something new for me atleast...<br/>
<br/>
The Imperial government attempted a secret ammunitions seizure from <br/>
Kagoshima (officially under government but prior to the Restoration <br/>
property of Satsuma clan)...the government was unsuccessful as 1,000 <br/>
Satsuma men drove off the gov's naval force.<br/>
Saigo T. was unaware of this situation.  When Saigo T. returned to <br/>
Kagoshima, Nakahara Hisao was charged with plotting to assasinate <br/>
Saigo T.  Furthermore, Nakahara H. confessed to meeting with Kawaji <br/>
Toshiyoshi, Chief Inspector of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept <br/>
(and native of Satsuma).  We don't know if Nakahara's words are to <br/>
be trusted however at least 50 members of the Tokyo Police Dept who <br/>
were natives of Satsuma returned to Kagoshima in 1876-1877 at the <br/>
same time a high-ranking Tokyo official was sent to "adjust Tokyo's <br/>
relations with Satsuma leadership." "Some even advocated immediate <br/>
execution of the 'traitors' from the Tokyo Police Department."(page <br/>
430)<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is quiet obvious that Kawaji had been monitoring his own <br/>
Satsuma domain for some time and used Satsuma policemen as spies.<br/>
The article also give some more info on how Satsuma remained <br/>
rebellious against various policies,from the government they put in <br/>
power, imposed.</div>

<h3>Re: Saigo vs. Toshiyoshi (you guys may know this already)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-38286396">I need to make a few adjustments to the comments I made earlier,<br/>
EVERYONE called Saigo, GREAT SAIGO, and no the book was really that<br/>
pro Saigo at all...the book was AWESOME and it gives some some more<br/>
info on Nakahara Hisao, and how Kawaji's assasination plan was an<br/>
order from [Okubo] (remember Barb's earlier comments on how the 3<br/>
Great Men of the Restoration squabbled amongst themselves?).  Thanks<br/>
for the translation of the newspaper article Miss B.  Actually the<br/>
location Ichigo mentioned in relation to Fujita G is mentioned in<br/>
Seinan War books (one of the 2 Japanese books I mentioned had a pic of<br/>
Kawaji which made sense seeing how he was actually one of the field<br/>
generals in this war).  <br/>
<br/>
From what I've read so far, it would be ridiculous if more recent<br/>
books in English fail to mention the TMPD because they seemed to have<br/>
done most of the fighting (I also have stats to prove this as well)<br/>
and you would come across an entire police unit under siege at<br/>
Kumamoto Castle.  I think that newspaper articles were based on spy<br/>
info because even in the account of the siege of Kumamoto Castle we<br/>
have the name of one guy who ran around dressed as a peasant<br/>
collecting/delivering alot of info.  Furthermore, they seemed to have<br/>
been put in front of alot of skirmishes which made me wonder how<br/>
important demographics are in this war (government thinks: many of<br/>
these guys are from Aizu, might as well put them on the front lines).<br/>

I did see "police troops" mentioned once, so I tend to think they just lump them all together as "government forces" with no distinction of what part of the government they were working for. The main focus is Saigo and his rebels. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037002331">@_@<br/>
did you check for Kumamoto Castle in the index?<br/>
In a totally different book the author lists the possible reasons <br/>
for why the Satsuma forces lost...and one of the reasons is that <br/>
Saigo spent too long concentrating  his troops on laying seige to <br/>
this castle, in which a whole bunch of policemen were trapped. <br/>
Initially the guys in the castle had no idea as to who was leading <br/>
the forces surrounding the castle and then they realize GREAT SAIGO <br/>
had them pinned down in one place.  So I'm pretty ticked off you <br/>
books don't even mention this ^_^<br/>
<br/>
I guess my library books are detailed...it even lists field <br/>
commanders almost all of them were specifically under TMPD.  Since <br/>
TMPD's training was more intense and the officers were more <br/>
experienced from previous wars they were use all over the place in <br/>
the Seinan wars. An estimated 6,000 police officers.  Each book will <br/>
have a different "break down" of the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Today's "Menu During a Seige" as we wait for other police troops to <br/>
show up...<br/>
millet gruel<br/>
vegetable gruel which looks like bird droppings<br/>
horsemeat (lets hope one of our steeds get shot today)<br/>
soup made from crushed horse bone<br/>
yummy<br/>
<br/>
can't stand the menu?  Then its time to open the gates and find <br/>
help...<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to give away spoilers to my write up...but when they <br/>
say "intense fighting" they mean it...some of the tactics were <br/>
downright scary...police battalions were quiet small and designed <br/>
that way for fast maneuvers...the rest of the peasant conscripts <br/>
(basically anyone who was not a police officer) served almost back <br/>
up purposes unless there was a major confrontation.  Note, the <br/>
various texts I've read will constantly mention Satsuma as taunting <br/>
the Imperial Forces as "peasants" etc again a class distinction was <br/>
very evident and I thought Satsuma wanted to end feudalism hmm....<br/>

<h3>Re: Saigo vs. Toshiyoshi (&quot;tail&quot; in translations)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-587447332">Barb, we don't know if Fujita G was at Kumamoto Castle because it <br/>
happened very early on in the conflict...basically this Castle was <br/>
standing between Tokyo and Saigo's army.  The police stationed at <br/>
Kumamoto were pretty shocked to find a document on the body of one <br/>
of Saigo's guys indicating that none other than Saigo was waiting <br/>
beyond the castle walls.  In this case the police trapped in the <br/>
castle were seriously outnumbered...I'm not going to spoil the <br/>
story :)<br/>
<br/>
Miss B, remember how we were scratching our heads over the <br/>
word "tail" that babelfish keeps spitting out?  Well it seems that <br/>
in many maneuvers during the Seinan War, specifically involving <br/>
police battalions their goal was take attack Saigo's forces from the <br/>
back, furthermore, the article I was reading deals alot <br/>
with "pronged" or "pincer" movements the government used to deal <br/>
with the guerrilla forces used by Saigo after siege of Kumamoto <br/>
Castle (considered by another researcher to be a turning point of <br/>
the war because it raised the morale of gov. troops).  After the <br/>
siege of Kumamoto castle, fierce fighting continued (because other <br/>
groups of samurai began to join with Saigo) and in a way the gov. <br/>
had to deal with a smashed bee hive so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
3-hajime mentioned that it was hard/impossible to determine which <br/>
battalion Fujita G. was assigned to and I know why...once police <br/>
troops were deployed they were re-organized and split up a couple of <br/>
times as tactics in the war changed.  All I know was that Kawaji was <br/>
in charge of an independent brigade #3 and this was considered to be <br/>
a "final" reorganization as of March 1877.  None of the writers <br/>
understand how to present the info visually like a pyramid structure <br/>
or something because it seems that there are brigades/battalions and <br/>
then a whole bunch of other police battalions running around too <br/>
which I assume are part of a larger brigade.  I know there is <br/>
probably a military book out there that explains this stuff but I am <br/>
reading info from 3 authors and they mention both <br/>
brigades/battalions/units without drawing any distinction or even <br/>
giving a basic defintion :(<br/>
<br/>
Miss B, did you find in 3-hajime anywhere of a "bonus" or prize <br/>
award given to Fujita G, besides the Medal "Order of the Blue <br/>
Paulownia"?  One of the ideas adopted from the French/"Paris" police <br/>
system was the idea of monetary awards to policemen.<br/>
<br/>
Remember how we discussed how much 100 yen really was back then?  <br/>
Fujita G received the "Order of the Blue Paulownia" + 100 yen.  <br/>
During the Seinan War, the gov. troops were in Saigo friendly <br/>
domains and when they inadvertantly destroyed civilian homes, <br/>
commanders had to compensate the civilians ofcourse.  In one record <br/>
it mentions a gov. official awarding 5 to 10 yen to people who lost <br/>
their home during the fighting...so 100 yen was -alot- of money.<br/>
