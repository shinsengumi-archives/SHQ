According to &quot;The Satsuma Rebellion of 1877 From Kagoshima Through <br/>
the Siege of Kumamoto Castle&quot; by James H. Buck<br/>
Monumenta Nipponica, Vol 28 no. 4 (Winter 1973) 427-446<br/>
<br/>
[my summary]...will appear in my Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept. <br/>
write up too...I&#39;m just so happy that hours of research turned up <br/>
something new for me atleast...<br/>
<br/>
The Imperial government attempted a secret ammunitions seizure from <br/>
Kagoshima (officially under government but prior to the Restoration <br/>
property of Satsuma clan)...the government was unsuccessful as 1,000 <br/>
Satsuma men drove off the gov&#39;s naval force.<br/>
Saigo T. was unaware of this situation.  When Saigo T. returned to <br/>
Kagoshima, Nakahara Hisao was charged with plotting to assasinate <br/>
Saigo T.  Furthermore, Nakahara H. confessed to meeting with Kawaji <br/>
Toshiyoshi, Chief Inspector of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept <br/>
(and native of Satsuma).  We don&#39;t know if Nakahara&#39;s words are to <br/>
be trusted however at least 50 members of the Tokyo Police Dept who <br/>
were natives of Satsuma returned to Kagoshima in 1876-1877 at the <br/>
same time a high-ranking Tokyo official was sent to &quot;adjust Tokyo&#39;s <br/>
relations with Satsuma leadership.&quot; &quot;Some even advocated immediate <br/>
execution of the &#39;traitors&#39; from the Tokyo Police Department.&quot;(page <br/>
430)<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is quiet obvious that Kawaji had been monitoring his own <br/>
Satsuma domain for some time and used Satsuma policemen as spies.<br/>
The article also give some more info on how Satsuma remained <br/>
rebellious against various policies,from the government they put in <br/>
power, imposed.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38286396">I need to make a few adjustments to the comments I made earlier,<br/>
EVERYONE called Saigo, GREAT SAIGO, and no the book was really that<br/>
pro Saigo at all...the book was AWESOME and it gives some some more<br/>
info on Nakahara Hisao, and how Kawaji&#39;s assasination plan was an<br/>
order from [Okubo] (remember Barb&#39;s earlier comments on how the 3<br/>
Great Men of the Restoration squabbled amongst themselves?).  Thanks<br/>
for the translation of the newspaper article Miss B.  Actually the<br/>
location Ichigo mentioned in relation to Fujita G is mentioned in<br/>
Seinan War books (one of the 2 Japanese books I mentioned had a pic of<br/>
Kawaji which made sense seeing how he was actually one of the field<br/>
generals in this war).  <br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve read so far, it would be ridiculous if more recent<br/>
books in English fail to mention the TMPD because they seemed to have<br/>
done most of the fighting (I also have stats to prove this as well)<br/>
and you would come across an entire police unit under siege at<br/>
Kumamoto Castle.  I think that newspaper articles were based on spy<br/>
info because even in the account of the siege of Kumamoto Castle we<br/>
have the name of one guy who ran around dressed as a peasant<br/>
collecting/delivering alot of info.  Furthermore, they seemed to have<br/>
been put in front of alot of skirmishes which made me wonder how<br/>
important demographics are in this war (government thinks: many of<br/>
these guys are from Aizu, might as well put them on the front lines).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037002331">@_@<br/>
did you check for Kumamoto Castle in the index?<br/>
In a totally different book the author lists the possible reasons <br/>
for why the Satsuma forces lost...and one of the reasons is that <br/>
Saigo spent too long concentrating  his troops on laying seige to <br/>
this castle, in which a whole bunch of policemen were trapped. <br/>
Initially the guys in the castle had no idea as to who was leading <br/>
the forces surrounding the castle and then they realize GREAT SAIGO <br/>
had them pinned down in one place.  So I&#39;m pretty ticked off you <br/>
books don&#39;t even mention this ^_^<br/>
<br/>
I guess my library books are detailed...it even lists field <br/>
commanders almost all of them were specifically under TMPD.  Since <br/>
TMPD&#39;s training was more intense and the officers were more <br/>
experienced from previous wars they were use all over the place in <br/>
the Seinan wars. An estimated 6,000 police officers.  Each book will <br/>
have a different &quot;break down&quot; of the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s &quot;Menu During a Seige&quot; as we wait for other police troops to <br/>
show up...<br/>
millet gruel<br/>
vegetable gruel which looks like bird droppings<br/>
horsemeat (lets hope one of our steeds get shot today)<br/>
soup made from crushed horse bone<br/>
yummy<br/>
<br/>
can&#39;t stand the menu?  Then its time to open the gates and find <br/>
help...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to give away spoilers to my write up...but when they <br/>
say &quot;intense fighting&quot; they mean it...some of the tactics were <br/>
downright scary...police battalions were quiet small and designed <br/>
that way for fast maneuvers...the rest of the peasant conscripts <br/>
(basically anyone who was not a police officer) served almost back <br/>
up purposes unless there was a major confrontation.  Note, the <br/>
various texts I&#39;ve read will constantly mention Satsuma as taunting <br/>
the Imperial Forces as &quot;peasants&quot; etc again a class distinction was <br/>
very evident and I thought Satsuma wanted to end feudalism hmm....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587447332">Barb, we don&#39;t know if Fujita G was at Kumamoto Castle because it <br/>
happened very early on in the conflict...basically this Castle was <br/>
standing between Tokyo and Saigo&#39;s army.  The police stationed at <br/>
Kumamoto were pretty shocked to find a document on the body of one <br/>
of Saigo&#39;s guys indicating that none other than Saigo was waiting <br/>
beyond the castle walls.  In this case the police trapped in the <br/>
castle were seriously outnumbered...I&#39;m not going to spoil the <br/>
story :)<br/>
<br/>
Miss B, remember how we were scratching our heads over the <br/>
word &quot;tail&quot; that babelfish keeps spitting out?  Well it seems that <br/>
in many maneuvers during the Seinan War, specifically involving <br/>
police battalions their goal was take attack Saigo&#39;s forces from the <br/>
back, furthermore, the article I was reading deals alot <br/>
with &quot;pronged&quot; or &quot;pincer&quot; movements the government used to deal <br/>
with the guerrilla forces used by Saigo after siege of Kumamoto <br/>
Castle (considered by another researcher to be a turning point of <br/>
the war because it raised the morale of gov. troops).  After the <br/>
siege of Kumamoto castle, fierce fighting continued (because other <br/>
groups of samurai began to join with Saigo) and in a way the gov. <br/>
had to deal with a smashed bee hive so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
3-hajime mentioned that it was hard/impossible to determine which <br/>
battalion Fujita G. was assigned to and I know why...once police <br/>
troops were deployed they were re-organized and split up a couple of <br/>
times as tactics in the war changed.  All I know was that Kawaji was <br/>
in charge of an independent brigade #3 and this was considered to be <br/>
a &quot;final&quot; reorganization as of March 1877.  None of the writers <br/>
understand how to present the info visually like a pyramid structure <br/>
or something because it seems that there are brigades/battalions and <br/>
then a whole bunch of other police battalions running around too <br/>
which I assume are part of a larger brigade.  I know there is <br/>
probably a military book out there that explains this stuff but I am <br/>
reading info from 3 authors and they mention both <br/>
brigades/battalions/units without drawing any distinction or even <br/>
giving a basic defintion :(<br/>
<br/>
Miss B, did you find in 3-hajime anywhere of a &quot;bonus&quot; or prize <br/>
award given to Fujita G, besides the Medal &quot;Order of the Blue <br/>
Paulownia&quot;?  One of the ideas adopted from the French/&quot;Paris&quot; police <br/>
system was the idea of monetary awards to policemen.<br/>
<br/>
Remember how we discussed how much 100 yen really was back then?  <br/>
Fujita G received the &quot;Order of the Blue Paulownia&quot; + 100 yen.  <br/>
During the Seinan War, the gov. troops were in Saigo friendly <br/>
domains and when they inadvertantly destroyed civilian homes, <br/>
commanders had to compensate the civilians ofcourse.  In one record <br/>
it mentions a gov. official awarding 5 to 10 yen to people who lost <br/>
their home during the fighting...so 100 yen was -alot- of money.<br/>

to <br/>
&gt; &gt;show up... millet gruel<br/>
&gt; &gt;vegetable gruel which looks like bird droppings<br/>
&gt; &gt;horsemeat (lets hope one of our steeds get shot today)<br/>
&gt; &gt;soup made from crushed horse bone<br/>
&gt; &gt;yummy<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; No wonder Saitou looks so blah and worn out in that group photo! <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; poor man hadn&#39;t had a decent meal let alone a bowl of soba in far <br/>
too long! </span></blockquote></div>
