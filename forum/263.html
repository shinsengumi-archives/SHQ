seems to narrate the guys as they spend some time sight seeing, with <br/>
liquor and treats (candy) in hand wearing their uniforms[?].  Babelfish <br/>
translates Mibu "farce" but this is probably an error...but it would be <br/>
interesting if the guys saw themselves portrayed in local <br/>
entertainment...now on a different Japanese site there is a mention of <br/>
puppet plays featuring the Shinsengumi which were performed when the <br/>
group was still active in Kyoto.</div>
