<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-295164576">Peacemaker Kurogane has two "seasons"; first is bases off the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker manga (or vice versa), and the second one isn't out yet--or if they're even going to turn it into an anime, not sure. Which will most probably be based on the Peacemaker Kurogane manga, the ones licensed by ADV.<br/>
 <br/>
The anime has 24 episodes. Imon Peacemaker manga has 6 volumes, and Peacemaker Kurogane manga, I think, has 5 or six volumes.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655143556">Even I've been looking for that manga... No luck. I think they stopped printing? (somebody please correct me on this!) But nevertheless, I hope ADV licenses Imon Peacemaker.. That way, fans won't have to scour for them in obscure places. <br/>
 <br/>
If you're okay with scanlations, I suggest Manga City. I don't know if they have it over at Direct Manga, but check it out just in case. And oh! www.stoptazmo.com also have them.<br/>
 <br/>
Or if you want, the pm_kurogane community over at LJ created an email account for the downloaded scans. You can just email them to yourself from there ^^ For details, please contact me privately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376262848">The "second season" is manga only. The anime only has one season, and <br/>
it is a mix of both manga, although it uses more more the first <br/>
(Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker). Some plot elements, such as Saitou's <br/>
appearance, come from the sceond (Peace Maker Kurogane).<br/>
As Kaneyoshi wrote, here are 24 episodes. Currently, ADV has 6 discs <br/>
(w/ 21 eps.) out. I'm not sure when the 7th will be out. <br/>
Manga-wise though, SIPM is not licensed. If you want to read it, you <br/>
can get the scanlations from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mangacity.net">http://www.mangacity.net</a> PMK is licensed <br/>
by ADV, and up to volume 4 is currently out.<br/>
