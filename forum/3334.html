<div id="ygrps-yiv-969948252">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Well, as it&#39;s been a little quiet around here the last time, so I hope<br/>
you don&#39;t mind me postig this and have some time to spare for a little<br/>
advice. <br/>
(I&#39;m sorry if such a personal post should not be allowed, then delete it.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m searching for a reseach topic that has to do with shinsengumi and<br/>
media. But I have no really good idea what exactly to chose. The<br/>
problem is, it has to be such a topic that there is a reason to go to<br/>
Japan (it&#39;s to get a scholarship for a year) and it has to be &quot;easy&quot;<br/>
enough that somebody studying Japanese for only 3 semesters is able to<br/>
do this..any ideas?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Something like a history of the Shinsengumi in the media?<br/>
Maybe a paper on how they entered printed media like newspapers,<br/>
novels and then more modern novels maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Keep brainstorming here (^_^)...don&#39;t worry about this list being quiet.  <br/>
