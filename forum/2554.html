no text is cited (as far as I can tell)<br/>
<br/>
the topic discussed is the Shinsengumi [after] Kyoto that is when <br/>
some of them ended up in Aizu.  It is not clear if Hijikata Toshizo <br/>
is still in Aizu or not.  All that we know is that after Hijikata <br/>
left Aizu with a large group (including Nakajima Nobori) -perhaps- <br/>
to find reinforcements, Saitou (now known as Yamaguchi Jiro) stayed <br/>
behind in Aizu with just a handful of men.<br/>
<br/>
"Saigo Tanomo" mentioned was a very important retainer close to <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori (daimyo of Aizu).<br/>

In fact, although he claimed placing a reconnaissance unit out of a <br/>
castle after Jiro Yamaguchi (Saito 1) repulsed the first attack of ¼<br/>

front. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I might be able to give it a try if I could find the original post.  Do you<br/>
know the message number?  (Or if you have a copy of the message and could<br/>
e-mail it to me directly without going through Yahoo, that would work too.<br/>
Unfortunately, Yahoo doesn't support Japanese characters.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(No guarantees on how well I can translate it, though.  I'm still a beginner<br/>
at Japanese.  I can usually puzzle out a few short paragraphs like this<br/>
between what I know and what I can look up in a dictionary, but I can't read<br/>
it well enough to go through the message board and find this one.  My<br/>
reading in Japanese is still too slow and laborious for me to have much<br/>
patience for finding stuff.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never mind, I found it.  (It's message number 271 at the above address if<br/>
anyone else wants to check the original.)  The last sentence, about the<br/>
family relationships, was confusing and I'm not sure I translated that part<br/>
correctly, but I think the rest of it is right.  Anyway, here's what I came<br/>
up with as a translation:<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
Actually, after he repelled the first attack of the western campaign,<br/>
Yamaguchi Jirou (Saitou Hajime) requested a placement in a reconnaissance<br/>
unit outside the castle, but Saigou Tanomo didn't permit it and removed him<br/>
from the front lines.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after that, the western campaign broke through the Shirasaka<br/>
gateway, which the Shinsengumi had originally been protecting.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very delicate issue whether it should be called lucky or should be<br/>
called a mistake to have taken such a true battle experienced person from<br/>
the scene.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally,  Saigou Tanomo becomes an uncle to Fujita Tokio by her cousin<br/>
Kazuo's adoptive father (Numazawa Shichirou).<br/>
