<h3><a href="#msg-3500">&gt;</a> Rurouni Kenshin/Shinsengumi Doujinshi</h3>
by <i>purplealienmio</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-643180178">Hello everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I hope you won&#39;t mind this shameless plug, but my partner Eeni has embarked on an ambitious project to make an English-language doujinshi out of a Rurouni Kenshin fanfiction I wrote. We have set up a tumblr blog in order to showcase our work, and we would be extremely grateful for any help we can get in promoting it. If you could possibly check it out, and if you like it, give us a shout-out on your website, we&#39;d be thrilled. We really hope you enjoy it and can spread the love - it was a lot of work, if I may say so myself. Eeni spent weeks working on the first two chapters. <br/>
<br/>
The fic itself is &quot;The Courtship of Lady Tokio&quot;. The links are here: <br/>

<br/>
Please let us know what you think - your candid opinion would be very much appreciated! <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much in advance, <br/>
<br/>
M & Eeni <br/>
