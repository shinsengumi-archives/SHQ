  Scans are from An Illustrated Guide to the Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
  First image: Info about the Shiban or "death squad". Hijikata in PMK mentions this in ep 20 or 21. It's a group of 4 people that head in first during a raid. <br/>
<br/>
  Second and Third Images: Info about Mibu Gishi Den's Yoshimura Kanichiro. I'm guessing someone asked if there was really someone in the Shinsengumi by that name. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230814153">I haven't seen all of PMK yet...but interesting the Shiban could be<br/>
used to lure out all the attackers like if the Ishin ShiShi see only 4<br/>
Shinsengumi then would take the bait and all attack (thereby revealing<br/>
their true numbers) then the real Shinsengumi back up squad would show<br/>
up.  I'm thinking along the lines of the Itou Affair as described by<br/>
Christopher Mayo which describes using Itou's corpse to lure out the<br/>
rest of his followers.<br/>
