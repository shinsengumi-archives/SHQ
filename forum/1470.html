<h3>Last Samurai (not the Tom Cruise One)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034014959">I had to view this 2 disk film in fast forward (but paused for the <br/>
fight scenes)....<br/>
<br/>
LAST SAMURAI (by Samurai Entertainment) Takahashi Hideki<br/>
purchased from an online merchant...can't recall address<br/>
<br/>
hmmm what can I say...<br/>
the film is about several characters whose paths cross several times <br/>
before the Bakumatsu all the way to the Seinan War (in which the <br/>
last character dies)....it's not a spoiler folks the movie ain't <br/>
pretty but what struck me is that this must've been very <br/>
controversial because it offers many *interesting* opinions on the <br/>
founding of the new era.  I can imagine some viewers lifting their <br/>
eyebrows at certain points in the script....<br/>
<br/>
1) the story is about how a Satsuma Hitokiri became a respected <br/>
military man in the new government....his friend tries to save him <br/>
from marching on Tokyo (Seinan War) by saying..."Saigo is a big old <br/>
fool!"<br/>
<br/>
2) Okita Soujiro (there is a FABULOUS indoor fight scene between <br/>
Okita and the main character---easily the [BEST] I've seen in <br/>
Japanese cinema---and I've seen plenty...the actors were splendid)<br/>
All of the moves were very clear to see and the choreography offers <br/>
ALOT of variety...truly worthy of depicting Okita S. one of the <br/>
foremost swordsmen of his day...just this scene alone makes the film <br/>
worthy buying ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi (the most INTERESTING interpretation on their uniform <br/>
I've ever seen) vs. Mimawarigumi tension<br/>
a bit of Toba Fushimi<br/>
a tiny bit of Hakodate and Takeaki Enomoto<br/>
<br/>
3) the main character = master swordsman decent guy who's outlook on <br/>
life changes alot...an important lesson learned from this <br/>
film...don't go blabbing about what you did during the revolution <br/>
especially to seemingly harmless barbers....<br/>
<br/>
4) a couple of interesting female characters...<br/>
<br/>
***this film covers alot of ground ^_^ (and includes even little <br/>
things like the retainers crying their eyes out as the Shogun <br/>
departs from Edo) but it was well written and filmed skillfully and <br/>
the director never lost sight of the fact that it is supposed to <br/>
ENTERTAIN as welll (humor here and there some romance too)....I <br/>
highly recommend it!!!! However, if you purchase it there is a <br/>
chance that it may not play on your PC....so no screencaps of the ---<br/>
different--- Shinsengumi uniform (-_-)...it seems to depend on what <br/>
version of Powerdvd you own</div>

when I got ti because I haven't' quite been in the mood to sit through <br/>
an almost 3 hr movie.<br/>

questionable past and allegiances. = Beware<br/>

day or two.<br/>

<h3>Different Uniforma</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777351837">As promised I got some screenshots of the Shinsengumi uniforms form the <br/>
1974 non Tom Cruise version of The Last Samurai they're here<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/uniforms.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/uniforms.htm</a><br/>

I  thought I got one of Okita who was wearing  a white version of <br/>
Kondou's jacket but I didn't.<br/>

<h3>Re: Different Uniforms</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-42223374">the guy in the red jinbaori/vest is [Saigo] not Kondou...pretty sure<br/>
but I did watch the movie in fast forward<br/>
<br/>
***the main character's sword style is Mugai Ryu (Okita I believe says<br/>
that the original/form is located in Edo however the hero clarified<br/>
and said that his sensei used derived forms---think back to the theme<br/>
of crosstraining and mix and match whatever technique you<br/>
like---unorthodox but whatever works is what important)<br/>
<br/>
***(good scene) when someone tells Okita that "it" is on display at<br/>
(insert location)...and then emphasizes that "KONDO's HEAD" is on<br/>
display...the actor who portrays Okita, although not attractive did a<br/>
good job of conveying unspeakable anguish<br/>
<br/>
***the movie does the whole black cat story too<br/>
