<h3>Suzuki Mikisaburo (rank and jurisdiction)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-800309987">I know Miki ended up being a police chief and retired to his hometown <br/>
to raise bonsai (common hobby amongst modern cops) and chickens (not <br/>
common hobby amongs modern cops)...but do we know his jurisdiction?<br/>
<br/>
Because there is alot of info on the Tokyo Metropolitan Police <br/>
Department (Kawaji's pet project) and prestige attached to the <br/>
capital police as really were retainers to the royal family.  I was <br/>
wondering if Miki worked in a more rural area...if so he would've <br/>
managed chuzaisho (rural versions of the "koban"* police boxes) and <br/>
had to deal with the army which was more dominant in rural areas.  <br/>
Police in rural areas are even more *closer* to citizens too.<br/>
<br/>
*during the Meiji Era another term was used for koban (which meant <br/>
dormitory) but the term "koban" stuck to this very day<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Meiji Era police (every jurisdiction) had songs...during major events <br/>
such as kendo or judo tournaments bands would play (see Kurosawa's <br/>
SAnshiro Sugata, during the 70s notes/lyrics for police music were <br/>
reprinted to celebrate the centenial anniversary of the police <br/>
system, the Seinan War pic of F.G. was discovered and later on the <br/>
diary of Toshiyoshi Kawaji in a law library)<br/>
<br/>
*major event*<br/>
<br/>
Koga Tanji (Fujita Goro's friend) "Psst hey Goro, you have to sing <br/>
just like the rest of us, we have to be unified and all that"<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro "I refuse to do so"<br/>
<br/>
Koga TAnji "If you don't you'll end up assigned to the koban near <br/>
your house where you'll just stand there and give directions to <br/>
pedestrians all day"<br/>
<br/>
Fujita Goro [shrugs]<br/>
<br/>
Koga Tanji "okay I'll bribe you" (hands F.G. a bottle of sake)<br/>
<br/>
**5 minutes later**<br/>
<br/>
New Recruit "Koga-san Is there any way to STOP Inspector Fujita from <br/>
singing?" (puts hand over ears)<br/>
<br/>
Koga TAnji "I'm afraid not, once he has sake in his system there is <br/>
no stopping him, and he does have a kawaii voice you know"</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439928793">The most I have currently on Miki that would apply is that he probably began his police service in July, 1869 (after being a staff sergeant in charge of military affairs and responsible for bringing soldiers, etc. home after the Battle of Aizu (and this after he was released from prison during the Sekihoutai fiasco)); was police chief in Tsuruoka (wherever that is, he also contributed funds to the building of the hospital there); and in Meiji 14, he was in charge of security for the Emperor's tour.  Does that give you any leads to follow?  Oh, and he retired in 1884.  I should be able to dig up the links (in Japanese) for that info... just can't get to it at the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437708867">There is a Tsuruoka in Tokyo and a Tsuruoka in Yamagata <br/>
Prefecture...police who served as part of the Imperial entourage were <br/>
absorbed into the Imperial Guard (even on a temporary basis and their <br/>
ranks in the police system were preserved e.g. Inspector of the <br/>
Imperial Guard)....and the Imperial Guard headquarters was at the <br/>
palace which was at Tokyo...I assume Miki was in Tokyo<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can give us some more info please do (^_^)<br/>

There is *only* a Tsuruoka in Yamagata Prefecture...so Miki was in a <br/>
rural area....it means the Emperor travelled there and local law <br/>
enforcement provided additional security<br/>
