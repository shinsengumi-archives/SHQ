<h3>Great news!</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-315200513">I found out that there's a scanner available on my campus for FREE! <br/>
Soo....expect several scans as early as Monday(hopefully)! These include:<br/>
<br/>
1. A never-before seen photo of Matsudaira Katamori, which shows how truly <br/>
young he was in those days.<br/>
2. Better-quality pictures of Tokugawa Yoshinobu<br/>
3. Scans from the official NHK "Shinsengumi!" Guidebook<br/>
4. Pictures of Nijo and Aizu Castles<br/>
5. My own drawings, including Hiro and Yuki (from my Shinsengumi novel), as <br/>
well as my own depictions of Shinsengumi members, such as Kondou, Hijikata, <br/>
Okita, Saitou, Shimada, and Nakajima Nobori.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this will all be put up bit by bit. But I just wanted to let <br/>
everyone know that there's a great deal that's on its way.<br/>
