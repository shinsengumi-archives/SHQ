<h3>Masuya , Ueno War, and TB</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682349345">Ok, I ran across an anime site that had info about the shop the <br/>
Shinsengumi raided just before the Ikedaya incident and the Ueno War. <br/>
It also had an odd fact about TB. It's not much mind you and a lot of <br/>
folks might have already run across this. Also, I'm not even sure <br/>
their information is accurate. The Ueno War thing seemed pretty <br/>
interesting to me though, because I've never run across ANYTHING on <br/>
it before, other than the name. Probably I'm the only dummy here who <br/>
didn't know this. -_-<br/>
<br/>
The site in question is:<br/>

Masuya - That was the name of the store the Shinsengumi raided as we <br/>
all know. The merchant who ran it called himself "Kiemon", but he was <br/>
really a Choshu samurai named Kotaka Shuntaro. The Shinsengumi found <br/>
out about him supposedly by following one of Miyabe Teizo's servants <br/>
back to the place. (He was staying there at the time.) Of course they <br/>
captured the owner and tortured him and weapons found hidden in the <br/>
shop. But here's what confused me. Both from the RK OVA and the <br/>
PeaceMaker anime, I thought that the incident at the Ikedaya took <br/>
place either later that same day or the next day? It says here that <br/>
it took place "less than a week later"? This implies to me that at <br/>
least a couple days passed. Anyone care to clarify or object to this?<br/>
<br/>
Ueno War - I knew that the group known as the Shogitai (the group <br/>
that Harado joined) were defeated in the Ueno War. Until now that's <br/>
all I could find out. I couldn't even come up with a date. (Some of <br/>
you scholars have been holding out with the info, haven't you?) <br/>
According to this site, they formed in March of 1868 and served as an <br/>
informal police force in Edo. They were headquartered in the temple <br/>
of Kanei-ji in Ueno. The city was surrendered, but they refused to <br/>
stop resisting the Imperialists and were defeated in a battle that <br/>
took place on July 4, 1868. Much of the temple was destroyed in the <br/>
fighting. Some survivors then went on to fight in Hokkaido. Of <br/>
course, Harada is generally thought to have died in that battle.<br/>
<br/>
Ketsukaku - The name for TB in Japan. The site said that Shinto <br/>
tradition thought it was a polluting diease. Both the sufferer and <br/>
their family were stigmatized by it and even today people who had <br/>
someone with it in their family history have a harder time getting <br/>
married. Anyone know anyting about this claim?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm not certain. I haven't run across enough about Shinto beliefs yet. Sounds like an interesting religion from what I do know about it,though.<br/>
<br/>
As far as why the Shinsengumi kept Okita's condition secret goes, I always thought it had more to do with them being afraid the group would be demoralized if they found out their strongest member had a fatal illness. This just adds a new twist to it. Maybe they were afraid some of their followers would think it was a sign the Shinsengumi were angering the kami or something? Knowing how forward-thinking Hijikata was, I can't see him giving in to superstitions. He had a very practical reason for hiding Okita's condition I'm sure, but that doesn't mean he didn't recognize what the knowledge might lead others to think.<br/>
<br/>
But what about the other stuff? Was the site correct about the raid at the Masuya and the Ueno War do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379805338">Shintoism is very difficult to study because it was synthesized with<br/>
Buddhism (for example many Japanese people today will not deny that<br/>
they "believe" in both Shintoism -and- Buddhism but they may not<br/>
"practice" either).  Shintoism is big on purification for example the<br/>
marking of sacred areas and the significance of water but that is<br/>
merely the beginning.  All shrines have official purification<br/>
ceremonies on their special festival days<br/>
<br/>
I think it is impossible to prevent the Shinsengumi from being<br/>
demoralized when news got out about Okita's condition.  I can imagine<br/>
that they were concerned about it leaking to the general public<br/>
because the Ishin Shishi could definately "spin" it to encourage their<br/>
followers that the Shinsengumi were not so invincible.<br/>
<br/>
The website you brought up is awesome (I added it to the website<br/>
database back on Miburo Yahoo Groups).<br/>
<br/>
The text resource it used are well accepted (Ikedaya info)<br/>
Hillsborough, Romulus. Ryoma: Life of a Renaissance Samurai [but] <br/>
(Ueno War) Japan : An Illustrated Encyclopedia p.1643 is a very<br/>
general resource which can hardly explain the intricacies of what is<br/>
considered to be a minor conflict.  <br/>
