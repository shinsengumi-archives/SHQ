fabric with a good sheen and a pebbly texture. It has a beautiful drape, <br/>
and is great for semi-fitted to loose-fitted styles...&quot;<br/>

Those Suzuki boys liked nice clothes....undoubtedly the influence of <br/>
Mama Suzuki and hard drinking sister Koto. *snicker*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133744951">I&#39;ve just read the page about Aizu Women by Masayoshi and I appreciate <br/>
it very much.<br/>
<br/>
A little note; there is &quot;? &quot;after the word &quot;chirimen&quot; for the <br/>
description of the kimono worn by Nakano sisters.<br/>
&quot;Chirimen&quot; means &quot; crepe&quot; as just Barb mentioned for the cloth of Ito&#39;s <br/>
favorite black haori.<br/>
I read somewhere Tanaka sisters wore beautiful chirimen kimono, purple <br/>
and asagi, so crepe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is testimony of Fujita Makoto which is the grandson of Fujita <br/>
Gorou. <br/>
It appears in this book in detail. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4041906121/qid=1100614734/re">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4041906121/qid=1100614734/re</a><br/>
f=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/249-1742061-3265907<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My father&quot; in this testimony is not Fujita Gorou. <br/>
He is Fujita Tsutomu which is the son of Gorou. <br/>
How Gorou educated his sons does not remain in record. <br/>
However, we can know it a little by this testimony of Makoto. <br/>
As Kamo-san guessed, &quot;Shidou-fukakugo&quot; is the word used by <br/>
Shinsengumi. <br/>
I cannot think that Tsutomu used this word spontaneously. <br/>
Probably, when Tsutomu was a child, he would receive the same <br/>
education from Gorou. <br/>
(The samurai has to be able to do preparedness always. Even if he is <br/>
attacked by the enemy, to be able to cope with it calmly is desired. <br/>
It will be &quot;Shidou-fukakugo&quot;, if he is surprised and escapes.)<br/>
Tsutomu is the son who was most near the Gorou. <br/>
He respected the father very much. <br/>
It is no wonder to consider that the education which he received <br/>
from the father gave his son. <br/>
<br/>
There is one more testimony of Makoto about the education of <br/>
Tsutomu. <br/>
Tsutomu taught Makoto &quot;Enter first from a leg&quot;, when going into an <br/>
inner side from the door. <br/>
If he puts the head into the door previously, even if he is cut by <br/>
the enemy in the door, he cannot counterattack. <br/>
If the leg was cut, he can do a counterattack, falling. <br/>
Probably, as for this, Tsutomu was similarly taught from Gorou. <br/>
It seems that the character of Fujita Gorou did not change even if <br/>
it became a peaceful time^^<br/>
