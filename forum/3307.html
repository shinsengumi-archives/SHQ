(it was written on the new strange version of word, if you have <br/>
problems please email secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com)<br/>
<br/>
it is a file which will expire in 7 days<br/>
<br/>
we have a reason for this...<br/>
<br/>
it is a work of speculation however we have really tried our best to <br/>
investigate this matter<br/>
<br/>
We are currently waiting for a response from someone with an <br/>
insider's view of the subject.  There is a chance this person may not <br/>
be able to clarify this mystery.  If that is the case then what you <br/>
have is our most sincerest effort.<br/>
<br/>
The work was translated and written by A. Bakalian in collaboration <br/>
with secretarytocapt3 who provided some bits of text and who dragged <br/>
him (kicking and screaming into the Meiji Era) and into the study of <br/>
Takamine Hideo.<br/>
<br/>
In a few days, there will be yet another anniversary to mark the <br/>
death of Fujita Goro.  In 1915, he lived through his last September.  <br/>
The month always held great meaning to him.  It was in September of <br/>
1868 his time as a Shinsengumi fighting in Aizu came to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the purpose of why he sat in seiza (position) before death <br/>
was to maintain his mental lucidity and clean from his mind that <br/>
fateful month from his youth and all ties which bind him to this <br/>
world: hate, love, revenge, even joy.  He yearned to destroy his ego <br/>
in an attempt to find freedom.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Minor Detail:<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to submit to members here a photograph of a garden <br/>
where Fujita Goro once spent alot of time in.  I know it's not <br/>
the "coolest" photo but please bear in mind that many things in Tokyo <br/>
was completely destroyed in 1923 Kanto Earthquake, and more <br/>
destruction during WWII.  This photo was taken in between those <br/>
catastrophic events.  Thus, to even have this photo is remarkable.  <br/>
It was preserved outside of Japan.  So yes, over 2 decades before the <br/>
photo was taken---Fujita Goro was here (I assure you on this fact).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79903546">Dear SHQ members,<br/>
<br/>
I know that perhaps the megaupload file (which ended in .docx may have<br/>
given some of you problems in viewing the file so I have attached the<br/>
file in its entirety below (a the very bottom).<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to present more evidence, as resaerched by Mr.<br/>
Bakalian which does much to confirm our assertion that Saito Hajime<br/>
did not have 5 names, but 6---and that he came up with the 6th because<br/>
he insisted on speaking on behalf of a friend---a very good friend.<br/>
<br/>
{new additional evidence}<br/>
"Saito Kazuma" calls himself an Aizu samurai<br/>
-- according to Saito Hajime no subete, in the Meiji Era, Fujita Goro<br/>
was registered (on records) as formerly an Aizu samurai<br/>
<br/>
-- the most powerful detail emerged from an acquaintance of mine who<br/>
graciously provided a key word and that is SAitou Kazuma knew the<br/>
Takamine family since their "Sannohe" days.  <br/>
<br/>
Sannohe is located in Northern Japan which was where hundreds of Aizu<br/>
families were exiled (or travelled to--to reunite with family). <br/>
Amongst those samurai included Ichinohe Denpachi who soon changed his<br/>
name to Fujita Goro.<br/>
<br/>
Sannohe is a district.<br/>
<br/>
Gonohe is a town.<br/>
<br/>
The Kurasawa family lived in Gonohe.  The Kurasawa shared their home<br/>
with Fujita Goro.  This is a well known fact amongst Japanese<br/>
Shinsengumi researchers.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, "Saito Kazuma" who knew the Takamine family from their<br/>
time in Sannohe has the SAME biography as SAITOU HAJIME (FUJITA GORO).<br/>
<br/>
Which members of the Takamine family did "Saitou Kazuma" meet in<br/>
Sannohe?  He met Takamine's mother, and brothers (who were young<br/>
children).  Takamine Hideo (Tadayoshi) himself was a POW in Edo/Tokyo.<br/>
 The narrative of the Takamine family has partly been preserved in the<br/>
diary of a Swiss immigrant (professor of Oswego Normal School).  In<br/>
short, "Saitou Kazuma" knew the Takamine family when they faced<br/>
incredible hardship, so much so that they adopted one of their younger<br/>
sons to another Aizu family.  Saitou Kazuma knew this family well<br/>
before they prospered in the Meiji Era.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, we feel somewhat our theory has blossomed into something more.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Mr. Bakalian for doing this work.<br/>
As I have always known, Takamine and Fujita were truly good friends,<br/>
even though they were 10 years apart and came from different backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
I hope they are enjoying a drink now, wherever they may be.<br/>

THE MYSTERY OF SAITO KAZUMA<br/>
By Armen Bakalian <br/>
with notes by secretarytocapt3<br/>
<br/>
FACTS:  <br/>
Takamine Hideo was the cousin of Takagi/Fujita Tokio<br/>
Fujita Goro very likely found employment in the Education Museum<br/>
(years on the job 1891-1899) through the assistance of Takamine (who<br/>
had a leadership role in the Imperial Museum, and Educational Museum<br/>
which was affiliated with the Normal School he also managed).  <br/>
Fujita Goro was employed at the Tokyo (Higher) Women's Normal School<br/>
(years on the job 1899-1909) through petitions by both Takagi<br/>
Morinusuke (his brother-in-law) and Takamine Hideo.<br/>
A mystery is unfolding.<br/>
<br/>
In the reminiscences collected in: Furoku: Tsuikai Danso of/about the<br/>
educator Takamine Hideo, three is one reminiscence, titled "Ko<br/>
Takamine Hideo-kun" (The Late Mr. Takamine Hideo) pages 5 to 7, penned<br/>
by one "Saito Kazuma, former Aizu retainer." This would be inherently<br/>
worth something, except when you consider the following (note:<br/>
Japanese kanji follow):<br/>
<br/>
&#25993;&#34276;&#19968; Saito Hajime<br/>
&#25993;&#34276;&#19968;&#39340; Saito Kazuma<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference of one kanji between this man's name and the<br/>
name of the Shinsengumi captain, Saito Hajime. Nowhere in the text, or<br/>
in the entirety of "Takamine Hideo Sensei-den" (especially the<br/>
chapter(s) on Aizu), does it have any mention of this man; and it<br/>
certainly does not say anything about him being of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
However, it also doesn't disprove his potentially being Saito Hajime<br/>
of the Shinsengumi. Saito Hajime, at the time of Takamine Hideo's<br/>
death, used the name Fujita Goro; however, let us consider the facts:<br/>
this is a collection of writings in tribute to one of the greatest<br/>
educators in modern Japanese history.<br/>
Fujita Goro was a traffic cop, museum guard, and sword appraiser to<br/>
Takamine and personal friend; would the writings of such a low-ranking<br/>
man fit alongside the tributes penned by Shinoda Toshihide, Yasui<br/>
Tetsu, Baron Kuki Ryuichi, and the women who undertook high-level<br/>
roles in the Tokyo Women's Normal School? In the modern day, would a<br/>
book of reminiscences of a school or university president include the<br/>
words of the gateman? Perhaps it is just my opinion, but the answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
However, Fujita Goro does have a way of putting his words alongside<br/>
everyone else's: his Aizu connection. He may not have been born in<br/>
Aizu, but he was adopted into its community, married the daughter of<br/>
an Aizu samurai, and spilled blood for its people. He had as much a<br/>
right as anyone to call himself an Aizu samurai. Furthermore, "Saito<br/>
Kazuma" does what no one else in Furoku dares to do: brings up, at<br/>
length, Takamine's Aizu connection, his conduct in the Boshin War, and<br/>
his continued devotion to his former lord's family. Others perhaps<br/>
mention Takamine's origins briefly, but pass over them quickly; after<br/>
all, at the time of Takamine's death, Aizu was still stigmatized under<br/>
the false label of "enemy of the throne."<br/>
It is not until 1928, the Imperial wedding between Matsudaira Setsuko<br/>
and Prince Chichibu (brother of Emperor Hirohito) did Aizu<br/>
"officially" return into good graces to the national narrative.<br/>
<br/>
Could "Saito Kazuma" be, in fact, the rather taciturn(1) Saito Hajime,<br/>
writing under a slightly, yet cleverly altered pseudonym? Could the<br/>
old warrior have broken his silence for Takamine Hideo? While there is<br/>
as yet no definite "yes" answer to that question, there is also no<br/>
definite "no." However, when considering even some of the points<br/>
covered by Ko Takamine Hideo-kun, the facts line up a little too<br/>
neatly for this to be mere coincidence.<br/>
<br/>
*"Saito" has intimate knowledge of the events concerning Takamine's<br/>
school. Fujita Goro was an employee of the school.(2)<br/>
<br/>
*"Saito" devotes great length to praising Takamine's art collection.<br/>
Takamine, who relied on Saito for sword appraisal, gave Saito<br/>
unrestricted access to the art collection in his LOCKED storehouse.(3)<br/>
<br/>
*"Saito" knows that Matsudaira Katamori's sons came to Takamine's<br/>
house for tutoring. Firstly, the Matsudaira children, as sons of a<br/>
former daimyo, would not be taken just anywhere; secondly, for "Saito"<br/>
to know of this point, regarding the still maligned Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori's family, shows that he was trusted. Fujita Goro spent a<br/>
great deal of time visiting Takamine's house.(4) After all, Fujita<br/>
received the name Fujita Goro from Matsudaira Katamori himself.<br/>
*"Saito's own oldest son, Fujita Tsutomu, was friends with Matsudaira<br/>
Tsuneo.  Ofcourse Saito would know if any one of the Matsudaira boys<br/>
spent time at Takamine's home.  After all, his own sons probably did<br/>
as well.  We know that Takamine's own daughter frequently visited the<br/>
Fujita home.<br/>
<br/>
*"Saito" knows that Takamine talked about the Matsudaira family to his<br/>
Aizu friend Kusaka Yoshio (Onetime governor of Nagasaki and Fukushima<br/>
Prefectures), and "shed sincere tears." Historical records suggest<br/>
that Takamine almost never spoke openly about Aizu, though he was in<br/>
charge of the former retainers' association; consequently, for "Saito"<br/>
to know of Takamine speaking about Aizu, and speaking emotionally<br/>
about Aizu, shows his level of trust. Fujita Goro, as stated above,<br/>
often came to the Takamine house, and when he came, would always drink<br/>
sake(5). Those who know the Japanese culture of sake know that you<br/>
don't just randomly invite someone to your house and let them drink<br/>
alone; first of all, for Fujita to be trusted to the point of being<br/>
allowed to *always* drink sake at the Takamine house suggests that he<br/>
might have witnessed such discussions about the past. Fujita often<br/>
spoke of the past to Yamakawa Kenjiro, another prominent Aizu native,<br/>
so it is not unreasonable to think that he may have spoken of the past<br/>
to Takamine, as well. Kenjiro's brother Hiroshi, during his tenure as<br/>
president of the Normal School (while Takamine was still there), is<br/>
believed to have been the one who recommended Fujita for employment;<br/>
an overlap between Fujita's discussions with Kenjiro and Fujita's<br/>
discussions with Takamine Hideo is not at all unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
The Aizu natives who are on record as having associated or been in<br/>
close proximity to Takamine are all families who were high-ranking<br/>
Aizu retainers: Yamakawa, Ibuka, Takagi, Numazawa, Iinuma, Saigo...for<br/>
the sake of confirmation, I have looked over the casualty lists for a<br/>
"Saito Kazuma" or a relation of one, in Yamakawa Kenjiro's Hoshu Aizu<br/>
Byakkotai Jukyushi-den, they include: Saito Gengo, Saito Yukichi,<br/>
Saito Jinzaemon, Saito Tasaburo, and Saito Tetsunosuke. None of them<br/>
particularly high-ranking; none of them containing any reference to a<br/>
"Saito Kazuma."(6)<br/>

Some Pros and Cons to Consider<br/>
1)	 Why would FUJITA GORO use a pseudonym?  It's unnecessary isn't it?<br/>
Mr. Bakalian raises and important point regarding status.  In the<br/>
Meiji Era generally you would invite someone honored to speak on<br/>
behalf of the deceased.  While Fujita was no doubt a close and<br/>
respected friend his position cannot compare to many of the other<br/>
people who contributed to Takamine's memorial/biography.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we have to think like a Japanese living in the Meiji Era not as<br/>
someone living in 2007.<br/>
<br/>
Another point to consider is clearly the fact that Saito Kazuma is not<br/>
addressing educators, he is addressing people of the Aizu community. <br/>
Therefore the name "Saito" may or may not ring a bell with people of<br/>
that background.  "Saito" would mean nothing to many readers.  Simply,<br/>
is this the coded language that comes from living a bit separately<br/>
from society due to one's past Aizu connections?  Please keep in mind<br/>
that there was a lot of discrimination, favoritism and cronyism after<br/>
1868 which was based on one's feudal hometown.<br/>
<br/>
2)	So how does Saito Kazuma get to write all this stuff?<br/>
That is the biggest question.  The Takamine family had several<br/>
surviving members, including Takamine Hideo's aged mother (who was<br/>
close to Tokio and no doubt knew Fujita Goro VERY WELL), Takamine's<br/>
2nd, 3rd son, and 2 daughters.  Why would four members of the Takamine<br/>
family let some strange person write all of this?  Clearly Saito<br/>
Kazuma is someone they knew and trusted very well<br/>
<br/>
3)	Who else oversaw the publication?<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro's name appears at the end of the book as likely a<br/>
financial contributor to its publication.  He was also a mutual friend<br/>
of Fujita and Takamine and a major figure in the post 1868 Aizu<br/>
network.  Again we ask, if Yamakawa proofread this work he had to know<br/>
who Saito Kazuma was and like the Takamine family, was "ok" with it.<br/>
<br/>
4)	Wait a minute!  Takamine's book was published in 1921 !  Fujita<br/>
Goro was DEAD ALREADY in 1915!  He could not have written anything.<br/>
This is obviously a question which needs to be answered.  Takamine<br/>
died in 1910, however his memorial was not published for a decade. <br/>
Japanese frequently publish memorial even years after the person has<br/>
died (they do so to fall on certain Buddhist anniversaries).  It is<br/>
not strange for a friend to prepare statements which are published<br/>
later on behalf of the deceased.  Most interestingly even some of<br/>
Takamine's speeches were published years after he died (for the first<br/>
time).  Furthermore, the words of Saito Kazuma may in fact be the<br/>
polished narrative assisted by Fujita Tokio (admittedly a very well<br/>
educated of the feudal era AND knew Takamine when he was still just a<br/>
teenager as well).<br/>
<br/>
Tokio was alive when this project had already started (she died in<br/>
1921). Even though she may have retired from the Higher Women's Normal<br/>
School (we do not have the start or end dates of her employment<br/>
there), she was close to campus and likely "hung out" there to help<br/>
out or just be nosy. In doing so she could easily be found. We must<br/>
also remember that Tokio was Takamine's cousin and they knew each<br/>
other since 1868 while serving in the castle.<br/>
<br/>
To prove that Saito Kazuma is NOT Fujita Goro:<br/>
1)	Find a real Aizu retainer who was named Saito Kazuma.  At this time<br/>
we have not yet found a retainer with that name after searching<br/>
through more well known Aizu history books (which do include lists of<br/>
names).  Perhaps one would have to go to a library in Aizu Wakamatsu<br/>
to find this man.<br/>
2)	Find an educator, artist, scientist who was an Aizu associate of<br/>
Takamine with the name Saito Kazuma.<br/>
I, secretarytocapt3, have spent nearly 3 intense years studying<br/>
Takamine Hideo from various research angles.  I have never found the<br/>
name of an educator, Aizu connections or not, with the name "Saito<br/>
Kazuma".</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041866344">OMG! This is incredible information about Saito Kazuma! It certainly <br/>
made my head spin. Information I will read and reread, again and <br/>
again, that is for sure.<br/>
<br/>
This is all making me so curious about the Takamine family.  I have <br/>
not even thought of studying on Mr. Takamine, but after this, I <br/>
seriously want to know who this man is that trusted Saito with so <br/>
many confidential areas of his life.  What was their relationship and <br/>
what made them so compatible.  Oh, if only I could be a fly on the <br/>
wall back then, can you imagine the conversations I'd overhear?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your research, and for sharing it with those of <br/>
us who mentally 'live' during that time.  This is precious <br/>
information and I for one, am drinking it down like a fish that had <br/>
been out of water way too long!  Ahhhhhhh *burp*  So good!<br/>

------------------------------------------------<br/>
Dear Kikue, thanks for your comment!<br/>
<br/>
Just something for everyone to chew on.  WHO came up with the name <br/>
Saito Kazuma?  <br/>
<br/>
I wager it's not even Fujita.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's Tokio.<br/>
Let me try to explain (and you all can disregard this blabber if you <br/>
want)<br/>
<br/>
Japanese love to keep logs/records since feudal times.  If there is a <br/>
famine you write it down.  If there is a fire, you note houses burned.<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu kept a good log on Shinsengumi<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi (yet another friend of the Fujitas) even noted in <br/>
his log when Fujita Tsutomu was born (Goro and Tokio's first son)<br/>
Many families (well before 1868) kept an expense log (usually <br/>
maintained by the wife if she was literate)<br/>
<br/>
It is in no way strange if Fujita Goro scribbled something in his log <br/>
book (mind you it's probably not a tell all diary XD) after Takamine <br/>
died.  When the book is printed, Tokio could easily rummage through <br/>
hubby's stuff and pull out the papersand she may have done some <br/>
editinglike tag on a fake name.<br/>
<br/>
Remember Tokio was still alivethis is still well before the 1923 <br/>
earthquake when a lot of things are lost forever.<br/>
<br/>
Kikue, it's not complete yet but you can visit this site <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.takaminehideo.net">http://www.takaminehideo.net</a> (studied the T-sensei since 2004 and it <br/>
occurred to me to put up a site in 2006 XD---there is a section on <br/>
the Siamese and Takamine during Fujita's years at the school which I <br/>
should upload)<br/>
<br/>
Well the information we posted ofcourse is based on a translation of <br/>
just what "Saitou Kazuma" said about Takamine.  So your question <br/>
about what made two very very different men friends is very important <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
So I'd like to approach your question from another angle, "what did <br/>
Takamine think about Fujita?"  I've been studying this man since <br/>
2004.  Info on Takamine appears in English, Japanese and Thai (I've <br/>
found him in 4 Thai books---however 2 cite the other as source).<br/>
I can't even begin to list how different they were in terms of <br/>
background:<br/>
<br/>
Age:  Takamine was exactly 10 years younger than Fujita Goro<br/>
This is important.  In 1868, Takamine was only 15 however unlike <br/>
Fujita he never really was a fully a samurai "in practice" (if you <br/>
incorporate the warrior definition of a samurai).  Takamine was a <br/>
page, while that was an important job, he like another friend of <br/>
Fujita, Yamakawa Kenjiro, could not experience the dimension of going <br/>
into battle.  The reason why both Takamine and Yamakawa [respected] <br/>
Fujita because: <br/>
<br/>
1) Yamaguchi Jiro ~DEFENDED AIZU, their homeland---if I may speculate <br/>
here, Fujita to them, was sort of their hero.  Regardless of any <br/>
difference in social class in the Meiji, they didn't see him <br/>
as "officer Fujita"  they saw him as a samurai.<br/>
<br/>
2) They shared in survivor's guilt and had empathy for one another<br/>
Social Background:  Takamine (as a kid he was called Tadayoshi not <br/>
Hideo), completed his education at Nisshinkan (Aizu's school for <br/>
samurai) and was gifted enough to be called a 'shindo', he was given <br/>
the job of page to daimyo Matsudaira Katamori.  <br/>
We know Saitou's background pretty well (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Adulthood:  Takamine spent 3 years in the USA (rural New York) and <br/>
spent the rest of his life in Japan as an academic and was involved <br/>
in many extracurricular activities (art, science, charity, working <br/>
with many foreigners--some of whom literally exported "Meiji Japan" <br/>
to the USA and even to Europe)<br/>
Fujita's career was very "classic" post 1868 samurai jobs (police, <br/>
bodyguard to Inoue Kaoru, Imperial guard detail for the Empress etc)<br/>
<br/>
Political/Social views:  Takamine was a "true" progressive (not like <br/>
Mori Arinori, or even Takamine's own mentor Fukuzawa).  Some women <br/>
here may appreciate this:  "He (Takamine) hated the old saying 'men <br/>
revered, women subjected'...." (danson-johi) (Takamine Hideo-sensei <br/>
den, p. 174 translated by A. Bakalian).  T-sensei worked very hard <br/>
for women's education and also adopted highly unpopular views at the <br/>
risk of his own career.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know about Fujita's views.<br/>
<br/>
so with all these differences in mind how did they become friends, <br/>
other than their common Aizu "connection" and the fact that Tokio is <br/>
Takamine's cousin?<br/>
<br/>
They are different that's why they get along.<br/>
<br/>
Takamine was VERY LOQUACIOUS (he can blah blah blah for hours on <br/>
topics he likes).  Fujita was taciturn or he may have come across as <br/>
a good listener.  For all we know Fujita may have learned how to <br/>
sleep with his eyes open in these one sided conversations : LOL :<br/>
Fujita may have felt that some of Takamine's ideas were 100% "silly" <br/>
because---they were (if you imagine yourself to be a typical Japanese <br/>
man of that era).  <br/>
<br/>
However, likely their conversations were "selective" and focused on <br/>
things they could agree on:  certain political figures they knew from <br/>
before 1868, who were still around in the Meiji Era.  In other <br/>
words "Did you read about that guy who just died, remember what he <br/>
was up to during the war?...." etc etc<br/>
<br/>
Very few people can advise Takamine in matters of art, except when it <br/>
came to swords.  Again, one must meditate on the fact that Fujita in <br/>
his youth had to have had a peculiar education or mentor to be so <br/>
learned in the field of sword appraisal to have been able to give <br/>
pointers to a man like Takamine who was -OBSESSED- with things like <br/>
traditional, modern art, pottery etc.<br/>
<br/>
We all assume that Fujita's appointment to the Women's Normal School <br/>
was to Fujita's advantage.<br/>
<br/>
From my own study into Meiji Education politics I don't think this is <br/>
necessarily the only way to view the situation.  It was to TAKAMINE'S <br/>
ADVANTAGE to have someone in the office to keep him informed.  There <br/>
was intense factionalism in the system and as the director it was a <br/>
good idea to have a good "pulse" on the situation in the school and <br/>
to inform him if some of his wacky ideas was truly accepted or not by <br/>
his staff and faculty. To keep this short, I have to say that <br/>
Takamine's career had very very severe declines.  By the time he <br/>
drags a friend into the school, Takamine has seen it all when it <br/>
comes to career matters.<br/>
<br/>
"Saitou Kazuma" seemed to know intimate details about Takamine.  Well <br/>
the reverse is true as well.  When Numazawa Tatsuo asked his aunt <br/>
Ibuka Saku about his true parentage (Tatsuo was Goro and Tokio's <br/>
third son), Ibuka told him the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Ibuka is Takamine's  mother's family.  <br/>
<br/>
In other words, it's impossible to imagine that Takamine didn't know <br/>
about the adoption, Ibuka Saku was probably his mother's relative <br/>
(sister?).  Tokio had to have told Takamine's mother about the <br/>
adoption.  Pic of Tokio's gal pal "Ma Takamine" (Takamine Kinoko <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/TakamineKinoko.jpg)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/TakamineKinoko.jpg)</a>. <br/>
Takamine's mother in turn may have told her own relative.<br/>
<br/>
Recall this testimony:<br/>
<br/>
"Mrs. Tokio and my grandmother Ikuno/Kinoko were very close to each <br/>
other, and Mrs. Tokio often came over to see my grandmother...If my <br/>
memories are correct, at the time Ms. Tokio had her bangs <br/>
in 'kirisage style"<br/>
I remember, when my mother died, Ms. Tokio stopped by my house <br/>
several times to help us.<br/>
Mrs. Tokio was a woman not too tall, but rather small of stature. She <br/>
certainly did look like an Aizu woman. (likely because she was small--<br/>
or maybe also because she was hard-working) She often went to the <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori's home at Enoki-zaka...working there on many <br/>
different things (or: There she devoted herself to various chores, <br/>
such as housekeeping and other things women were in charge)<br/>
My grandmother often took my sister and I to Mr. Fujita's <br/>
residence...As I remember, from the street we would go down the stone-<br/>
made staircase to get to the house.<br/>
<br/>
These stories are from Ms. Takamine Keiko who was interviewed in 1978.<br/>
<br/>
Keiko was born in the 1890s and therefore only knew very "aged" Mr. <br/>
and Mrs. Fujita.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in a way this discovery of a "Saito Kazuma" makes up for my <br/>
disastrous attempt at acquiring the wedding photos of Mr. and Mrs. <br/>
Takamine.<br/>
<br/>
While Takamine is not our main interest, what we want are the other <br/>
Aizu figures which would show up in a group photo, namely, possibly a <br/>
man which may or may not resemble the one shown in teh Seinan War <br/>
photo.<br/>
<br/>
Research is never neat and organized, you have to be really really <br/>
wily to find what you need and look for other "opportunities" because <br/>
after all, there is little or no chance of anyone finding artifacts <br/>
directly related to the Fujitas.</div>

<h3>Re: The Mystery of Saito Kazuma</h3>
by <i>kikue.mugen</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774021203">Okay, get this.  I only got this far in what you've written so far:<br/>
<br/>
***Age: Takamine was exactly 10 years younger than Fujita Goro<br/>
This is important. In 1868, Takamine was only 15 however unlike <br/>
Fujita he never really was a fully a samurai "in practice" (if you <br/>
incorporate the warrior definition of a samurai). Takamine was a <br/>
page, while that was an important job, he like another friend of <br/>
Fujita, Yamakawa Kenjiro, could not experience the dimension of going <br/>
into battle.***<br/>
<br/>
I see what you're saying!  I can even relate to it, because Fujita-<br/>
sama is my hero today, although I'm way more than 10 years younger <br/>
than he.  Hey, I like feeling young again!<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I said this is as far as I got with what you wrote is <br/>
because I'm chewing it slowly.  I cannot begin to tell you how much <br/>
this is impacting myself personally.  I can understand Yamakawa & <br/>
Takamine's interest in Fujita-sama and I can just about feel the <br/>
honor they felt in knowing a man that actually did so much for their <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
OMG and the fiction sense of the whole thing as a writer as I view <br/>
Takamine as a page and Fujita-sama 10 years his senior :O  I'm just <br/>
floored with this information.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I'm chewing this all so slowly, taking notes along the <br/>
way and perhaps I'll have enough 'stuff' to tack on an entertaining <br/>
volume to the fiction I'm writing.  Right now I have Saitou in Kyoto <br/>
awaiting to meet up with the Roshingumi and I'm already over 51000 <br/>
words into the manuscript.  I'm thinking, just by what you've written <br/>
here, later on down the road, after bunches of study, I'll pen a <br/>
Takamine episode.  Oh heavens, I can feel my heart thumping with <br/>
excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing all this stuff, I'll read and chew more.  I just <br/>
had to mention this now before I pop. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>--------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Shizuko Akama who wrote one book on historical Saitou Hajime and <br/>
another in a novel form also mentioned Takamine Tadayoshi (Hideo) <br/>
briefly as well.  There were many kinds of pages for a daimyo and <br/>
they had ranks etc, however Tadayoshi was close to Matsudaira <br/>
Katamori.<br/>
<br/>
The only picture we have of him when he was really young is this one <br/>
which was taken after 1868 and likely when he was still a prisoner in <br/>
Tokyo and moving around from school to school.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/T-sensei/Kid.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/T-sensei/Kid.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
but even aside from young Takamine in Tsurugajo that horrible fall of <br/>
1868, remember we have more guys too.  <br/>
<br/>
Takagi GOro (Morinusuke) --- Tokio's bro who was a brave messenger, <br/>
Numazawa Shichiro (he later adopted Tokio/Goro's son) he actually saw <br/>
combat and as mentioned, Yamakawa Kenjiro.  <br/>
<br/>
All 4 of these guys were born 1854 (Year of the Tiger) and all 4 had <br/>
extensive ties with Fujita Goro and were close to one another in the <br/>
Meiji.  We fondly call them the Tigers of Aizu (although we call them <br/>
the BAKAtai as a pun on the Byakkotai behind their backs).  All 4 <br/>
became prominent members of society and were key figures in <br/>
preserving Aizu's story.  They were the fabulous 4! XD<br/>
<br/>
So you see the fictional possibilities are endless especially when <br/>
the history basically reveals itself like this.  We have many <br/>
universes in pop culture, but one can easily create another if you <br/>
find inspiration in the history.<br/>
<br/>
We used T-sensei to get to not only Fujita Goro, Fujita Tokio but <br/>
also to provide a context for Fujita MIdori (daughter in law of <br/>
Tokio+Goro) and Yamaguchi Yukiko (niece of Fujita Goro).  Both of <br/>
these young ladies attended TAkamine's school.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more fictional possibilities, consider this.  That photo <br/>
of the garden is interesting because it had hosted MANY MANY MANY <br/>
foreigners (both famous and not well known).  One wonders if Fujita <br/>
ever walked into the home and was faced with...AMERICANS :: gasp ::<br/>
<br/>
If you google William Sturgis Bigelow there should be mention that he <br/>
was a collector of Japanese swords and guards (he also had alot of <br/>
money to spend).  He was very close to Takamine---however from <br/>
studying Bigelow's personal letters (some are restricted though) I <br/>
couldn't find any mention of Takamine possibly introducing him to <br/>
Fujita.  <br/>
<br/>
----I digress----<br/>
The first chapter of Ono Suzue:  A Man of Talent in the Meiji <br/>
Era "THE PET RABBIT" which Kikue patiently read, features <br/>
mesmerism/hypnotism which in part came about from me studying both <br/>
Takamine and Yamakawa (who were deeply interested in the field <br/>
generally called "metaphysics").  <br/>
Interestingly they both appear in the article "The early 20th <br/>
century: Shaping the discipline of psychology in Japan" by SATO.<br/>
Both of them appear in later chapters (under fictional names <br/>
ofcourse) and Fujita explains how he grasps mesmerism via <br/>
demonstrating how he confounds his enemies in combat (which surprises <br/>
Yamakawa).</div>

<h3>Re: The Mystery of Saito Kazuma</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521852549">I'm resurrecting an old and very complex thread.<br/>
<br/>
If you come to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/</a> and login<br/>
and paste: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/3307">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/3307</a><br/>
<br/>
you'll be taken to the first message of the thread.  You can skim it <br/>
quickly and familiarize yourself with a very odd discovery a <br/>
researcher made here about "Saitou Kazuma" who appeared in, <br/>
Takamine's, an Aizu retainer, memorial book.<br/>
<br/>
To summarize we try to prove and also list arguments against <br/>
how "Saitou Kazuma" wasn't a random Aizu samurai.  But in fact, <br/>
Fujita Goro (formerly SAITOU HAJIME). The strongest detail which <br/>
proves Saitou Kazuma is our Shinsengumi is that his background bares <br/>
details very similar to that of Hajime.  Namely, they even lived in <br/>
the same region up north during the post 1868 exile.  Again, the <br/>
thread is LONG and time consuming (^_^) and you can go over it at <br/>
your own pace.  If you've been a member for a long time the info is <br/>
redundant in some cases but we had to state things logically best we <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Yes we know that he died with his last name Fujita Goro, but as <br/>
stated in the super long marathon length post....these people who <br/>
received this memorial book were in a niche community.  <br/>
<br/>
A community specifically which knew the Shinsengumi and were more <br/>
familiar even with Saitou Hajime or his third name Yamaguchi Jiro who <br/>
fought at Aizu and left behind a respectible if not heroic record at <br/>
that domain.<br/>
<br/>
One of the interesting things the researcher noted was simply how one <br/>
character was different in "SAitou Kazuma".  Just one character.<br/>
<br/>
As we know one character makes all the difference in <br/>
Chinese/Korean/Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
But here is the problem.  It may have simply have been an honest to <br/>
goodness...TYPO which was typical of that time period (especially if <br/>
this was done at a small press).<br/>
<br/>
Well weren't there editors you might ask?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro, highly literate, competant and detailed was listed <br/>
at the back of the book---maybe as a financial contributor, maybe as <br/>
an editor but nothing is specific. The book doesn't say "well here <br/>
are the editors" in any way.  Yamakawa who could easily spell "Saitou <br/>
Hajime" properly may have contributed to the book but not had to <br/>
proof it.<br/>
<br/>
The book was written by a group of people (I'm guessing <br/>
educators/former students of Takamine) who likely had NO IDEA nor <br/>
direct relationship with Fujita Goro/Saitou Hajime.<br/>
<br/>
Again, only Aizu folks especially would recognize Saitou Hajime and <br/>
for that matter any Shinsengumi name.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that SAitou Kazuma was a typo because even the surviving <br/>
family members of Takamine family may not have caught it for the same <br/>
reason many of us (pretend you are Japanese) have not seen the way <br/>
your dad's friend spells his name *on *paper because your <br/>
relationship to that person was face-to-face (verbal interaction).  <br/>
You didn't read about your dad's friend in let's say a book or <br/>
newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the book was published in 1921.  It may have been <br/>
compiled months and months earlier ofcourse since so many people's <br/>
words were incorporated into it.  If the project began in 1919 <br/>
(Fujita was dead but his wife Tokio sure was alive to contribute and <br/>
use her husban'd name)---I know that Takamine's oldest son who <br/>
technically should've had a role in this book---was barely in Japan <br/>
that year!  He was also abroad in 1920.  The likelihood of him <br/>
spending time or even reading a first draft is unlikely.  Travel was <br/>
not only the issue this son was completing other work which would've <br/>
taken up most of his time.<br/>
<br/>
If other family members were weighed down with the editing/proofing <br/>
they'd have *less ability to do so especially in terms of tiny <br/>
details like name spelling.  The two youngest daughters only knew of <br/>
an elderly Fujita Goro and Tokio.  There is little or no chance <br/>
they'd get the spelling of the name right---even in this very <br/>
fascinating case of using Fujita's most "well known" label.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about this rant---the above idea occurred to me because I read <br/>
a message online about someone criticizing a journalist for making a <br/>
typing error in an article (the name of a bridge).  Simply, the <br/>
complexity of language Asian or otherwise just guarantees that some <br/>
words have more than one spelling.</div>
