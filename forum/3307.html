(it was written on the new strange version of word, if you have <br/>
problems please email secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com)<br/>
<br/>
it is a file which will expire in 7 days<br/>
<br/>
we have a reason for this...<br/>
<br/>
it is a work of speculation however we have really tried our best to <br/>
investigate this matter<br/>
<br/>
We are currently waiting for a response from someone with an <br/>
insider&#39;s view of the subject.  There is a chance this person may not <br/>
be able to clarify this mystery.  If that is the case then what you <br/>
have is our most sincerest effort.<br/>
<br/>
The work was translated and written by A. Bakalian in collaboration <br/>
with secretarytocapt3 who provided some bits of text and who dragged <br/>
him (kicking and screaming into the Meiji Era) and into the study of <br/>
Takamine Hideo.<br/>
<br/>
In a few days, there will be yet another anniversary to mark the <br/>
death of Fujita Goro.  In 1915, he lived through his last September.  <br/>
The month always held great meaning to him.  It was in September of <br/>
1868 his time as a Shinsengumi fighting in Aizu came to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the purpose of why he sat in seiza (position) before death <br/>
was to maintain his mental lucidity and clean from his mind that <br/>
fateful month from his youth and all ties which bind him to this <br/>
world: hate, love, revenge, even joy.  He yearned to destroy his ego <br/>
in an attempt to find freedom.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Minor Detail:<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to submit to members here a photograph of a garden <br/>
where Fujita Goro once spent alot of time in.  I know it&#39;s not <br/>
the &quot;coolest&quot; photo but please bear in mind that many things in Tokyo <br/>
was completely destroyed in 1923 Kanto Earthquake, and more <br/>
destruction during WWII.  This photo was taken in between those <br/>
catastrophic events.  Thus, to even have this photo is remarkable.  <br/>
It was preserved outside of Japan.  So yes, over 2 decades before the <br/>
photo was taken---Fujita Goro was here (I assure you on this fact).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79903546">Dear SHQ members,<br/>
<br/>
I know that perhaps the megaupload file (which ended in .docx may have<br/>
given some of you problems in viewing the file so I have attached the<br/>
file in its entirety below (a the very bottom).<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to present more evidence, as resaerched by Mr.<br/>
Bakalian which does much to confirm our assertion that Saito Hajime<br/>
did not have 5 names, but 6---and that he came up with the 6th because<br/>
he insisted on speaking on behalf of a friend---a very good friend.<br/>
<br/>
{new additional evidence}<br/>
&quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; calls himself an Aizu samurai<br/>
-- according to Saito Hajime no subete, in the Meiji Era, Fujita Goro<br/>
was registered (on records) as formerly an Aizu samurai<br/>
<br/>
-- the most powerful detail emerged from an acquaintance of mine who<br/>
graciously provided a key word and that is SAitou Kazuma knew the<br/>
Takamine family since their &quot;Sannohe&quot; days.  <br/>
<br/>
Sannohe is located in Northern Japan which was where hundreds of Aizu<br/>
families were exiled (or travelled to--to reunite with family). <br/>
Amongst those samurai included Ichinohe Denpachi who soon changed his<br/>
name to Fujita Goro.<br/>
<br/>
Sannohe is a district.<br/>
<br/>
Gonohe is a town.<br/>
<br/>
The Kurasawa family lived in Gonohe.  The Kurasawa shared their home<br/>
with Fujita Goro.  This is a well known fact amongst Japanese<br/>
Shinsengumi researchers.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; who knew the Takamine family from their<br/>
time in Sannohe has the SAME biography as SAITOU HAJIME (FUJITA GORO).<br/>
<br/>
Which members of the Takamine family did &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; meet in<br/>
Sannohe?  He met Takamine&#39;s mother, and brothers (who were young<br/>
children).  Takamine Hideo (Tadayoshi) himself was a POW in Edo/Tokyo.<br/>
 The narrative of the Takamine family has partly been preserved in the<br/>
diary of a Swiss immigrant (professor of Oswego Normal School).  In<br/>
short, &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; knew the Takamine family when they faced<br/>
incredible hardship, so much so that they adopted one of their younger<br/>
sons to another Aizu family.  Saitou Kazuma knew this family well<br/>
before they prospered in the Meiji Era.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, we feel somewhat our theory has blossomed into something more.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Mr. Bakalian for doing this work.<br/>
As I have always known, Takamine and Fujita were truly good friends,<br/>
even though they were 10 years apart and came from different backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
I hope they are enjoying a drink now, wherever they may be.<br/>

THE MYSTERY OF SAITO KAZUMA<br/>
By Armen Bakalian <br/>
with notes by secretarytocapt3<br/>
<br/>
FACTS:  <br/>
Takamine Hideo was the cousin of Takagi/Fujita Tokio<br/>
Fujita Goro very likely found employment in the Education Museum<br/>
(years on the job 1891-1899) through the assistance of Takamine (who<br/>
had a leadership role in the Imperial Museum, and Educational Museum<br/>
which was affiliated with the Normal School he also managed).  <br/>
Fujita Goro was employed at the Tokyo (Higher) Women&#39;s Normal School<br/>
(years on the job 1899-1909) through petitions by both Takagi<br/>
Morinusuke (his brother-in-law) and Takamine Hideo.<br/>
A mystery is unfolding.<br/>
<br/>
In the reminiscences collected in: Furoku: Tsuikai Danso of/about the<br/>
educator Takamine Hideo, three is one reminiscence, titled &quot;Ko<br/>
Takamine Hideo-kun&quot; (The Late Mr. Takamine Hideo) pages 5 to 7, penned<br/>
by one &quot;Saito Kazuma, former Aizu retainer.&quot; This would be inherently<br/>
worth something, except when you consider the following (note:<br/>
Japanese kanji follow):<br/>
<br/>
&#25993;&#34276;&#19968; Saito Hajime<br/>
&#25993;&#34276;&#19968;&#39340; Saito Kazuma<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference of one kanji between this man&#39;s name and the<br/>
name of the Shinsengumi captain, Saito Hajime. Nowhere in the text, or<br/>
in the entirety of &quot;Takamine Hideo Sensei-den&quot; (especially the<br/>
chapter(s) on Aizu), does it have any mention of this man; and it<br/>
certainly does not say anything about him being of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
However, it also doesn&#39;t disprove his potentially being Saito Hajime<br/>
of the Shinsengumi. Saito Hajime, at the time of Takamine Hideo&#39;s<br/>
death, used the name Fujita Goro; however, let us consider the facts:<br/>
this is a collection of writings in tribute to one of the greatest<br/>
educators in modern Japanese history.<br/>
Fujita Goro was a traffic cop, museum guard, and sword appraiser to<br/>
Takamine and personal friend; would the writings of such a low-ranking<br/>
man fit alongside the tributes penned by Shinoda Toshihide, Yasui<br/>
Tetsu, Baron Kuki Ryuichi, and the women who undertook high-level<br/>
roles in the Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School? In the modern day, would a<br/>
book of reminiscences of a school or university president include the<br/>
words of the gateman? Perhaps it is just my opinion, but the answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
However, Fujita Goro does have a way of putting his words alongside<br/>
everyone else&#39;s: his Aizu connection. He may not have been born in<br/>
Aizu, but he was adopted into its community, married the daughter of<br/>
an Aizu samurai, and spilled blood for its people. He had as much a<br/>
right as anyone to call himself an Aizu samurai. Furthermore, &quot;Saito<br/>
Kazuma&quot; does what no one else in Furoku dares to do: brings up, at<br/>
length, Takamine&#39;s Aizu connection, his conduct in the Boshin War, and<br/>
his continued devotion to his former lord&#39;s family. Others perhaps<br/>
mention Takamine&#39;s origins briefly, but pass over them quickly; after<br/>
all, at the time of Takamine&#39;s death, Aizu was still stigmatized under<br/>
the false label of &quot;enemy of the throne.&quot;<br/>
It is not until 1928, the Imperial wedding between Matsudaira Setsuko<br/>
and Prince Chichibu (brother of Emperor Hirohito) did Aizu<br/>
&quot;officially&quot; return into good graces to the national narrative.<br/>
<br/>
Could &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; be, in fact, the rather taciturn(1) Saito Hajime,<br/>
writing under a slightly, yet cleverly altered pseudonym? Could the<br/>
old warrior have broken his silence for Takamine Hideo? While there is<br/>
as yet no definite &quot;yes&quot; answer to that question, there is also no<br/>
definite &quot;no.&quot; However, when considering even some of the points<br/>
covered by Ko Takamine Hideo-kun, the facts line up a little too<br/>
neatly for this to be mere coincidence.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Saito&quot; has intimate knowledge of the events concerning Takamine&#39;s<br/>
school. Fujita Goro was an employee of the school.(2)<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Saito&quot; devotes great length to praising Takamine&#39;s art collection.<br/>
Takamine, who relied on Saito for sword appraisal, gave Saito<br/>
unrestricted access to the art collection in his LOCKED storehouse.(3)<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s sons came to Takamine&#39;s<br/>
house for tutoring. Firstly, the Matsudaira children, as sons of a<br/>
former daimyo, would not be taken just anywhere; secondly, for &quot;Saito&quot;<br/>
to know of this point, regarding the still maligned Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori&#39;s family, shows that he was trusted. Fujita Goro spent a<br/>
great deal of time visiting Takamine&#39;s house.(4) After all, Fujita<br/>
received the name Fujita Goro from Matsudaira Katamori himself.<br/>
*&quot;Saito&#39;s own oldest son, Fujita Tsutomu, was friends with Matsudaira<br/>
Tsuneo.  Ofcourse Saito would know if any one of the Matsudaira boys<br/>
spent time at Takamine&#39;s home.  After all, his own sons probably did<br/>
as well.  We know that Takamine&#39;s own daughter frequently visited the<br/>
Fujita home.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Takamine talked about the Matsudaira family to his<br/>
Aizu friend Kusaka Yoshio (Onetime governor of Nagasaki and Fukushima<br/>
Prefectures), and &quot;shed sincere tears.&quot; Historical records suggest<br/>
that Takamine almost never spoke openly about Aizu, though he was in<br/>
charge of the former retainers&#39; association; consequently, for &quot;Saito&quot;<br/>
to know of Takamine speaking about Aizu, and speaking emotionally<br/>
about Aizu, shows his level of trust. Fujita Goro, as stated above,<br/>
often came to the Takamine house, and when he came, would always drink<br/>
sake(5). Those who know the Japanese culture of sake know that you<br/>
don&#39;t just randomly invite someone to your house and let them drink<br/>
alone; first of all, for Fujita to be trusted to the point of being<br/>
allowed to *always* drink sake at the Takamine house suggests that he<br/>
might have witnessed such discussions about the past. Fujita often<br/>
spoke of the past to Yamakawa Kenjiro, another prominent Aizu native,<br/>
so it is not unreasonable to think that he may have spoken of the past<br/>
to Takamine, as well. Kenjiro&#39;s brother Hiroshi, during his tenure as<br/>
president of the Normal School (while Takamine was still there), is<br/>
believed to have been the one who recommended Fujita for employment;<br/>
an overlap between Fujita&#39;s discussions with Kenjiro and Fujita&#39;s<br/>
discussions with Takamine Hideo is not at all unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
The Aizu natives who are on record as having associated or been in<br/>
close proximity to Takamine are all families who were high-ranking<br/>
Aizu retainers: Yamakawa, Ibuka, Takagi, Numazawa, Iinuma, Saigo...for<br/>
the sake of confirmation, I have looked over the casualty lists for a<br/>
&quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; or a relation of one, in Yamakawa Kenjiro&#39;s Hoshu Aizu<br/>
Byakkotai Jukyushi-den, they include: Saito Gengo, Saito Yukichi,<br/>
Saito Jinzaemon, Saito Tasaburo, and Saito Tetsunosuke. None of them<br/>
particularly high-ranking; none of them containing any reference to a<br/>
&quot;Saito Kazuma.&quot;(6)<br/>

Some Pros and Cons to Consider<br/>
1)	 Why would FUJITA GORO use a pseudonym?  It&#39;s unnecessary isn&#39;t it?<br/>
Mr. Bakalian raises and important point regarding status.  In the<br/>
Meiji Era generally you would invite someone honored to speak on<br/>
behalf of the deceased.  While Fujita was no doubt a close and<br/>
respected friend his position cannot compare to many of the other<br/>
people who contributed to Takamine&#39;s memorial/biography.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we have to think like a Japanese living in the Meiji Era not as<br/>
someone living in 2007.<br/>
<br/>
Another point to consider is clearly the fact that Saito Kazuma is not<br/>
addressing educators, he is addressing people of the Aizu community. <br/>
Therefore the name &quot;Saito&quot; may or may not ring a bell with people of<br/>
that background.  &quot;Saito&quot; would mean nothing to many readers.  Simply,<br/>
is this the coded language that comes from living a bit separately<br/>
from society due to one&#39;s past Aizu connections?  Please keep in mind<br/>
that there was a lot of discrimination, favoritism and cronyism after<br/>
1868 which was based on one&#39;s feudal hometown.<br/>
<br/>
2)	So how does Saito Kazuma get to write all this stuff?<br/>
That is the biggest question.  The Takamine family had several<br/>
surviving members, including Takamine Hideo&#39;s aged mother (who was<br/>
close to Tokio and no doubt knew Fujita Goro VERY WELL), Takamine&#39;s<br/>
2nd, 3rd son, and 2 daughters.  Why would four members of the Takamine<br/>
family let some strange person write all of this?  Clearly Saito<br/>
Kazuma is someone they knew and trusted very well<br/>
<br/>
3)	Who else oversaw the publication?<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro&#39;s name appears at the end of the book as likely a<br/>
financial contributor to its publication.  He was also a mutual friend<br/>
of Fujita and Takamine and a major figure in the post 1868 Aizu<br/>
network.  Again we ask, if Yamakawa proofread this work he had to know<br/>
who Saito Kazuma was and like the Takamine family, was &quot;ok&quot; with it.<br/>
<br/>
4)	Wait a minute!  Takamine&#39;s book was published in 1921 !  Fujita<br/>
Goro was DEAD ALREADY in 1915!  He could not have written anything.<br/>
This is obviously a question which needs to be answered.  Takamine<br/>
died in 1910, however his memorial was not published for a decade. <br/>
Japanese frequently publish memorial even years after the person has<br/>
died (they do so to fall on certain Buddhist anniversaries).  It is<br/>
not strange for a friend to prepare statements which are published<br/>
later on behalf of the deceased.  Most interestingly even some of<br/>
Takamine&#39;s speeches were published years after he died (for the first<br/>
time).  Furthermore, the words of Saito Kazuma may in fact be the<br/>
polished narrative assisted by Fujita Tokio (admittedly a very well<br/>
educated of the feudal era AND knew Takamine when he was still just a<br/>
teenager as well).<br/>
<br/>
Tokio was alive when this project had already started (she died in<br/>
1921). Even though she may have retired from the Higher Women&#39;s Normal<br/>
School (we do not have the start or end dates of her employment<br/>
there), she was close to campus and likely &quot;hung out&quot; there to help<br/>
out or just be nosy. In doing so she could easily be found. We must<br/>
also remember that Tokio was Takamine&#39;s cousin and they knew each<br/>
other since 1868 while serving in the castle.<br/>
<br/>
To prove that Saito Kazuma is NOT Fujita Goro:<br/>
1)	Find a real Aizu retainer who was named Saito Kazuma.  At this time<br/>
we have not yet found a retainer with that name after searching<br/>
through more well known Aizu history books (which do include lists of<br/>
names).  Perhaps one would have to go to a library in Aizu Wakamatsu<br/>
to find this man.<br/>
2)	Find an educator, artist, scientist who was an Aizu associate of<br/>
Takamine with the name Saito Kazuma.<br/>
I, secretarytocapt3, have spent nearly 3 intense years studying<br/>
Takamine Hideo from various research angles.  I have never found the<br/>
name of an educator, Aizu connections or not, with the name &quot;Saito<br/>
Kazuma&quot;.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041866344">OMG! This is incredible information about Saito Kazuma! It certainly <br/>
made my head spin. Information I will read and reread, again and <br/>
again, that is for sure.<br/>
<br/>
This is all making me so curious about the Takamine family.  I have <br/>
not even thought of studying on Mr. Takamine, but after this, I <br/>
seriously want to know who this man is that trusted Saito with so <br/>
many confidential areas of his life.  What was their relationship and <br/>
what made them so compatible.  Oh, if only I could be a fly on the <br/>
wall back then, can you imagine the conversations I&#39;d overhear?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your research, and for sharing it with those of <br/>
us who mentally &#39;live&#39; during that time.  This is precious <br/>

&gt; Fujita Goro was a traffic cop, museum guard, and sword appraiser to<br/>
&gt; Takamine and personal friend; would the writings of such a low-<br/>
ranking<br/>
&gt; man fit alongside the tributes penned by Shinoda Toshihide, Yasui<br/>
&gt; Tetsu, Baron Kuki Ryuichi, and the women who undertook high-level<br/>
&gt; roles in the Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School? In the modern day, would a<br/>
&gt; book of reminiscences of a school or university president include <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; words of the gateman? Perhaps it is just my opinion, but the answer <br/>
is no.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, Fujita Goro does have a way of putting his words alongside<br/>
&gt; everyone else&#39;s: his Aizu connection. He may not have been born in<br/>
&gt; Aizu, but he was adopted into its community, married the daughter of<br/>
&gt; an Aizu samurai, and spilled blood for its people. He had as much a<br/>
&gt; right as anyone to call himself an Aizu samurai. Furthermore, &quot;Saito<br/>
&gt; Kazuma&quot; does what no one else in Furoku dares to do: brings up, at<br/>
&gt; length, Takamine&#39;s Aizu connection, his conduct in the Boshin War, <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; his continued devotion to his former lord&#39;s family. Others perhaps<br/>
&gt; mention Takamine&#39;s origins briefly, but pass over them quickly; <br/>
after<br/>
&gt; all, at the time of Takamine&#39;s death, Aizu was still stigmatized <br/>
under<br/>
&gt; the false label of &quot;enemy of the throne.&quot;<br/>
&gt; It is not until 1928, the Imperial wedding between Matsudaira <br/>
Setsuko<br/>
&gt; and Prince Chichibu (brother of Emperor Hirohito) did Aizu<br/>
&gt; &quot;officially&quot; return into good graces to the national narrative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; be, in fact, the rather taciturn(1) Saito <br/>
Hajime,<br/>
&gt; writing under a slightly, yet cleverly altered pseudonym? Could the<br/>
&gt; old warrior have broken his silence for Takamine Hideo? While there <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; as yet no definite &quot;yes&quot; answer to that question, there is also no<br/>
&gt; definite &quot;no.&quot; However, when considering even some of the points<br/>
&gt; covered by Ko Takamine Hideo-kun, the facts line up a little too<br/>
&gt; neatly for this to be mere coincidence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; has intimate knowledge of the events concerning Takamine&#39;s<br/>
&gt; school. Fujita Goro was an employee of the school.(2)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; devotes great length to praising Takamine&#39;s art collection.<br/>
&gt; Takamine, who relied on Saito for sword appraisal, gave Saito<br/>
&gt; unrestricted access to the art collection in his LOCKED storehouse.<br/>
(3)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s sons came to Takamine&#39;s<br/>
&gt; house for tutoring. Firstly, the Matsudaira children, as sons of a<br/>
&gt; former daimyo, would not be taken just anywhere; secondly, <br/>
for &quot;Saito&quot;<br/>
&gt; to know of this point, regarding the still maligned Matsudaira<br/>
&gt; Katamori&#39;s family, shows that he was trusted. Fujita Goro spent a<br/>
&gt; great deal of time visiting Takamine&#39;s house.(4) After all, Fujita<br/>
&gt; received the name Fujita Goro from Matsudaira Katamori himself.<br/>
&gt; *&quot;Saito&#39;s own oldest son, Fujita Tsutomu, was friends with <br/>
Matsudaira<br/>
&gt; Tsuneo.  Ofcourse Saito would know if any one of the Matsudaira boys<br/>
&gt; spent time at Takamine&#39;s home.  After all, his own sons probably did<br/>
&gt; as well.  We know that Takamine&#39;s own daughter frequently visited <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Fujita home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Takamine talked about the Matsudaira family to <br/>
his<br/>
&gt; Aizu friend Kusaka Yoshio (Onetime governor of Nagasaki and <br/>
Fukushima<br/>
&gt; Prefectures), and &quot;shed sincere tears.&quot; Historical records suggest<br/>
&gt; that Takamine almost never spoke openly about Aizu, though he was in<br/>
&gt; charge of the former retainers&#39; association; consequently, <br/>
for &quot;Saito&quot;<br/>
&gt; to know of Takamine speaking about Aizu, and speaking emotionally<br/>
&gt; about Aizu, shows his level of trust. Fujita Goro, as stated above,<br/>
&gt; often came to the Takamine house, and when he came, would always <br/>
drink<br/>
&gt; sake(5). Those who know the Japanese culture of sake know that you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t just randomly invite someone to your house and let them drink<br/>
&gt; alone; first of all, for Fujita to be trusted to the point of being<br/>
&gt; allowed to *always* drink sake at the Takamine house suggests that <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; might have witnessed such discussions about the past. Fujita often<br/>
&gt; spoke of the past to Yamakawa Kenjiro, another prominent Aizu <br/>
native,<br/>
&gt; so it is not unreasonable to think that he may have spoken of the <br/>
past<br/>
&gt; to Takamine, as well. Kenjiro&#39;s brother Hiroshi, during his tenure <br/>
as<br/>
&gt; president of the Normal School (while Takamine was still there), is<br/>
&gt; believed to have been the one who recommended Fujita for employment;<br/>
&gt; an overlap between Fujita&#39;s discussions with Kenjiro and Fujita&#39;s<br/>
&gt; discussions with Takamine Hideo is not at all unreasonable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Aizu natives who are on record as having associated or been in<br/>
&gt; close proximity to Takamine are all families who were high-ranking<br/>
&gt; Aizu retainers: Yamakawa, Ibuka, Takagi, Numazawa, Iinuma, <br/>
Saigo...for<br/>
&gt; the sake of confirmation, I have looked over the casualty lists for <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; or a relation of one, in Yamakawa Kenjiro&#39;s Hoshu <br/>
Aizu<br/>
&gt; Byakkotai Jukyushi-den, they include: Saito Gengo, Saito Yukichi,<br/>
&gt; Saito Jinzaemon, Saito Tasaburo, and Saito Tetsunosuke. None of them<br/>
&gt; particularly high-ranking; none of them containing any reference to <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &quot;Saito Kazuma.&quot;(6)<br/>

&gt; Some Pros and Cons to Consider<br/>
&gt; 1)	 Why would FUJITA GORO use a pseudonym?  It&#39;s unnecessary <br/>
isn&#39;t it?<br/>
&gt; Mr. Bakalian raises and important point regarding status.  In the<br/>
&gt; Meiji Era generally you would invite someone honored to speak on<br/>
&gt; behalf of the deceased.  While Fujita was no doubt a close and<br/>
&gt; respected friend his position cannot compare to many of the other<br/>
&gt; people who contributed to Takamine&#39;s memorial/biography.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, we have to think like a Japanese living in the Meiji Era not <br/>
as<br/>
&gt; someone living in 2007.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another point to consider is clearly the fact that Saito Kazuma is <br/>
not<br/>
&gt; addressing educators, he is addressing people of the Aizu <br/>
community. <br/>
&gt; Therefore the name &quot;Saito&quot; may or may not ring a bell with people of<br/>
&gt; that background.  &quot;Saito&quot; would mean nothing to many readers.  <br/>
Simply,<br/>
&gt; is this the coded language that comes from living a bit separately<br/>
&gt; from society due to one&#39;s past Aizu connections?  Please keep in <br/>
mind<br/>
&gt; that there was a lot of discrimination, favoritism and cronyism <br/>
after<br/>
&gt; 1868 which was based on one&#39;s feudal hometown.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2)	So how does Saito Kazuma get to write all this stuff?<br/>
&gt; That is the biggest question.  The Takamine family had several<br/>
&gt; surviving members, including Takamine Hideo&#39;s aged mother (who was<br/>
&gt; close to Tokio and no doubt knew Fujita Goro VERY WELL), Takamine&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 2nd, 3rd son, and 2 daughters.  Why would four members of the <br/>
Takamine<br/>
&gt; family let some strange person write all of this?  Clearly Saito<br/>
&gt; Kazuma is someone they knew and trusted very well<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3)	Who else oversaw the publication?<br/>
&gt; Yamakawa Kenjiro&#39;s name appears at the end of the book as likely a<br/>
&gt; financial contributor to its publication.  He was also a mutual <br/>
friend<br/>
&gt; of Fujita and Takamine and a major figure in the post 1868 Aizu<br/>
&gt; network.  Again we ask, if Yamakawa proofread this work he had to <br/>
know<br/>
&gt; who Saito Kazuma was and like the Takamine family, was &quot;ok&quot; with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4)	Wait a minute!  Takamine&#39;s book was published in 1921 !  <br/>
Fujita<br/>
&gt; Goro was DEAD ALREADY in 1915!  He could not have written anything.<br/>
&gt; This is obviously a question which needs to be answered.  Takamine<br/>
&gt; died in 1910, however his memorial was not published for a decade. <br/>
&gt; Japanese frequently publish memorial even years after the person has<br/>
&gt; died (they do so to fall on certain Buddhist anniversaries).  It is<br/>
&gt; not strange for a friend to prepare statements which are published<br/>
&gt; later on behalf of the deceased.  Most interestingly even some of<br/>
&gt; Takamine&#39;s speeches were published years after he died (for the <br/>
first<br/>
&gt; time).  Furthermore, the words of Saito Kazuma may in fact be the<br/>
&gt; polished narrative assisted by Fujita Tokio (admittedly a very well<br/>
&gt; educated of the feudal era AND knew Takamine when he was still just <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; teenager as well).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tokio was alive when this project had already started (she died in<br/>
&gt; 1921). Even though she may have retired from the Higher Women&#39;s <br/>
Normal<br/>
&gt; School (we do not have the start or end dates of her employment<br/>
&gt; there), she was close to campus and likely &quot;hung out&quot; there to help<br/>
&gt; out or just be nosy. In doing so she could easily be found. We must<br/>
&gt; also remember that Tokio was Takamine&#39;s cousin and they knew each<br/>
&gt; other since 1868 while serving in the castle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To prove that Saito Kazuma is NOT Fujita Goro:<br/>
&gt; 1)	Find a real Aizu retainer who was named Saito Kazuma.  At <br/>
this time<br/>
&gt; we have not yet found a retainer with that name after searching<br/>
&gt; through more well known Aizu history books (which do include lists <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; names).  Perhaps one would have to go to a library in Aizu Wakamatsu<br/>
&gt; to find this man.<br/>
&gt; 2)	Find an educator, artist, scientist who was an Aizu associate <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Takamine with the name Saito Kazuma.<br/>
&gt; I, secretarytocapt3, have spent nearly 3 intense years studying<br/>
&gt; Takamine Hideo from various research angles.  I have never found the<br/>
&gt; name of an educator, Aizu connections or not, with the name &quot;Saito<br/>
&gt; Kazuma&quot;.<br/>

------------------------------------------------<br/>
Dear Kikue, thanks for your comment!<br/>
<br/>
Just something for everyone to chew on.  WHO came up with the name <br/>
Saito Kazuma?  <br/>
<br/>
I wager it&#39;s not even Fujita.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s Tokio.<br/>
Let me try to explain (and you all can disregard this blabber if you <br/>
want)<br/>
<br/>
Japanese love to keep logs/records since feudal times.  If there is a <br/>
famine you write it down.  If there is a fire, you note houses burned.<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu kept a good log on Shinsengumi<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi (yet another friend of the Fujitas) even noted in <br/>
his log when Fujita Tsutomu was born (Goro and Tokio&#39;s first son)<br/>
Many families (well before 1868) kept an expense log (usually <br/>
maintained by the wife if she was literate)<br/>
<br/>
It is in no way strange if Fujita Goro scribbled something in his log <br/>
book (mind you it&#39;s probably not a tell all diary XD) after Takamine <br/>
died.  When the book is printed, Tokio could easily rummage through <br/>
hubby&#39;s stuff and pull out the papersand she may have done some <br/>
editinglike tag on a fake name.<br/>
<br/>
Remember Tokio was still alivethis is still well before the 1923 <br/>
earthquake when a lot of things are lost forever.<br/>
<br/>
Kikue, it&#39;s not complete yet but you can visit this site <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.takaminehideo.net">http://www.takaminehideo.net</a> (studied the T-sensei since 2004 and it <br/>
occurred to me to put up a site in 2006 XD---there is a section on <br/>
the Siamese and Takamine during Fujita&#39;s years at the school which I <br/>
should upload)<br/>
<br/>
Well the information we posted ofcourse is based on a translation of <br/>
just what &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; said about Takamine.  So your question <br/>
about what made two very very different men friends is very important <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d like to approach your question from another angle, &quot;what did <br/>
Takamine think about Fujita?&quot;  I&#39;ve been studying this man since <br/>
2004.  Info on Takamine appears in English, Japanese and Thai (I&#39;ve <br/>
found him in 4 Thai books---however 2 cite the other as source).<br/>
I can&#39;t even begin to list how different they were in terms of <br/>
background:<br/>
<br/>
Age:  Takamine was exactly 10 years younger than Fujita Goro<br/>
This is important.  In 1868, Takamine was only 15 however unlike <br/>
Fujita he never really was a fully a samurai &quot;in practice&quot; (if you <br/>
incorporate the warrior definition of a samurai).  Takamine was a <br/>
page, while that was an important job, he like another friend of <br/>
Fujita, Yamakawa Kenjiro, could not experience the dimension of going <br/>
into battle.  The reason why both Takamine and Yamakawa [respected] <br/>
Fujita because: <br/>
<br/>
1) Yamaguchi Jiro ~DEFENDED AIZU, their homeland---if I may speculate <br/>
here, Fujita to them, was sort of their hero.  Regardless of any <br/>
difference in social class in the Meiji, they didn&#39;t see him <br/>
as &quot;officer Fujita&quot;  they saw him as a samurai.<br/>
<br/>
2) They shared in survivor&#39;s guilt and had empathy for one another<br/>
Social Background:  Takamine (as a kid he was called Tadayoshi not <br/>
Hideo), completed his education at Nisshinkan (Aizu&#39;s school for <br/>
samurai) and was gifted enough to be called a &#39;shindo&#39;, he was given <br/>
the job of page to daimyo Matsudaira Katamori.  <br/>
We know Saitou&#39;s background pretty well (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Adulthood:  Takamine spent 3 years in the USA (rural New York) and <br/>
spent the rest of his life in Japan as an academic and was involved <br/>
in many extracurricular activities (art, science, charity, working <br/>
with many foreigners--some of whom literally exported &quot;Meiji Japan&quot; <br/>
to the USA and even to Europe)<br/>
Fujita&#39;s career was very &quot;classic&quot; post 1868 samurai jobs (police, <br/>
bodyguard to Inoue Kaoru, Imperial guard detail for the Empress etc)<br/>
<br/>
Political/Social views:  Takamine was a &quot;true&quot; progressive (not like <br/>
Mori Arinori, or even Takamine&#39;s own mentor Fukuzawa).  Some women <br/>
here may appreciate this:  &quot;He (Takamine) hated the old saying &#39;men <br/>
revered, women subjected&#39;....&quot; (danson-johi) (Takamine Hideo-sensei <br/>
den, p. 174 translated by A. Bakalian).  T-sensei worked very hard <br/>
for women&#39;s education and also adopted highly unpopular views at the <br/>
risk of his own career.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know about Fujita&#39;s views.<br/>
<br/>
so with all these differences in mind how did they become friends, <br/>
other than their common Aizu &quot;connection&quot; and the fact that Tokio is <br/>
Takamine&#39;s cousin?<br/>
<br/>
They are different that&#39;s why they get along.<br/>
<br/>
Takamine was VERY LOQUACIOUS (he can blah blah blah for hours on <br/>
topics he likes).  Fujita was taciturn or he may have come across as <br/>
a good listener.  For all we know Fujita may have learned how to <br/>
sleep with his eyes open in these one sided conversations : LOL :<br/>
Fujita may have felt that some of Takamine&#39;s ideas were 100% &quot;silly&quot; <br/>
because---they were (if you imagine yourself to be a typical Japanese <br/>
man of that era).  <br/>
<br/>
However, likely their conversations were &quot;selective&quot; and focused on <br/>
things they could agree on:  certain political figures they knew from <br/>
before 1868, who were still around in the Meiji Era.  In other <br/>
words &quot;Did you read about that guy who just died, remember what he <br/>
was up to during the war?....&quot; etc etc<br/>
<br/>
Very few people can advise Takamine in matters of art, except when it <br/>
came to swords.  Again, one must meditate on the fact that Fujita in <br/>
his youth had to have had a peculiar education or mentor to be so <br/>
learned in the field of sword appraisal to have been able to give <br/>
pointers to a man like Takamine who was -OBSESSED- with things like <br/>
traditional, modern art, pottery etc.<br/>
<br/>
We all assume that Fujita&#39;s appointment to the Women&#39;s Normal School <br/>
was to Fujita&#39;s advantage.<br/>
<br/>
From my own study into Meiji Education politics I don&#39;t think this is <br/>
necessarily the only way to view the situation.  It was to TAKAMINE&#39;S <br/>
ADVANTAGE to have someone in the office to keep him informed.  There <br/>
was intense factionalism in the system and as the director it was a <br/>
good idea to have a good &quot;pulse&quot; on the situation in the school and <br/>
to inform him if some of his wacky ideas was truly accepted or not by <br/>
his staff and faculty. To keep this short, I have to say that <br/>
Takamine&#39;s career had very very severe declines.  By the time he <br/>
drags a friend into the school, Takamine has seen it all when it <br/>
comes to career matters.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; seemed to know intimate details about Takamine.  Well <br/>
the reverse is true as well.  When Numazawa Tatsuo asked his aunt <br/>
Ibuka Saku about his true parentage (Tatsuo was Goro and Tokio&#39;s <br/>
third son), Ibuka told him the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Ibuka is Takamine&#39;s  mother&#39;s family.  <br/>
<br/>
In other words, it&#39;s impossible to imagine that Takamine didn&#39;t know <br/>
about the adoption, Ibuka Saku was probably his mother&#39;s relative <br/>
(sister?).  Tokio had to have told Takamine&#39;s mother about the <br/>
adoption.  Pic of Tokio&#39;s gal pal &quot;Ma Takamine&quot; (Takamine Kinoko <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/TakamineKinoko.jpg)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/TakamineKinoko.jpg)</a>. <br/>
Takamine&#39;s mother in turn may have told her own relative.<br/>
<br/>
Recall this testimony:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mrs. Tokio and my grandmother Ikuno/Kinoko were very close to each <br/>
other, and Mrs. Tokio often came over to see my grandmother...If my <br/>
memories are correct, at the time Ms. Tokio had her bangs <br/>
in &#39;kirisage style&quot;<br/>
I remember, when my mother died, Ms. Tokio stopped by my house <br/>
several times to help us.<br/>
Mrs. Tokio was a woman not too tall, but rather small of stature. She <br/>
certainly did look like an Aizu woman. (likely because she was small--<br/>
or maybe also because she was hard-working) She often went to the <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s home at Enoki-zaka...working there on many <br/>
different things (or: There she devoted herself to various chores, <br/>
such as housekeeping and other things women were in charge)<br/>
My grandmother often took my sister and I to Mr. Fujita&#39;s <br/>
residence...As I remember, from the street we would go down the stone-<br/>
made staircase to get to the house.<br/>
<br/>
These stories are from Ms. Takamine Keiko who was interviewed in 1978.<br/>
<br/>
Keiko was born in the 1890s and therefore only knew very &quot;aged&quot; Mr. <br/>
and Mrs. Fujita.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in a way this discovery of a &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; makes up for my <br/>
disastrous attempt at acquiring the wedding photos of Mr. and Mrs. <br/>
Takamine.<br/>
<br/>
While Takamine is not our main interest, what we want are the other <br/>
Aizu figures which would show up in a group photo, namely, possibly a <br/>
man which may or may not resemble the one shown in teh Seinan War <br/>
photo.<br/>
<br/>
Research is never neat and organized, you have to be really really <br/>
wily to find what you need and look for other &quot;opportunities&quot; because <br/>
after all, there is little or no chance of anyone finding artifacts <br/>
directly related to the Fujitas.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774021203">Okay, get this.  I only got this far in what you&#39;ve written so far:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I see what you&#39;re saying!  I can even relate to it, because Fujita-<br/>
sama is my hero today, although I&#39;m way more than 10 years younger <br/>
than he.  Hey, I like feeling young again!<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I said this is as far as I got with what you wrote is <br/>
because I&#39;m chewing it slowly.  I cannot begin to tell you how much <br/>
this is impacting myself personally.  I can understand Yamakawa & <br/>
Takamine&#39;s interest in Fujita-sama and I can just about feel the <br/>
honor they felt in knowing a man that actually did so much for their <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
OMG and the fiction sense of the whole thing as a writer as I view <br/>
Takamine as a page and Fujita-sama 10 years his senior :O  I&#39;m just <br/>
floored with this information.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I&#39;m chewing this all so slowly, taking notes along the <br/>
way and perhaps I&#39;ll have enough &#39;stuff&#39; to tack on an entertaining <br/>
volume to the fiction I&#39;m writing.  Right now I have Saitou in Kyoto <br/>
awaiting to meet up with the Roshingumi and I&#39;m already over 51000 <br/>
words into the manuscript.  I&#39;m thinking, just by what you&#39;ve written <br/>
here, later on down the road, after bunches of study, I&#39;ll pen a <br/>
Takamine episode.  Oh heavens, I can feel my heart thumping with <br/>
excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing all this stuff, I&#39;ll read and chew more.  I just <br/>
had to mention this now before I pop. <br/>

&gt; ------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; Dear Kikue, thanks for your comment!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just something for everyone to chew on.  WHO came up with the name <br/>
&gt; Saito Kazuma?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wager it&#39;s not even Fujita.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s Tokio.<br/>
&gt; Let me try to explain (and you all can disregard this blabber if <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; want)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Japanese love to keep logs/records since feudal times.  If there is <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; famine you write it down.  If there is a fire, you note houses <br/>
burned.<br/>
&gt; Yamazaki Susumu kept a good log on Shinsengumi<br/>
&gt; Yamakawa Hiroshi (yet another friend of the Fujitas) even noted in <br/>
&gt; his log when Fujita Tsutomu was born (Goro and Tokio&#39;s first son)<br/>
&gt; Many families (well before 1868) kept an expense log (usually <br/>
&gt; maintained by the wife if she was literate)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is in no way strange if Fujita Goro scribbled something in his <br/>
log <br/>
&gt; book (mind you it&#39;s probably not a tell all diary XD) after <br/>
Takamine <br/>
&gt; died.  When the book is printed, Tokio could easily rummage through <br/>
&gt; hubby&#39;s stuff and pull out the papersand she may have done some <br/>
&gt; editinglike tag on a fake name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember Tokio was still alivethis is still well before the 1923 <br/>
&gt; earthquake when a lot of things are lost forever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kikue, it&#39;s not complete yet but you can visit this site <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.takaminehideo.net">http://www.takaminehideo.net</a> (studied the T-sensei since 2004 and <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; occurred to me to put up a site in 2006 XD---there is a section on <br/>
&gt; the Siamese and Takamine during Fujita&#39;s years at the school which <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; should upload)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well the information we posted ofcourse is based on a translation <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; just what &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; said about Takamine.  So your question <br/>
&gt; about what made two very very different men friends is very <br/>
important <br/>
&gt; to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I&#39;d like to approach your question from another angle, &quot;what did <br/>
&gt; Takamine think about Fujita?&quot;  I&#39;ve been studying this man since <br/>
&gt; 2004.  Info on Takamine appears in English, Japanese and Thai (I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; found him in 4 Thai books---however 2 cite the other as source).<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t even begin to list how different they were in terms of <br/>
&gt; background:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Age:  Takamine was exactly 10 years younger than Fujita Goro<br/>
&gt; This is important.  In 1868, Takamine was only 15 however unlike <br/>
&gt; Fujita he never really was a fully a samurai &quot;in practice&quot; (if you <br/>
&gt; incorporate the warrior definition of a samurai).  Takamine was a <br/>
&gt; page, while that was an important job, he like another friend of <br/>
&gt; Fujita, Yamakawa Kenjiro, could not experience the dimension of <br/>
going <br/>
&gt; into battle.  The reason why both Takamine and Yamakawa [respected] <br/>
&gt; Fujita because: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Yamaguchi Jiro ~DEFENDED AIZU, their homeland---if I may <br/>
speculate <br/>
&gt; here, Fujita to them, was sort of their hero.  Regardless of any <br/>
&gt; difference in social class in the Meiji, they didn&#39;t see him <br/>
&gt; as &quot;officer Fujita&quot;  they saw him as a samurai.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) They shared in survivor&#39;s guilt and had empathy for one another<br/>
&gt; Social Background:  Takamine (as a kid he was called Tadayoshi not <br/>
&gt; Hideo), completed his education at Nisshinkan (Aizu&#39;s school for <br/>
&gt; samurai) and was gifted enough to be called a &#39;shindo&#39;, he was <br/>
given <br/>
&gt; the job of page to daimyo Matsudaira Katamori.  <br/>
&gt; We know Saitou&#39;s background pretty well (^_^)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Adulthood:  Takamine spent 3 years in the USA (rural New York) and <br/>
&gt; spent the rest of his life in Japan as an academic and was involved <br/>
&gt; in many extracurricular activities (art, science, charity, working <br/>
&gt; with many foreigners--some of whom literally exported &quot;Meiji Japan&quot; <br/>
&gt; to the USA and even to Europe)<br/>
&gt; Fujita&#39;s career was very &quot;classic&quot; post 1868 samurai jobs (police, <br/>
&gt; bodyguard to Inoue Kaoru, Imperial guard detail for the Empress etc)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Political/Social views:  Takamine was a &quot;true&quot; progressive (not <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; Mori Arinori, or even Takamine&#39;s own mentor Fukuzawa).  Some women <br/>
&gt; here may appreciate this:  &quot;He (Takamine) hated the old saying &#39;men <br/>
&gt; revered, women subjected&#39;....&quot; (danson-johi) (Takamine Hideo-sensei <br/>
&gt; den, p. 174 translated by A. Bakalian).  T-sensei worked very hard <br/>
&gt; for women&#39;s education and also adopted highly unpopular views at <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; risk of his own career.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t know about Fujita&#39;s views.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so with all these differences in mind how did they become friends, <br/>
&gt; other than their common Aizu &quot;connection&quot; and the fact that Tokio <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; Takamine&#39;s cousin?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They are different that&#39;s why they get along.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Takamine was VERY LOQUACIOUS (he can blah blah blah for hours on <br/>
&gt; topics he likes).  Fujita was taciturn or he may have come across <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; a good listener.  For all we know Fujita may have learned how to <br/>
&gt; sleep with his eyes open in these one sided conversations : LOL :<br/>
&gt; Fujita may have felt that some of Takamine&#39;s ideas were <br/>
100% &quot;silly&quot; <br/>
&gt; because---they were (if you imagine yourself to be a typical <br/>
Japanese <br/>
&gt; man of that era).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, likely their conversations were &quot;selective&quot; and focused on <br/>
&gt; things they could agree on:  certain political figures they knew <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; before 1868, who were still around in the Meiji Era.  In other <br/>
&gt; words &quot;Did you read about that guy who just died, remember what he <br/>
&gt; was up to during the war?....&quot; etc etc<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very few people can advise Takamine in matters of art, except when <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; came to swords.  Again, one must meditate on the fact that Fujita <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; his youth had to have had a peculiar education or mentor to be so <br/>
&gt; learned in the field of sword appraisal to have been able to give <br/>
&gt; pointers to a man like Takamine who was -OBSESSED- with things like <br/>
&gt; traditional, modern art, pottery etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all assume that Fujita&#39;s appointment to the Women&#39;s Normal <br/>
School <br/>
&gt; was to Fujita&#39;s advantage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From my own study into Meiji Education politics I don&#39;t think this <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; necessarily the only way to view the situation.  It was to <br/>
TAKAMINE&#39;S <br/>
&gt; ADVANTAGE to have someone in the office to keep him informed.  <br/>
There <br/>
&gt; was intense factionalism in the system and as the director it was a <br/>
&gt; good idea to have a good &quot;pulse&quot; on the situation in the school and <br/>
&gt; to inform him if some of his wacky ideas was truly accepted or not <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; his staff and faculty. To keep this short, I have to say that <br/>
&gt; Takamine&#39;s career had very very severe declines.  By the time he <br/>
&gt; drags a friend into the school, Takamine has seen it all when it <br/>
&gt; comes to career matters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; seemed to know intimate details about Takamine.  <br/>
Well <br/>
&gt; the reverse is true as well.  When Numazawa Tatsuo asked his aunt <br/>
&gt; Ibuka Saku about his true parentage (Tatsuo was Goro and Tokio&#39;s <br/>
&gt; third son), Ibuka told him the truth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ibuka is Takamine&#39;s  mother&#39;s family.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In other words, it&#39;s impossible to imagine that Takamine didn&#39;t <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; about the adoption, Ibuka Saku was probably his mother&#39;s relative <br/>
&gt; (sister?).  Tokio had to have told Takamine&#39;s mother about the <br/>
&gt; adoption.  Pic of Tokio&#39;s gal pal &quot;Ma Takamine&quot; (Takamine Kinoko <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/TakamineKinoko.jpg)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/TakamineKinoko.jpg)</a>. <br/>
&gt; Takamine&#39;s mother in turn may have told her own relative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Recall this testimony:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Mrs. Tokio and my grandmother Ikuno/Kinoko were very close to each <br/>
&gt; other, and Mrs. Tokio often came over to see my grandmother...If my <br/>
&gt; memories are correct, at the time Ms. Tokio had her bangs <br/>
&gt; in &#39;kirisage style&quot;<br/>
&gt; I remember, when my mother died, Ms. Tokio stopped by my house <br/>
&gt; several times to help us.<br/>
&gt; Mrs. Tokio was a woman not too tall, but rather small of stature. <br/>
She <br/>
&gt; certainly did look like an Aizu woman. (likely because she was <br/>
small--<br/>
&gt; or maybe also because she was hard-working) She often went to the <br/>
&gt; Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s home at Enoki-zaka...working there on many <br/>
&gt; different things (or: There she devoted herself to various chores, <br/>
&gt; such as housekeeping and other things women were in charge)<br/>
&gt; My grandmother often took my sister and I to Mr. Fujita&#39;s <br/>
&gt; residence...As I remember, from the street we would go down the <br/>
stone-<br/>
&gt; made staircase to get to the house.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These stories are from Ms. Takamine Keiko who was interviewed in <br/>
1978.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keiko was born in the 1890s and therefore only knew very &quot;aged&quot; Mr. <br/>
&gt; and Mrs. Fujita.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess in a way this discovery of a &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; makes up for my <br/>
&gt; disastrous attempt at acquiring the wedding photos of Mr. and Mrs. <br/>
&gt; Takamine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While Takamine is not our main interest, what we want are the other <br/>
&gt; Aizu figures which would show up in a group photo, namely, possibly <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; man which may or may not resemble the one shown in teh Seinan War <br/>
&gt; photo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Research is never neat and organized, you have to be really really <br/>
&gt; wily to find what you need and look for other &quot;opportunities&quot; <br/>
because <br/>
&gt; after all, there is little or no chance of anyone finding artifacts <br/>
&gt; directly related to the Fujitas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>--------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Shizuko Akama who wrote one book on historical Saitou Hajime and <br/>
another in a novel form also mentioned Takamine Tadayoshi (Hideo) <br/>
briefly as well.  There were many kinds of pages for a daimyo and <br/>
they had ranks etc, however Tadayoshi was close to Matsudaira <br/>
Katamori.<br/>
<br/>
The only picture we have of him when he was really young is this one <br/>
which was taken after 1868 and likely when he was still a prisoner in <br/>
Tokyo and moving around from school to school.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/T-sensei/Kid.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/T-sensei/Kid.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
but even aside from young Takamine in Tsurugajo that horrible fall of <br/>
1868, remember we have more guys too.  <br/>
<br/>
Takagi GOro (Morinusuke) --- Tokio&#39;s bro who was a brave messenger, <br/>
Numazawa Shichiro (he later adopted Tokio/Goro&#39;s son) he actually saw <br/>
combat and as mentioned, Yamakawa Kenjiro.  <br/>
<br/>
All 4 of these guys were born 1854 (Year of the Tiger) and all 4 had <br/>
extensive ties with Fujita Goro and were close to one another in the <br/>
Meiji.  We fondly call them the Tigers of Aizu (although we call them <br/>
the BAKAtai as a pun on the Byakkotai behind their backs).  All 4 <br/>
became prominent members of society and were key figures in <br/>
preserving Aizu&#39;s story.  They were the fabulous 4! XD<br/>
<br/>
So you see the fictional possibilities are endless especially when <br/>
the history basically reveals itself like this.  We have many <br/>
universes in pop culture, but one can easily create another if you <br/>
find inspiration in the history.<br/>
<br/>
We used T-sensei to get to not only Fujita Goro, Fujita Tokio but <br/>
also to provide a context for Fujita MIdori (daughter in law of <br/>
Tokio+Goro) and Yamaguchi Yukiko (niece of Fujita Goro).  Both of <br/>
these young ladies attended TAkamine&#39;s school.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more fictional possibilities, consider this.  That photo <br/>
of the garden is interesting because it had hosted MANY MANY MANY <br/>
foreigners (both famous and not well known).  One wonders if Fujita <br/>
ever walked into the home and was faced with...AMERICANS :: gasp ::<br/>
<br/>
If you google William Sturgis Bigelow there should be mention that he <br/>
was a collector of Japanese swords and guards (he also had alot of <br/>
money to spend).  He was very close to Takamine---however from <br/>
studying Bigelow&#39;s personal letters (some are restricted though) I <br/>
couldn&#39;t find any mention of Takamine possibly introducing him to <br/>
Fujita.  <br/>
<br/>
----I digress----<br/>
The first chapter of Ono Suzue:  A Man of Talent in the Meiji <br/>
Era &quot;THE PET RABBIT&quot; which Kikue patiently read, features <br/>
mesmerism/hypnotism which in part came about from me studying both <br/>
Takamine and Yamakawa (who were deeply interested in the field <br/>
generally called &quot;metaphysics&quot;).  <br/>
Interestingly they both appear in the article &quot;The early 20th <br/>
century: Shaping the discipline of psychology in Japan&quot; by SATO.<br/>
Both of them appear in later chapters (under fictional names <br/>
ofcourse) and Fujita explains how he grasps mesmerism via <br/>
demonstrating how he confounds his enemies in combat (which surprises <br/>
Yamakawa).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521852549">I&#39;m resurrecting an old and very complex thread.<br/>
<br/>
If you come to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/</a> and login<br/>
and paste: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/3307">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/3307</a><br/>
<br/>
you&#39;ll be taken to the first message of the thread.  You can skim it <br/>
quickly and familiarize yourself with a very odd discovery a <br/>
researcher made here about &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; who appeared in, <br/>
Takamine&#39;s, an Aizu retainer, memorial book.<br/>
<br/>
To summarize we try to prove and also list arguments against <br/>
how &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; wasn&#39;t a random Aizu samurai.  But in fact, <br/>
Fujita Goro (formerly SAITOU HAJIME). The strongest detail which <br/>
proves Saitou Kazuma is our Shinsengumi is that his background bares <br/>
details very similar to that of Hajime.  Namely, they even lived in <br/>
the same region up north during the post 1868 exile.  Again, the <br/>
thread is LONG and time consuming (^_^) and you can go over it at <br/>
your own pace.  If you&#39;ve been a member for a long time the info is <br/>
redundant in some cases but we had to state things logically best we <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Yes we know that he died with his last name Fujita Goro, but as <br/>
stated in the super long marathon length post....these people who <br/>
received this memorial book were in a niche community.  <br/>
<br/>
A community specifically which knew the Shinsengumi and were more <br/>
familiar even with Saitou Hajime or his third name Yamaguchi Jiro who <br/>
fought at Aizu and left behind a respectible if not heroic record at <br/>
that domain.<br/>
<br/>
One of the interesting things the researcher noted was simply how one <br/>
character was different in &quot;SAitou Kazuma&quot;.  Just one character.<br/>
<br/>
As we know one character makes all the difference in <br/>
Chinese/Korean/Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
But here is the problem.  It may have simply have been an honest to <br/>
goodness...TYPO which was typical of that time period (especially if <br/>
this was done at a small press).<br/>
<br/>
Well weren&#39;t there editors you might ask?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro, highly literate, competant and detailed was listed <br/>
at the back of the book---maybe as a financial contributor, maybe as <br/>
an editor but nothing is specific. The book doesn&#39;t say &quot;well here <br/>
are the editors&quot; in any way.  Yamakawa who could easily spell &quot;Saitou <br/>
Hajime&quot; properly may have contributed to the book but not had to <br/>
proof it.<br/>
<br/>
The book was written by a group of people (I&#39;m guessing <br/>
educators/former students of Takamine) who likely had NO IDEA nor <br/>
direct relationship with Fujita Goro/Saitou Hajime.<br/>
<br/>
Again, only Aizu folks especially would recognize Saitou Hajime and <br/>
for that matter any Shinsengumi name.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that SAitou Kazuma was a typo because even the surviving <br/>
family members of Takamine family may not have caught it for the same <br/>
reason many of us (pretend you are Japanese) have not seen the way <br/>
your dad&#39;s friend spells his name *on *paper because your <br/>
relationship to that person was face-to-face (verbal interaction).  <br/>
You didn&#39;t read about your dad&#39;s friend in let&#39;s say a book or <br/>
newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the book was published in 1921.  It may have been <br/>
compiled months and months earlier ofcourse since so many people&#39;s <br/>
words were incorporated into it.  If the project began in 1919 <br/>
(Fujita was dead but his wife Tokio sure was alive to contribute and <br/>
use her husban&#39;d name)---I know that Takamine&#39;s oldest son who <br/>
technically should&#39;ve had a role in this book---was barely in Japan <br/>
that year!  He was also abroad in 1920.  The likelihood of him <br/>
spending time or even reading a first draft is unlikely.  Travel was <br/>
not only the issue this son was completing other work which would&#39;ve <br/>
taken up most of his time.<br/>
<br/>
If other family members were weighed down with the editing/proofing <br/>
they&#39;d have *less ability to do so especially in terms of tiny <br/>
details like name spelling.  The two youngest daughters only knew of <br/>
an elderly Fujita Goro and Tokio.  There is little or no chance <br/>
they&#39;d get the spelling of the name right---even in this very <br/>
fascinating case of using Fujita&#39;s most &quot;well known&quot; label.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about this rant---the above idea occurred to me because I read <br/>
a message online about someone criticizing a journalist for making a <br/>
typing error in an article (the name of a bridge).  Simply, the <br/>
complexity of language Asian or otherwise just guarantees that some <br/>
words have more than one spelling.</div>
