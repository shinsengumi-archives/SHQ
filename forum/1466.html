<h3>Name that family!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072607790">Hello knowledgeable people----I&#39;m trying to track down the kamon that<br/>
appears on a kimono I found on ebay (man, I need to stay away from<br/>
there!) I looked in the list that Okita posted back in message 704 but<br/>
it wasn&#39;t on their list. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has time I put a scan of it in the photos section of the<br/>
group (on page 2) and if you can&#39;t identify it maybe you can direct me<br/>
to other sites with kamon displayed?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
