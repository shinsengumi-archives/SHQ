<h3>Need help with evil babelfish.</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558911710">Once again the evil babelfish is hiding information that I really <br/>
need. I've been trying to learn more about the town where Saito moved <br/>
to and it seems to be located between two rivers. Unfortunately I'm <br/>
not sure if I'm reading the names of these rivers correctly. It looks <br/>
like one is called the Shingo river and the other says Izumisawa five <br/>
Togawa. Would that be Izumisawa Goro Togawa? Or could they be named <br/>
something else entirely? That sounds really odd for a river name. The <br/>
site is www.gonohe.net/ <br/>
<br/>
Incidently, Gonohe is located near the city of Hachinohe, way below <br/>
the area actually known as the Shimokita peninsula. This region is <br/>
still fairly barren though. In fact, even today it seems farmers and <br/>
others who live in the area move to Tokyo during the winter season.<br/>
