<h3>phil&#39;s playing around again</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-57846913">I've been meaning to learn html for some time, but knew that it was pointless to even approach it until I was really ready.  I suddenly got ready... :-)<br/>
 <br/>
It is a LONG way from finished... needs some tweaking in various spots... no manga images yet (just received them a few minutes ago) and no PMK yet (going after permissions tomorrow)... and a couple of links need looking into.  It also hasn't been tested on Netscape yet as Netscape isn't loaded on my computer and I can't get to my husband's until he's finished blowing up things in his online game.<br/>
 <br/>
This is my first time creating and loading a website, so it's very experimental.  The font size is smaller than I want it in some places... lots and lots more to learn.  I wanted to do something related to Saitou, so I chose to collect images.  I owe many thanks to Tiffany and Kevin for helping me today... especially Tiffany for giving me that little extra push over the side to do it.  Comments and complaints welcome.<br/>

phil (who's about decided RK Saitou deserves a site all his very own... ever try to pick "just a few" from among hundreds?  I should make it a revolving gallery...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950469642">I'm *SOOOO* thankful, I could kiss you, Barb!!  I was already <br/>
dreading having to learn how to futz with the Netscape/IE dimension.  <br/>
Nice to know they're getting along.<br/>
<br/>
Corrections have been made (thanks to some of you guys catching them <br/>
for me), additions (new Mibugishiden shots and some RK manga images <br/>
are up) and links corrected/added (Black Faery's RK screencap site <br/>
and Kevin's bakumatsu site --- thanks Kevin!!)<br/>
<br/>
My apologies to you PMK fans out there... I slept most of the day <br/>
away & never got around to emailing people about getting scans & <br/>
screencaps.  It'll get done soon.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be a work in progress for some time, so come by & check it out <br/>
occasionally.  Donations always welcome.  (Where's my Saitou beer???)<br/>

<h3>Mail problems (was: Re: phil&#39;s playing around again)</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186900970">I haven't had messages come THAT many times, but I've been getting <br/>
messages from several of my yahoogroups two and three times... not <br/>
all of them, just a few, but still...<br/>
<br/>
I'll send an e-mail to yahoo again and ask what's going on.  Some <br/>
messages are repeating, some I'm not even getting at all in my <br/>
mailbox.  If I want to stay caught up, I'm having to go to the list <br/>
sites to read new messages.<br/>
