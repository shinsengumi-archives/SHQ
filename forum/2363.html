<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938147477">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you've all heard about the Miburo Lair game we have going on <br/>
LiveJournal, but you may not know about the other game our "guilty <br/>
pleasure"  called Far Frontier where darn near anything goes and <br/>
historic fact is twisted in strange and unusual ways in the pursuit of <br/>
fun and alleviation of boredom.<br/>
The premise is that Itou Kashitaro and Takeda Kanryuusai escaped their <br/>
historic demises in Kyoto and decided to run away and join the <br/>
barbarians in the USA. They landed in 1870 in a sleepy little town <br/>
called Pagoda Springs Colorado.<br/>
<br/>
Only they never counted on most of their old co-workers and enemies to <br/>
get the same idea. We've even had appearances from the great 15th <br/>
century warrior Maeda Toshiie and his lovely wife Matsu and even Saizou <br/>
the pig from PMK and Bigfoot  are known to pop in O_O.<br/>
<br/>
Don't want to be a transplanted Japanese character? We could use long <br/>
term and temporary appearances from assorted American townsfolk types.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested or have questions or would like to know more pop me <br/>
