Shinsengumi one, it&#39;s called a jinhachimaki or a hachigane.<br/>
<br/>
The sleeveless jacket is called a jinbaori-- &quot;war-haori&quot;-- since, in full <br/>
traditional garb, it would be worn over a suit of armor.<br/>

Hope that helps.<br/>

 <br/>
Just to make sure, it&#39;s &quot;jinbaori&quot; (with a &quot;b&quot;) and not jinhaori (with an &quot;h&quot;)?<br/>
 <br/>
I knew about the hachigane (from Shishio&#39;s wearing one and taunting Saitou about it), but I knew that the Sekihoutai didn&#39;t wear that... that it was just cloth.  Glad to have a better term for it than headband or bandana.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113349003">Yes, that&#39;s jinbaori with a &quot;b&quot;. When you put another word in front of an <br/>
&quot;h&quot; sound, the &quot;h&quot; usually becomes a &quot;b&quot;-- like &quot;nagabakama&quot; (long hakama) <br/>
or &quot;hanbakama&quot; (half-length hakama).<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s anything else, don&#39;t hesitate to ask.<br/>
