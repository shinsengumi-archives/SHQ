Shinsengumi one, it's called a jinhachimaki or a hachigane.<br/>
<br/>
The sleeveless jacket is called a jinbaori-- "war-haori"-- since, in full <br/>
traditional garb, it would be worn over a suit of armor.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926961295">Oh, that helps a lot!  Gracias!<br/>
 <br/>
Just to make sure, it's "jinbaori" (with a "b") and not jinhaori (with an "h")?<br/>
 <br/>
I knew about the hachigane (from Shishio's wearing one and taunting Saitou about it), but I knew that the Sekihoutai didn't wear that... that it was just cloth.  Glad to have a better term for it than headband or bandana.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113349003">Yes, that's jinbaori with a "b". When you put another word in front of an <br/>
"h" sound, the "h" usually becomes a "b"-- like "nagabakama" (long hakama) <br/>
or "hanbakama" (half-length hakama).<br/>
<br/>
If there's anything else, don't hesitate to ask.<br/>
