<h3>Beware Shinsengumi grandpas!</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700912154">Oh, how could I have forgotten this after SK's wonderful tale of Nagakura and the yakuza?  <br/>
 <br/>
Babelfish translation of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sara1.gotdns.com/~ark24/suzuki003.html">http://sara1.gotdns.com/~ark24/suzuki003.html</a> (for those who can translate babelfish):<br/>
 <br/>
<<In addition, the thief entered into the Suzuki Family in 1911 New Year's Day, but the sword which that time is put between the floor (three tree Saburo demon circular Kunisige and Bizen Osafune �S had fixed, "it can cut this sword well," that we made the demon circle important, it was considerably the lively preparation of the red sheath, it seems) pulling out, "ride the ��! When "with it keeps facing, as for the thief being overwhelmed by the force, the �� of one one it was and with kept escaping.>><br/>
 <br/>
According to momoiro, a thief entered the house and Suzuki (keeping in mind he's about 75 in 1911) drove him out by force.  Too cool!<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, to get to the other two pages of this site, just substitute 1 and 2 for the 3 at the end of the above URL.  As usual, babelfish garbles it badly.  (and Yahoo is screwing with my fonts...)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>hold it...demon circular kunisige...doesn't that sound like the name of Saitou's sword too?<<<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>:-D  Looks like my plan worked.  I purposely put in the babelfish translation even though it was worse than usual just so you'd bite on "demon circular."  I wondered the same thing, but I couldn't remember if there was more to the name of Saitou's sword and I'm just not up to searching in past messages.  I figured you'd know (or at least find it noteworthy).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>?...imagine Shinsengumi captains Saitou "my sword is xxxx", <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Miki "so's mine"...then they just go on and on about the history of their swords<<<br/>
<br/>
While they both down plenty of sake, I'm sure.  That could've been a riot (perhaps literally).  ;-)  Something else the site (and momoiro) mentioned was that Suzuki had a lifelong drinking problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>now with all these tales of Shinsengumi grandpas I imagine their grandsons and granddaughters...at school saying things like "my grandpa can kick your grandpa's *ss"<<<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And maybe that was good enough reason to stay away from each other.  :-D  Kids say the darnedest things, like giving away your hiding place.  With what appears to be *seven* grandkids from Tsutomu alone (looking at the family tree M provided), maybe Saitou had good reason to be always on alert.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
We should start a grandpa file to keep all these stories...  they're such a treat!<br/>

<h3>Miki+Saitou&#39;s Sword/more Seinan War paintings</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-328299483">babelfish of Saitou's sword is Demon circular Kunisige Ikeda <br/>
Miki's sword is "three tree Saburo demon circular Kunisige" <br/>
<br/>
hmmm...part of sword names include the name of the maker and where <br/>
it was made...I'm sure a certain resident sword enthusiast may try <br/>
to find out <br/>
<br/>
I uploaded just a couple more paintings at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3">http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3</a><br/>
folder Seinan+TMPD+FrenchPolice "seinan6"<br/>
password makoto<br/>
<br/>
***if you download the images please note that some images are <br/>
really big so you have to use your scroll bar otherwise you may miss <br/>
something interesting<br/>
<br/>
1) the depiction of bullets flying through the air....lines all over <br/>
the place (see file 2 in seinan6 collection)<br/>
<br/>
2) Toshiyoshi Kawaji is labelled in group pics of important people <br/>
(I compared the name under his photograph w/ the folded arms and it <br/>
matches exactly with what is shown in the paintings)...I found him <br/>
in 3 paintings and (chuckle) the artist did a very realistic <br/>
rendition...I wonder if his relatives in Satsuma ever forgave him <br/>
for marching against his own people so to speak...I didn't bother to <br/>
scan these but believe me I was like -wow- he's in pics of banquets <br/>
and on the battlefield fighting<br/>
<br/>
3) I would like to draw your attention to a painting (Zoom of an <br/>
earlier scan) showing a Satsuma samurai woman on the floor...the <br/>
gov. soldier had his knee on her chest...her naginata was flung <br/>
behind the soldier...he has rope to restrain her and in her right <br/>
hand is her wakizashi short sword.<br/>
In another pic you its kind of like "its a bird, its a plane, its <br/>
Saigo in the meteor!"...2 versions of this Saigo sighting similar to <br/>
the one M pointed out in the newspaper archive.<br/>
I also put in another pic with Saigo surrounded...next to him is a <br/>
worn out warrior woman leaning on her naginata</div>

The actual blade in the site is pretty nice. Do you know if its currently in any museum? <br/>
During the later Edo period a lot of swords emerged that had very little curvature like Saitou's katana. I read on one Japanese site that the use of shinai had an influence on the decrease in curvature. <br/>

Do you by chance have a site that has the kanji for the maker's name on Miki's katana? I have a small hunch that the name has something to do with the way it was made. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-518899126">In a message dated 6/17/2004 6:20:22 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:secretarytocapt3@...">secretarytocapt3@...</a> writes:<br/>
In another pic you its kind of like "its a bird, its a plane, its <br/>
Saigo in the meteor!"...2 versions of this Saigo sighting similar to <br/>
the one M pointed out in the newspaper archive.<br/>
The book I'm reading on Saigo has one of those pics in it. I don't know if <br/>
you've read this or not Sec. I know I told phil and Barb, but let me fill <br/>
everyone else in. The reason Saigo is being shown in the meteor is that on August 2, <br/>
1877 (while Saigo was still fighting in Satsuma) a meteor appeared in the <br/>
skies over Osaka. A newspaper called the Osaka nippo reported the next day that <br/>
if the "bright star" was viewed through a telescope one could see a portrait of <br/>
Saigo in full Imperial army uniform. Popular opinion being with Saigo at the <br/>
time, people took this at evidence he was already ascending to the stars and <br/>
"night after night people stood on their  laundry-drying platforms to get a <br/>
better look at the celestial hero". <br/>
<br/>
By the time the comet appeared over Tokyo it had become an object of <br/>
veneration. The term at the time for a comet was "hoki boshi", but this could also be <br/>
read as "rebellious star" in reference to the insurrection. People by this <br/>
time were climbing onto their roofs to get a better view and many wound up <br/>
getting hurt because the roof boards would collapse under all the weight.<br/>
<br/>
There are supposed to be some prints of this star by a guy named Haneda that <br/>
show people unhappy with his leaving trying to drag the star back down with <br/>
ropes. Another print by Tsukioka Yonejiro shows the government trying to shoot <br/>
the star down with a millitary balloon!<br/>
<br/>
There are some other prints Sec that are called "Saigo nehanzo" or nirvana <br/>
prints. Saigo is presented as an enlightened being (still in his uniform) who is <br/>
about to transcend this world. More "common" people from all walks of life <br/>
surround him, praying for him to remain. Even animals are shown grieving! <br/>
(Perhaps the most telling of these is the snake?) <br/>
<br/>
Yet another type of Saigo print is the ones made after his defeat. They are <br/>
commonly called "kubi Jikken" or "inspection of heads" and show Yamagata and <br/>
Co. sitting around while the heads of the traitors are lined up before them. NO <br/>
such inspection ever took place however.<br/>
<br/>
What these are all about is the fact that for a short time after his defeat, <br/>
Saigo's head went missing. The new government had begun a policy of not <br/>
displaying heads publicly because it was "an example of the cruelty of the old <br/>
regime". (So was anyone else unaware that it was the "evil old regime" that <br/>
displayed Kondo and Sagara's heads rather than the "good" new one?) The fact is that <br/>
they didn't really need the head. However they were frantic to find it because <br/>
of all the myth that had already sprung up around Saigo.<br/>
<br/>
They had the body. They could prove that it was truly him. He was an <br/>
unusually tall man of nearly six feet and had a very distinctive scar on his right arm <br/>
from a youthful quarrel, so he was easy to identify. However they wanted the <br/>
head to lay the rumors and legends to rest along with him. Not only had he <br/>
already become something of a demigod while he was still alive, but there were <br/>
many who did not accept the reality of his death even WITH the head.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors began to circulate that he was in either China or India preparing an <br/>
army to come back and seize control of Japan. These stories continued to pop up <br/>
every now and again. As late as 1891 people were claiming that Saigo was in <br/>
Russia (who was coming for a visit)  and would return to Japan in the company <br/>
of Crown Prince Nikolai to start the new rebellion. When Saigo failed to appear <br/>
a constable named Tsuda Sanzo decided this was evidence of foul play and <br/>
attacked the crown prince!<br/>
<br/>
Legend tells of Saigo's fall and the finding of his head in this way:<br/>
<br/>
When they rushed down the hill Saigo was struck in the hip by a bullet and <br/>
fell. He supposedly composed himself and prepared to die. He asked his friend <br/>
Beppu to be his second (the actual conversation gets VERY long according to the <br/>
source), then faced east and the Imperial Palace. In prints he's shown <br/>
thrusting a sword into his abdomen just before Beppu cuts his head off. The head is <br/>
given to Saigo's manservant Kichizaemon, who flees with it and tries to hide it <br/>
from the Imperial army by burying at the gate of a private home. (The <br/>
manservants name changes from tale to tale, as does the home where he did this.)<br/>
<br/>
The next part of the myth is the presentation of the head to Yamagata. I've <br/>
already mentioned that no such scene as the one depicted in the prints ever <br/>
occured. The "historical" version that is usually given is that a man named Maeda <br/>
Tsunemitsu (again, there is a question of WHO actually found the head, but <br/>
this name is the most likely) brought the head to Yamagata. The general of the <br/>
Imperial army treats it with great respect, washing it and praising his <br/>
"glorious death". He recollects how they fought together during the Revolution and <br/>
weeps for his fallen comrade. <br/>
<br/>
The reality is this: According to the autopsy done on Saigo's body, he could <br/>
not have sat there calmly or make a big speech. He was most likely in shock at <br/>
the time and a shattered hip would have made it impossible to do what he does <br/>
in the story. Furthermore, there were no sword wounds of any sort on his <br/>
abdomen. His head was indeed severed with a clean cut, but  that's all.<br/>
<br/>
The second part of the story comes from an American observer named Captain <br/>
Hubbard. He reports that the bodies of the rebels had been striped naked and <br/>
lined up in two rows on a hill by the Imperial army's barricades. Hubbard <br/>
immediately spots Saigo's body and realizes the head is missing. It is the only one <br/>
that the head is completely gone from. Others were "dreadfully cut up" and he <br/>
felt certain they had killed each other. While he was watching Saigo's head was <br/>
brought in and unceremoniously placed beside his body. And that's all there <br/>
was to it.<br/>
<br/>
This is of course all from Mark Ravina's book, The Last Samurai. <br/>
