<h3>Beware Shinsengumi grandpas!</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700912154">Oh, how could I have forgotten this after SK&#39;s wonderful tale of Nagakura and the yakuza?  <br/>
 <br/>
Babelfish translation of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sara1.gotdns.com/~ark24/suzuki003.html">http://sara1.gotdns.com/~ark24/suzuki003.html</a> (for those who can translate babelfish):<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;In addition, the thief entered into the Suzuki Family in 1911 New Year&#39;s Day, but the sword which that time is put between the floor (three tree Saburo demon circular Kunisige and Bizen Osafune ï¿½S had fixed, &quot;it can cut this sword well,&quot; that we made the demon circle important, it was considerably the lively preparation of the red sheath, it seems) pulling out, &quot;ride the ï¿½ï¿½! When &quot;with it keeps facing, as for the thief being overwhelmed by the force, the ï¿½ï¿½ of one one it was and with kept escaping.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
According to momoiro, a thief entered the house and Suzuki (keeping in mind he&#39;s about 75 in 1911) drove him out by force.  Too cool!<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, to get to the other two pages of this site, just substitute 1 and 2 for the 3 at the end of the above URL.  As usual, babelfish garbles it badly.  (and Yahoo is screwing with my fonts...)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>:-D  Looks like my plan worked.  I purposely put in the babelfish translation even though it was worse than usual just so you&#39;d bite on &quot;demon circular.&quot;  I wondered the same thing, but I couldn&#39;t remember if there was more to the name of Saitou&#39;s sword and I&#39;m just not up to searching in past messages.  I figured you&#39;d know (or at least find it noteworthy).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;?...imagine Shinsengumi captains Saitou &quot;my sword is xxxx&quot;, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Miki &quot;so&#39;s mine&quot;...then they just go on and on about the history of their swords&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
While they both down plenty of sake, I&#39;m sure.  That could&#39;ve been a riot (perhaps literally).  ;-)  Something else the site (and momoiro) mentioned was that Suzuki had a lifelong drinking problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;now with all these tales of Shinsengumi grandpas I imagine their grandsons and granddaughters...at school saying things like &quot;my grandpa can kick your grandpa&#39;s *ss&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And maybe that was good enough reason to stay away from each other.  :-D  Kids say the darnedest things, like giving away your hiding place.  With what appears to be *seven* grandkids from Tsutomu alone (looking at the family tree M provided), maybe Saitou had good reason to be always on alert.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
We should start a grandpa file to keep all these stories...  they&#39;re such a treat!<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-1150">&gt;</a> Miki+Saitou&#39;s Sword/more Seinan War paintings</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-328299483">babelfish of Saitou&#39;s sword is Demon circular Kunisige Ikeda <br/>
Miki&#39;s sword is &quot;three tree Saburo demon circular Kunisige&quot; <br/>
<br/>
hmmm...part of sword names include the name of the maker and where <br/>
it was made...I&#39;m sure a certain resident sword enthusiast may try <br/>
to find out <br/>
<br/>
I uploaded just a couple more paintings at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3">http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3</a><br/>
folder Seinan+TMPD+FrenchPolice &quot;seinan6&quot;<br/>
password makoto<br/>
<br/>
***if you download the images please note that some images are <br/>
really big so you have to use your scroll bar otherwise you may miss <br/>
something interesting<br/>
<br/>
1) the depiction of bullets flying through the air....lines all over <br/>
the place (see file 2 in seinan6 collection)<br/>
<br/>
2) Toshiyoshi Kawaji is labelled in group pics of important people <br/>
(I compared the name under his photograph w/ the folded arms and it <br/>
matches exactly with what is shown in the paintings)...I found him <br/>
in 3 paintings and (chuckle) the artist did a very realistic <br/>
rendition...I wonder if his relatives in Satsuma ever forgave him <br/>
for marching against his own people so to speak...I didn&#39;t bother to <br/>
scan these but believe me I was like -wow- he&#39;s in pics of banquets <br/>
and on the battlefield fighting<br/>
<br/>
3) I would like to draw your attention to a painting (Zoom of an <br/>
earlier scan) showing a Satsuma samurai woman on the floor...the <br/>
gov. soldier had his knee on her chest...her naginata was flung <br/>
behind the soldier...he has rope to restrain her and in her right <br/>
hand is her wakizashi short sword.<br/>
In another pic you its kind of like &quot;its a bird, its a plane, its <br/>
Saigo in the meteor!&quot;...2 versions of this Saigo sighting similar to <br/>
the one M pointed out in the newspaper archive.<br/>
I also put in another pic with Saigo surrounded...next to him is a <br/>
worn out warrior woman leaning on her naginata</div>

The actual blade in the site is pretty nice. Do you know if its currently in any museum? <br/>
During the later Edo period a lot of swords emerged that had very little curvature like Saitou&#39;s katana. I read on one Japanese site that the use of shinai had an influence on the decrease in curvature. <br/>

  You know I have no idea of that double for Saitou&#39;s actual sword is <br/>
  in any museum...it appears on every Saitou related site (3-<br/>
  hajime.com/1to5.net)<br/>
<br/>
  Phil, can you grab the kanji for the name of Miki&#39;s blade?<br/>
<br/>
  Hmmm I wonder since so many of the management level captains had <br/>
  valuable weapons I&#39;m sure they had &quot;my sword is better than your <br/>
  sword conversations&quot; ^_^<br/>

  &gt; The actual blade in the site is pretty nice. Do you know if its <br/>
  currently in any museum? <br/>
  &gt; During the later Edo period a lot of swords emerged that had very <br/>
  little curvature like Saitou&#39;s katana. I read on one Japanese site <br/>
  that the use of shinai had an influence on the decrease in <br/>
  curvature. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Do you by chance have a site that has the kanji for the maker&#39;s <br/>
  name on Miki&#39;s katana? I have a small hunch that the name has <br/>
  something to do with the way it was made. <br/>

In another pic you its kind of like &quot;its a bird, its a plane, its <br/>
Saigo in the meteor!&quot;...2 versions of this Saigo sighting similar to <br/>
the one M pointed out in the newspaper archive.<br/>
The book I&#39;m reading on Saigo has one of those pics in it. I don&#39;t know if <br/>
you&#39;ve read this or not Sec. I know I told phil and Barb, but let me fill <br/>
everyone else in. The reason Saigo is being shown in the meteor is that on August 2, <br/>
1877 (while Saigo was still fighting in Satsuma) a meteor appeared in the <br/>
skies over Osaka. A newspaper called the Osaka nippo reported the next day that <br/>
if the &quot;bright star&quot; was viewed through a telescope one could see a portrait of <br/>
Saigo in full Imperial army uniform. Popular opinion being with Saigo at the <br/>
time, people took this at evidence he was already ascending to the stars and <br/>
&quot;night after night people stood on their  laundry-drying platforms to get a <br/>
better look at the celestial hero&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
By the time the comet appeared over Tokyo it had become an object of <br/>
veneration. The term at the time for a comet was &quot;hoki boshi&quot;, but this could also be <br/>
read as &quot;rebellious star&quot; in reference to the insurrection. People by this <br/>
time were climbing onto their roofs to get a better view and many wound up <br/>
getting hurt because the roof boards would collapse under all the weight.<br/>
<br/>
There are supposed to be some prints of this star by a guy named Haneda that <br/>
show people unhappy with his leaving trying to drag the star back down with <br/>
ropes. Another print by Tsukioka Yonejiro shows the government trying to shoot <br/>
the star down with a millitary balloon!<br/>
<br/>
There are some other prints Sec that are called &quot;Saigo nehanzo&quot; or nirvana <br/>
prints. Saigo is presented as an enlightened being (still in his uniform) who is <br/>
about to transcend this world. More &quot;common&quot; people from all walks of life <br/>
surround him, praying for him to remain. Even animals are shown grieving! <br/>
(Perhaps the most telling of these is the snake?) <br/>
<br/>
Yet another type of Saigo print is the ones made after his defeat. They are <br/>
commonly called &quot;kubi Jikken&quot; or &quot;inspection of heads&quot; and show Yamagata and <br/>
Co. sitting around while the heads of the traitors are lined up before them. NO <br/>
such inspection ever took place however.<br/>
<br/>
What these are all about is the fact that for a short time after his defeat, <br/>
Saigo&#39;s head went missing. The new government had begun a policy of not <br/>
displaying heads publicly because it was &quot;an example of the cruelty of the old <br/>
regime&quot;. (So was anyone else unaware that it was the &quot;evil old regime&quot; that <br/>
displayed Kondo and Sagara&#39;s heads rather than the &quot;good&quot; new one?) The fact is that <br/>
they didn&#39;t really need the head. However they were frantic to find it because <br/>
of all the myth that had already sprung up around Saigo.<br/>
<br/>
They had the body. They could prove that it was truly him. He was an <br/>
unusually tall man of nearly six feet and had a very distinctive scar on his right arm <br/>
from a youthful quarrel, so he was easy to identify. However they wanted the <br/>
head to lay the rumors and legends to rest along with him. Not only had he <br/>
already become something of a demigod while he was still alive, but there were <br/>
many who did not accept the reality of his death even WITH the head.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors began to circulate that he was in either China or India preparing an <br/>
army to come back and seize control of Japan. These stories continued to pop up <br/>
every now and again. As late as 1891 people were claiming that Saigo was in <br/>
Russia (who was coming for a visit)  and would return to Japan in the company <br/>
of Crown Prince Nikolai to start the new rebellion. When Saigo failed to appear <br/>
a constable named Tsuda Sanzo decided this was evidence of foul play and <br/>
attacked the crown prince!<br/>
<br/>
Legend tells of Saigo&#39;s fall and the finding of his head in this way:<br/>
<br/>
When they rushed down the hill Saigo was struck in the hip by a bullet and <br/>
fell. He supposedly composed himself and prepared to die. He asked his friend <br/>
Beppu to be his second (the actual conversation gets VERY long according to the <br/>
source), then faced east and the Imperial Palace. In prints he&#39;s shown <br/>
thrusting a sword into his abdomen just before Beppu cuts his head off. The head is <br/>
given to Saigo&#39;s manservant Kichizaemon, who flees with it and tries to hide it <br/>
from the Imperial army by burying at the gate of a private home. (The <br/>
manservants name changes from tale to tale, as does the home where he did this.)<br/>
<br/>
The next part of the myth is the presentation of the head to Yamagata. I&#39;ve <br/>
already mentioned that no such scene as the one depicted in the prints ever <br/>
occured. The &quot;historical&quot; version that is usually given is that a man named Maeda <br/>
Tsunemitsu (again, there is a question of WHO actually found the head, but <br/>
this name is the most likely) brought the head to Yamagata. The general of the <br/>
Imperial army treats it with great respect, washing it and praising his <br/>
&quot;glorious death&quot;. He recollects how they fought together during the Revolution and <br/>
weeps for his fallen comrade. <br/>
<br/>
The reality is this: According to the autopsy done on Saigo&#39;s body, he could <br/>
not have sat there calmly or make a big speech. He was most likely in shock at <br/>
the time and a shattered hip would have made it impossible to do what he does <br/>
in the story. Furthermore, there were no sword wounds of any sort on his <br/>
abdomen. His head was indeed severed with a clean cut, but  that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
The second part of the story comes from an American observer named Captain <br/>
Hubbard. He reports that the bodies of the rebels had been striped naked and <br/>
lined up in two rows on a hill by the Imperial army&#39;s barricades. Hubbard <br/>
immediately spots Saigo&#39;s body and realizes the head is missing. It is the only one <br/>
that the head is completely gone from. Others were &quot;dreadfully cut up&quot; and he <br/>
felt certain they had killed each other. While he was watching Saigo&#39;s head was <br/>
brought in and unceremoniously placed beside his body. And that&#39;s all there <br/>
was to it.<br/>
<br/>
This is of course all from Mark Ravina&#39;s book, The Last Samurai. <br/>

which is the celebration, but the large sword there is no knife of <br/>
certain ones and the ÂÃ the place where it has been troubled, it was <br/>

&gt; You know, after thinking about it, some of the swords of the <br/>
Shinsengumi <br/>
&gt; members may have been destroyed after WWII when the occupational <br/>
forces gathered <br/>
&gt; all the weapons and melted them down. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s true. How sad. Or they could be here in America. I recall <br/>
hearing that <br/>
&gt; a lot of service men got hold of confiscated Japanese swords and <br/>
brought them <br/>
&gt; home as &quot;souviners&quot;. <br/>

Saigo was worthy of being called a &quot;great hero&quot;...<br/>
