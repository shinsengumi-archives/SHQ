  I&#39;ll check Shinsengumi Keppuroku, I believe in the ep that Hijikata sends Saitou to infiltrate the Itou group you see a shot of his mon. I&#39;ll see if I can screencap it later. I checked my volumes of Kaze Hikaru manga and it seems that it&#39;s the bamboo design as well. I&#39;ll scann that and out it up. Oddly enough, Kaze Hikaru has shots of almost every captain&#39;s mon which is where I initially found the mon for Okita. Harada&#39;s mon is similar to Kondo&#39;s but with only one horizontal bar.  <br/>
<br/>
  Out of curiosity, why would his kamon have been wisteria? <br/>
<br/>
  Note: Oddly enough, the biohazard sign used in our modern world was actually a family crest according to this small book I have.  <br/>

    appearance in the film Bakumatsu Monoga...during the movie to see if<br/>
    he had kamon on his clothing....(in other films you can clearly see<br/>
    Kondo+Hijikata&#39;s kamon)<br/>

    (I was wondering why the mon was bamboo and not wisteria... will have<br/>
    to hunt up that discussion... )  <br/>

    *there are many reasons why bamboo would be a good choice<br/>

    and we were good too...cited all websites:)<br/>
<br/>
    *nine...for the number of bamboo leaves by the way REALLY is<br/>
    unlucky...I asked a Japanese student and that was her first<br/>
    impression...but again superstitions/beliefs change over time<br/>

    *I just thought is was interesting...once he gets his new Fujita last<br/>
    name does he get a package &quot;this is your new family&quot; package complete<br/>
