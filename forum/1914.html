<h3>Hijikata descendants.</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278539300">Yes, you're right. They would be Kiroku's descendants. ( I would assume so <br/>
anyway.) Is that pic of the woman with the child still in the files? That was <br/>
one of them. <br/>
<br/>
As for the child, I would love to know more about the source of that rumor as <br/>
well. Pretty sad if it's true and that the baby died. :(<br/>
