<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953839421">Hello all I know it&#39;s been a while since i&#39;ve posted here. I have been in Japan since last Wednesday. Below this following paragraph I have written a brief discussion about my martial arts training here.<br/>
<br/>
So far I have visited Kyoto and Himeji. For those who have never been, Kyoto is an amazing city. I was lucky to see three places when I was there. Kinkakujin, Kiyomizudera, and Nijo Castle. Each place I went to was amazing especially Kiyomizudera for the view. Unfortunately I did not have much time to visit any areas like Mibudera or any other Shinsengumi related areas. The day after visiting Kyoto I went to Himeji castle. Lucky, we came as the sakura were blooming so that added a very beautiful touch to the scenery.<br/>
<br/>
However, sightseeing was not my primary goal here in Japan. I came here to attend the yearly Suio Ryu gasshuku (training camp) and also to train at the honbu in Shimizu city. The gasshuku porton has ended and I will start the other part of my training tomorrow. The gasshuku which took place this past weekend was held at a traditional Japanese inn. I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever trained that hard before. Both days consisted of constant training in various techniques of the Ryu. I was fortunate to be introduced to both the seated and standing wakizashi techniques as well as witness some of the kenjutsu and naginatajutsu taught within the school. Many points of technique were pointed out and some philosophy discussed by Katsuse Yoshimitsu sensei, 15th headmaster of the Suio Ryu. One important point was that Bushido is not a way of dying, but living. Another point was that in order for a Ryu to survive and progress and for a person to become better there must be constant change. If you ask yourself a question now (related to training), and say 10 years in the future your answer is the same, then you have not progressed. Over years of training a person&#39;s answer ad way of doing things should naturally change. <br/>
<br/>
I have seen past demos done by my sensei on video and the change he discusses is very apparent. His way of doing things from back then is totally different from the way he does them now. He believes that the growth of a person should not be stifled by conforming them to do things the same way all the time. He explaned to us that we should do technique based who we are. Make the techniques our own, something unique to you. Copying someone and making yourself look like them has absolutely no meaning. <br/>
<br/>
One other thing that was brought up is that without being guided we must constantly analyze what we are doing. These were techniques were developed during a time where ones life would depend on them. In practice ask yourself, &quot;will this work?&quot; If it is not done correctly or safely, as yourself why. Hone the technique to be effective without discarding parts of the technique (no shortcuts). Effectiveness without sacrifice. Once a basic form is learned one must go beyond just the form itself. I remember in an essay written by his father, the 14th headmaster of Suio Ryu, he said &quot;iai which has not been fully studied can only be a dance with a sword&quot;. This applies not only to the iai portion of the school, but all areas. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if some of what I have typed is hard to follow. I&#39;m trying to recall bits of info from a mountain of info as well as trying to express what I have learned deep in my heart thusfar. Also, I am not fluent in Japanese, and there was someone translating for me there so some things my have been lost in translation. I am also by no means an expert in this Ryu as I have hardly even set foot on the path, but I hope that this is able to give you all a small glimpse of the tradition of which I study under.  <br/>
