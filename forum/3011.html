<h3>When history converges:Hijikata, the Battle of Aizu, and the Byakkotai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148979979">Some have asked in the past about the importance of thorough, broad research <br/>
into all of the Bakumatsu, and how it feels sometimes as though a dedicated <br/>
Shinsengumi fan may lose sight of the "objective"-- learning more about <br/>
Shinsengumi. I thoroughly sympathize with this feeling, being a researcher <br/>
and trying my best to constantly learn more about the Bakumatsu, though I am <br/>
at heart a fan of the Shinsengumi, which is what sparked my interest in the <br/>
period to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
As an example of how the people and events of this period are so thoroughly <br/>
connected, I'd like to share with you an anecdote from the life of Ando <br/>
Tozaburo, a young Aizu samurai who was one of the famed Byakkotai members <br/>
who died in the latter part of the Boshin War, on Mt. Iimori in the fall of <br/>
1868.<br/>
<br/>
The young Tozaburo was manning a barrier gate in the early parts of the <br/>
siege, before the Aizu forces were pushed back to Wakamatsu. He was <br/>
ostensibly on the lookout for any suspicious people approaching, when along <br/>
rode a man on horseback. This man on horseback did not stop for him, so <br/>
Tozaburo turned and shouted "Wait! Stop!" and fired a warning shot over the <br/>
man's head. The rider turned and rode back a bit, at which point he <br/>
introduced himself to the Tozaburo-- it was none other than Hijikata Toshizo <br/>
of the Shinsengumi. Apologizing for his indiscretion to the young man, <br/>
Hijikata turned and rode on.<br/>
