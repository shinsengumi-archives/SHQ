The article above pertains to the Wakamatsu Tea & Silk Colony settlement in N. California.<br/>
<br/>
"The Wakamatsu Colony story is every bit as compelling as the story of Jamestown or the Mayflower and Plymouth Rock," said Conservancy director Alan Ehrgott...In addition to its agricultural history, the property is also the only community outside Japan that was settled by samurai; the birthplace of the first naturalized Japanese-American; and the location of the first Japanese woman buried on American soil...A bipartisan bill has been introduced in Congress to allow the Department of Interior to take title to the land and help manage it as a historic site."</div>
