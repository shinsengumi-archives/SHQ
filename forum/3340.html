<h3>Trip to Kyoto</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352635016">FYI - I&#39;m going to be in Kyoto for 2 weeks starting Sunday, and the<br/>
first 7 days will be in a hotel two blocks from Mibudera.  Anyone have<br/>
any photograph requests?  I&#39;m free to travel for a few days, so if<br/>
anyone wants to request me to go somewhere and ask questions and/or<br/>
get some pics, let me know. Since I&#39;ll be in the heart of the ole<br/>
&#39;gumi stomping grounds, I figured I&#39;d ask.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Seems this trip is turning out to be a Bakumatsu trip after all.  <br/>
Today I walked over to the Imperial palace, and then from there to <br/>
Sanjo bridge, and got some pics of it. Not sure where the whole Sanjo <br/>
Seisatsu incident took place, but I probably walked over it at some <br/>
point.  Also added to the pebble collection with a pebble from the <br/>
grounds of the imperial palace, and one from the riverbank of the <br/>
kamo river under sanjo bridge. So your daughter won&#39;t get a handful <br/>
of dirt, but I can send some pebbles.  I&#39;ll keep track of just where <br/>
I got them :D</div>

Takayoshi&#39;s (Kouin) grave as well. Also visited the bakumatsu museum <br/>

beyond that, there wasn&#39;t a lot to see. Also, there was a painting of <br/>
Kondo Isami&#39;s severed head by a Choshu samurai who painted it while <br/>
it was sitting exposed by Sanjo bridge.  Kondo didn&#39;t look too happy <br/>
about his fate.</div>
