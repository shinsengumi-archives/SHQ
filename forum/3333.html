<br/>
&quot;Bakumatsu Junjouden,&quot; a popular play by dramatist Kohei Tsuka, is<br/>
returning to the stage later this year with Tsuka directing. This is his<br/>
first time directing it in 18 years.<br/>
<br/>
The play, which was turned into a movie in 1991, portrays the<br/>
Shinsengumi swordsman Okita Soji as actually being a woman. Satomi<br/>
Ishihara will star in this role, previously played by Riho Makise for<br/>
the film. Former Takarazuka top star Tsubasa Makoto will plays Sakamoto<br/>
Ryoma.<br/>
<br/>
Performances will be held at the Shinbashi Enbujo in August.<br/>
<br/>
Information on Ishihara (who was just in TV Asahi&#39;s production of the<br/>
Mishima play &quot;Rokumeikan,&quot; torrent available on d-addicts, no<br/>
subtitles)...  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Ishihara_Satomi">http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Ishihara_Satomi</a><br/>
