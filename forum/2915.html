<h3>Battle at Hamaguri Gate...</h3>
by <i>onigiribeanie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150949004">Certainly the rout of Choshu and the loss of key figures was a set <br/>
back to various reformist activities, but I haven't read enough of <br/>
the literature to assert how significant of a contributor this event <br/>
was to the destabilization of power within Choshu.<br/>
<br/>
However, certainly had this incident not happened, I do think there <br/>
is an idea that Kusaka Genzui would have been alive to perhaps push <br/>
the internal control of Choshu over to more liberal hands earlier.  <br/>
Even so , there are simply too many variables and other parallel <br/>
reformist movements that were going on in other parts of Japan to <br/>
ignore.  To pin the timing of reformation on one even involving one <br/>
clan  I think is much too simplistic.<br/>
<br/>
I still haven't finished Albert Craig's work, but his work along <br/>
with Thomas Huber's gives a good illustration of politics within <br/>
Choshu and the conflict between the conservative pro-Bakufu elements <br/>
and the liberal pro-Emperor elements.  (These works are still both <br/>
available in most academic libraries and on amazon.com if someone is <br/>
interested in pursuing them. And if so - feel free to ping me should <br/>
you develop any summaries you wish to be shared , archived, etc. on <br/>

<br/>
I have a suspicion that Huber might have made some arguments <br/>
regarding the timing of massive changes in the political scene in <br/>
his work, but would have to go back and look at this more closely.<br/>
<br/>
As for Ikedaya - there also seems to be little mention of it in <br/>
Craig's work or elsewhere.  The only reference someone was able to <br/>
find after translating some of the Japanese sites committed to <br/>
looking at the students of the Shoin jinja (where many of the <br/>
younger reformists studied or passed through), is that had Yoshida <br/>
Toshimaro not perished in relation to that event, more than likely <br/>
he would have been a key political figure in the Meiji government <br/>
(as would have others from Choshu).<br/>
<br/>

Hope this is helpful... <br/>
