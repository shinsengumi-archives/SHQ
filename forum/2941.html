<h3>Hijikata at Utsunomiya Castle</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868444343">After his escape from Edo, Hijikata Toshizo and Otori Keisuke, a commander <br/>
of the former Shogunate's infantry, led an attack on Utsunomiya Castle. <br/>
Utsunomiya Castle was strategically located-- it was on the northward roads <br/>
leading to places like Aizu and Sendai, and one of the locations prime for <br/>
attack by the new government's army.<br/>
<br/>
A question that has been on my mind for some time was the following-- a <br/>
castle in Edo-era Japan is never without an occupant. A ruling family of <br/>
Utsunomiya was never mentioned in anything I'd read on Hijikata's attack, <br/>
and this led me to believe that perhaps it was one of the Tokugawa family's <br/>
castles. Checking the list of castles in direct posession of the Tokugawa, I <br/>
quickly found that this was not the case.<br/>
<br/>
Who ruled Utsunomiya Castle, then? Where was its lord, and why was his <br/>
castle attacked by Hijikata and Otori?<br/>
<br/>
The logical step was to look for "Utsunomiya-han" ("Utsunomiya domain") in a <br/>
reference book-- in this case, volume one of Ogawa Kyoichi's "Edo Bakuhan <br/>
Daimyo-ke Jiten" ("A Dictionary of Edo-era Lordly Families"), and Abe <br/>
Akira's article on Utsunomiya-han in volume two of the the extensive domain <br/>
encyclopedia "Hanshi Daijiten". Sure enough, I found it: Utsunomiya-han was <br/>
a domain ruled by the Toda family. As of Keio 3 (1867), it was a <br/>
moderately-sized domain of 70,850 koku, or roughly a quarter of the size of <br/>
the Aizu domain in the same year (280,000 koku). The lord of Utsunomiya was <br/>
Toda Tadatomo, who in 1868 was a young 20 years old.<br/>
<br/>
The next question on my mind that arose was this, now that I knew the name <br/>
of the lord-- did he have any history of a disconnect with the Tokugawa <br/>
family, or a tendency toward inaction when it came to Shogunal politics? The <br/>
answer was a resounding no-- Tadatomo held high positions in the Tokugawa <br/>
administration, both as a Master of Ceremonies (soshaban) and a Magistrate <br/>
of Temples and Shrines (Jisha-bugyo). He was appointed to these posts as of <br/>
the 25th day of the 7th month of Keio 3 (1867), so that doesn't leave much <br/>
room for him to do anything antagonistic to deserve an attack by the former <br/>
Shogunate's infantry.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at a timeline of the actions of the lords of Utsunomiya throughout <br/>
history, I found the following: Toda Tadatomo was, on the 15th of the 3rd <br/>
month of Meiji 1 (1868), in Otsu, on his way to Kyoto, to transmit Tokugawa <br/>
Yoshinobu's apologies to the Imperial Court, when he was arrested and <br/>
detained. Utsunomiya was thus left lordless, until the 6th of the 4th month, <br/>
when his predecessor, Toda Tadayuki, returned to Utsunomiya from Edo, and <br/>
officially submitted to the new government.<br/>
<br/>
This answered my question of why exactly Hijikata and Otori attacked him. <br/>
But I read further-- about a week after Tadayuki returned, a peasant riot (a <br/>
"yonaoshi-ikki", as it's known in Japanese) broke out, and hard on the heels <br/>
of the riots, only a handful of days later, Hijikata and Otori arrived and <br/>
took the castle on the 19th of the 4th month. However, the new government <br/>
attacked Utsunomiya Castle a handful of days later, on the 23rd. Years <br/>
later, Otori wrote an account of the events, which was published in the <br/>
magazine "Kyu Bakufu" in Meiji 32, in which he said that Hijikata was <br/>
injured in the toes and subsequently taken to the Higashiyama hotsprings <br/>
within the Aizu domain for treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Just a little example of the level of detail that I am beginning to discover <br/>
in my research on the Bakumatsu.<br/>
