<h3>upcoming movie &quot;IZO&quot;</h3>

<br/>
This isn't a historical film, which would be categorized as fantastic.<br/>
Izo Okada, one of famous assassin from Tosa, manipulated by Hanpeita Takechi, <br/>
was executed by the people of his domain in 1865. He was crucified and <br/>
pierced by spears.( Historical Izo is beheaded though) After death, as a revengeful <br/>
ghost, Izo's soul possesses the body of a homeless living in present-day <br/>
Tokyo.<br/>
Became a killing machine, Izo transcends between space-time to slay everyone <br/>
who cuts off his way.<br/>
<br/>
I think this film would be very violent and bloody one a la Miike, and <br/>
perhaps recommendable for only fans of the genre. Nevertheless, this film has also <br/>
few Shinsengumi appearance and casts many stars like Takeshi Kitano( not as <br/>
Hijikata this time. LOL)or Ryuhei Matsuda.<br/>
