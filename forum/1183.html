<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797783849">I'm guess here...Toshiyoshi Kawaji is the one right in the <br/>
middle...same hair do and the shape of the face is a perfect <br/>
match...wearing a suit...man all of his friends/family from Satsuma <br/>
must've hated him...<br/>
By the way the only dates I have of Toshiyoshi Kawaji is 1836-<br/>
1879...pretty short life...<br/>
<br/>
I've found neat info on the armories in Tokyo/Osaka...they imported <br/>
guns and started "converting" them right before the Seinan <br/>
War...details will show up in my essay<br/>
<br/>
If you have a hard time believing that Miki can scare off some <br/>
robbers then you'll have to download one of the sensei vids at <br/>
http://www.kendovj.com...the guy is 81...and you don't want to go up <br/>
against him in a match @_@...very calm and reflexes are sharp<br/>

 <br/>
I thought 1879 was when he retired.  I may have just assumed that ages ago, not realizing he had died.  Anyway, the way RK Kawaji smokes and practically hyperventilates over everything in both the manga and the anime, I wouldn't be surprised if he keeled over with a heart attack.  The real man must've seen few nights of sleep trying to organize and regulate the new police force in such troubled and changing times... think of all the animosities he must've had to deal with with so many former samurai in the ranks.  (Okay, let's see... we've got to keep that Suzuki fellow away from *anyone* with Shinsengumi connections... it's easy to joke about now, but I have to think he had to keep things like that in mind.)  <br/>
 <br/>
I developed an admiration for the man from the first I started looking for info on him.  He seemed to leave his own prior loyalties on the back burner in favor of creating something beneficial for all of Japan. I really do wonder how difficult it was for him to have to go against Saigou...  I sometimes feel like it might not have bothered him too much considering the threat Saigou posed to the new government.  Like I said, his actions speak more of man concerned with the larger picture, not just who won the war.  Even Katsura was fed up by the end.<br/>

 <br/>
It's my luck Sagara's in there somewhere, just not identified (though he did seem to stick to his home ground of Edo and vicinity).  Now, if someone speaks up and tells me I've missed seeing Kojima Masamitsu in that large print, I'll be going back to bed and trying again tomorrow.  ;-D<br/>

This photograph is entire imitation. <br/>
Although sold at the tourist resort in Kagoshima as a photograph of <br/>

Since the foreign teacher who was present in Nagasaki went to Edo, <br/>
the students held the farewell party. <br/>
This is a photograph at that time. Bakumatsu shishi is completely <br/>

The Ryoma Sakamoto memorial hall in Kochi city has concluded that <br/>
this is imitation. And the ryozen museum in Kyoto is the same <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
To be sure, if their position is considered, it will be a strange <br/>
talk that Katsu Kaisyu and Takasugi Shinsaku are together. <br/>
However, katsu was the teacher of Sakamoto Ryoma and Saigo Takamori <br/>
was an acquaintance. <br/>
Takasugi were also Sakamoto and an acquaintance. <br/>
When it was their mediation, possibly two persons might meet. <br/>
(Therefore, those who are deceived and buy this photograph appear.) <br/>
<br/>
It is that Takasugi Shinsaku died in April, 1867.<br/>
When this photograph was a thing in 1865, he was still alive.<br/>
<br/>
Katsu negotiated for the armistice of Chosyu and the Tokugawa <br/>
government in 1867. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And it is strange that Emperor Meiji is in this photograph as you <br/>
say. <br/>
If the status distinctions at the time are considered, this will be <br/>
an impossible talk absolutely. <br/>
Furthermore, although this was a digression, Emperor Meiji abhorred <br/>
the photograph. <br/>
His vassals were troubled whenever the Emperor's photograph was <br/>
needed on friendliness with a foreign country, after becoming Meiji <br/>
Era. <br/>
Incidentally, Saigo also disliked the photograph. <br/>
Now, there is no photograph decided as a photograph of Saigo. <br/>
<br/>
A certain historian announced to the magazine this photograph as a <br/>
photograph of Ishin shishi in 1895. <br/>
Although judged as the photograph which is completely different as a <br/>
result of investigation, in addition to this, there was such an <br/>
example. <br/>
Now, the photograph which we know as a photograph of Hijikata <br/>
Toshizou was believed to be the samurai Hijikata Hisamoto of a Tosa <br/>
domain by people of Meiji Era. <br/>
It was published as a photograph of Hijikata Hisamoto by the person <br/>
dictionary of the time. <br/>
And it was sold as a photograph of Hisamoto. <br/>
(This will not be based on malice and is a simple mistake.) <br/>
Hisamoto played an active part in the alliance of Satsuma and <br/>
Chosyu. <br/>
He became a minister after becoming Meiji Era. <br/>
And he is one of the vassals who worried about Emperor Meiji's <br/>
photograph dislike.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not know why they disliked the photograph. <br/>
When the photograph was imported to Japan, there was rumor that soul <br/>
was sucked up by it. <br/>
(Although Kondou has hidden both hands in the photograph, it is said <br/>
that that is behavior not to take a soul.)<br/>
There was a custom which exchanges the Royal Family's photograph in <br/>
each country at the time. <br/>
Although Emperor Meiji took the photograph in Meiji 6, he did not <br/>
take a photograph at all for 15 years after that. <br/>
And the request came from the foreign country, saying "We desire His <br/>
Majesty's latest photograph." .<br/>

remembered that the king Rama V was the person respected as a wise <br/>

Unlike Japan of a maritime power, it is surmised that friendly <br/>
relations with a foreign country were probably important for <br/>
continental Thailand. <br/>

<br/>
"Simple mistake" means not being a political intrigue. <br/>
for me, it is a big mistake (probably, you too).<br/>
Probably, people of Meiji Era would not imagine the photograph with <br/>
which Hijikata of Shinsengumi wore the France military uniform. <br/>

<br/>
This is the fact which must be accepted although I dislike Saigou. <br/>
Although the Chosyu side wanted to surely execute Tokugawa <br/>
Yoshinobu, Saigou is the talks with Katsu and it promised to help <br/>
Yoshinobu. <br/>
Probably, the Tokugawa side continued resistance more, if Saigou <br/>
asserted execution of Yoshinobu strongly. <br/>
(Katsu was actually making the preparations which burn down Edo.) <br/>
Probably, it must have developed into Britain and the proxy war of <br/>
France. <br/>
Britain sided with Satsuma and Chosyu and France was siding with the <br/>
Tokugawa government. <br/>

Konnichiwa Tama san! <br/>
I think it very strange to speak to you in English. <br/>
(Watashi no mechakucha na eigo wo anata ga akireteiru nodehanaikato <br/>
dokidoki shite imashita.) <br/>
Although I am not going to write the information on false, it is a <br/>
fact that information is also a little partial. <br/>
Since you who are a Japanese Shinsengumi fan are, I am very <br/>
relieved. <br/>
<br/>
Does Tama san live in the Tama area? <br/>
It is imagination from a name. <br/>
