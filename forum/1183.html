<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797783849">I&#39;m guess here...Toshiyoshi Kawaji is the one right in the <br/>
middle...same hair do and the shape of the face is a perfect <br/>
match...wearing a suit...man all of his friends/family from Satsuma <br/>
must&#39;ve hated him...<br/>
By the way the only dates I have of Toshiyoshi Kawaji is 1836-<br/>
1879...pretty short life...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found neat info on the armories in Tokyo/Osaka...they imported <br/>
guns and started &quot;converting&quot; them right before the Seinan <br/>
War...details will show up in my essay<br/>
<br/>
If you have a hard time believing that Miki can scare off some <br/>
robbers then you&#39;ll have to download one of the sensei vids at <br/>
http://www.kendovj.com...the guy is 81...and you don&#39;t want to go up <br/>
against him in a match @_@...very calm and reflexes are sharp<br/>

 <br/>
I thought 1879 was when he retired.  I may have just assumed that ages ago, not realizing he had died.  Anyway, the way RK Kawaji smokes and practically hyperventilates over everything in both the manga and the anime, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he keeled over with a heart attack.  The real man must&#39;ve seen few nights of sleep trying to organize and regulate the new police force in such troubled and changing times... think of all the animosities he must&#39;ve had to deal with with so many former samurai in the ranks.  (Okay, let&#39;s see... we&#39;ve got to keep that Suzuki fellow away from *anyone* with Shinsengumi connections... it&#39;s easy to joke about now, but I have to think he had to keep things like that in mind.)  <br/>
 <br/>
I developed an admiration for the man from the first I started looking for info on him.  He seemed to leave his own prior loyalties on the back burner in favor of creating something beneficial for all of Japan. I really do wonder how difficult it was for him to have to go against Saigou...  I sometimes feel like it might not have bothered him too much considering the threat Saigou posed to the new government.  Like I said, his actions speak more of man concerned with the larger picture, not just who won the war.  Even Katsura was fed up by the end.<br/>

 <br/>
It&#39;s my luck Sagara&#39;s in there somewhere, just not identified (though he did seem to stick to his home ground of Edo and vicinity).  Now, if someone speaks up and tells me I&#39;ve missed seeing Kojima Masamitsu in that large print, I&#39;ll be going back to bed and trying again tomorrow.  ;-D<br/>

Although I was not going to come here, there is something to tell <br/>
about this subject. <br/>
<br/>
This photograph is entire imitation. <br/>
Although sold at the tourist resort in Kagoshima as a photograph of <br/>
Bakumatsu shishi, investigation shows that they are the samurais of <br/>
the Saga domain in fact. <br/>
Since the foreign teacher who was present in Nagasaki went to Edo, <br/>
the students held the farewell party. <br/>
This is a photograph at that time. Bakumatsu shishi is completely <br/>
unrelated.<br/>
The Ryoma Sakamoto memorial hall in Kochi city has concluded that <br/>
this is imitation. And the ryozen museum in Kyoto is the same <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
To be sure, if their position is considered, it will be a strange <br/>
talk that Katsu Kaisyu and Takasugi Shinsaku are together. <br/>
However, katsu was the teacher of Sakamoto Ryoma and Saigo Takamori <br/>
was an acquaintance. <br/>
Takasugi were also Sakamoto and an acquaintance. <br/>
When it was their mediation, possibly two persons might meet. <br/>
(Therefore, those who are deceived and buy this photograph appear.) <br/>
<br/>
It is that Takasugi Shinsaku died in April, 1867.<br/>
When this photograph was a thing in 1865, he was still alive.<br/>
<br/>
Katsu negotiated for the armistice of Chosyu and the Tokugawa <br/>
government in 1867. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And it is strange that Emperor Meiji is in this photograph as you <br/>
say. <br/>
If the status distinctions at the time are considered, this will be <br/>
an impossible talk absolutely. <br/>
Furthermore, although this was a digression, Emperor Meiji abhorred <br/>
the photograph. <br/>
His vassals were troubled whenever the Emperor&#39;s photograph was <br/>
needed on friendliness with a foreign country, after becoming Meiji <br/>
Era. <br/>
Incidentally, Saigo also disliked the photograph. <br/>
Now, there is no photograph decided as a photograph of Saigo. <br/>
<br/>
A certain historian announced to the magazine this photograph as a <br/>
photograph of Ishin shishi in 1895. <br/>
Although judged as the photograph which is completely different as a <br/>
result of investigation, in addition to this, there was such an <br/>
example. <br/>
Now, the photograph which we know as a photograph of Hijikata <br/>
Toshizou was believed to be the samurai Hijikata Hisamoto of a Tosa <br/>
domain by people of Meiji Era. <br/>
It was published as a photograph of Hijikata Hisamoto by the person <br/>
dictionary of the time. <br/>
And it was sold as a photograph of Hisamoto. <br/>
(This will not be based on malice and is a simple mistake.) <br/>
Hisamoto played an active part in the alliance of Satsuma and <br/>
Chosyu. <br/>
He became a minister after becoming Meiji Era. <br/>
And he is one of the vassals who worried about Emperor Meiji&#39;s <br/>
photograph dislike.<br/>
<br/>

Toshizou.) <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; belief?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not know why they disliked the photograph. <br/>
When the photograph was imported to Japan, there was rumor that soul <br/>
was sucked up by it. <br/>
(Although Kondou has hidden both hands in the photograph, it is said <br/>
that that is behavior not to take a soul.)<br/>
There was a custom which exchanges the Royal Family&#39;s photograph in <br/>
each country at the time. <br/>
Although Emperor Meiji took the photograph in Meiji 6, he did not <br/>
take a photograph at all for 15 years after that. <br/>
And the request came from the foreign country, saying &quot;We desire His <br/>
Majesty&#39;s latest photograph.&quot; .<br/>

remembered that the king Rama V was the person respected as a wise <br/>
king who promoted modernization of Thailand. <br/>
Unlike Japan of a maritime power, it is surmised that friendly <br/>
relations with a foreign country were probably important for <br/>
continental Thailand. <br/>

&quot;Simple mistake&quot; means not being a political intrigue. <br/>
for me, it is a big mistake (probably, you too).<br/>
Probably, people of Meiji Era would not imagine the photograph with <br/>
which Hijikata of Shinsengumi wore the France military uniform. <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider<br/>
&gt; Saigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also<br/>
&gt; plenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo<br/>
&gt; Takamori, who could have understood the plea of<br/>
&gt; Yamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; Edo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were<br/>
&gt; good men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin<br/>
&gt; side,<br/>
&gt; as well as bad men in both, IMHO :)&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And just possibly Saigou is an example of how a man<br/>
&gt; could be both good AND bad... a human condition.<br/>
<br/>
This is the fact which must be accepted although I dislike Saigou. <br/>
Although the Chosyu side wanted to surely execute Tokugawa <br/>
Yoshinobu, Saigou is the talks with Katsu and it promised to help <br/>
Yoshinobu. <br/>
Probably, the Tokugawa side continued resistance more, if Saigou <br/>
asserted execution of Yoshinobu strongly. <br/>
(Katsu was actually making the preparations which burn down Edo.) <br/>
Probably, it must have developed into Britain and the proxy war of <br/>
France. <br/>
Britain sided with Satsuma and Chosyu and France was siding with the <br/>
Tokugawa government. <br/>

I think it very strange to speak to you in English. <br/>

Although I am not going to write the information on false, it is a <br/>
fact that information is also a little partial. <br/>
Since you who are a Japanese Shinsengumi fan are, I am very <br/>
relieved. <br/>
<br/>
Does Tama san live in the Tama area? <br/>
It is imagination from a name. <br/>
