<h3>Shura No Toki Screencaps</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-263834469">Shura No Toki is an anime based on a manga.<br/>
So far the hero, Yakumo (has some interesting personality quirks) has <br/>
only encountered Musashi and the first volume DVD (available in the <br/>
U.S.) is still not done with this story.<br/>
The strength in this anime is the action scenes, barehanded combat <br/>
the hero uses...it is very clear that the director has some trouble <br/>
doing swordfight scenes and the animation is choppy at times...I <br/>
still don't understand how the hero is supposed to live into the next <br/>
eras to encounter 3 more master swordsmen before getting to...OKITA<br/>
the anime is taking a really long time to "warm up" and at times I <br/>
felt like fast forwarding some scenes...the show is for a younger <br/>
audience clearly...but I am still hopeful that it gets better ::soon::<br/>

<h3>OT question - going to Japan</h3>
by <i>enma_o</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-172554033">Sorry to bother you guys with this, but this was the only forum I could think of to get advice... <br/>
<br/>
My boyfriend and I are planning a trip to Japan sometime during this year. At first we'd planned to go in mid-May to early June, but now because of various factors, I'm having second thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
So my question for those who've been to Japan (I know there are a few) is: What time would you think is best for the trip? May-June as above, or early autumn (probably September)? Mostly in terms of weather and chance to catch interesting festivals and such (we'll be travelling all over Japan) but also prices/chances of getting hotel rooms, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you really feel like helping out, you can answer another burning question... is there such a thing as public laundromats in Japan?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any answers!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a general reply is carried out, I will think that the travel to <br/>
Japan is best to carry out in May. <br/>
May has many fine days and temperature is warm. <br/>
Although April has many fine days, it is still somewhat cold in a <br/>
north area. <br/>
June is the rainy season. <br/>
However, since Hokkaido does not have the rainy season, it is OK <br/>
also in this season. <br/>
July and August are hot and they are moist.<br/>
Although September and October are warm, there are many typhoons. <br/>
In a southern area, it may become serious damage.<br/>
However, October is a season good for a travel. <br/>
If the travel in May is impossible, the end in September and the <br/>
beginning of October are good seasons. <br/>
It is cold from November till March. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Many festivals are held in various places.<br/>
What kind of thing do you want to see? <br/>
Is it the relation of Shinsengumi? <br/>
Or is it the other famous festival? <br/>
<br/>
The festival which should be introduced to you depending on your <br/>
answer changes. <br/>
It is assumed that it is in May that you come to Japan.<br/>
Since there will be Hijikata's deathday May, a festival is performed <br/>
in the Hino city.<br/>
<br/>
(All pages are the bans on unapproved reproduction.) <br/>
<br/>
Hino Shinsengumi matsuri (Hino Shinsengumi festival)<br/>
Every year, this is held on the 2nd Saturday and Sunday. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since it is also in May that the Hakodate war ended, a festival is <br/>
performed in Hakodate.<br/>
<br/>
Hakodate Goryoukaku sai (Hakodate Goryoukaku festival)<br/>
Every year, this is held on the 3rd Saturday and Sunday. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, my reply is different if you are wanted to see not these <br/>
but the festival which has history more. <br/>
Probably, in Kyoto, the festival with 1000 years of history is held <br/>
at the almost same time as those festivals. <br/>
<br/>
Aoi matsuri (Aoi festival)<br/>
Every year, this is held on May 15. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/index11.htm">http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/index11.htm</a><br/>
(Since music sounds, be careful.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The festival which exists from the Edo period is held in the <br/>
downtown area in Tokyo on the same day. <br/>
<br/>
Kanda matsuri (Kanda festival)<br/>
This will be held on May 14 and the 15th this year. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/kan1.htm">http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/kan1.htm</a> <br/>
(Since music sounds, be careful.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the festival which has the origin of the Edo period in <br/>
Sendai is held. <br/>
<br/>
aoba matsuri (aoba festival)<br/>
This will be held on May 14 and the 15th this year. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sakura.mond.jp/aoba16/16aoba1.htm">http://sakura.mond.jp/aoba16/16aoba1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably, the oldest temple in Tokyo is holding the big festival. <br/>
<br/>
sanjya-matsuri (sanjya festival)<br/>
This is unknown for details.<br/>
This holds after May 15. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/san1.htm">http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/san1.htm</a><br/>
(Since music sounds, be careful.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably, Kyoto is carrying out the graceful festival. <br/>
<br/>
Mifune matsuri (Mifune festival)<br/>
Every year, this is held on the 3rd Saturday and Sunday. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/ben-yama/2-mifune.htm">http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/ben-yama/2-mifune.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A shrine famous as God of learning also holds a festival. <br/>
<br/>
Yushimatenmangu taisai (Yushimatenmangu big festival)<br/>
Every year, this is held on May 25. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://junko55.web.infoseek.co.jp/02maturi/0405yusima1.htm">http://junko55.web.infoseek.co.jp/02maturi/0405yusima1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In others, the famous festival called Hakata Dontaku to beginning in <br/>
May is held in Kyushu. <br/>
Every year, this will be held on May 2 and the 3rd. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kasane.jp/tamasudare/dontaku2004/parade1/index.html">http://www.kasane.jp/tamasudare/dontaku2004/parade1/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you need it, I will do the festival of other seasons, and <br/>
introduction of a tourist resort.<br/>
<br/>
The charge of a hotel is really various.<br/>
About it, I do not have a good opinion. <br/>
<br/>
Laundromat is in the city section. <br/>
However, a district without it also exists. <br/>

If you are in Tokyo there are many cool places to visit (according <br/>
to the books I have)...major museums and UENO PARK and Ueno Library <br/>
(Higuchi Ichiyo's favorite library)...but won't you visit<br/>
<br/>
Ichiyo Shiryokan?  "Ichiyo Museum" dedicated to Higuchi Ichiyo it is <br/>
filled with Meiji era artifacts and its only a hop skip and a jump <br/>
away from the BUNKYO Furusato Rekishikan "Bunkyo Museum" which has <br/>
ancient Yayoi/Jomon pottery and an interactive display which allows <br/>
you to see pics/replicas of daily life in the Bunkyo Ward during the <br/>
Meiji Era (every reference to Bunkyo ward includes the author's <br/>
complaint about the hills there)<br/>

{{maps}} pics, famous murderess stories from the era, Rokumeikan info<br/>
on the Higuchi Ichiyo map you will see the name "Mori Ogai" one of <br/>
many guy friends of Higuchi Ichiyo, he was a prominent literary <br/>
figure and there is a memorial for him at the Bunkyo Ward Library<br/>
<br/>
The map will also point out "Yoshiwara" red-light district which was <br/>
visited by GENERAL GRANT in 1879...Higuchi Ichiyo made some extra <br/>
money and friends by writing love letters for the ladies of Yoshiwara<br/>
<br/>
***Lafcadio Hearn*** ALSO taught at Tokyo Imperial University during <br/>
this time period....his compilation of ghost stories from the <br/>
countryside can be viewed on the DVD "KAIDAN" directd by Masaki <br/>

If anyone has a pic of dolls decorated with chrysanthemum flowers <br/>
please let me know...it was supposed to be a famous craft from <br/>

Probably, I found such a site that is helpful to you. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lgj-net.com/">http://lgj-net.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Shinsengumi-related festival to be held in September has Aizu <br/>
autumn festival, as Sec wrote. <br/>
<br/>
Aidu aki matsuri (Aizu autumn festival)<br/>
Every year, this is held from September 22 to the 24th. <br/>
25 days and 26 days were Shinsengumi festivals last year. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rakuten.co.jp/aizu/447910/567019/">http://www.rakuten.co.jp/aizu/447910/567019/</a><br/>
<br/>
About this festival, you should ask Tama-san or Kamo-san. <br/>
They know well about it rather than me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a result of investigating the festival of holding in September, <br/>
probably I think in Kyoto that there is no big festival. <br/>
If it will become in October, two of them exist. <br/>
<br/>
Fushimi matsuri (Fushimi festival)  The first half of October<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://miyakoweb.at.infoseek.co.jp/hanagasa/turezure.htm">http://miyakoweb.at.infoseek.co.jp/hanagasa/turezure.htm</a><br/>
(Music sounds)<br/>
<br/>
Jidai matsuri (Time festival)  October 22<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www11.tok2.com/home/happy21/jidai/jidai03.html">http://www11.tok2.com/home/happy21/jidai/jidai03.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A big festival is held in Kamakura city, Kanagawa. <br/>
<br/>
Tsurugaoka Hachimangu rei taisai (Tsurugaoka Hachimangu big <br/>
festival)  Every year, this is held from September 14 to the 16th. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ancient city Kamakura is the place where the samurai government was <br/>
born at the very beginning. <br/>
It is a place wonderful also not only as the festival but a tourist <br/>
resort.<br/>
However, this place has "Yoshitsune" and the relation which are a <br/>
Taiga drama this year.<br/>
Every year, many tourists visit the place which is related to a <br/>
Taiga drama.<br/>
Many tourists may come rather than usual.-_-<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The very violent festival is held in Kishiwada city, Osaka. <br/>
<br/>
Kishiwada danjiri matsuri (Kishiwada danjiri festival)  Every year, <br/>
this is held from September 14 to the 15th. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A big festival is held in the shrine in Tokyo. <br/>
<br/>
Nedu gongen matsuri (Nezu avatar festival)  This is held on Saturday <br/>
and Sunday near on September 21.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bunkyo-tky.ed.jp/kiki/bunkyou/07omatsuri/m-013.htm">http://www.bunkyo-tky.ed.jp/kiki/bunkyou/07omatsuri/m-013.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
A good photograph site was not found.-_-<br/>
I think that it will be a big festival because it is compared with <br/>
the Kanda festival.<br/>
 <br/>
Incidentally this place is close to the former site of the Higuchi <br/>
Ichiyo house which Sec is writing. <br/>
(However, you will walk for a while.) <br/>
Higuchi Ichiyo house:The 70th Hongo kikusaka-cho<br/>
(Present 4-32, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo.)<br/>
And Saitou lived in the neighborhood.<br/>
Saitou's house:The 30th Hongo Masago-cho<br/>
(The present outskirts of 4-14, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo.)<br/>
However, most things of those days do not remain around here. <br/>

<br/>
If you walk for a while from there, there is Koishikawa Dentsuin <br/>
(temple).<br/>
This is the place where Roushis which go to Kyoto gathered. <br/>
Koishikawa Dentsuin: 3-14-6, Koishikawa, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo.<br/>

This is the place where the samurais of Mito Tengutou were executed <br/>
as a rebel army. <br/>
(Serizawa Kamo had joined Mito Tengutou before Shinsengumi.)<br/>
Moreover, the shrine where it is related to Abeno Seimei (Onmyouji) <br/>
is located in this town. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The festival which continues from the Edo period is held in Hanamaki <br/>
city, Iwate. <br/>
<br/>
Hanamaki matsuri (Hanamaki festival)  This festival is held from <br/>
September 9 to the 11th this year. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.city.hanamaki.iwate.jp/main/matsuri/matsuriindex.htm">http://www.city.hanamaki.iwate.jp/main/matsuri/matsuriindex.htm</a><br/>

<br/>
Hanamaki is famous as Novelist's Miyazawa Kenji hometown. <br/>
There are the theme park and building like a fairy tale of his <br/>
image. <br/>
And there are many hot spring resorts here. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there is a festival on the schedule near it even in Tono-shi, <br/>
Iwate. <br/>
<br/>
Tono matsuri (Tono festival)   Every year, this festival is held <br/>
from September 13 to the 15th. <br/>
However, it held also on September 18 and the 19th in 2004. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage.mac.com/nanshoji/e.html">http://homepage.mac.com/nanshoji/e.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This is a place famous for having many folktales. <br/>
If you want to see the scene of the country in Japan, I will <br/>
recommend to go here. <br/>
Although there is no famous temple etc., it is a quiet and very good <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
Since Hanamaki and Tono are near, if you are going to go to either, <br/>
I will recommend going to both. <br/>
Moreover, the famous temple representing the culture of the north <br/>
side of Japan called a Chusonji temple is near this. <br/>

to Kyoto (for obvious reasons).<br/>
<br/>
If you come to Aizu Wakamatsu, don't forget to visit<br/>
the Museums. Although they are mainly focused on the<br/>
Byakkotai (for obvious reasons), there are plenty of<br/>
stuff about the Shinsengumi and related people,<br/>
including, but not limited to, a picture of Takagi<br/>
Morinosuke, copy of letters by Kondo Isami et al. ^^<br/>
