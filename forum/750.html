<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103099649">You people probably already know about this but for those who do not <br/>
PBS is going to air Japan: Memoirs of a Secret Empire. I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how many episodes it is but so far I think they will show three on <br/>
WTTW Chicago on May 26 8PM. You&#39;ll have to check your own listings <br/>
though...<br/>
<br/>
They also have a nicely done website tacking the subject divided <br/>
into &quot;Enter Edo&quot;, &quot;Travel Tokaido&quot; and a timeline... Good if you&#39;re <br/>
like me who needed a crash course.... ^_^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545564451">What would be *really* cool is if this happened to be a prelude, an <br/>
introduction, to PBS picking up the NHK drama.  Anyone got any PBS <br/>
connections??  :-D<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the heads-up and the link!!  With my luck, KAET has <br/>
already started showing it (or shown it).<br/>

phil (who&#39;s spent the whole afternoon writing thanks to that stupid <br/>
movie and will try to keep it a one-shot story and NOT start another <br/>
multi-parter)<br/>
