<h3>Shinsengumi March Map + Guns</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666309599">Hello to our new buddies Maria k and okushow01 (^_^)<br/>
Nobody should worry about their English writing ability---after all<br/>
many of us here cannot<br/>
read Japanese and here we are being devoted fans of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa translated this for us <br/>
The Shinsengumi March<br/>

<br/>
The map of their "parade" (ok parade is not the right word LOL!) is<br/>
dated [1864] <br/>
so this appears as a link on<br/>

<br/>
(fangirl moment) so if Gintama Shinsengumi had a parade would they all<br/>
be in their squard cars, on their mopeds and motorcycles? LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed how this document is evidence of Shinsengumi using guns.<br/>
<br/>
[1864] The Shinsengumi March showing rifles and cannons<br/>
<br/>
[1865] (reference point) The Choshu Kiheitai and their modern weapons<br/>
article will mention Kido Takayoshi, Tosa and Thomas Glover<br/>

[1867]  "...several  Shinsengumi absconded from Kyoto because of their<br/>
resentment at <br/>
orders to adopt firearms. Three days later a serious confrontation<br/>
occurred in the city <br/>
between about two hundred pike-carrying city patrols (Mimawari) and<br/>
perhaps a battalion <br/>
of infantry (hohei) armed with rifles. After several hours of tension<br/>
the deployed forces were <br/>
quieted and no serious damage was done...The Shinsengumi was one of<br/>
the most vigorously <br/>
loyal patrol groups in Kyoto, and its men were fiercely proud of their<br/>
function and capacity." <br/>
(Totman 359)<br/>
<br/>
[1868.2] Hijikata obtains "state-of-the-art breech-loading rifles" for the<br/>
Shinsengumi. (Hillsborough Shinsengumi 143)<br/>
<br/>
[1868] E. Schnell (think of him as the Thomas Glover of the bakufu forces)<br/>
had sold weapons to Aizu and allies of that domain.  Aizu samurai were<br/>
already trained<br/>
to use guns and canons earlier.  The Yamamoto family history clearly<br/>
shows that pro-bakufu<br/>
forces were interested in this technology.  I think Hirotada Tokugawa<br/>
had mentioned the Nagaoka rifle unit.<br/>
<br/>
[1868 end of summer early fall]  Saitou Hajime (now Yamaguchi Hajime)<br/>
saved Oshima Torao, <br/>
during his retreating, using small arms fire.<br/>
<br/>
[1868] ofcourse at Hakodate, under Hijikata Toshizo, the Shinsengumi<br/>
also used guns/cannons etc<br/>
<br/>
So if you read a text that says that samurai abhorred the use of guns,<br/>
think of these<br/>
examples.  Every side which could afford guns used them.  Going much<br/>
farther back in time,<br/>
feudal warfare in Japan, China and Southeast Asia has always<br/>
incorporated these tools.<br/>

---------------------------------<br/>
shinsengumihq.com was recently hacked.  If you're curious this is how<br/>
the server<br/>
entry page looked like<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/SHQ/SHQhackers.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/SHQ/SHQhackers.jpg</a><br/>
The site did go down for a while but it was the inability to enter the<br/>
server and check on files<br/>
which was worrisome---anyways everything seems ok (I think--only one<br/>
page had missing data).  <br/>
I can't wait to see how the new "look" of the site will be after a<br/>
professional designer<br/>
shows her work.  So in the next few weeks the site will be upgraded.<br/>
