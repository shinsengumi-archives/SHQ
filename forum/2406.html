<h3>Review of a manga &quot;Hinata no ookami&quot;</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27845482">Warning! This post contains some spoilers. <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve told already about this manga, but I&#39;m not sure if I posted here <br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about the manga of Misaki Saitou about Shinsengumi &quot;Hinata no <br/>
Ookami&quot;(Wolves in the sunshine) that I&#39;ve just read the 2nd volume recently come <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I put the links to amazon.jp for volumes published for those who might have <br/>
interest.<br/>

<br/>
I guess many of you can&#39;t accept the character design, especially for <br/>
strangely effeminate look Hijikata.<br/>
Yes, the guy with long straight hair on the cover isn&#39;t other than him. <br/>
Myself, when I saw the image for the first time, I thought the guy would be Okita.<br/>
But he isn&#39;t. Okita, who is usually described as a bish, is a tall and <br/>
&quot;flatfish like&quot; face guy in this manga, and that would be more real. <br/>
Anyway, the artist said she has changed deliberately the design of Hijikata, <br/>
that meant she didn&#39;t care the famous photo or historical look of him.<br/>
<br/>
The other main characters you know well having rather modern hairstyle and no <br/>
one has shaved hair or topknot.<br/>
However, after being shocked by those character designs, I can notice that <br/>
this manga is not so eccentric as Shinsengumi manga.<br/>
I can say this one is rather &quot;classic&quot; of the genre, I mean more &quot;historical <br/>
&quot;or serious than what we can imagine from the first impression.<br/>
There are many well known episodes and details like the fire at Honjo juku on <br/>
the way to Kyoto, Serizawa and Oume etc.<br/>
Currently, the Roushitai has arrived at Kyoto and Shieikan people and <br/>
Serizawa group decided to stay despite Kiyokawa&#39;s plot.<br/>
<br/>
That is by no means yaoi type manga ( I think) , however seeing Serizawa <br/>
drunken asking Hijikata to sit on his lap, or that same Serizawa commenting on <br/>
Hijikata who has killed a man for the first time, that he (Hijikata) looked like <br/>
a young girl who had just lost her virginity, made me laugh a lot.<br/>
The story become strangely fascinating after all and now, after recent <br/>
disappointment with PMK which has been unfortunately stopped, I have another <br/>
interesting Shinsengumi manga to be continued. <br/>
And I&#39;m looking forward to see appearance of some characters from now on. ( <br/>
Some of you could guess who)<br/>
<br/>
Tama<br/>

First row--Kondo (WHY is he always an old guy?), Okita<br/>
back row left to right, Harada, Saitou, Todo (looking rather Itou-ish), <br/>
Nagakura<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She (the artist) said in that photo, she can see clearer Fujita&#39;s eye <br/>
than other same photo she had ever seen.<br/>
She has been a big fan of Saito since long time and her pseudonym Saito <br/>
was taken from him, she said.<br/>
Saito appears in the volume 2.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s really difficult to guess who&#39;s who.<br/>
First row Kondo (Barb is right), Hijikata (!)<br/>
back row left to right, Okita(!), Todo, Saitou(Yes!), Nagakura, Harada <br/>
(You know,hisotrical Harada had been known as a very handsome man!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; I guess Tama is waiting for Yamanami?  (^_^)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yamanami has already appeared in the manga, and he looks like rather a <br/>
kindly father too!<br/>
I&#39;m waiting for Ito and Goryoeji group people but that would take more <br/>
time from now on.<br/>
<br/>
Probably I&#39;ll upload some scanned images for a while to give some idea <br/>
of this manga.<br/>
