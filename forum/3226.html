<h3>Fujita Tsutomu&#39;s birth</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106389118">Yamakawa Hiroshi, the former Aizu retainer who was a close friend of Saitou <br/>
Hajime (Fujita Gorou), wrote a poem on the occasion of Goro's son Tsutomu's <br/>
birth. I can't quite make out the meaning-- it plays off his name <br/>
"tsutomu"-- which means "to work [hard]," and exhorts him to grow into a <br/>
distinguished man, but I wanted to share it in transliterated form.<br/>
<br/>
Tsutometefu<br/>
Na ni somukasu wa<br/>
yakate yoni<br/>
takaku tsutomu no<br/>
tatasareme ya wa<br/>

If people want to learn more about Yamakawa Hiroshi they can visit<br/>
http://www.shinsengumihq.com/aizu1868yamakawa.html<br/>
<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi was also close to Takagi/Fujita Tokio's brother <br/>
Morinusuke and was also a co-worker of Tokio's cousin Takamine Hideo <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>

------INFORMATION------<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
The first novel featuring the Shinsengumi to be translated from <br/>
Japanese to English was Dai-Bosatsu Toge (multiple spellings on the <br/>
name) or GREAT BODHISATTVA PASS by C.S. Bavier<br/>
<br/>
You can learn more here: http://www.shinsengumihq.com/dbt.html<br/>
We have a youtube vid that's more like a vlog about the novel at our <br/>
account:<br/>
http://www.youtube.com/shinsengumihq<br/>
<br/>
----BUT----<br/>
<br/>
78 years later, with Shinsengumi fandom now permanently established <br/>
in the WEST...there is yet another NOVEL IN ENGLISH<br/>
(for young adults, sorry no Shinsengumi orgy sex scenes T_T)<br/>
<br/>
This is a historical occasion!  It was written by the great sage and <br/>
unabashed Itou Kashitaro fangirl here on the SHQ ML Chloe Michelle <br/>
(psssst it's really Barbara Sheridan)<br/>
<br/>
I give you MIRROR, MIRROR(http://www.chloemichelle.com)<br/>
See the trailer here (feature SAitou Hajime fanart)<br/>

---------------------------------<br/>
Want to learn about the Meiji ERa but don't have the time or books?<br/>
Like the history but hate the boring?<br/>
Then you NEED<br/>
Ono Suzue: A Man of Talent In The Meiji Era<br/>
free novel---just contact the email on this page to get a copy<br/>
(above 18 readers only please, there is sex/yaoi and mxfxm)<br/>
http://silapajarun.1happyturtle.com/<br/>
<br/>
YES! It stars Fujita Goro (I fictionalized him as Fujita Gorou) and <br/>
he is completely different than what you've seen in other universes<br/>
<br/>
Please read/comment---I need the love/attention (*^_^*)<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
I wanted to take this opportunity to suggest to all fans that<br/>
to keep abreast of new Shinsengumi info on the general web that they <br/>
start a Google alert<br/>
<br/>
using the term Shinsengumi and Shinsengumihq<br/>
http://www.google.com/alerts?hl=en<br/>
<br/>
We also have a fun blog here:<br/>
