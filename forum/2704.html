<h3>Maybe someone here will know</h3>
by <i>michaelcarcana</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-33501901">About two weeks ago I was looking up different words on Jim Breen&#39;s<br/>
WWWJDic and through the google images link I found a Japanese site<br/>
that had hachimaki with the metal bar on them and the makoto kanji.  I<br/>
thought I bookmarked it, but apparently I didn&#39;t.  Does anyone know of<br/>
any sites that have such hachimaki (aside from the anime cosplay<br/>
sites)?  I&#39;ve tried duplicating my search to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
