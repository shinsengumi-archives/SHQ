<h3>A question for our friends in Japan</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-385855133">Perhaps you folks in Japan can help answer this question that came to us <br/>
via a visitor to the SHQ website.<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you know anyone in Japan, that would know about Matsudaira Yasusada? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The question is from Peter Matsudaira who is part of the Matsudaira <br/>
family who were retainers to the Maeda of Kaga.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably, I think that you have said about this person. <br/>

<br/>
He served Maeda Toshinaga who is the daimyo of the 2nd generation of <br/>
the Kaga domain.<br/>
He existed in the last stage of Sengoku period, and the beginning of <br/>
Edo period.<br/>
(From the second half of the 16th century to the first half of the <br/>
17th century.)<br/>
He was the son of the small feudal lord of Mikawa area. <br/>
Although he served Shibata Katsuie at first, since Toyotomi <br/>
Hideyoshi ruined Shibata, he became the retainer of Sassa Narimasa.<br/>
And after Sassa lost at war, he served Maeda Toshinaga. <br/>
In the Sekigahara war in 1600, he helped Toshinaga and did largest <br/>
activity in Maeda&#39;s retainers.<br/>
(In Sekigahara war, Daimyos in Japan was divided into the group of <br/>
Tokugawa and Ishida, and fought. Although Maeda group did not go to <br/>
Sekigahara, they fought with the Niwa group who is an enemy.) <br/>
He was set to karou (The maximum important vassal) of a Kaga domain <br/>
after Maeda Toshinaga died. <br/>
He died in 1620. <br/>
His posterity became the important vassal of Kaga domain. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
By the way, I ask why the questioner knows this person. <br/>
About this man, probably, even if it is a Japanese, almost all <br/>
people do not know. <br/>
(I also got to know this person for the first time.) <br/>
I think that he probably will not be known if it is not the <br/>
investigator of Sengoku period, and the investigator of Maeda <br/>
family. <br/>
But since Sengoku period is the time which is popular more than <br/>
Bakumatsu, many researchers exist^_^<br/>
