<br/>
again, this file is pdf and citations will be right at the <br/>
beginning...for those of you who may use the info for school reports <br/>
please notice that I took the time to include page numbers which you <br/>
can use in direct quotes...<br/>
<br/>
This is the good stuff folks ^_^ complete with pictures and diagrams<br/>
<br/>
People like members of the Shinsengumi and SAitou Hajime especially <br/>
obsessed about this stuff...please download and just skim the <br/>
info...its mind-boggling how technical this field can be....keep in <br/>
mind that Japanese and non-Japanese sword collectors today do not <br/>
necessarily practice martial arts at all...so sometimes their <br/>
understanding of weaponry is limited to a degree and based on modern <br/>
standards (and there are complex established standards some derived <br/>
from old records ofcourse).  Again, I use Saitou as an example, the <br/>
way he appraises swords would be a very personal because he is <br/>
totally looking at the blade as a weapon first and foremost.<br/>
<br/>
It's just fun to take a glimpse into what hobbies these guys had...</div>
