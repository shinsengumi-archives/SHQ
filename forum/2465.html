<h3>Shinsengumi family ties</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-317225223">Thought I'd do my part to outline what I've figured out as far as family and <br/>
regional ties until now:<br/>
<br/>
Kondou Isami-- originally from the same region as Hijikata (Kamiishihara <br/>
village, in Tama). Apparently *would have* adopted Okita as his successor, <br/>
though this never happened and I'm not even sure about the truth of that <br/>
statement.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata Toshizo-- originally from the same region as Kondo (Ishida village, <br/>
in Tama)<br/>
<br/>
Okita Souji-- brother in law Rintaro (adopted into Okita house) was <br/>
originally from the Inoue family-- same Inoue as the 2 brothers <br/>
Genzaburo/Matsugoro<br/>
<br/>
Inoue Genzaburo-- Brother of Inoue Matsugoro (never in Shinsengumi, but <br/>
related). Uncle of Inoue Taisuke (Kondou's page). Related to Inoue (Okita) <br/>
Rintaro.<br/>
<br/>
Tani bros (Mantaro, Sanjuro, Shuuhei/Masatake)-- Taught yari (spear) to <br/>
Harada Sanosuke. Masatake was adopted by Kondou Isami and became Kondou <br/>
Shuuhei.<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of at the moment. Just wanted to do a little bit of <br/>
my part for the time being over here. ^^<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, as we can see, many of these people already knew each other or <br/>
were related to each other waaaaaay before the Kyoto years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635993917">Okita was considered to be (indirectly) Kondou Shuske's "adopted son" (because Okita's <br/>
older sister Mitsu was an adopted daughter of Shuuske in name.) <br/>
<br/>
However, since Okita was the heir and the only son of the Okita Family, Kondo Shuske <br/>
wasn't able to (formally) adopt him even though Okita was raised by both the Okita family <br/>
and the Kondo family. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Kondou Isami would NOT have adopted Okita but he DID name Okita to be the <br/>
fifth master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu after him in 1865.<br/>
