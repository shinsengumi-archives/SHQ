As there are not only Japanese/English but also Korean or Chinese option, you <br/>
can choose the 4th option( from the left side) for Japanese to English. The <br/>
first one is English to Japanese.( Those options are under URL bar)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t yet really compared with the other softs but it seems pretty good. <br/>
