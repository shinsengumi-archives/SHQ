<h3>Schedule of Samurai and other Japanese films... and the Calendar</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083182843">Because I am going to be unemployed for quite some time, I gave <br/>
myself a task (with Barb's permission).  I'm tired of missing films.  <br/>
Are you?  Wish you'd even been aware of them in the first place?  <br/>
It's a relatively simple matter for me to get information about <br/>
what's coming up on certain channels, so I'll be posting a monthly <br/>
heads up on what's coming on.  Look for it on the 15th of each <br/>
month.  I'll also be constantly updating the SHQ Calendar as I gather <br/>
the information.<br/>
<br/>
Because I don't want you to miss out on a chance to see "Sword of <br/>
Doom" tomorrow, this month's list only includes fare from the <br/>
Independent Film Channel (IFC) and the Sundance Channel, the two <br/>
channels that show the most Japanese film I can access.  In future, <br/>
it will also include the HBO & Cinemax family of channels, Showtime & <br/>
The Movie Channel family, and the Starz family.  If anyone has access <br/>
to other cable or dish networks with different channels than these, <br/>
please feel free to join me in keeping our fellow wolves fed with <br/>
Japanese fare.<br/>

<br/>
Below is a listing of films being shown on US cable channels from <br/>
March 21, 2004 to April 20, 2004.  All times are Eastern Standard <br/>
Time (EST).  Always check your own local schedules for show dates and <br/>
times in your area there are variations in cable feeds and the <br/>
problem that I'm human and prone to err.  <br/>
<br/>
The schedule is available in the Calendar in the Web Features on the <br/>
SHQ yahoogroup site.  If you receive individual e-mails, link to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq/cal">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq/cal</a> .  The calendar is set to <br/>
reflect the day starting at 12:00AM and ending at 11:00PM.  Times for <br/>
films have been incorporated into a calendar set for EST.  You can <br/>
import calendar entries into your own personal calendar (but pay <br/>
attention to whether or not it changes show times to your time zone <br/>
I'm not sure if it does or not).  When you click on the title of the <br/>
film, it will give you more information, including an option to <br/>
import the entry.  Film show times and lengths have been rounded down <br/>
or up where necessary (if it starts at 1:50, the start time shows <br/>
1:45; if it lasts 88 minutes, it's shown to last 1 hour 30 minutes).  <br/>
Play with it and see if it will help you not miss any more of those <br/>
wonderful films!<br/>
<br/>
All films are subtitled unless otherwise indicated.<br/>
