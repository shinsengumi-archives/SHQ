<h3>Shinsengumi Investigation Journal Found</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-829122809">This might be old news, but I just found it as I was going through old<br/>
email in my inbox, and thought people here might find it interesting.<br/>
It comes from Hillsborough&#39;s Fall 2005 issue of his email<br/>
magazine/newsletter:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A so-called Shinsengumi Investigation Journal has recently been found.<br/>
The document, written between May and October 1865, is more aptly<br/>
called a memorandum than a journal. It is believed to have been<br/>
recorded by Shinsengumi officer Yamazaki Susumu, whose name appears on<br/>
the front and back covers. Although it cannot be confirmed that the<br/>
document was actually written by Yamazaki, the Hino City Furusato<br/>
Museum, in Hino City, Tokyo, has issued a statement that &quot;it was<br/>
definitely written by someone who knew much about the inner-affairs of<br/>
the Shinsengumi.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The document measures 7.6 cm x 16.5 cm and consists of 42 pages, some<br/>
of which have been torn out. The contents include a copy of infantry<br/>
training records and a list of 148 Shinsengumi corpsmen Â­ beginning<br/>
with the slightly elevated names of Kondo Isami and Hijikata Toshizo.<br/>
(Okita Soji, Nagakura Shinpachi, Inoue Genzaburo and Todo Heisuke<br/>
follow in that order. Harada Sanosuke and Saito Hajime appear as<br/>
numbers 7 and 8. Yamazaki SusumuÂ¹s name is 12th on the list.) Above<br/>
each name is a number between 1 and 8, indicating the number of the<br/>
squad that the man belonged to. Near some of the names are written the<br/>
words &quot;seppuku&quot; and &quot;deserted&quot; Â­ and even the date (June 21) that two<br/>
of the men disemboweled themselves Â­ adding to the value of the<br/>
document as an on-the-scene report. Although there exist several<br/>
valuable written and oral memoirs of former Shinsengumi corpsmen,<br/>
including Nagakura Shinpachi, Shimada Kai and Shinohara Yasunoshin,<br/>
the &quot;Yamazaki Journal&quot; is one of few remaining documents written<br/>
during the actual time period. It is also important as an indication<br/>
of the rank of the corpsmen and the Shinsengumi organization in<br/>
mid-1865, although it differs slightly from another list of the same<br/>
period recorded by Shimada.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu, believed to have been an expert with a wooden staff,<br/>
served as a spy for the Shinsengumi. He was involved in the arrest of<br/>
anti-Tokugawa activist Furudaka Shuntaro in June 1864, leading to the<br/>
notorious IkedaÂ¹ya Incident, a turning point in the revolution.<br/>
<br/>
The current owner of the document claims to be a descendent of an<br/>
Osaka merchant family with ties to Kondo Isami. The document was<br/>
exhibited at the Hino City Furusato Museum (Hinoshi Furusato<br/>
Hakubutuskan) in November and December of 2004.<br/>

Anyway, Hino  Furusato Museum has not announced any update since then.<br/>
