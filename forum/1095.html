<h3>Full Body Chainmail</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655949777">Most of us have seen Hijikata&#39;s helmet and arm guards already...I <br/>
recently found full body chainmail in a Japanese Shinsengumi <br/>
book...I uploaded the pic in the PHOTOS&gt;Shinsengumi Artifacts (next <br/>
to Itou&#39;s hat)...the image is big enough to read the Japanese <br/>
caption I wonder who owned this artifact ^_^...<br/>
<br/>
The same image is available at another Japanese Shinsengumi site as <br/>
well (but also a black and white image)</div>
