<h3>RED CLIFF (movie) and Kondou Isami</h3>

John Woo's upcoming film RED CLIFF (set at the disintegration of the<br/>
Han dynasty)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/</a><br/>
is a depiction of the most famous episode in the Chinese epic Romance<br/>
of the Three Kingdoms (ROTK).  You can read online classic<br/>
translations of ROTK, read summaries in Chinese literature books or<br/>
just play any one of the famous DYNASTY WARRIOR vid games.<br/>
<br/>
ROTK was/is not only beloved in China but also Korea, Japan and even<br/>
entered Southeast Asia a couple hundred years ago (in the form of<br/>
stage plays/operas/puppet shows).<br/>
<br/>
I'm posting about RED CLIFF<br/>
here is the trailer <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbx9oPfFNFs">http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbx9oPfFNFs</a> (Takeshi<br/>
Kaneshiro as Zhuge Liang and Andy Lau as Zhou Yu)<br/>
because it's the easiest and least time consuming way for Shinsengumi<br/>
fans to be acquainted with what Kondou Isami loved, ROTK, and<br/>
especially the character of Guan Yu, known for his loyalty.  We've<br/>
mentioned in the past that Kondou's love of Guan Yu is interesting<br/>
because of the way Guan Yu is captured and eventually executed<br/>
(classic case of a great hero's fall) and it's almost foreshadowing<br/>
Kondou's own fate. In the trailer you can see Guan Yu at 0:48.<br/>
<br/>
What I like about the trailer is that it doesn't seem fancy and artsy<br/>
like HERO or THE BANQUET or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS.  ROTK is none of<br/>
those things and the story would not have any staying power of the<br/>
centuries if it was "boring".  I hope RED CLIFF will do its part to<br/>
introduce one of the greatest works of historical fiction to the west.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the eery parallels between Guan Yu and Kondou Isami....ROTK<br/>
is THE TEMPLATE or prophetic narrative of how empires and governments,<br/>
modern and ancient,  fall.  Think about it...Three Kingdoms and the<br/>
division of China into major factions and the parallel between the end<br/>
of the Tokugawa shogunate.  The Three Kingdoms of China also had<br/>
shifting alliances to neutralize the third party and all negotiations<br/>
fluctuated over time.  It's just like the major feuds of Japan vying<br/>
for power in Kyoto.</div>

<br/>
I saw the 8 minute promo reel.  You'll enjoy the scenes after 4:00 <br/>
onwards.  The character of Guan Yu, Kondou's fav chara, is shown more <br/>
in the 8 min. segment too.<br/>
<br/>
You'll love it.  The music has some sort of weird Jo Hisaishi influence (I <br/>
wonder if he worked on the film).  I think there is some Japanese money <br/>
invested in this movie clearly---and Shidou Nakamura stars in it as well.<br/>
<br/>
And for any questions as to why there are female characters and if it is <br/>
some sort of way to use "girl power" to pull in the crowd---that's not <br/>
true.  Romance of the Three Kingdoms had many significant female <br/>
characters and a few warrior women to boot.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand why they made RED CLIFF, rather than the later <br/>
chapters of ROTK which would require them to bring in the elephants.<br/>
<br/>
If you study Chinese/Korean/Japanese history then reading ROTK or <br/>
summaries or watching these film versions will help you figure out what <br/>
the heck old texts allude to.  ROTK is one of those works of historical <br/>
fiction (although there is a historical version of the story too) that is <br/>
*constantly* mentioned, referenced and compared to.<br/>
<br/>
ROTK is a peek into the past, and often used as a peek into the future as <br/>
it is believed to be prophesize the outcome of political crisis once certain <br/>
factors come into play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423985354">yahoo messed up the link here is a tinyurl:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/6mft73">http://tinyurl.com/6mft73</a><br/>
<br/>
the promo just takes your breath away...<br/>
<br/>
anyways people who read "THE ART OF WAR" and may have been a bit <br/>
bored with it should read Romance of the Three Kingdoms...the original <br/>
version (historical fiction) is told chronologically however most modern <br/>
folks are introduced to it via spin-off texts.  For example texts which are <br/>
character bios of the major figures in ROTK---then people get so <br/>
interested they are willing to wade through the original text.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways as stated here on the list in before, it is eery Kondou Isami <br/>
related himself to the character of Guan Yu who had a very tragic end in <br/>
ROTK.  More well known themes from ROTK is simply the "PEACH <br/>
GARDEN PACK" during which 3 warriors swore to be brothers---this is a <br/>
stock phrase used all over the place in China/Korea/Japan in the context <br/>
ofcourse of a warrior's bond.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately though it would have occurred to MANY MANY guys during the <br/>
Bakumatsu that on a national scale, politics had entered the "state" of <br/>
three kingdoms (3 political units/parties etc) in which to survive you <br/>
don't want to be the unit that gets ganged up on by 2 other units (this is <br/>
what happened to Aizu vs Sat-Cho, and a few smaller domains w/ Sat-<br/>
Cho).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways people who study warfare, warriors or the "mentality" of <br/>
military strategists and confine themselves to THE ART OF WAR, Book of <br/>
5 rings etc---are missing like a good 90% of detail, nuance, diplomacy, <br/>
non-military tactics and personel management unless they seriously <br/>
make an effort to get a taste of one of Asia's most best-selling works of <br/>
literature.<br/>
<br/>
Footnote:  Sichuan which experienced the devastating earthquake this <br/>
year is one of the 3 kingdoms in ROTK.  I really appreciated how John <br/>
Woo used the occasion of this movie's release to honor people who tried <br/>
to alleviate the suffering there.<br/>
<br/>
Even in the ROTK text, earthquakes are mentioned and the very rugged <br/>
terrain around the area used as a natural defense in pre-modern times <br/>
was what hindered rescue efforts during this recent disaster.<br/>

I saw the first half of RED CLIFF and it's SPECTACULAR.  <br/>
<br/>
John Woo's vision of RED CLIFF, the most well known chapter of China's <br/>
epic THREE KINGDOMS is everything it promises to be to people who know <br/>
the story.  I'm concerned that when the movie is released in the west it <br/>
will simply not have the same impact and the first 20 minutes are so are a <br/>
bit rocky.  Most people who know the story can tell which character is <br/>
which such as "guy on white horse" has a name we all know already.  <br/>
<br/>
Understandably trailers of RED CLIFF make it seem like another empty, <br/>
soul-less CG extravaganza but if you acquire the film you'll be in for a BIG <br/>
SURPRISE and part two will be even better.  <br/>
<br/>
Warning: there is another "Three Kingdoms" film by Sammo Hung---it <br/>
looks really "iffy".<br/>
<br/>
But back to Three Kingdoms and why Kondou and men of his generation <br/>
loved this work---to the point that Kondou somewhat identified himself <br/>
with the character of Guan Yu.<br/>
<br/>
There are many versions of THree Kingdoms but the "basic" Guan Yu we <br/>
know from history was simply a self-made man.  A farmer with no distinct <br/>
background.  We assume that although he came from an incredibly <br/>
humble background he seemed to be able to read---atleast in one <br/>
memorable episode he reads  (or he may have pretended to read).  More <br/>
importantly Guan Yu was very loyal/sincere and had a warrior's sense of <br/>
pride well before his sworn brother was able to establish a kingdom/feud <br/>
which in the process raised his rank.  His pathetic capture and death is <br/>
often dramatized in fiction and over the centuries he became a "stock <br/>
character" for loyalty, warrior prowess and masculine power however the <br/>
historical Guan Yu was supposedly much more cunning and seemed to put <br/>
up a better fight than his fictional self. Kondou would have had access to <br/>
the fictional Guan Yu via traditional story tellers and then he could have <br/>
come across poetry and the full-length "novel" as he matured.  With each <br/>
retelling a person experiences the story becomes more "badass" to the <br/>
young warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai easily related to the Three Kingdoms as a historical and literary <br/>
work because the epic is about warring feuds yet it has so many delicate <br/>
episodes which remind readers that in between the blood and gore there <br/>
is still life beyond the battlefield and even the possibility of averting conflict.</div>

On the big screen Nov 20 in the USA.<br/>
<br/>
Available on  VOC, XBOX Live and Amazon on October 22, <br/>
<br/>
Below is a post I made long ago with my mini-rant on why it is actually relevant to Shinsengumi fans because Romance of the Three Kingdoms (the Red Cliff arc is part of the epic) was a beloved work of historical fiction by the historical Shinsengumi not to mention many generations of samurai before them.  Most interestingly, historical Kondou compared himself to one of the characters in the film.<br/>
<br/>
The film ultimately is the highest level of "fanfiction" of Romance of the Three Kingdoms by a master director.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't miss this film!<br/>
