<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743567994">Ok I have 2 episodes of the Shinsengumi drama encoded and i'm working on the next 3 right now. Currently the filesizes are 400megs average for an episode with the current video compression (DIVX5) and audio (MP3). With the way the files are, i'll only be able to distro these via DVDs instead of CDs, and I know some of you may not have DVD drives to read the files. Or distro them on many many cds. <br/>
<br/>
So, basically it all comes down to, do you want smaller files at the expense of quality?<br/>
<br/>
On another note, if anyone knows how to get these files loaded on a bittorrent server, i'll do that to make them easily available to those who do have a high speed connection.  <br/>
