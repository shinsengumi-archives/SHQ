<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743567994">Ok I have 2 episodes of the Shinsengumi drama encoded and i&#39;m working on the next 3 right now. Currently the filesizes are 400megs average for an episode with the current video compression (DIVX5) and audio (MP3). With the way the files are, i&#39;ll only be able to distro these via DVDs instead of CDs, and I know some of you may not have DVD drives to read the files. Or distro them on many many cds. <br/>
<br/>
So, basically it all comes down to, do you want smaller files at the expense of quality?<br/>
<br/>
On another note, if anyone knows how to get these files loaded on a bittorrent server, i&#39;ll do that to make them easily available to those who do have a high speed connection.  <br/>
