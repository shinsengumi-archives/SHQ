I&#39;m especially interested in the documents shown in the vid.  We know<br/>
Hijikata is mentioned in Jules Brunet&#39;s writing (in French) but are<br/>
the docs in the vid---RUSSIAN???  It would be interesting.  We have to<br/>
remember that the north (Hokkaido) was of special interest to the<br/>
Russians.  I saw some art out of that era where the Russian bear and<br/>
other western powers were watching over the naval battles in the north.</div>

  Unfortunately I&#39;ve never seen the full page of the diary with the praise of Hijikata&#39;s leadership so I can&#39;t comment on what exactly Jules Brunet wrote. Maybe it is accessible from some academic database?<br/>

I used to try looking for Jules Brunet material in general (a couple<br/>
of years ago) and only found a book of his drawings in French (-_-). <br/>
I can only read and type in English ofcourse and so my past database<br/>
searches can&#39;t look up French sources.  I think we&#39;d probably need a<br/>
fan based in  France with access to a university to find if Brunet&#39;s<br/>
diary has ever been published.</div>

cyrillic, which is what Russian uses.  I also heard &quot;Gdye,&quot; which <br/>
is &quot;Where&quot; in Russian, &quot;Dobre,&quot; which is &quot;Good,&quot; and the <br/>
pronunciation is definitely Russian.  The title of the post is in <br/>
Cyrillic.  Unfortunately, I&#39;d have better luck if I saw the cyrillic <br/>
text.<br/>

I really would like to translate whatever you may have. But if I read<br/>
correctly you read it, right? So the chances are slim I guess. Maybe I<br/>
can find some infos looking at the university...., well starting the<br/>
new semester in September. Or did you already get more information<br/>
about what he may have written?<br/>
<br/>
That has gotten really interesting.</div>

Hello Akimiya,<br/>
<br/>
I only found a book with Jules Brunet&#39;s drawings and a few pages of<br/>
info in French but not his diary.  I hope you have better luck finding<br/>
it at your university.<br/>
<br/>
In 2005, 3 long years ago this is what I found:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/2004">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/2004</a><br/>
(book title is in the post)<br/>
<br/>
At the time no one was really excited about it so I let it go.<br/>
<br/>
I no longer have the files. Sorry (-_-).<br/>
