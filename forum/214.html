<h3>Police Uniforms</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432502686">I have looked and looked using yahoo.co.jp for police uniforms from <br/>
the Meiji...and I can't find any pics.  I know there is a police <br/>
museum but I can't find their main site...other sites list the <br/>
museum's address and phone number etc...I have also seen *really* <br/>
fancy military uniforms...lots of embroidery on the sleeve cuffs.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows where I can find a pic of a regular police uniform <br/>
let me know.  I noticed that in the anime S.H.'s uniform is a <br/>
lighter blue than in the OVA Remembrance (very dark navy blue)...it <br/>
may be due to the production of the series but I'm wondering how <br/>
these uniforms really look like.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a live action movie from this period which features <br/>
policemen?</div>
