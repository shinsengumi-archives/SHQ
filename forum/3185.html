<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620523912">I think you can find most books over at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp">http://www.amazon.co.jp</a><br/>
you just have to try to get the the titles or author names in Japanese <br/>
and do a search.  The last 3 are really the most common.  But I know <br/>
that sometimes filling out the order page on Amazon.co.jp can be <br/>
really hard.  Is there an online Japanese bookstore in your country?  <br/>
They can order these books for you.  In regards to Kan Shimosawa you <br/>
have to take his info at "face value"...some details are hard to trace <br/>
to a source and you have to make a judgment call on some of his <br/>
research.  He represents a truly early attempt at gathering <br/>
information in this field (so his job was really difficult).<br/>
