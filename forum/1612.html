Screencaps of<br/>
Lady Snowblood...in which the secret police monitor anti-government<br/>
elements.  What is important about these caps is it shows a feature of<br/>
the French Police system and that is the higher your rank the less<br/>
likely you had to wear the uniform...but you had to wear western<br/>
clothing. The general rule in the Meiji Era police system is that you<br/>
had to wear western clothing even when you are NOT on duty (0_0) keep<br/>
in mind that the Meiji government was engaged in rapid nation/state<br/>
building and the &quot;new&quot; face of the modern government WAS the police<br/>
system...the image of professionalism was not merely encouraged, it<br/>
was MANDATORY. The last installment of Lady Snowblood also shows the<br/>
influence of Russian political theory behind the anti-government<br/>
movement.  Most police shown use sabres<br/>
<br/>
Sanshiro Sugata...the film will show a police sponsored tournament<br/>
between practitioners of judo (the winner will become an instructor in<br/>
the force).  Notice the police band (they are in the background),<br/>
rickshaws, and how the typical Meiji era gentlemen wore western hats<br/>
and kimonos (basically mixed attire from both cultures).  If I<br/>
remember correctly, the police force in Sanshiro Sugata was the<br/>
Yokohama police, but keep in mind that the Meiji Era police system was<br/>
HIGHLY centralized so the uniforms etc would be basically the same<br/>
throughout the country.  I specifically chose these screencaps to give<br/>
us an idea of the atmosphere of the kenjutsu tournaments sponsored by<br/>
the TMPD.<br/>
<br/>
Last Samurai...the Tom Cruise movie will not mention the participation<br/>
of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department at all, even though the<br/>
use of the police was essentially a critical factor in the<br/>
government&#39;s victory (according to western writers).  The costuming<br/>
and uniform shown in this movie does not look 100% like what is<br/>
depicted in the traditional paintings of the Seinan War.  However,<br/>
some of the traditional paintings show slightly different uniforms as<br/>
well...[shrugs] just rely on the group pic of Fujita Goro (^_^).</div>
