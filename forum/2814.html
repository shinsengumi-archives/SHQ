I can't keep up with you intense researchers (I work on the timeline,<br/>
Saitou Hajime post 1868 because there is more info in English on the<br/>
Meiji Era, Takagi/Fujita Tokio and some Aizu folks) so I have a ~weak~<br/>
grasp of Okita (but I wrote that article on TB, that counts for<br/>
something right?)...now this is an idea...<br/>
<br/>
why don't all the Okita specialists form a team and revise Okita's<br/>
info page (^___^) get in a chatroom, or work on someone's blog and do<br/>
some revising etc...but really you don't have to be a specialist you<br/>
can be a fan who joins the group and asks questions, this will help<br/>
the main writers understand the "FAQ" of the hundreds of thousands of<br/>
Okita fans out there<br/>
<br/>
again it is totally important to cite details this would be very<br/>
helpful to visitors of the site<br/>
<br/>
also you may right some mini articles on Okita as well and I can<br/>
create a sub-menu<br/>
<br/>
for example I split the Saitou Hajime page into sections (by the way<br/>
I'm in the process of converting my word document essay into html to<br/>
enhance the info on the page) you can take a peak here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
and when you are all done, just email the text, your names (real or<br/>
user names) to shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
a similar approach was adopted with the gigantic still in progress<br/>
timeline where several people over a couple of months emailed<br/>
updates/entries<br/>
<br/>
so promise me that you will all think about it!  It is really<br/>
impossible for one person to study ALL the Shinsengumi members or all<br/>
facets of the history/culture<br/>
<br/>
specialize. divide and conquer!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68267672">This would be something nice to do.   To get to chat with others, and for a while I've been thinking about reviving the chatroom created in mIRC from a couple of months ago.  If anyone still remembers, the chatroom is still on the same server (caelestia.net)  with the same channel name (#shinsengumihq).   I myself am only available on Wednesdays & Thursdays, but I would love to chat with all of you in order to get more information (as was my original intention for the chatroom).   <br/>

Okita was NOT close to Hijikata at all.<br/>
<br/>
It's true that many believe Okita and Hijikata were like brothers based on Shiba <br/>
Ryoutarou's FICTION. However, in history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander <br/>
Okita shared a brotherly relationship with. It is debatable whether Okita and Hijikata were <br/>
even on good terms with each other.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's unsure of it, accurate information could be found in HISTORICAL references. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757139877">I've realized now that there are still quite a few mistakes...<br/>
<br/>
#1-#4 (please refer to my previous messages)<br/>
<br/>
#5 Okita did NOT become the captain of the first unit until 1865.<br/>
<br/>
#6 Keiou FOUR, during the Boshin War and after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, Okita went <br/>
into a hospital in Edo. He THEN moved to a guesthouse with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, <br/>
and their children. When the shogunate forces (including the Shinsengumi and the <br/>
Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region, Okita remained in Edo alone.<br/>
<br/>
#7 Keiou 4 did NOT become Meiji 1 until Oct 23 1868 (lunar calender Sep 8), 3 months <br/>
AFTER Okita's death. His date of death should NEVER be written as "Meiji 1, May 30 (Lunar <br/>
calendar)." It's either Jul 19, 1868 or  Keiou 4, May 30 (lunar calendar).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739036569">Nlf7,<br/>
We love your enthusiasm and knowledge---ofcourse we understand where<br/>
you are coming from when you say "see historical references" and so<br/>
forth and I got your list of books.  Many of us here who have written<br/>
articles for the website, also use historical references extensively,<br/>
please see this article as an example:<br/>
<br/>
The Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis and Okita Soujiro<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm</a><br/>
see how if a quote or detail is taken from a book...the exact<br/>
book/author and page number are noted OR the author is mentioned in<br/>
the text.<br/>
<br/>
and about Okita's birthday<br/>
have you seen his updated page?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I did note some of your major contributions (^___^) as I said in my<br/>
previous post I want to revise the page ASAP but I will need to have a<br/>
final format to work with  so I would need your help because I am not<br/>
knowledgeable on Okita.<br/>
<br/>
as for the conversion of dates we have a link to a good converter on<br/>
the timeline page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
but imagine this:<br/>
(visitor to Okita page) "wow lots of cool info from nlf7---but which<br/>
book did that detail come from?"<br/>
<br/>
we cannot tell people to just "believe us" just because we can post a<br/>
website on the internet---we want to give people the tools to learn on<br/>
their own<br/>
<br/>
there are hundreds of Shinsengumi books----I made a list of Okita<br/>
books here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography2.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography2.htm</a><br/>
I will add your list ASAP<br/>
<br/>
For example next to your information on Okita's alternate birth year<br/>
we would add (author last name and page number from the book).<br/>
<br/>
I don't want you to misunderstand (early on 2 years ago we made minor<br/>
errors so we quickly changed our strategy, so now we want to be<br/>
careful to prevent SHQ.com from becoming a source of innaccurate<br/>
information)--- with certain details especially coming from English<br/>
texts, we know the information is *solid however we still need to cite<br/>
them so people can find the book and read details themselves <br/>
<br/>
*if we did not cite our sources, we would be plaigiarizing---those<br/>
authors are very well respected academics I dont' think they would be<br/>
happy to see their words posted without proper credit<br/>
<br/>
-WE- believe you 100%!!! But we want any visitor (from all over the<br/>
world) to also understand where the information came from so they can<br/>
*double *check or they can buy the right books<br/>
<br/>
Nlf7, I hope you can head up the Okita Team if you have the time and<br/>
get in touch with other mailing list members and put your fabulous<br/>
minds together.  If we split up the work we can accomplish many things<br/>
together .TEAM.WORK.<br/>
<br/>
so nlf7, Bunneh, Kaneyoshi are anyone, if you guys are going to meet<br/>
somewhere, sometime or use a blog/livejournal just post here to<br/>
organize your efforts<br/>
<br/>
Again, Shinsengumihq.com doesn't "own" the Shinsengumi or history, we<br/>
just study it---any contribution to the site such as fanart, fanfic<br/>
and articles remain the property of the individual we just make it<br/>
available to the public.  So we would like to learn from you nlf7<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please don't misunderstand me,  I was only commenting on the Okita article (http://<br/>
www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm) I understand that you also use historical <br/>
references, but please double check whether your own information is correct when there's <br/>
conflicting info. (I believe some mistakes to be human errors or/and typos.) <br/>
<br/>
Also, make sure your "historical references" are actually in the history section and are not <br/>
categorized as (historical) fiction. For example, many regard the trilogy by Shimozawa Kan <br/>
as "historical references" but in fact, his Shinsengumi books are categorized as (historical) <br/>
fiction. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > and about Okita's birthday<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was NOT talking about his birthday earlier today.  <br/>
<br/>
quote from www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm<br/>
"Born in Tenpou 13 (1844) (some say Tenpou15)"<br/>
<br/>
I was saying that Tenpou 13 = 1842 (not 1844.) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I've already given you a list of books.  However, I haven't used quotes in regard of the <br/>
Shinsengumi. <br/>
<br/>
Again, almost all the books/chapters in regard of Okita contain this (rather basic) <br/>
information. For example, <br/>
<br/>
Mori, Makiko.  Okita Soji Feature (Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999)<br/>
Oji, Kazuko. Walking with Okita Soji  (Tokyo: Shin Chosha, 2003)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >  I hope you can head up the Okita Team if you have the time and<br/>
> get in touch with other mailing list members and put your fabulous<br/>
> minds together.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'd rather "chat" on the Okita Soji discussion page at Wikipedia.  I understand that some <br/>
fans of the Shinsengumi/Okita don't have access to SHQ nor want to join it. (To tell you <br/>
the truth, it took me a while before I decided to join this group.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I suggest that we merge the Okita Soji article at Wikipedia and the Okita article <br/>
at SHQ.<br/>
<br/>
I've been keeping an eye on all the Shinsengumi articles at Wikipedia since March.  It's true <br/>
that anyone could edit or delete information at Wikipedia and I had a problem with it when <br/>
I started editting the articles (as all could see on my talk page.)<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, the Wikipedia's linked to library networks so improving articles at  at <br/>
Wikipedia is certainly more than worthwhile. (At least, that's what I tell myself when I feel <br/>
like giving up.) <br/>
<br/>
As anyone could see from the history of every article on the Shinsengumi, I've done many <br/>
corrections and whenever there was any conflicting info, my version would always end up <br/>
on top (since my edits could be backed up with research and historical references.)<br/>
<br/>
That being said, Ito and Todo don't have their own articles yet and the new Inoue and <br/>
Takeda articles need  a lot of help.  (I've done most research on the members of the <br/>
Shieikan so I could only write more about Inoue when I get the chance.)<br/>

My point is this:  I can give you hundreds of books on the Bakumatsu <br/>

how things work (not at the SHQ) but now many websites are adopting <br/>

<br/>
Why would you think of giving up? Currently Wikipedia is not <br/>
acceptable in terms of citation.  The reason is that the internet is <br/>
always in "flux".  The reason why books dominate academia is because <br/>
the text is "frozen".  Although Wikipedia has a time stamp on <br/>
commentary, it is still hard to determine authorship.  Books however <br/>
have clear cut editors and authorship--again for the purpose of <br/>
citation.  I can post something to shinsengumihq.com right now, and <br/>
change it in 5 minutes--this causes confusion unlike a book which <br/>
remains "static"---or undergoes a revision and becomes a new edition.<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
NLF7<br/>
As anyone could see from the history of every article on the <br/>
Shinsengumi, I've done many <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > corrections and whenever there was any conflicting info, my <br/>

--------------------------------------<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
Currently there are no resident historians (you can get a degree in <br/>
history and specialize but there is no licensing ^_^) at Wikipedia <br/>
to oversee your work---your corrections are at the top because they <br/>
are the most recent.  Your edits are backed by books---but again <br/>
your citation method is still too general.<br/>
<br/>
Promise you aren't mad at secretarytocapt3?  I am giving <br/>
suggestions...I am a student of history and I study the development <br/>
of social institutions---I am familiar with various methods of <br/>
studying history---I don't want to make the study of the shinsengumi <br/>
boring at all---I write silly fanfic, do fanart and videos too it's <br/>
just that we must put our best foot forward when it comes to history</div>

 </span></blockquote>Please (kindly) ask the other party to back up claims such as that Okita was born in <br/>
Shirakawa and that he was close to Hijikata with historical references.  I'm confident to say <br/>
that it would not be possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Okita was born in the Shirakawa Domain's Edo mansion and the other party might have <br/>
confused that with him being born in Shirakawa.  While his place of death is an issue of <br/>
book "A" saying something and book "B" saying something, his place of birth is NOT.  I <br/>
could upload some book samples for you (for example, p12 -13 from "Okita Soji Feature" <br/>
by Mori and p14-15 from "Walking with Okita Soji" by Oji), but could the other party do <br/>

Please feel free to use language tools to translate the first few lines (if you haven't done so <br/>
already.) <br/>
<br/>
Also, as I've mentioned, many believe that Okita was close to Hijikata based on Shiba's <br/>
fiction and until I made the corrections, the Shinsengumi artcicles at Wikipedia had Shiba <br/>
Ryoutarou's novels listed as non-fiction references.  <br/>
<br/>
There's no doubt that his books are historical novels. <br/>

I'm not sure why others don't want to join this group; I could only speak for myself. I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why? I'd rather spend the time on reading the Shinsengumi manga I've bought and more <br/>
about the history of the Shinsengumi...<br/>
<br/>
In addition, it gets rather tiring sometimes and I haven't had any time left to edit articles <br/>

I wouldn't allowed mistakes to be edited in. :P :P :P <br/>

Yes, I do see your point. As I've mentioned above, the citation method won't be so general <br/>

so if you had to waste your time to edit those pages then I'm sorry<br/>
but we aren't responsible.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm confused when you constantly say that you had to do this and that<br/>
on wikipedia because our volunteers are responsible for what  is on<br/>
the website ONLY<br/>
<br/>
as I've stated before in earlier posts I only posted a discussion<br/>
question to your KOndou page and I did cite my information regarding<br/>
Tani Tateki---the detail in the Hillsborough book, and his Japanese<br/>
source.  On the board you proceeded to SHOUT AND USE CAPS TO MAKE YOUR<br/>
POINT LIKE THIS. You must take up the matter with Mr. Hillsborough AND<br/>
the Japanese author of the book he used (not with me---I just read the<br/>
information). Please keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
however we do link to certain Wikipedia articles (with warnings) such<br/>
as the one on Teruhime and Aizu which we did contribute facts<br/>
<br/>
It is possible we have members who add information but individual<br/>
actions should not reflect on our entire group<br/>

for the record we are one of SEVERAL Shinsengumi sites out there...it<br/>
is possible you may be addressing the wrong group entirely...like I<br/>
said this is an open community with hundreds of members<br/>

they might have been misled by the same website sources or have mistaken materials <br/>

<br/>
The Okita Soji article on Wikipedia (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okita_S?ji)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okita_S?ji)</a> is ready to be <br/>

The Wikipedia doesn't use the MLA-like "(author, page #)" format so I've only listed 2 <br/>

<br/>
PS. Here's the Okita article with "(author, page #.)"	<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okita S?ji<br/>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>
<br/>
Okita S?ji (?? ??), (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the first troop of <br/>
the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate period. He was <br/>
a well-known genius swordsman, being one of the strongest out of the Shinsengumi, <br/>
along with Saito Hajime and Nagakura Shinpachi.<br/>

	 	3 Death<br/>

<br/>
Background<br/>
He was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai family <br/>
in the Shirakawa- han's Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His Great-grandfather was Okita <br/>
Kan'emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His father, Okita <br/>
Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907) and Okita Kin <br/>
(1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita family, Okita Rintaro <br/>
(1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuke <br/>
in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and Okita started <br/>
training at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time, Kondo Shusuke had <br/>
already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijikata Toshizo had not <br/>
yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy and attained <br/>
Menkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 - p.11)<br/>
<br/>
In 1861, Okita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often <br/>
commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he was also <br/>
known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori, p.27 - p.28)<br/>
<br/>
According to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou's son) and Satou Shun'sen (Satou <br/>
Higokorou's descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high cheekbones, a <br/>
wide month, and a "flatfish" face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he was known as a man who <br/>
smiled and laughed well (not very talkative, however.)<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Period<br/>
Okita changed his name to Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before his departure <br/>
to Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and a <br/>
Fukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander's Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou, also a <br/>
practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the Shinchougumi (the <br/>
Shinsengumi's brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)<br/>
<br/>
Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, with Todo Heisuke being <br/>
the youngest. He was one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (one of <br/>
the original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro assassinations in <br/>
1863. (Oji, p.132)<br/>
<br/>
Equally skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his signature technique was <br/>
named the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (which translates as "Three Piece Thrust"), a <br/>
technique that could attack one's neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. <br/>
(the Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but this is most <br/>
likely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention and it could <br/>
have been derived from an invention of Hijikata's (the Hirazuki.)<br/>
<br/>
It was rumored that his tuberculosis was discovered when he coughed blood and fainted <br/>
during the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say that he contracted the disease after that. <br/>
Both are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very slowly (many years). <br/>
While many of the Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaru was killed by Okita <br/>
during the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shiba Ryoutarou's fiction), it is in fact historically <br/>
inaccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)<br/>
<br/>
Based on Shiba Ryoutarou's fiction, many also believe that Okita and Hijikata were like <br/>
brothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly <br/>
relationship with. Yamanami's seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was an <br/>
extremely painful incident in Okita's short life. (Mori, p.78) There is no record showing <br/>
that Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got along with <br/>
Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
In 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and also served as a <br/>
kenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be <br/>
the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)<br/>
<br/>
Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana called Kikuichi-<br/>
monji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a wakizashi) and <br/>
his so-called "Kikuichimonji Norimune" was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo instead. (Oji, 96)<br/>
<br/>
Death<br/>
During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of Keiou 4, Okita went <br/>
into Matsumoto Ryoujun's hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a guesthouse <br/>
with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces (including <br/>
the Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region, Okita remained in <br/>
Edo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May 30th), 1868. Later <br/>
that night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present Tokyo), under his birth name <br/>
(with Okita Souji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita's grave is not open to the <br/>
public. (Oji, p.252)<br/>
<br/>
The information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that he was born <br/>
in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in 1868 (or on a <br/>
lesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and therefore was <br/>
25 by Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)<br/>
<br/>
Trivia<br/>
It is historical accurate that Okita loved children. During his time in Kyoto, he was often <br/>
seen playing with children and was a baby-sitter to Yagi's sons in Mibu. (Oji, p.100)<br/>
<br/>
He was not particularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved sweets.<br/>
<br/>
Okita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)<br/>
<br/>
Aside from being treated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku (medicine for <br/>
enervation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with Ishida Sanyaku for <br/>
treating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)<br/>
<br/>
There has not been any evidence of an Okita photograph.<br/>

Okita in Fiction<br/>
It is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with historical data about him.<br/>
<br/>
Okita is briefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga series Rurouni Kenshin, which <br/>
takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. A character later on in the <br/>
series, Seta S?jir?, was based on the Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi Keppuroku (and <br/>
therefore, darker than the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in the anime/manga <br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an episode of the anime <br/>
GS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about the <br/>
Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only of killing <br/>
people (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the show's rendition of <br/>
Hijikata.) Okita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru, which is a fictional <br/>
story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (where Okita trains a <br/>
young girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her father and older brother.) He is also <br/>
depicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/manga series Shura no Toki, <br/>
Okita's (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with a warrior from the <br/>
Mutsu, a clan that supposedly practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a request from <br/>
Okita himself from years before.<br/>
<br/>
His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man (sometimes a <br/>
bish?nen). The Latin American dub of Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook Okita for a <br/>
woman, and the Hijikata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the fangirls of <br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane.<br/>
<br/>
While only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a flashback and as a <br/>
possible ghost), Okita's (obviously) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an equally-obviously <br/>
fictional unnamed wife) is one of the three main characters of the series.<br/>
<br/>
His three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are also very similar to the <br/>
character Ukyo Tachibana from the video game series Samurai Shodown.</div>

You only have to list the references which you actually used for <br/>
your article---however we are listing all the Okita books you <br/>
recommended for visitors to see<br/>
<br/>

translation (such as Tani Tateki's statement after Imai Nobuo's confession to the murder of <br/>
Sakamoto.)  I don't seek help for something like "in Mibu" though. The online language <br/>

temple. "<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You only need to list the five books on Okita. I really don't think that you need to list all 20 <br/>
for such a short article. Moreover, the other 15 Shinsengumi books would be more <br/>
appropriate on your Bibliography page. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Wikipedia seems to suggest strict citation rules however they don't<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, Wikipedia  uses the so-called "wikifying" format.  I decided to keep the style used in a <br/>
few other articles on historical figures (like the Matthew Perry article), after I saw a flag on <br/>
the Nagasone Kotetsu article page. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-339656320">Wow!  secretarytocapt3, You've updated the website already! <br/>
<br/>
Just a few notes.<br/>
<br/>
I.  It's a misconception that Okita's mother died when he was "very young."  In fact, she <br/>
died in 1862. (Mori, p.36 - p.37)<br/>
<br/>
2. Okita Souji is listed in the death records at the family temple<br/>
as being the "2nd son of Okita Rintaro Genji (sp???)" (not to be confused with  Okita <br/>
Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune.) Okita Rintaro Genji (also from the Inoue family) was <br/>
adopted into the Okita family; he died in 1852.   (Mori, p.10)   <br/>
<br/>
It's believed that Okita Rintaro Genji adopted Okita Souji. (Mori, p.11)<br/>
(Myabe he also adopted Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune?)  Okita Rintaro Genji served <br/>
as the head of the Okita family, before Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune became the <br/>
head of the family in place of the young heir, Okita Souji.<br/>
<br/>
3. Okita changed his name to "Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi" before his departure to <br/>
Kyoto.  He could have changed his name in 1863 (or in 1862, or less likely, in 1861.)  I've <br/>
reversed my notes on the Okita discussion page at Wikipedia (and have taken all the caps <br/>
off.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >A few notes<br/>
><br/>
>1. Okita was born in the Shirakawa-han's mansion in Edo (present day Tokyo.)<br/>
><br/>
>2. His birth name (in full) was Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa. He later >changed <br/>
>his name to "Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi." Other than his full >name, he could be <br/>

>Family Name: Okita<br/>
>Given Name/First Name Equivalent: Soujirou, Souji<br/>
>Family Clan Name:Fujiwara<br/>
>Formal Given Name/Middle Name Equivalent: Harumasa, Kaneyoshi<br/>
><br/>
>3. Okita was enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school between 1850 and 1852, Kondou <br/>
>Isami was enrolled in 1848. Kondou Isami was like a "TA" to Okita and didn't become the <br/>

><br/>
>4. Okita was actually Hijikata's "senpei" and was enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school <br/>
>before Hijikata. (Hijikata was formally enrolled in 1859.)<br/>
><br/>
>5. Okita was sent to a hospital in Edo during the Boshin War(1868-1869) and after the <br/>
>first battle (Battle of Toba-Fushimi) of Boshin War. It was not a tuberculosis hospital and <br/>
>an injured Kondo was sent to the same hospital with Okita.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>4. This is only a suggestion,  I think it's more appropriate to refer him as "Okita Souji <br/>
Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi." While Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi was a member of the <br/>
Shinsengumi, Okita Soujirou Fijiwara no Harumasa was the Head Coach at the Shieikan.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Even though my user name is "nlf7," I've been using my nickname "Seven" on all the <br/>
discussion pages at Wikipedia. May I suggest that you also use my nickname "Seven" to <br/>
avoid confusion or list both my user name and my nickname?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695987822">Nlf7:<br/>
<br/>
It's always a pleasure to hear of your efforts in setting down good<br/>
data for Okita Soji. However, for the sake of clarification, I was<br/>
hoping you could help address a bit of a discrepancy I've found.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at page 26 of Kikuchi Akira's "Shinsengumi 101 no Nazo",<br/>
and the death records of Soji at the family temple are quoted directly:<br/>
<br/>
"Kenkouinjinmyoudou-koji. Died last day of the 5th month. 2nd son of<br/>
Okita Rintarou."<br/>
<br/>
(The first, rather long word is his funerary name)<br/>
<br/>
You've said that he was listed as "the 2nd son of Okita Rintaro<br/>
Genji"-- as cited on Mori, p. 10. I don't doubt the possibility of<br/>
another Okita Rintaro-- and in this case, the name that you're reading<br/>
as "Genji" is probably "Motoharu", which, with one character being the<br/>
same as "Mototsune", would indeed suggest a common family background<br/>
with Rintaro Mototsune. However, I can find no mention of an "Okita<br/>
Rintaro Genji" in this text, so I was hoping that you could possibly<br/>
point to a website where this name is mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I can find no mention of "Okita Rintaro Genji" when it comes to<br/>
the adoption of Rintaro Mototsune. Rintaro Mototsune is listed in<br/>
Shinchogumi records as "Son of the late Okita Katsujiro, retainer of<br/>
Lord Abe Noto no Kami". (Kikuchi, p. 26) As Soji was still underage,<br/>
Rintaro Mototsune was adopted into the family, as was common custom<br/>
among families in such a predicament, in order to carry on the family<br/>
name. It seems improbable, though not impossible, that there was<br/>
another Okita Rintarou that was adopted, and who adopted Rintarou<br/>
Mototsune. Kikuchi's reference is the actual Okita family record, and<br/>
so, you can see my confusion with your statement.<br/>
<br/>
As such, I was hoping that you could possibly help me out with regards<br/>
this.<br/>

The two men you refer to are one and the same.<br/>
<br/>
The name you posted at the top reads:<br/>
<br/>
"Okita Rintarou Fujiwara no Fusamasa"<br/>
<br/>
The lower one reads:<br/>
<br/>
"Okita Rintarou Mototsune"<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid that "Mototsune" can't be read "Genji".<br/>
<br/>
According to the link I posted above (Japanese wikipedia), Okita<br/>
Rintarou Mototsune, Mitsu's husband, was referred to as "Mototsune" at<br/>
one point in his life, and "Fusamasa" at another point.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'm sorry, but I have to respectfully disagree. The record of Okita<br/>
Rintaro as [adopted] son of Okita Katsujiro *is* a fact, recorded in a<br/>
source related to the Shinchogumi, compiled *during* the Bakumatsu,<br/>
which Kikuchi lists. It wasn't raised as part of explaining why Soji<br/>
is listed as the "second son", it was merely confirming how Rintaro<br/>
Mototsune/Fusamasa was listed in Shinchogumi records. Kikuchi<br/>
theorizes later, but this much, with regards to Rintaro being<br/>
Katsujiro's "son", is a fact which Kikuchi cites as coming from the<br/>
record of "Shinchogumi Meisaishosocho", from 1865.<br/>
