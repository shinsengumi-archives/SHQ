I'm aware of that. The Wikipedia articles do link to your website though<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
secretarytocapt3<br/>
that is because some members of the Shinsengumihq.com DID author the<br/>
article on Aizu...the other Shinsengumi stuff (I) didn't touch--nor<br/>
did I care to touch, however your differing opinion on Kondou's death<br/>
due to Tani's catalyzing the situation goes against, Tani Tateki's own<br/>
memoirs (his own words)---thus I had to correct your information nlf7.<br/>
 Other than that I have no interest in the other articles.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizu">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizu</a><br/>
<br/>
I linked information from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm</a><br/>
and I should added <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm</a><br/>
as well<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a question regarding the Aizu page?  <br/>
Our work is cited in detail and can be scrutinized.  <br/>
As I said before, we will defer to someone who knows Japanese---but<br/>
you said yourself that you aren't done reading those texts.<br/>
<br/>
We have texts for you to read if you wish---they are considered<br/>
difficult by even educated Japanese.  <br/>
I scanned them and can email them to you.<br/>
<br/>
as for dreamfeather.net she did not give me her new webaddress or<br/>
email thus I cannot pass along your comments (which are by the way<br/>
came across as harsh).  <br/>
<br/>
What I'm saying is, unless you are fluent in Japanese then please be<br/>
nice to our contributors---dreamfeather did try her best.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
however I need to ask you about this comment NLF7<br/>
<br/>
" I believe that the volunteers from<br/>
SHQ and the editors from Wikipedia might have made the very same<br/>
errors of judgment. (For example,<br/>
they might have been misled by the same website sources or have<br/>
mistaken materialsfrom fictional work as historical facts in a similar<br/>
fashion...etc)"<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking that you be careful with some of your comments nlf7<br/>
<br/>
WHICH members of the SHQ?  <br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned we are aware of the countless problems on<br/>
wikipedia---if we post something such as the Aizu information that is<br/>
only very general information we use to help lead people to our<br/>
website and especially to certain pages which are well researched.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't ask me to repeat myself.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know all over 100 members here, but the ones I know---I assure<br/>
you know the difference between *historical fiction and *fiction and<br/>
*historical texts.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of us work with texts right out of that era...the problem is they<br/>
are in the process of being studied...and written in CHINESE. Would<br/>
you like to read them? Many texts are handwritten and cannot be easily<br/>
deciphered.  I am totally hapy to send you the entire Kyoto Shugoshoku<br/>
Shimatsu...book which details Kyoto's security apparatus if you want<br/>
just email me at secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com I assure you this text<br/>
has the detail you want.  We can sure use more people who are fluent<br/>
in Japanese (or just studying Japanese).<br/>
<br/>
we have members in elementary school all the way to those pursuing<br/>
advanced degrees so when you say members of the SHQ in a critical way<br/>
you are in fact addressing a RANGE of members who are just trying to learn<br/>
<br/>
if you can teach us please do so in a appropriate way</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424344657">Please don't take things out of the context. I was only talking about member(s) of the SHQ <br/>
that claimed Okita was born in Shirakawa and that he was close to Hijikata.  Yes, I could be <br/>
a bit harsh in regard of Okita's place of birth.  As you could see from the few history based <br/>
websites I've sent you, it wouldn't be hard for one to see that he was born in Edo. I did feel <br/>
a little offended when you called this an issue of book "A" saying something and book "B" <br/>
saying something (because no book would say that he was born in Shirakawa and the <br/>
other party obviously made a mistake.) <br/>
<br/>
Imagine this, if I confused Aizu with Ainu and claimed Matsudaira Katamori to be Ezo's <br/>
daimyo and if a third party in your position called it an issue of book "A" saying something <br/>
and book "B" saying something, wouldn't you feel a little offended? If a third party <br/>
considered such a situation to be discrepencies between two authors and used both your <br/>
text and my text, wouldn't you be eager to sort things out?<br/>

<h3>Re: Aizu Articles on Wikipedia linked to Shinsengumihq.com</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134059304">nlf7:<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to take this time to once again commend you on your desire<br/>
for accuracy. However, I'd like to bring a detail to your attention.<br/>
<br/>
You corrected the entry, saying that Aizu was besieged in September<br/>
1868, to saying that it was besieged in October 1868. I presume you<br/>
meant the beginning of the siege. In this case, you are correct.<br/>
<br/>
"On the morning of the 23rd day of the 8th month, the new government's<br/>
army quickly broke through Takizawa Pass and arrived at the castle<br/>
town." (page 176 of "Aizu-han", by Noguchi Shin'ichi)<br/>
<br/>
23rd day of the 8th (lunar) month. That being the case, if you now use<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,">http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,</a> and put in the<br/>
date of "1868/8/23", and select the lower option to convert from lunar<br/>
to solar calendar, and then click on the button on the lower right of<br/>
the green box, that translates to, in our modern calendar: October 8,<br/>
1868. You are correct in saying October for the *start* of the siege;<br/>
obviously, the article says "they were eventually besieged at Tsuruga<br/>
Castle, the seat of the Aizu domain, in October 1868." Besieged, not<br/>
defeated; so again, that's absolutely correct.<br/>
<br/>
However, those who read this article should be mindful that the siege<br/>
did not end overnight; according to the timeline that appears on page<br/>
15 of the text "Sendai Boshin Senshi" (written by Fujiwara Ainosuke in<br/>
1911), as well as the timeline that appears on page 237 of the<br/>
timeline compiled by Itou Tetsuya in "Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no<br/>
Subete", the date for the surrender of Aizu is the 23rd day of the 9th<br/>
lunar month, 1868. Another source, page 182 of text "Aizu-han", gives<br/>
the date one day earlier-- the 22nd day of the 9th lunar month, 1868,<br/>
as being the date when, as the text says (I'm quoting directly here):<br/>
"Shin-seifugun to no kyouryoku ga nari, tsui ni kugatsu nijuuninichi,<br/>
roujou ikkagetsu nishite koufuku to kimatta." Translated, that reads<br/>
"After negotiation with the new government's army, the surrender was<br/>
decided for the 22nd day of the 9th month, after the siege that lasted<br/>
a month."<br/>
<br/>
22nd or 23rd, it doesn't matter much. Two other sources say 9/23, and<br/>
as the siege started on the 23rd of the 8th lunar month, and Noguchi<br/>
says "after a siege that lasted a month", I will go with the 23rd.<br/>
<br/>
That being the case, if you again use<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,">http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,</a> and put in the<br/>
date of "1868/9/23" and use the same method to convert it, that<br/>
translates to, in our modern calendar: November 6, 1868.<br/>
<br/>
You were right to correct the start date of the siege from September<br/>
to October, however, the siege did take a month in the lunar calendar,<br/>
and just under a month by the Western calendar, to end. I don't say<br/>
this to lecture anybody, I merely respectfully wish to bring correct<br/>
information to people's attention-- just as you wish to bring correct<br/>
information to people.<br/>
<br/>
Again, please accept my thanks for your efforts.<br/>
<br/>
-M.</div>

<br/>
I've always been interested in Aizu but since there's been an increasing interest in Okita's <br/>
life, I've started buying books on him last year. Anyways, in regard of the date of the Aizu <br/>
Clan's surrender, I've read it was Nov 6 1868 from "Shinsengumi Encyclopedia," p.122. <br/>

no idea that I'd be so interested in the subject for such a long time so I didn't list the <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-65863732">Hello,<br/>
first of all I have to apologize for my hostility in my previous<br/>
posts--I ask that you too reflect on the tone of your posts because<br/>
they seem condescending.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope that you will forgive me for coming across as aggressive and<br/>
unappreciative and from this point forth I hope we can start with a<br/>
clean slate.  My replies to you should be regarded as between<br/>
secretarytocapt3 to nlf7/seven and not the entire SHQ to nlf7/seven.<br/>
<br/>
as mentioned before, there are people on this list who I think are<br/>
somewhat knowledgeable and have tried to learn by reading, reading and<br/>
reading...we use some really great English language texts <br/>
<br/>
there are also those who have studied Japanese for several years (many<br/>
have stated that it takes nearly 10 years to read a modern day<br/>
newspaper without opening a dictionary even once), and even to this<br/>
day some names on the shinsengumihq.com page were romanized<br/>
incorrectly because even a well educated Japanese may choose to<br/>
interpret the name differently (this is the nature of the language)<br/>
<br/>
thus do not make assumptions about the collective intelligence of this<br/>
group---although we are fandom I think we can surprise you (^___^)<br/>
<br/>
this list is mostly Shinsengumi there is a sister list called<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/<br/>
and<br/>
http://www.livejournal.com/community/edo_meiji<br/>
which can handle Aizu-studies<br/>
<br/>
this livejournal blog also can handle Aizu questions<br/>
http://yamaguchiyukiko.livejournal.com/<br/>
<br/>
however, it is my personal opinion that the Shinsengumi history in<br/>
connection to Aizu is very very fascinating too (but few have found it<br/>
because it has not been portrayed in popular culture other than the<br/>
film Byakkotai http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm) all we need<br/>
is Nobuhiro Watsuki to do the "Aizu Arc" of the Shinsengumi and throw<br/>
in some of our naginata wielding hot females and he has a hit on his hands<br/>
<br/>
Aizu was just like any other domain during the Bakumatsu but I have to<br/>
say here that it has been ignored and devalued because of its military<br/>
and political defeat---there is simply very few books/articles written<br/>
on it.  Any analysis on the domain is shallow and one should not be<br/>
surprised that no one has bothered to study the Shinsengumi in a<br/>
professional manner.  If one can "find" Aizu in Bakumatsu texts---you<br/>
*will* find the Shinsengumi!  I stated in the past that there is a<br/>
scholar who is working on a book on Aizu and I have humbly suggested<br/>
(ok beg) that he also write in the Shinsengumi's patronage by Aizu in<br/>
Kyoto...<br/>
<br/>
this list is more focused on just the Shinsengumi so I hope to keep<br/>
this brief:<br/>
<br/>
For nlf7/Seven and others who would like to learn about Aizu:<br/>

Kyoto Shugoshoku Shimatsu... by Yamakawa Hiroshi (Fujita family friend)<br/>
http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/KYOTOSHUGOSHOKUSHIMATSU/vol1/vol.1.1-25.zip<br/>
I have scanned the entire book---if you feel that you can read it (or<br/>
read it when your Japanese has improved) then email me and I will give<br/>
you the rest<br/>
<br/>
Aizu Boshin Senso...by Yamakawa Kenjiro (brother of Hiroshi and also<br/>
another friend of the Fujita family)<br/>
http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/aizuboshinsenshi/0-50.zip<br/>

<br/>
Aizu Byakkotai<br/>
http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/AizuByakkotai/ByakkotaiBK.zip<br/>
<br/>
[I also have Bolitho, Harold. "Aizu, 1853-1868" Proceedings. of the<br/>
British Association for<br/>
Japanese Studies Vol. 2, 1977]  but give me a chance to find the file<br/>
<br/>
I hope you continued with your investigation into Aizu---I enjoy<br/>
studying the post 1868 Aizu network  (Aizu folks who contributed to<br/>
Meiji era society, even though they faced discrimination)<br/>
