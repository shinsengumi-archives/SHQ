<h3>List and personal calendars</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953349159">A heads-up.  Apparently times are not converted when the entry is imported (at least to a personal Yahoo calendar)... it&#39;s still listed in EST.  6:00AM EST doesn&#39;t do me much good when that&#39;s 4:00AM where I&#39;m at.  :-)  Just thought you should be aware.  Check your local schedules if you see something you really want to watch!  (Unless someone else has figured out how to make it convert... I&#39;m always missing places where I should click...)<br/>
