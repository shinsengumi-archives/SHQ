<h3>List and personal calendars</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953349159">A heads-up.  Apparently times are not converted when the entry is imported (at least to a personal Yahoo calendar)... it's still listed in EST.  6:00AM EST doesn't do me much good when that's 4:00AM where I'm at.  :-)  Just thought you should be aware.  Check your local schedules if you see something you really want to watch!  (Unless someone else has figured out how to make it convert... I'm always missing places where I should click...)<br/>
