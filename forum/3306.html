News on the Civil War in Japan is not always correct (comprehensive),<br/>
but probably the best the writers could do in their era and with<br/>
limited sources. <br/>
<br/>
Also includes some info on samurai sent on study abroad prior to 1868<br/>
(these are not the Choshu ones who made their way to Great<br/>
Britain)---these would be the **bakufu** sponsored ones (they are<br/>
alluded to in some texts and no details are provided).<br/>

I was too tired to search for coverage on the murder of Queen Min (of<br/>
Korea). Many books do cite newspaper articles and editorials which<br/>
waited for the axe to fall on the Japanese conspirators (directly<br/>
sponsored by the Meiji Gov's ARMY) in this horrible event of one<br/>
country assassinating the leader of another Asian country. <br/>
<br/>
I ofcourse left out Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese war because there<br/>
would hundreds of articles (many duplicate info but published in<br/>
countless cities across the USA). <br/>
<br/>
The database searches for words in the scans and often the images are<br/>
so poor due to the newspaper type quality that it's hard to find the<br/>
exact article one needs.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a secondary problem of name spelling.  Enomoto was (I<br/>
believe) spelled correctly in one article and in another place "Heno<br/>
moto" (Or something like that).  Remember all the lingo is<br/>
characteristic of the time like "Tycoon" and "Mikado". <br/>
