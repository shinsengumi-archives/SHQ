<h3>Another Ikedaya portrayal on youtube.com</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-15695499">From TV series Mibu no Koiuta 1983 <br/>

I'm not crazy about the action scenes in this one however I always <br/>
like Ikedaya scenes which are shot in low lighting because it seems <br/>
to me to be accurate.  also one of the actors (near the end of the <br/>
clip) was Kondou Isami in the film Byakkotai.<br/>
<br/>
A while back I said that the RK OVA copied frame by frame a part of <br/>
the Ikedaya raid from the film Byakkotai <br/>

<br/>
Here are caps of those exact moments which the animators for the RK <br/>
OVA studied from Byakkotai to enhance the movements and "flow" of <br/>
characters which move backwards and outwards towards the camera<br/>

I was going to find caps from the RK OVA to put side by side by the <br/>
website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jag.cx/Kenshin/">http://www.jag.cx/Kenshin/</a> which has ALOT of screencaps <br/>
buthe website seems to be offline<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
I hope that in a few months once the timeline is finished<br/>
people will see that aside from the insanely complicated politics, <br/>
the Shinsengumi should be atleast acknowledged as fighters in the <br/>
following areas:<br/>
<br/>
-[urban]       = Kyoto (offense + defense, guerrila warfare)<br/>
-[semi-rural]  = Toba + Fushimi (offense, retreat + regroup)<br/>
-[urban]       = Edo (offense + defense, fall back to "Kyoto" mode <br/>
style patrol in different environment as  Koyochinbutai)<br/>
-[semi-rural]  = Nagarayema (retreat + regrouping + scatter)<br/>
-[castle town] = Aizu Wakamatsu (and outlying area) (defense + <br/>
guerrilla warfare offense)<br/>
-[mountainous] = various battles in the Aizu domain (mostly defense)<br/>
-[sea] = Ezo/Hokkaido (but the last half of the fighting right <br/>
before Hijikata was shot was on land ofcourse)<br/>
<br/>
I finished reading <br/>
Author: Boyer, Samuel Pellman, 1839-1875.  <br/>
Title: Naval surgeon; the diary of Dr. Samuel Pellman Boyer. Edited <br/>
by Elinor Barnes and James A. Barnes. Introd. by Allan Nevins. <br/>
Publisher: Bloomington, Indiana University Press [1963] <br/>
<br/>
and the description of the naval fighting (added by the editor) <br/>
which involved Enomoto's doomed fleet was very intense and exciting<br/>
<br/>
through the study of the Bakumatsu Battleships one will see that the <br/>
foreigners such as the *British were influential in the the fighting <br/>
and money loaned to the kangun Imperial Army for weapons<br/>

I'm soooo jealous of Laura...she's right next to my RK Saitou (^_^)<br/>
[added: interview with the owners of the Saitou and Tokio tattoos]<br/>
Thanks wolverinesg7 and Sarah for contributing!!!!<br/>

<br/>
updated with more details ""The Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis <br/>
and Okita Soujiro" see [edits] on the page <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm</a><br/>
so basically the argument being made is:<br/>
<br/>
1) Dr. Matsumoto Ryojun knew Kondou Isami (clearly mentioned in the <br/>
Hillsborough book and also Japanese sites however we had to cite <br/>
Hillsborough on the timeline)<br/>
2) Dr. Matsumoto was a top notch physician of his day<br/>
3) Dr. Matsumoto has used opium in the treatment of people such as <br/>
Tokugawa Yoshinobu (thank you to Hirotada Tokugawa for find this <br/>
detail and translating it)<br/>
4) opium was used to treat tuberculosis (this method is totally <br/>
common)<br/>
<br/>
[conclusion: If in a fanfic you use the detail that Okita drank <br/>
opium tea to treat the *symptoms of TB then you would 99.9% <br/>
historically accurate.  Does this mean that Okita was addicted to <br/>
opium.  NOPE.  I never said that.<br/>
  <br/>
Opium was used as medicine in many many ways since ancient times and <br/>
it was such a COMMON practice.  The method of extracting opium or <br/>
just creating poppy tea was widespread in the EAst and West.  Think <br/>
of it this way...people were giving small opium pellets <br/>
to "difficult" babies who wouldn't stop crying.  It was like this <br/>
weird "cure all"]<br/>
<br/>
So please be sure to read the page carefully because I don't want <br/>
people to go around saying "oh no SHQ is saying that Okita is an <br/>
opium adduct"... LOL!!!!!!!!!</div>
