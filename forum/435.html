<h3>Kaden - Translation offer</h3>
by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-996464165">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I sent the following message two days ago, but as it is still not <br/>
showing, I decided to give it another try. Sorry if yahoo finally <br/>
behaves and if you receive two copies.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was sitting right here in front of my computer, reading the <br/>
numerous posts and feeling bad about the fact that I could get access <br/>
to such precious information without offering anything in return. But <br/>
the truth is that my knowledge of Japan history and of the world of <br/>
anime is somewhat limited. But then, I thought about a little <br/>
something<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I speak French at home and I do happen to have French copies of the <br/>
manga and of the Kaden. I know that they started publishing the manga <br/>
in English, I don&#39;t know where they&#39;re at, but I guess that it&#39;s not <br/>
very, very far. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are some interesting articles in both the Kaden and the manga. <br/>
If you are interested, and if you tell me that no translation of <br/>
these articles are easily available on the web, then I&#39;ll work on <br/>
translations of these articles and gradually post them on the ML.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the most interesting topics, in my opinion:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the manga<br/>
-The &quot;In the secret of the creation of the characters&quot; section. Each <br/>
character has one, even the more obscure characters. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the Kaden, vol. 1<br/>
-Historical note on Gensai Kawakami: the historical figure behind <br/>
Kenshin;<br/>
-Historical note on Arimoto Yamagata: the politician who accidentally <br/>
meets Kenshin in one of the first episode;<br/>
-Historical note on the Oniwabanshu;<br/>
-Historical note on occidental weapons used in RK;<br/>
-Summary of the Sekihoutai history;<br/>
-Historical note on Saito;<br/>
-Historical note on the Shinsengumi;<br/>
-Historical note on Toshimi Okubo and Toshiyoshi Kawaji: the ones <br/>
who, quite unfortunately, interrupted Saito/Kenshin fight (T-T)<br/>
-The Boshin war, the Seinan war and what links the two;<br/>
-Information on katana;<br/>
-Watsuki&#39;s sources. Unfortunately, these books have not been <br/>
translated from the Japanese. Well, I don&#39;t think so But the Kaden <br/>
do provide short summaries. <br/>
-Interview with Watsuki: general questions on his life as a mangaka <br/>
and his aspirations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the Kaden, vol. 2<br/>
-Interview with Watsuki, part one: The Tokyo Arc;<br/>
-Interview with Watsuki, part two: The Kyoto Arc;<br/>
-Interview with Watsuki, part three: The Revenge Arc;<br/>
-Interview with Watsuki, part four: the Hokkaido Arc, which, <br/>
unfortunately for Shinsengumi fans, has never seen the day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a quite busy person and also, I want to make sure that I give you <br/>
guys the best translation I can, so I won&#39;t translate everything over <br/>
one night. Tell me what would interest you the most, and I&#39;ll <br/>
establish a priority order. If some elements above don&#39;t seem to <br/>
interest anyone, they just won&#39;t be translated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what you think,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Only two copies?  I&#39;m up to 12 copies of one of Tiffany&#39;s messages <br/>
earlier today, about 8 of MissB&#39;s reply, and about the same number of <br/>
Tiffany&#39;s reply to that.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Yahoo is still working on the message delivery problem with <br/>
Groups.  Uh... I received 2 copies of their message to me.  (giggle) <br/>
Any of you continuing to have problems receiving list mail into your <br/>
inboxes (very late, multiple copies, not at all), would you contact <br/>
me off-list and let me know what you&#39;re experiencing in case Yahoo <br/>
wants more info from me to help them figure it out?  <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:spiritus_saitou@...">spiritus_saitou@...</a>)  I&#39;m sure to receive multiple copies of <br/>
it, thank you.  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485988657">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll start working on the fourth part of the interview and on <br/>
Watsuki&#39;s sources right away. Maybe you&#39;ll get them before the end of <br/>
the week-end... I&#39;m sooo slow. (T-T)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to request any other item on my list, feel free to <br/>
ask for it. I love doing translations.<br/>
