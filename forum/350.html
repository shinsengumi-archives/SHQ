<div id="ygrps-yiv-650168984">OK, so I was going through some of the posts over on the Miburo site <br/>

that there was a rumor Saito wrote a biography about himself. <br/>

have anymore information about this? I sort of doubt it exists, but <br/>
oh if it did!<br/>

This is mentioned on www.3-hajime.com that he wrote a &quot;dream diary&quot;<br/>
according to babelfish (located in the puzzles section) and gave it to<br/>
a relative however it has never been found.  It goes in the rumor or<br/>
folktale section...but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he did because other<br/>
former members of the Shinsengumi wrote their accounts to.  Besides<br/>
Nagakura SHinpachi, Nobori Nakajima also wrote a record. They lived so<br/>
intensely and I&#39;m sure they needed to think about what they were doing<br/>
etc.  If it did exist he must&#39;ve given it someone who would take care<br/>
of it...somewhere out there...<br/>
<br/>
my own speculation (so it is worthless:P):<br/>
1) it wouldn&#39;t just be about the Shinsengumi it would be about<br/>
swordsmanship and some of his spiritual beliefs as well...this is<br/>
based on my overall opinion from reading stuff on the 2 Japanese sites<br/>
and other messageboards...<br/>
a. from how he died he must&#39;ve practiced meditation throughout his<br/>
life...and on 3-hajime.com it kinda details that he sat like this<br/>
throughout the night...took some time and lots of will power that<br/>
isn&#39;t mustered at the last moments of your life but through lifelong<br/>
cultivation.<br/>
b. If he did indeed practice Mugai Ryu kenjutsu then he would attempt<br/>
to study/realize its spiritual dimension based on Buddhism...many<br/>
&quot;ryus&quot; are heavily mixed with either<br/>
Shintoism/Buddhism/Zen/Confucianism (all or three but the older the<br/>
school the more Shinto it is)...the more advanced your martial arts<br/>
level so to speak the more abstract you get (abstract can also mean<br/>
trying to realize the most simple basic tenets of your art though).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429235774">This biography, if it exists, is probably locked in the same vault as the dream diary. -_-  The post where I saw this was talking specifically about books that had written about the Shinsengumi and Saito, and then mentioned that he was supposed to have wrote his own account. I wonder if they could have heard that same rumor about the dream diary and misunderstood? I didn&#39;t think about that possibility before.<br/>
<br/>
About the Seiza thing. That reminds me of a story about Rob Roy MacGregor of Scotland. He had his family help him off his death bed so he could meet an old foe who dropped by in a way that wouldn&#39;t seem &quot;weak&quot;. Perhaps that was part of what Saito was trying to accomplish? He wanted to meet death in a way that befitted a samurai? I don&#39;t mean this as a contradiction of what you&#39;re saying. I think it goes hand in hand with it rather. Just a thought.</div>
