<h3>Good line in this article...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251311954">This is just coverage of Kaze Hikaru:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/arts/20081024TDY13001.htm">http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/arts/20081024TDY13001.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I wanted to point out this line "The mangaka is also fascinated by the <br/>
lifestyle in those days, which was totally different between Edo and Kyoto."<br/>
<br/>
It's a good reminder the "foreign-ness" of the Shinsengumi in Kyoto as <br/>
well as the Aizu troops who were also imported into the capital.  With Aizu <br/>
it's always interesting to think of it a bit like the California State Military <br/>
Reserve being asked to travel across the country to Washington D.C. and <br/>
protect it from anti-government elements, some of whom are also from <br/>
other states.  People in Kyoto must've been disturbed by the influx <br/>
of "foreigners".<br/>
<br/>
During the Meiji Era you also have a movement of government personel <br/>
from the center, Tokyo, outwards to all regions and in that era in the form <br/>
of administrators, teachers and military leaders.</div>
