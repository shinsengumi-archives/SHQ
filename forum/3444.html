I wanted to point out this line &quot;The mangaka is also fascinated by the <br/>
lifestyle in those days, which was totally different between Edo and Kyoto.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good reminder the &quot;foreign-ness&quot; of the Shinsengumi in Kyoto as <br/>
well as the Aizu troops who were also imported into the capital.  With Aizu <br/>
it&#39;s always interesting to think of it a bit like the California State Military <br/>
Reserve being asked to travel across the country to Washington D.C. and <br/>
protect it from anti-government elements, some of whom are also from <br/>
other states.  People in Kyoto must&#39;ve been disturbed by the influx <br/>
of &quot;foreigners&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
During the Meiji Era you also have a movement of government personel <br/>
from the center, Tokyo, outwards to all regions and in that era in the form <br/>
of administrators, teachers and military leaders.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439261731">in this book, Im atempting to recreate the story of the shinsengumi in my little fictionalised word, while staying true to the actual historical events and such, so all my notes and time lines and scraps collected from websites after being translated have gone poof... its on a disk &#39;somewhere&#39; in my house, but I&#39;ve NO idea where it is currently hiding.<br/>
