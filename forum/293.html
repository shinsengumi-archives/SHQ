<h3>PMK &quot;Ending&quot; (CONTAINS SPOILERS)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207724317">I just finished watching PMK...it seems to be a really good &quot;industry&quot; <br/>
ending because it can be both a series ending or a season ending.<br/>
<br/>
I am totally confused by interaction between Yoshida and Tetsu.<br/>
Ofcourse Yoshida killed Tetsu/Tatsu&#39;s parents that is how he recognized <br/>
Tetsu in Shimabara in the first place right?  Then how come Yoshida <br/>
says &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about&quot; to Tetsu at Ikedaya?  <br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the Yamazaki Susumu/Ayunee &quot;switch&quot; very much...very cool.<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu and S.H. are my absolute favorites however S.H. is <br/>
still a very underdeveloped character grrrrr.  S.H. is always <br/>
alone...couldn&#39;t they make him hangout with the guys just once in ep. 24 <br/>
during the fireworks?  He was just walking like that:(<br/>
<br/>
There is alot of potential in the series but it would be totally flaky if Suzu <br/>
goes crazy and that would be his only motivation...which is sadly where <br/>
the series is heading with him carrying around Yoshida&#39;s head and <br/>
stuff.  I never understood the Suzu and Yoshida bond...like big deal <br/>
Yoshida comforted Suzu on the beach and encouraged Suzu to seek <br/>
revenge but it&#39;s still sooo shallow.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The was some speculation on some message board or other that I can&#39;t <br/>
recall either LJ or the AnimeForever one that said maybe it wasn&#39;t <br/>
Yoshida who killed them but that it could have been Hijikata since the <br/>
similarities between their looks and attitude. Personally I think <br/>
Yoshida was such a bad character and that he killed so many who <br/>
disagreed with his views that he just didn&#39;t remember--as in they were <br/>
too unimportant for him to remember. He did seem to recognize Tetsu in <br/>
Shimabara.<br/>

guessing the bond was a result of Yoshida being all Suzu had in the <br/>
world as his brother&#39;s death made him an orphan?<br/>
