<div id="ygrps-yiv-646964837"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Subject: Picture from Aizu Festival!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I was unable to upload to the Aizu Festival album,<br/>
I uploaded the pictures to the &quot;root&quot; album. They are<br/>
the last three pictures.<br/>
<br/>
The first is a picture of the Aizu Shinsengumi parade.<br/>
There was another Shinsengumi people in the parade,<br/>
but they were from Hino, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
The second picture is Yamamoto Koji (Hijikata<br/>
Toshizo).<br/>
<br/>
The third is Sho Ei (Shimada Kai / Ginga Blue).<br/>

Your pictures look fine ^_^ <br/>
also I am working on fanart of Nakano Takeko of Aizu&#39;s Women&#39;s Brigade<br/>
to commemorate this celebration in the castle town.<br/>
Hino-shinsengumi.com club is EXTREMELY active and they have been<br/>
discussing their participation for weeks so I&#39;m glad you got to see<br/>
them.  Just so everyone knows after the memorial for Saitou, there is<br/>
going to be the 4th annual Shinsengumi symposium (aren&#39;t we all<br/>
envious?)...so this is happening on Sat 25 in Japan...around Friday<br/>
24th night time in the USA anyone with DSL should watch the streaming<br/>
movies at the Aizu/Fukushima website (go to shinsengumimb.com &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Shinsengumi History&gt;&gt;&gt; AIZU to get the links).<br/>
