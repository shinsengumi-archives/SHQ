<h3>Shinsengumi Bus Tour! Complete and Unabridged!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244978213">Okay... We've talked about this before.... OMG... I want to go... If <br/>
anyone is serious enough to go next year, count me in...<br/>
<br/>
The site is in Japanese and YES babelfish is our friend for now.. If <br/>
you want to see this great tour... <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The tour starts with the Ishin shishi sites, the Restoration mansion <br/>
(yeah what did you expect! just kidding). <br/>
<br/>
Click next at the bottom<br/>
<br/>
This part of the tour shows the home of Katsura and Ikumatsu. If you <br/>
remember the RK OVAs then this should look familiar... There's <br/>
actually some sort of info (I'm not really sure as babelfish is <br/>
weird), that the Shinsengumi attacked the place and Katsura had <br/>
Ikumatsu hide in the big chest (don't worry you won't miss it). <br/>
There's a picture of Ikumatsu (not far from how she was drawn in <br/>
RK). Looks like she was also a Geisha? (not sure) <br/>
Then there seems to be a restaurant inside the Restoration mansion? <br/>
<br/>
Oh of course the prices are there too.<br/>
<br/>
Click next at the bottom<br/>
<br/>
I think it mentioned that they visited the Ikeda house but I'm not <br/>
sure about the pictures... <br/>
<br/>
There are pictures of what I'd say castles, probably the official <br/>
headquarters in Kyoto? I'm not sure please clarify this for me. <br/>
Thanks...<br/>
<br/>
Then they leave for the good part, the Maekawa residence (where the <br/>
Shinsengumi stayed after they separated I think from Serizawa Kamo?)<br/>
There is a shot of the corridor, shot of the house outside and a <br/>
shot of the storehouse. The storehouse is an interesting thing <br/>
because most tours I've read do let you go inside.<br/>
<br/>
Click next <br/>
<br/>
This is inside the storehouse... The floors are removable? What for?<br/>
There's also the low ceiling and the pulley there. The webmaster <br/>
said probably for torture... Remember RK OVA again... I think it was <br/>
in the directors cut, a footage was shown about this. More removable <br/>
floors... Finally what is that wood panel with the name Shinsengumi <br/>
on it? A postcard... <br/>
<br/>
Then contact information! I REALLY WANT TO GO!<br/>
<br/>
click next<br/>
<br/>
Yagi residence headquarters of Shinsengumi... I think this is where <br/>
Serizawa Kamo was forced to commit seppuku (not sure as usual... I'm <br/>
bad at this)... Bunches of pictures of the house... PLUS Shinsengumi <br/>
merchandise... I really want that UNIFORM... Last interesting note <br/>
for me is the Heshou Well, it says it has been in existence while <br/>
our bishies stayed there. I'm not sure what they meant when they <br/>
started talking about the "stones"... More yagi residence pictures...<br/>
<br/>
The tour was conducted by bus for one day, back in June 2003.<br/>
