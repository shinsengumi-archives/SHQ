 </span></blockquote>only two things:<br/>
<br/>
- The first "Sugimura Yoshitaro" is miswritten as<br/>
"Sugimaru"<br/>
<br/>

    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.<br/>
  I have created over a thousand blades.<br/>
       Unknown to Death.<br/>
   Nor known to Life.<br/>
Have withstood pain to create many weapons.<br/>
     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.<br/>
         So as I pray, unlimited blade works."<br/>
