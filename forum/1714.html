Also, check to see if you have International Channel available.  It just recently became a part of my cable programming as well as offering a family of premium channels in some areas.  Quite a bit of Japanese programming, from J-Pop on Fridays, NHK news in the mornings (but no Shinsengumi!... yet), movies and dramas, and anime.  They're currently showing an 11-episode drama called "To the One I Love" on Sundays at 9PM<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205168538">Pop Japan TV on the International Channel is cool on Friday nights . .<br/>
.my husband and I have been watching for almost a year.  Also, on Sunday<br/>
nights (10 pm EST) they air Hey Hey Hey Music champ, which is a music<br/>
variety show that shows a lot of popular J-pop artists.  Judy and Mary<br/>
were even on once performing the opening theme to Rurouni Kenshin.  ^_^<br/>
The down side is it's not sub-titled, but it's fun getting a chance to<br/>
hear the variety of music they offer.<br/>
