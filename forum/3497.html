<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508064354">I've been studying/reading about the Shinsengumi for a few years now. I realized over that time, that it was become a very popular subject for modern culture/entertainment. <br/>
<br/>
I have read/watched many different representations of the Shinsengumi. I really have enjoyed them all. Then I found this: <br/>

<br/>
This manga seems really great. I like that they address life as the Shinsengumi was forming & coming under the leadership of Kondo-san, Hijikata-san, & Yamanami-san. <br/>
This manga seems to have been dropped as a project for English translations. I know it has 5 volumes published in Japan, but I can't seem to find any way to get my hands on this manga. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that this post complies with this community's posting regulations. If not, please let me know. <br/>
If anyone does have news on this manga, I would really be grateful! I'm always looking for new material, even in Japanese. :)</div>
