<h3>Retreat, Revival, and Kondou dismissing the Shinsengumi</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140994082">This is, to my knowledge, largely unprecedented information appearing in <br/>
English on the Shinsengumi. It deals with them at their low point, after <br/>
Toba-Fushimi and before Aizu. The text below is my compilation of the facts <br/>
from two sources-- Akama Shizuko's book on Saitou Hajime (Shinsengumi Saitou <br/>
Hajime no Subete) and Nagakura Shinpachi's own memoir "Shinsengumi <br/>
Tenmatsu-ki"<br/>
<br/>
Any errors in translation are my own.<br/>
<br/>
-M.<br/>
---<br/>
Following the disastrous defeat at Toba-Fushimi, the Shinsengumi headed to <br/>
Edo, the Shogun's capital, by sea. (Akama 99) They were split up between two <br/>
vessels-- the frigate Fujiyama-maru and the merchantman Jundo-maru. Kondou <br/>
Isami (wounded since his departure from Kyoto) and the other wounded men <br/>
were on the Fujiyama-Maru. (Akama 99)<br/>
<br/>
-Jundo-maru shipped out on the 1st of February (Gregorian calendar) and <br/>
arrived in Shinagawa (near Edo) on the 4th. The 63 Shinsengumi men who were <br/>
on board disembarked and got shelter at a local kettle-vendor (Kamaya). <br/>
(Akama 99)<br/>
<br/>
-Fujiyama-maru waited for the wind to change, and shipped out on the 3rd of <br/>
February, arriving in Yokohama on the 14th. The remaining Shinsengumi men-- <br/>
22, who were heavily wounded-- were immediately taken to the Yokohama <br/>
Hospital. (Akama 99) The next day, the Fujiyama-maru entered Shinagawa, and <br/>
Kondou and Okita disembarked together, entering the Kanda Igakusho (Medical <br/>
Center). Based on this evidence, Akama Shizuko believes that 29 others, <br/>
including Yamaguchi Jiro (Saitou Hajime), accompanied them. However, these <br/>
men did not enter the medical center, instead finding accomodations in the <br/>
Imado area and receiving medical treatment there. It's said that a man from <br/>
Asakusa named Danzaemon looked after them. (Akama 100)<br/>
<br/>
As the Shinsengumi men rested and recovered (including Saitou Hajime), a new <br/>
headquarters was provided for them-- the former residence of Lord Akizuki <br/>
Ukyo no Suke, within Kajibashi Gate. (Akama 101) First to arrive there were <br/>
the men who were staying in Shinagawa at the kettle vendor, then the wounded <br/>
men. While they rested there, small groups would be sent out for security <br/>
duties. On March 5 (Western Calendar-- 2/12 old), Tokugawa Yoshinobu entered <br/>
kinshin at Kan'eiji Temple in Ueno, and the Shinsengumi, deploying on a <br/>
rotating basis in small units, served as security for him from the 8th to <br/>
the 18th of March. (Akama 101) They were relieved of duty because of orders <br/>
to deploy to KAI PROVINCE.<br/>
<br/>
Katsu Kaishu, who was in charge of much of Bakufu affairs at the time, was a <br/>
supporter of peaceful surrender, so it's said that he ordered Shinsengumi <br/>
(supporters of armed resistance) to deploy westward-- to the neighboring Kai <br/>
province, which the "Imperial" army was aiming for-- as an expedient for <br/>
eliminating them. However, the official Yuuki Munizou indicates that "The <br/>
junior councilor Nagai (Naoyuki) came up with the plan...Katsu and the <br/>
others were against it at first, but they couldn't do much to resist."<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, when Kondou was captured and questioned, he indicated that Okubo <br/>
Ichio (NOT the Satsuma Okubo...) had ordered the deployment, so in reality, <br/>
it probably wasn't Katsu's or Nagai's order to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
The Shinsengumi Leaders as Daimyo- Status on Paper<br/>
<br/>
On the occasion of their deployment to Kai Province, a promise was made to <br/>
Kondou and his men. In a long tradition of such orders (dating back to <br/>
pre-Warring States era), IF they could be victorious, they could have the <br/>
province for themselves. Kai was Bakufu land worth 1 million koku, and it <br/>
was to be divided as such:<br/>
<br/>
Kondou: 100,000 koku<br/>
Hijikata: 50,000 koku<br/>
The Captains (including Saitou Hajime): 30,000 koku each<br/>
Other supervisors: 10,000 koku each<br/>
<br/>
(Akama 102)<br/>
<br/>
There were also other symbols of rank that they were given in a hurry. <br/>
Kondou was given the rank of a Bakufu Junior Councilor, and was allowed to <br/>
ride in his own palanquin. Hijikata received the rank of a yoriai <br/>
(high-ranking hatamoto), and was given a horse (It was also at this time <br/>
that he started wearing his hair Western-style). The captains received the <br/>
rank and privileges of average hatamoto, and were allowed to wear the riding <br/>
caps of hatamoto. (Akama 103)<br/>
<br/>
-At the time, Shinsengumi numbered only around 80 men. To this was to be <br/>
added the previously mentioned Danzaemon's unit of 100 men trained in the <br/>
Western style, and the unit became the Koyochinbutai-- Kai Province <br/>
Pacification Unit. (Akama 102)<br/>
<br/>
The official orders came through on March 21. On the 20th, Shinsengumi had <br/>
received 2400 ryo of war funds, along with a number of large cannons and <br/>
rifles. With their money and new weapons in hand, they moved out on the <br/>
22nd, camping at Naito-Shinjuku, where they joined with Danzaemon's men. <br/>
(Akama 102)<br/>
<br/>
On the 24th they stopped at Fuchu, and the next day they paused at Kondou <br/>
and Hijikata's old neighborhood of Hino, where they met with Hijikata's <br/>
brother in law, Sato Hikogoro. Sato Hikogoro's privately-funded unit of 22 <br/>
men, the Kasugatai, joined Kondou, and this brought the unit strength up to <br/>
200.<br/>
<br/>
On the 27th they went through Sasago Pass, coming to Komakai Village, where <br/>
they received the news that the "Imperial" army had entered Kofu Castle-- <br/>
the center of Kai province. They pressed ahead to nearby Tanaka to <br/>
investigate-- and it was at this time that Danzaemon's men-- more than half <br/>
the unit strength-- suddenly got up and left. This left the Koyochinbutai <br/>
with 121 men. (Akama 103)<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Hijikata went back to Edo to get reinforcements, and Kondou <br/>
moved the men to the area of Daizenji Temple, near Katsunuma. Setting up a <br/>
barrier, he had the men light watchfires and waited until morning. (Akama <br/>
103)<br/>
<br/>
**NAGAKURA's take**<br/>
<br/>
-Nagakura says that the warships were the Fujiyama-maru and Jutoku-maru. <br/>
(Nagakura 164)<br/>
<br/>
-Also, he clarifies that "Kamaya" was not a "kettle shop," but it was the <br/>
name of a small inn. (Nagakura 165)<br/>
<br/>
-Also says that the HQ Shinsengumi received was the former residence of <br/>
Torii Tango no Kami. (Nagakura 165)<br/>
<br/>
-Nagakura says "At Toba-Fushimi, we lost Inoue Genzaburo, Yamazaki Susumu, <br/>
Accounting Officer Aoki Makidayu, Corporal Ito Tetsugoro, Ikeda Kotaro, and <br/>
around 20 others." (Nagakura 165)<br/>
<br/>
-Yamakawa Kenjiro wrote a letter to Nagakura's son, "The Issue Concerning <br/>
Those Responsible for Sakamoto Ryoma's Murder"-- and says that he doesn't <br/>
believe that it was Harada. (pp. 238-241)<br/>
<br/>
-Kondou took initiative and on 3/3 (what dating system??) Shinsengumi <br/>
acquired a 70-man cavalry unit, the Kibatai (literally "Cavalry Unit"). (p. <br/>
170)<br/>
<br/>
-They heard that Kofu Castle has fallen, and then Danzaemon got up and left. <br/>
This had them down to 121 men. The men got nervous and approach Harada and <br/>
Nagakura, saying "If we don't get reinforced, we don't want to die for <br/>
nothing." Harada and Nagakura went to Kondou, who said "It's not good for <br/>
them to be un-warrior-ly. By the way, I'm having a unit of 300 Aizu men <br/>
reinforce us at dawn." Meanwhile, Hijikata was in Kanagawa, trying to get <br/>
ahold of the Natsubatai, a hatamoto unit. (p. 171)<br/>
<br/>
-Iwakura Tomomi was at Kofu Castle and he knew Kondou was near. So he sent <br/>
out a messenger who said "Bakufu-Koyochinbutai commander Okubo Takeshi, <br/>
Prince Iwakura wants to see you." (Okubo Takeshi was Kondou's assumed name) <br/>
And Kondou said "I'll greet him with my guns." (p. 172)<br/>
<br/>
-Nagakura got 10 men and a 20 local hunters and headed to Mukoyama, where <br/>
there were imperial troops in a farmer's house. The hunters turned traitor <br/>
and started shooting at Nagakura and his men. (p. 172)<br/>
<br/>
-At this point they realized that Kondou had lied about Aizu reinforcements. <br/>
(p. 172)<br/>
<br/>
-Everyone started running in the direction of Kobotoke Pass. Nagakura's <br/>
detachment caught up-- Harada and Nagakura got horses and tried catching up <br/>
with the main unit, and made it to Yoshino-juku. (p. 172)<br/>
<br/>
-Kondou had decided that he was going to make his stand at Yoshino-juku. <br/>
Nagakura could not trust Kondou anymore, and so he left, making all the way <br/>
to Hachioji before realizing that he still had hopes of joining Aizu and <br/>
fighting for the Tokugawa house. So he thought "It can't be helped. I have <br/>
to go back to Shinsengumi, talk to Kondou, and convince him to put things in <br/>
perspective and head to Aizu." So he returned and spoke with Kondou. Kondou <br/>
took a deep breath and went "I want to die in battle at Aizu Castle, myself. <br/>
I leave the men to you Nagakura and Harada. Take them back to Edo, and we'll <br/>
regroup there." (p. 173)<br/>
<br/>
-The survivors made it to Edo, and headquartered themselves at Okubo Shuzen <br/>
no Kami's former residence in Honjo futatsu-me. However, Kondou hadn't made <br/>
it back yet, so most of the men slipped away-- leaving Nagakura, Harada, <br/>
Shimada Kai, Yada Kennosuke, and others. 10 men in all. (p. 174)<br/>
<br/>
-Nagakura and the others tried regrouping the AWOL men (some of whom were <br/>
off in Shin-Yoshiwara), and succeeded in regrouping many of them. They <br/>
decided that they were to head to Aizu, where they would make their stand. <br/>
They found Kondou-- who had since made it back and was at the Izumi-bashi <br/>
Medical Center-- and explained their decision to him. Kondou said, "I will <br/>
not be part of any closed-door decisions of yours. I'll only allow this if <br/>
you all become my retainers." Nagakura responded with "It is disloyal for a <br/>
samurai to serve two masters. I will not become your retainer." Nagakura, <br/>
Harada, and Yada left. (pp. 174-175) (NOTE: Bear in mind that the <br/>
Shinsengumi "served" the Tokugawa already, having been officially recognized <br/>
as hatamoto since 1867)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-Kondou, having thus alienated the last of his former Shinsengumi men, was <br/>
joined by Hijikata Toshizo, who helped him raise a force once again. Taking <br/>
the name Okubo Yamato, he went to Nagareyama, where, picking up stragglers <br/>
from the Bakufu army, he brought his force strength to above 110. It was at <br/>
Nagareyama that Kondou fought for the last time and was captured. He tried <br/>
to escape under his alias, but in the Imperial camp was Kano Washio <br/>
(Michinosuke), who had been a member of Ito Kashitaro's faction-- and who <br/>
recognized Kondou immediately. Kagawa Keizou, an Imperial officer, commended <br/>
Kondou's bravery and suggested that. he surrender. Kondou replied with "Is <br/>
the kangun the Emperor's army or Satsuma and Choshu's army? I can't tell..." <br/>
Kondou was executed on Keio 4, 4/25 (Japanese calendar), dying at age 35. <br/>
Hijikata Toshizo, upon hearing this, escaped Nagareyama, and fought on, <br/>
finally dying in battle at Hakodate in Meiji 2. At death, he was the same <br/>
age-- 35. (pp. 175-176)<br/>

<br/>
For those of us who have Hillsborough's SHINSENGUMI:THE SHOGUN'S LAST<br/>
SAMURAI CORPS you may want to compare the info in the post with the<br/>
narrative he provided in the chapter "The Peasant as Feudal Lord"<br/>
<br/>
I have only remembered that Kondou used the name Okubo Yamato, so I'm<br/>
glad Hirotada mentioned that KOndou had also used the name Okubo<br/>
Takeshi *earlier<br/>

<br/>
******************************<br/>
sorry for this second post...I was cutting and pasting and made an<br/>
error (^_^;)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Sakamoto's murder...it was pinned on the Shinsengumi with a<br/>
piece of "evidence", Harada's sword sheath.  Thus, Yamakawa Kenjiro<br/>
tried to examine the situation further with Nagakura's son.<br/>
<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro (1854-1931) is an Aizu figure connected to Fujita<br/>
Goro.  You may read about him here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>
and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm</a><br/>
he was a family friend of the Fujitas.<br/>
<br/>
so the signficance of Yamakawa's interest in the Sakamoto murder is<br/>
that an Aizu figure contributing to Meiji Era research on the<br/>
Shinsengumi---which is not strange at all.<br/>
<br/>
Yamakawa Kenjiro (he is called Yamaken by his fans) was a careful and<br/>
patient researcher who compiled the 700 page book AIZU BOSHIN SENSHI<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm</a><br/>
I scanned the entire book so if anyone here who studies Japanese would<br/>
like to try reading it just email me...and yes Hijikata and Kondou and<br/>
the rest are all in it.<br/>
<br/>
******************************<br/>
speaking about errors<br/>
<br/>
I will make this correction to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>
as soon as possible<br/>
<br/>
I had erroneously typed " Empress Dowager" (emperor Meiji's mother--he<br/>
actually had 2) when really Fujita GOro at one point guarded the<br/>
EMPRESS <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F:Empress_Shoken.jpg">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F:Empress_Shoken.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
the confusion occurred due to the name "Shoken" which was the other<br/>
name of "Haruko" the empress<br/>
<br/>
this in fact changes everything.  Originally, I had believed that<br/>
Fujita would be in the IMperial Guard Unit #2 (even for temporary<br/>
assignments) which guarded the Emperor's mother.  However, now that we<br/>
know he guarded the empress he would be part of an entire different<br/>
unit altogether...Unit #1 which guarded the Emperor, Empress and<br/>
direct heirs (all the children)<br/>
<br/>
we do have testimony from Tokio's niece stating that Uncle Goro had<br/>
commented on the beauty of the Empress<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for this error...I caught it while typind a bio for Saitou<br/>
Hajime...fortunately most of the essay is derived from English sources<br/>
(because the bulk of the text deals with post 1868 stuff) </span></blockquote></div>
