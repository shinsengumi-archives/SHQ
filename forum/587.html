I know that back at the Miburo Y.G. we discussed the years in which<br/>
some members of the Shinsengumi were born in.  Refresh my memory was<br/>
S.H. born in the Year of the Dragon 1844 many calculators don't go<br/>
that far back?  And we'll probably never know what year Okita was born<br/>
in since there is conflicting info on how old he was when he died.</div>
