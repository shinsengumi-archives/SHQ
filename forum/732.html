<h3>Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete info</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-479586641">Well, although I&#39;m very limited on internet usage for awhile (I just <br/>
got back from college), I&#39;m working on some things for our group. <br/>
Having gone through the beginning of &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no <br/>
Subete&quot;, I can tell you guys some things:<br/>
<br/>
1. The name Fujita Gorou was given to SH by Matsudaira Katamori.<br/>
2. One of Tokio&#39;s sisters married the son of Sagawa Kanbei, the chief <br/>
retainer of Aizu.<br/>
3. One of Saitou&#39;s grandsons is named Makoto (not THAT makoto, <br/>
though).<br/>
4. Remember Tatsuo&#39;s original family, Numazawa? Well it turns out <br/>
that the Numazawa family was already related to Tokio, on her <br/>
mother&#39;s side.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also working on translating the family tree, which is somewhat <br/>
difficult given the amount of &quot;older&quot; characters in the names that <br/>
aren&#39;t used very much today. As soon as it&#39;s done, I&#39;ll upload it.<br/>

<br/>
family tree...do you want me to scan the family tree and then put your<br/>
translations next to each name so everyone can understand it?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you get a chance to relax this summer<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So THAT&#39;s what it was trying to say! I had read something on 3-hajime.com about Fujita being a &quot;gift&quot; name, but I couldn&#39;t tell who gave it to him! Thanks for clearing that up!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, please-- I&#39;ll get you the tree once it&#39;s more or less complete (I think <br/>
there&#39;ll be a few of the oldest names in the tree that I won&#39;t be able to <br/>
decipher). My laptop will have internet access again soon (during my brief <br/>
return to school in June), so I&#39;ll be able to get it to you relatively soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
