<h3>Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete info</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-479586641">Well, although I'm very limited on internet usage for awhile (I just <br/>
got back from college), I'm working on some things for our group. <br/>
Having gone through the beginning of "Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no <br/>
Subete", I can tell you guys some things:<br/>
<br/>
1. The name Fujita Gorou was given to SH by Matsudaira Katamori.<br/>
2. One of Tokio's sisters married the son of Sagawa Kanbei, the chief <br/>
retainer of Aizu.<br/>
3. One of Saitou's grandsons is named Makoto (not THAT makoto, <br/>
though).<br/>
4. Remember Tatsuo's original family, Numazawa? Well it turns out <br/>
that the Numazawa family was already related to Tokio, on her <br/>
mother's side.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also working on translating the family tree, which is somewhat <br/>
difficult given the amount of "older" characters in the names that <br/>
aren't used very much today. As soon as it's done, I'll upload it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
family tree...do you want me to scan the family tree and then put your<br/>
translations next to each name so everyone can understand it?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you get a chance to relax this summer<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So THAT's what it was trying to say! I had read something on 3-hajime.com about Fujita being a "gift" name, but I couldn't tell who gave it to him! Thanks for clearing that up!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, please-- I'll get you the tree once it's more or less complete (I think <br/>
there'll be a few of the oldest names in the tree that I won't be able to <br/>
decipher). My laptop will have internet access again soon (during my brief <br/>
return to school in June), so I'll be able to get it to you relatively soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
