<h3>Ibaraki Tsukasa&#39;s death</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890483820">I&#39;m finding conflicting information for the death of Tsukasa.  The<br/>
Shinsengumi book I have (Blood and Makoto: Shinsengumi - Honor and<br/>
Determination of the Mibu Roshi) says that he was killed by Ooishi<br/>
Kuwajiro (and others) after trying to leave the Shinsengumi (&quot;He made<br/>
a request to leave the Shinsengumi, however it was not accepted, and<br/>
he was *put to the sword* [zansatsu] by Ooishi Kuwajirou (and<br/>
others)&quot;, but the Japanese Wikipedia states he commited suicide. As a<br/>
general rule, I disbelieve wikipedia first, but I&#39;m still curious. I<br/>
did notice on the Shinsengumi HQ site he is listed as showing up on<br/>
the grave for Kondo and Hijikata he is listed as one of the people who<br/>
&quot;Died of Illness, Executed, Assassinated, or otherwise Died Under<br/>

By the way, have you finished reading the book yet? Please disregard the mixed-up info on<br/>
p.182-p.183 (regarding the members&#39; origins). On one hand, the editor(s) put Nagakura <br/>
and Saitou under the Musashi scetion, but they put question marks after their names; on <br/>
the other hand, they put Okita under the Mutsu section. The editor(s) couldn&#39;t tell the <br/>
difference between one&#39;s place of birth and one&#39;s clan???<br/>

Are there questions on where Nagakura and the others with question marks came from? <br/>
Perhaps there are questions regarding a few members&#39; origins (2-3 at most).<br/>
<br/>
For example, Nagakura was born in Matsumae-han&#39;s residence in Edo. (clan=Matsumae of <br/>
Ezo, place of birth=Edo, Musashi). Okita was born in Shirakawa-han&#39;s residence in Edo. <br/>
(clan=Shirakawa of Mutsu, place of birth=Edo, Musashi).  <br/>
<br/>
If the editor(s) had wanted to list everyone&#39;s clan, then Nagakura should&#39;ve been under Ezo <br/>
section instead (and without a question mark).  If they had wanted to list everyone&#39;s place <br/>
of birth, then Okita should&#39;ve been under Musashi section instead.  <br/>
