<h3>Ibaraki Tsukasa&#39;s death</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-890483820">I'm finding conflicting information for the death of Tsukasa.  The<br/>
Shinsengumi book I have (Blood and Makoto: Shinsengumi - Honor and<br/>
Determination of the Mibu Roshi) says that he was killed by Ooishi<br/>
Kuwajiro (and others) after trying to leave the Shinsengumi ("He made<br/>
a request to leave the Shinsengumi, however it was not accepted, and<br/>
he was *put to the sword* [zansatsu] by Ooishi Kuwajirou (and<br/>
others)", but the Japanese Wikipedia states he commited suicide. As a<br/>
general rule, I disbelieve wikipedia first, but I'm still curious. I<br/>
did notice on the Shinsengumi HQ site he is listed as showing up on<br/>
the grave for Kondo and Hijikata he is listed as one of the people who<br/>
"Died of Illness, Executed, Assassinated, or otherwise Died Under<br/>
Unusual Circumstances".</div>

commited suicide (later in the same book). So I guess it just plain<br/>
unknown what really happened.</div>

By the way, have you finished reading the book yet? Please disregard the mixed-up info on<br/>
p.182-p.183 (regarding the members' origins). On one hand, the editor(s) put Nagakura <br/>
and Saitou under the Musashi scetion, but they put question marks after their names; on <br/>
the other hand, they put Okita under the Mutsu section. The editor(s) couldn't tell the <br/>
difference between one's place of birth and one's clan???<br/>

<br/>
Are there questions on where Nagakura and the others with question marks came from? <br/>
Perhaps there are questions regarding a few members' origins (2-3 at most).<br/>
<br/>
For example, Nagakura was born in Matsumae-han's residence in Edo. (clan=Matsumae of <br/>
Ezo, place of birth=Edo, Musashi). Okita was born in Shirakawa-han's residence in Edo. <br/>
(clan=Shirakawa of Mutsu, place of birth=Edo, Musashi).  <br/>
<br/>
If the editor(s) had wanted to list everyone's clan, then Nagakura should've been under Ezo <br/>
section instead (and without a question mark).  If they had wanted to list everyone's place <br/>
of birth, then Okita should've been under Musashi section instead.  <br/>

suicide, is it conceivable that for whatever reason this was to<br/>
conceal the truth of his assassination?  At the moment I can't think<br/>
of a much better reason beyond preserving his honor or memory, but if<br/>
he had "friends" in the Shinsengumi, they might have wanted to give<br/>
him that much(?) But I don't know how things worked within the group<br/>
all that well, so this off the cuff thought of mine could be<br/>
completely wrong. Just wondering if something like this is unheard of.</div>
