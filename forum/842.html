<h3>Info about the last battle Harada participated in.</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-54968544">More from the book on Saigo, The Last Samurai. This time about the <br/>
Shogitai. This is the group Sano Harada joined after parting with the <br/>
Shinsengumi. Most believe he died during this battle, commonly known <br/>
as the Ueno War. It's a whole paragraph, so I'll quote the whole <br/>
passage for you:<br/>
<br/>
"...In both Edo and the northeast there was talk of continued war <br/>
against the "wicked traitors".<br/>
<br/>
Saigo faced this looming crisis firsthand in Edo. The city was <br/>
patrolled by the Shogitai, or "League to Demonstrate Righteousness," <br/>
a newly formed brigade of former shogunal soldiers. These troops had <br/>
helped keep peace and order during the surrender of Edo Castle, but <br/>
now they bristled at the thought of abandoning the shogun's capital <br/>
to Satsuma forces. From their base at Kan'eiji Temple at the top of <br/>
Ueno Hill they mocked imperial troops, and by 1868/i4 they had begun <br/>
attacking imperial patrols. Katsu attempted to restrain them, but to <br/>
no effect. Saigo, although concerned, was reluctant to rush a <br/>
confrontation. With so many imperial troops in the northeast and <br/>
rural Kanto, imperial forces in Edo were actually outnumbered. At a <br/>
command meeting on 5/1 Saigo argued against attacking until <br/>
reinforcements arrived, but the Choshu commander, Omura Masujiro, <br/>
disagreed. The imperial government had plans to make Edo its new <br/>
capital, and shogunal forces would therefore have to be eliminated. <br/>
Saigo still had his reservations, but when the Shogitai escalated its <br/>
attacks on Satsuma forces, he relented. The final assault was set for <br/>
5/15. At dawn that day imperial forces attacked the Shogitai. <br/>
Satsuma's forces rushed the gates of Kan'eiji head-on and met fierce <br/>
resistance. After a frustrating delay, Choshu forces launched an <br/>
attack on the rear of the temple compound, but not before Satsuma had <br/>
suffered heavy losses. Despite the poor coordination and the <br/>
Shogitai's superior numbers, by evening the Shogitai was defeated. <br/>
The shogunal capital was now an imperial capital. Two months later <br/>
the city was renamed Tokyo, or "Eastern Capital"."<br/>
<br/>
No mention of who lead the Shogitai still. Katsu refers to Katsu <br/>
Kaishu, who was at one point in charge of the Tokugawa armed forces.<br/>
