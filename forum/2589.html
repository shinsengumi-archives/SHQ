<h3>Fujita Goro and Jigoro Kano (the founder of  Judo)</h3>

<br/>
For several months now, rather than get headaches reading Japanese<br/>
sites via online software I focused on relevant sources in English<br/>
which would  yield details on the life of both Fujita Goro and Fujita<br/>
Tokio(ko).  Most things in English, deal with the Meiji era.<br/>
<br/>
It is actually our good fortune that both Mr. and Mrs. Fujita worked<br/>
at a high profile school known as Tokyo Women's NOrmal School (later<br/>
Tokyo Women's Higher NOrmal School and then Ochanomizo).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I used Tokio's cousin as an anchor in the research.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout this time I had no idea who the "other" principal who kept<br/>
switching with Takamine Hideo (tokio's cousin) of the school was.<br/>
<br/>
A Japanese thread was discussing Mr. Fujita's work not only as an<br/>
office clerk but a teacher of kenjutsu at the Normal School (for men).<br/>
 SAdly, the posters were wrestling with the structure of the school<br/>
and timeline --- lucky for me I had been obsessing over Tokio's cousin<br/>
and understood some of the educational structure.<br/>
They did not cite their textual source---but their hint was good enough.<br/>
<br/>
The other principal was Jigoro Kano.<br/>
Please see this timeline <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4795/kano.html">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4795/kano.html</a><br/>
he became principal after Takamine Hideo resigned in 1893 (technically<br/>
forced to resign). <br/>
After Takamine returned in 1897, Kano resigned so they alternated.<br/>
Kano returns in 1901 (which coincides with the beginning of Takamine's<br/>
struggle with severe depression however he remained an influential<br/>
figure).<br/>
<br/>
ok let's compare with Goro's timeline<br/>
he works at the education museum in 1891<br/>
gets a job at Tokyo Women's Normal School in 1899<br/>
<br/>
the structure of the hierarchy of the Normal Schools (teacher training<br/>
academy) was like this<br/>
<br/>
Tokyo Normal School (men)<br/>
Tokyo Women's Normal School (women)<br/>
Educational Museum<br/>
<br/>
it was like a giant pyramid with overlapping faculty, staff and even<br/>
budget...students of both normal schools even used material right out<br/>
of the museum and frequently the top tier staff held concurrent<br/>
positions in the museum<br/>
<br/>
the Museum was used for the purpose of "object teaching" which was the<br/>
style used at both normal schools and nationwide--this is why the<br/>
museum was another branch of the schools<br/>
<br/>
KOdokan Judo (Jigoro Kano's claim to fame) was the OFFICIAL<br/>
competition to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department<br/>
it was always of interest to me how Kodokan Judo/dojo had a minor Aizu<br/>
connection and at one time located in the same ward as the Fujita<br/>
household<br/>
<br/>
JIgoro Kano in partnership with Dr. Baelz (German who treated many VIP<br/>
Meiji figures) were able to introduce modern kendo and judo (to a<br/>
lesser extent) into the education system.  Kendo was favored because<br/>
it was more safe.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time believing that the principal, an accomplished<br/>
martial artist, and deeply interested in Physical Education was<br/>
completely oblivious to a member of the office staff who was also a<br/>
practitioner of kenjutsu.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving his position at the school I believe TAkamine would be<br/>
sure to point out which members of the faculty and staff Kano should<br/>
care for.  Takamine would be sure to highlight their special talents<br/>
as well.  AFterall the Mr. and Mrs. Fujita were both family and friend<br/>
to Takamine.<br/>
<br/>
Principals also had access to all resumes of the staff---how would<br/>
Kano, who dealt with the TMPD not be interested in former assistant<br/>
inspector Fujita who also worked as body guard to Inoue Kaoru and<br/>
Empress Dowager?</div>
