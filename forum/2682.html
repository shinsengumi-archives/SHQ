<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045260703">sorry to bother the list again, <br/>
generally due to time constraints I'm not sure what I can accomplish <br/>
in a day and it would be better if I can compile everything into one <br/>
super long post for everyone's convenience but because this server <br/>
will be shut down ***ANY DAY NOW I just wanted people who have never <br/>
seen this to grab it<br/>
<br/>
this file is<br/>
1) not the sequel we all want to see<br/>
2) it is the SHINSENGUMI! Theme song performed by a chorus and it <br/>
does sound really good<br/>

Tama gave it to us ::thank you::<br/>

I don't know anything about torrents/seeding etc so perhaps this <br/>
special has already been made available elsewhere<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983309517">ok<br/>
<br/>
I got an email report about this server<br/>
whoever is downloading ALL MY FILES ***other than the ones <br/>
[specified] below should please please stop---those OTHER FILES have <br/>
*nothing* to do with the Shinsengumi! Those other files are HUGE <br/>
(and why would you want to read text in a totally different <br/>
language!?!).<br/>
<br/>
when you download OTHER files it really messes things up for me in <br/>
terms of bandwidth...just right click and download the files I <br/>
specified [ONLY]<br/>
<br/>
thanks alot now I have to go through and lock my other files<br/>

this page has been updated with screencaps (the film BYAKKOTAI<br/>
featuring the SHINSENGUMI) it was fascinating to watch Hijikata and<br/>
Okita interacting with folks from Aizu.  The film was brilliant in the<br/>
directing of Sakamoto's assassination---extremely fast and brutal<br/>
against the singing of ee ja na kai below the inn.<br/>

<h3>Sorta OT- For all you Aoshi and Misao fans out there- Oniwaban info</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-595662497">I know you guys are out there, so here's some info.<br/>
<br/>
The Oniwabanshu was founded in the early 1700s. Tokugawa Yoshimune, the <br/>
daimyo of Kii, became the 8th shogun, inaugurating what became the Kyoho <br/>
era, and when he came from Kii to Edo, he brought with him a group of 16 men <br/>
who were his private agents/bodyguards/investigators. In time, these 16 men <br/>
became what's known as the Oniwabanshu, and passed on the tradition within <br/>
the same 16 families. This tradition continued all the way through the Edo <br/>
period, all the way even into the Bakumatsu. These men were just one of many <br/>
groups of investigators in the service of the Shogunate, and took their <br/>
orders from the roju (Senior Councilors), wakadoshiyori (Junior Councilors), <br/>
and metsuke (inspectors). Their duties, depending on their specific <br/>
specialty or classification, ranged from security inside Edo Castle (or, <br/>
presumably, wherever the Shogun was, like Nijo Castle) to <br/>
patrol/surveillance in Edo. In the Meiji Era, when a concerted effort was <br/>
carried out to interview former Shogunate officials, one of those <br/>
interviewed was a former Oniwabanshu member-- and his record appears in the <br/>
compilation of those interviews, known as "Kyuji Shimonroku"-- loosely, "The <br/>
Record of Bygone Days".<br/>
<br/>
(info from Anna Beerens' translation of "Interview with a Bakumatsu <br/>
Official")<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be surprised if there was interaction between Kondou Isami and <br/>
the Oniwabanshu during the Shinsengumi's duty at Nijo Castle, or their work <br/>
in the Edo area.<br/>

<h3>Shinsengumi&#39;s friend in time of need- Nagai Naoyuki</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-149614504">Nagai Genba no Kami Naoyuki...member of the Wakadoshiyori (junior <br/>
councilors') council, Kyoto City Magistrate when Aizu entered in late 1862. <br/>
He was featured in the Hijikata special on NHK this month.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin/nagai.jpg　is">http://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin/nagai.jpg　is</a> a <br/>
picture of him.<br/>
<br/>
Little did I know that his connection with Shinsengumi-- and in particular <br/>
with Kondou Isami-- was deep and personal. The beginning of their <br/>
association, as best as I can tell, is when Nagai arranged for a meeting <br/>
between Kondou Isami and Goto Shojiro of Tosa, in September of Keio 3 <br/>
(1867).<br/>
<br/>
Toward the end of their time in Kyoto, Shinsengumi (as Conrad Totman's <br/>
"Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu") will attest, were on duty at Nijo Castle. <br/>
However, through some reason that I don't entirely understand, they had <br/>
antagonized the Mito domain (Serizawa Kamo's hometown), and this could have <br/>
led to serious problems. It be remembered, I hope, that Ito Kashitaro's <br/>
faction was made up of men connected to Mito-- including Ito and Suzuki <br/>
Mikisaburo themselves, who were from another domain in Hitachi Province.<br/>
<br/>
Who came to the rescue?<br/>
<br/>
Nagai Naoyuki.<br/>
<br/>
He reassigned Shinsengumi to Fushimi-- which means he was the one who had <br/>
them finally leave Kyoto-- and thus spared them from further antagonizing <br/>
Mito, which was not only a major Tokugawa collateral domain, but also the <br/>
birth clan of the shogun, Yoshinobu.<br/>
<br/>
So-- Shinsengumi is reassigned to Fushimi, but Kondo still makes trips to <br/>
Nijo Castle for business. On returning from one of those trips, he was shot <br/>
at by Abe Juurou and some of the other survivors of the Ito faction, and <br/>
barely made it back to Fushimi in one piece.<br/>
<br/>
It was at this point that-- it's said-- the Shogun Yoshinobu himself came in <br/>
person to see the injured Kondou, and gave the Shinsengumi commander the <br/>
services of his personal physician, Matsumoto Ryojun. Kondou was apparently <br/>
so happy that he cried.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER.....there is a rumor that it was not Yoshinobu, but Nagai Naoyuki, <br/>
disguised as Yoshinobu, who came to Kondou's bedside and brought Matsumoto <br/>
Ryojun with him.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I think that the latter possibility is more likely, especially <br/>
given that the Shogun never really seemed to have met anyone face to <br/>
face...and that Kondou was in Matsudaira Katamori's charge, not Yoshinobu's <br/>
(even though Shinsengumi HAD become hatamoto-- retainers of the Shogun-- in <br/>
late 1867).<br/>
<br/>
If it was indeed Nagai Naoyuki, then I am deeply impressed and greatly moved <br/>
by his double act of compassion.<br/>
<br/>
Later, Nagai went north with Enomoto's fleet, and he and Nakajima Saburosuke <br/>
(former Uraga Magistrate, and also said to be the first Japanese official <br/>
who rowed out to Perry's black ships) were chosen as Hakodate Magistrates by <br/>
the new Ezo Republic under Enomoto Takeaki, Matsudaira Taro, Ootori Keisuke, <br/>
and....Hijikata Toshizo.<br/>

<h3>In the interest of balanced coverage-Bio of Kijima Matabei</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260551051">Kijima Matabei- Commander of the Choshu Army at the Kinmon Incident<br/>
<br/>
The manga "Getsumei Seiki" just featured the incident in its newest volume, <br/>
and Kijima is there. If this manga is as accurate as it seems to be, then <br/>
Kondou saw Kijima go down in battle.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, here's a bio. Any mistakes I make in translation are my own.<br/>
<br/>
Born Bunka 14, January 8 (February 23, 1817), in Nagato Province, Asa <br/>
District, Nishitakadomari Village. 2nd son of Kitamura Masatsune. His <br/>
official name was Masahisa, common names were Kamenoshin, Kojiro, and <br/>
Matabei. Also known as Mori Kitaro. Pen names: Renki, Souzan, Muan Donin, <br/>
Hido.<br/>
<br/>
Though born into the family of the unsalaried courier Kitamura, in Tenpo 7 <br/>
(1836), he was adopted by Kijima Matabei Masatsune (59 koku 8 sho stipend) <br/>
of Ozu District, Tawarayama Village.<br/>
<br/>
Tenpo 8 (1837), the family moved to Mine District, Akayasu Village. Tenpo 12 <br/>
(1841), Matabei studied kenjutsu under Oishi Susumu of the Yanagawa domain, <br/>
and became an expert in the martial arts. In August of Koka 3 (1846), he <br/>
went to Edo and studied in the dojo of Kubota Sukeshiro. Returned to Choshu <br/>
in Kaei 1 (1848), and succeeded to the Kijima headship in January of Kaei 4 <br/>
(1851). In November of the same year, he was appointed to the Temawarigumi <br/>
(presumably the daimyo's personal entourage), and was made the kago-bugyo <br/>
(palanquin overseer) for the daimyo's heir.<br/>
<br/>
In March of Kaei 6, complying with the lord's orders, he went to Edo, and <br/>
was there when Perry's ships arrived. In December of the same year, he <br/>
submitted a memorial on national defense to the daimyo. Returned to Choshu <br/>
in May of Ansei 1, and held several successive jobs there- Official <br/>
Examiner, Household Affairs Manager, and others.<br/>
<br/>
October of Bunkyu 2, he was assigned to Edo, and in March of Bunkyu 3 <br/>
(1863)-- not long after the Shinsengumi-- he went to Kyoto, and in May he <br/>
returned to Choshu again, serving as assistant to the Overseer of Stables. <br/>
In June he AGAIN returned to Kyoto, at the head of a rifle brigade made up <br/>
of hunters. In July he was involved in political affairs, and in September, <br/>
returned home.<br/>
<br/>
Before this, Takasugi Shinsaku had organized the Kiheitai, and not long <br/>
afterward, on August 18, there was the incident that drove Choshu from <br/>
Kyoto. Kijima worked together and formed the Yuugekigun in November.<br/>
<br/>
(Now it gets interesting)<br/>
Genji 1 (1864)- March- Resigns as commander of the Yuugekigun, becomes <br/>
assistant to the new commander, Kokuji Shinano. *Infiltrates* Kyoto in April <br/>
of 1864, returning in May, and taking a strong line in advocating war <br/>
(against Aizu/Shinsengumi).<br/>
<br/>
Remember folks-- Choshu knew PRETTY QUICK about Ikedaya...<br/>
<br/>
In June he changed his name, and left for Osaka, leading the Yuugekitai and <br/>
Rikishitai (Sumo wrestler brigade) in battle at the Kinmon Incident in July. <br/>
While leading the forces from Saga-Tenryuji Temple to Hamagurigomon (outer <br/>
gate at the Imperial Palace), he was shot at by Aizu forces, and his nephew <br/>
Kitamura Takeshichi acted as his kaishaku (beheading at seppuku). Age at <br/>
death was 49.<br/>
<br/>
Court rank-- Senior 4th rank. Buried at Higashiyama-Reizan in Kyoto, as well <br/>
as in Hikari City (in the former Choshu) at Iwabiyama Shrine, as well as in <br/>
his former home of Mine (pronounced "Mee-neh") City, West Akayasu.<br/>
