<h3>3-hamjime.com says NO SINGING...</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515259668">Well, I've been looking at www.3-hajime.com with another translator <br/>
and I've found out just enough to make me ill because I can't <br/>
understand the rest of it. In the chronological table it seems to <br/>
have a great deal about his what he was doing from the battle of Toba-<br/>
Fushimi until he goes to Aizu. But of course I can't understand the <br/>
names of any of the places or people because they're mangled. It does <br/>
seem that he was "at the rear" with Nagakura during the fighting on <br/>
January 6. It also says something about him takeing "a treatment of <br/>
wound in a medical place" and something about Izumi Bridge on January <br/>
19. <br/>
<br/>
In the section on the different names he went by it's trying to <br/>
explain the origin of the name "Fujita Goro". It's saying something <br/>
about he was "granted" the name "of an old Aizu feudal lord according <br/>
to the traditions of the Fujitas". It states there are no historical <br/>
records to back the story up, but then the webmaster speculates it <br/>
could be true because he was able to marry Tokio and something about <br/>
who one of the go-betweens was. I'm guessing they mean one of the men <br/>
other than Matsudaira.<br/>
<br/>
The family register now lists Yaso too. I can't figure out what it's <br/>
trying to say about her brothers though. It seems to indicate her <br/>
father was killed in battle, but I might be misreading it.<br/>
<br/>
One amusing thing at least. When it was trying to explain something <br/>
about where the name "Saito" came from it said: "...no singing from <br/>
door to door for money". Ok...  I have no idea what that has to do <br/>
with his name, but I'll take that advice to heart!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, I've downloaded all of it, I just need a chance to go through it all now. Hopefully it will makes some things a bit clearer. The part I'm really interested in though will probably be the same as the chronological table on the other site. Translators REALLY hate Japanese people and place names I've noticed!<br/>
<br/>
As for what he was singing? Probably "99 bottle of sake on the wall"! LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003984423">Well, we still have Masayoshi's babelfish dictionary back at miburo<br/>
yahoo groups.  Whenever I have the time I'll probably finish<br/>
babelfishing 3-hajime and then we can totally put the info side by<br/>
side and find discrepencies and all things will be clear...yeah right<br/>
who am I kidding.<br/>

Did you see on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.1to5.net/saito/history/boshin.html">http://www.1to5.net/saito/history/boshin.html</a><br/>
at the end of the article:<br/>
"Saito one it is rough for the sake "<br/>
"also Saito was called ogre Saito"<br/>
<br/>
The advantages of saving translations offline is that you can type<br/>
your own speculation/translations in a different colored font...rather<br/>
than post 2,000 word posts on messageboards/mailing lists :P<br/>
<br/>
comment on drinking in Japan...I have read at e-budo.com that<br/>
Americans living abroad seem to have a very common experience that I<br/>
will paraphrase <br/>
Japanese friend to American "Let's go drink"<br/>
American to Japanese "I don't drink"<br/>
Japanese "how do you make frinds?"<br/>
<br/>
This is the same attitude in an area I am currently residing by the<br/>
way...it's sad if you are an alcoholic...society seems to "support" it<br/>

<br/>
(citizens of Kyoto proceed to dim lights, close doors, windows and<br/>
place hands over ears)<br/>
<br/>
and we were all waiting for some "interesting" translation for the<br/>
lastname Saito...singing door to door sheeesh<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
Slightly off-topic<br/>
To demonstrate how the Japanese are approaching the Shinsengumi with<br/>
humor...I have found a series of posts on various messageboards<br/>
regarding a skit which members of various Shinsengumi clubs have seen<br/>
the title is something like "laughing sword attack group" which<br/>
parodies the more colorful personalities of the group...so far I've<br/>
heard that Hijikata is very funny, cute and his overall viciousness<br/>
is...H*i*l*a*r*i*o*u*s...I guess his utter ruthlessness is a goldmine<br/>
for comedy</div>

 </span></blockquote>It will be sometime tomorrow before I can start going through all of that. <br/>
<br/>
That reminds me though. Somewhere I saw a reference to Kondou that said "long-nosed goblin". I'll have to look that up again. I still get a kick out of the fact that the fish had to stress that Hijikata had five HUMAN siblings. Maybe it just wanted to let us know he didn't actually come from a family of demons, he was just called that?<br/>
