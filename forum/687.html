<h3>3-hamjime.com says NO SINGING...</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515259668">Well, I&#39;ve been looking at www.3-hajime.com with another translator <br/>
and I&#39;ve found out just enough to make me ill because I can&#39;t <br/>
understand the rest of it. In the chronological table it seems to <br/>
have a great deal about his what he was doing from the battle of Toba-<br/>
Fushimi until he goes to Aizu. But of course I can&#39;t understand the <br/>
names of any of the places or people because they&#39;re mangled. It does <br/>
seem that he was &quot;at the rear&quot; with Nagakura during the fighting on <br/>
January 6. It also says something about him takeing &quot;a treatment of <br/>
wound in a medical place&quot; and something about Izumi Bridge on January <br/>
19. <br/>
<br/>
In the section on the different names he went by it&#39;s trying to <br/>
explain the origin of the name &quot;Fujita Goro&quot;. It&#39;s saying something <br/>
about he was &quot;granted&quot; the name &quot;of an old Aizu feudal lord according <br/>
to the traditions of the Fujitas&quot;. It states there are no historical <br/>
records to back the story up, but then the webmaster speculates it <br/>
could be true because he was able to marry Tokio and something about <br/>
who one of the go-betweens was. I&#39;m guessing they mean one of the men <br/>
other than Matsudaira.<br/>
<br/>
The family register now lists Yaso too. I can&#39;t figure out what it&#39;s <br/>
trying to say about her brothers though. It seems to indicate her <br/>
father was killed in battle, but I might be misreading it.<br/>
<br/>
One amusing thing at least. When it was trying to explain something <br/>
about where the name &quot;Saito&quot; came from it said: &quot;...no singing from <br/>
door to door for money&quot;. Ok...  I have no idea what that has to do <br/>
with his name, but I&#39;ll take that advice to heart!<br/>

I&#39;m a cashier and I met some Japanese students and I ~happen~ to have<br/>
the Shizuko Akama book which has the Fujita family kamon in it and I<br/>
asked how a Japanese family comes up with a design...I also explained<br/>
that &quot;Fujita&quot; was a given last name and they said if that is the case<br/>
then the kamon may also have been given at the inception of the family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, I&#39;ve downloaded all of it, I just need a chance to go through it all now. Hopefully it will makes some things a bit clearer. The part I&#39;m really interested in though will probably be the same as the chronological table on the other site. Translators REALLY hate Japanese people and place names I&#39;ve noticed!<br/>
<br/>
As for what he was singing? Probably &quot;99 bottle of sake on the wall&quot;! LOL!<br/>

Did you see on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.1to5.net/saito/history/boshin.html">http://www.1to5.net/saito/history/boshin.html</a><br/>
at the end of the article:<br/>

The advantages of saving translations offline is that you can type<br/>
your own speculation/translations in a different colored font...rather<br/>
than post 2,000 word posts on messageboards/mailing lists :P<br/>
<br/>
comment on drinking in Japan...I have read at e-budo.com that<br/>
Americans living abroad seem to have a very common experience that I<br/>
will paraphrase <br/>
Japanese friend to American &quot;Let&#39;s go drink&quot;<br/>
American to Japanese &quot;I don&#39;t drink&quot;<br/>
Japanese &quot;how do you make frinds?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the same attitude in an area I am currently residing by the<br/>
way...it&#39;s sad if you are an alcoholic...society seems to &quot;support&quot; it<br/>

(citizens of Kyoto proceed to dim lights, close doors, windows and<br/>
place hands over ears)<br/>
<br/>
and we were all waiting for some &quot;interesting&quot; translation for the<br/>
lastname Saito...singing door to door sheeesh<br/>

<br/>
Slightly off-topic<br/>
To demonstrate how the Japanese are approaching the Shinsengumi with<br/>
humor...I have found a series of posts on various messageboards<br/>
regarding a skit which members of various Shinsengumi clubs have seen<br/>
the title is something like &quot;laughing sword attack group&quot; which<br/>
parodies the more colorful personalities of the group...so far I&#39;ve<br/>
heard that Hijikata is very funny, cute and his overall viciousness<br/>
is...H*i*l*a*r*i*o*u*s...I guess his utter ruthlessness is a goldmine<br/>
for comedy</div>

<br/>
That reminds me though. Somewhere I saw a reference to Kondou that said &quot;long-nosed goblin&quot;. I&#39;ll have to look that up again. I still get a kick out of the fact that the fish had to stress that Hijikata had five HUMAN siblings. Maybe it just wanted to let us know he didn&#39;t actually come from a family of demons, he was just called that?<br/>
