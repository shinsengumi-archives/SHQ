<h3>Sorta OT: Ee Ja Nai Ka</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-798842235">"Ee ja nai ka" was a line from a protest song of 1867. Apparently<br/>
these people "danced in protest" of something regarding rice (taxes I<br/>
think). Now, I didn't quite understand the whole dancing in protest<br/>
bit, but then I remembered my project on the Onin War (1467-1477) last<br/>
year. In those days, the Ashikaga Shogunate issued a set of laws for<br/>
Kyoto, which began with "Dancing is forbidden..."<br/>
<br/>
NOW I get it...<br/>
<br/>
lol...So the Shinsengumi are the Dance Police?! lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896676994">Cool!  "Low class" people can always figure out a way to protest<br/>
indirectly:)<br/>
<br/>
1st and 3rd Squad comes upon a bunch of bedraggled peasants partying<br/>
with drums, flutes and shouting a "controversial" song.<br/>
<br/>
Saitou: "break it up folks...we have more than enough room for ALL of<br/>
you in the prison"<br/>
<br/>
Random Member of the Shinsengumi (elbows Saitou):  "ummm, Sir" (points<br/>
to Okita)<br/>
<br/>
Saitou: "Okita, do you really want me to inform Hijikata of you<br/>
dancing in the streets?"<br/>
