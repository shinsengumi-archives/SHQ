<h3>&quot;Mibugishiden&quot; manga version announced</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067353199">I've just found on Yahoo News this article, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20050122-00000057-mailo-l03(">http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20050122-00000057-mailo-l03(</a> Japanese only) saying "Mibugishiden" will be <br/>
adapted as manga and <br/>
published as serial in the "Morning" magazine (Kodansya edition, <br/>
600,000copies sold).<br/>
<br/>
The serial will start after this summer and the cartoonist Takumi Nagayasu <br/>
who has gekiga drawing style rather than manga, is actually visiting the related <br/>
places for the research. He said also the adaptation would be close to the <br/>
original novel.<br/>
<br/>
We can look forward to see his work further this year.<br/>
