contain 2 images of the Ministry of Justice during the Meiji Era<br/>
<br/>
Now you may think to yourself what does the Min. of Justice have<br/>
anything to do with the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
Well former members of the Shinsengumi Fujita Goro and also Suzuki<br/>
Miki (even if he was not posted in Tokyo) knew these buildings very<br/>
well.  Trainings/meetings were often not held at the local<br/>
station---but at the central admin building, the Ministry of Justice<br/>
and or the TMPD headquarters because the Min. of Justice was the<br/>
"paperwork" center where alot of stuff was sent to for processing.<br/>
<br/>
Other buildings in the files such as the Panorama structure, kabukiza<br/>
and sumo ring are one of the most popular places depicted in ukiyo-e<br/>
of that era as well.</div>
