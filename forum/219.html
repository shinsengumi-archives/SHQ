<h3>Sort of (OT) Wild 7 Biker Knights</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550672970">Wild 7 or Wild 7:Biker Knights is vintage anime based on a manga...it<br/>
caught my sight because they use a wolf's head on a red background on<br/>
their motorcycles...it is about a bunch of outlaws who become<br/>
policement to fight crime etc...what is funnier is it takes place in a<br/>
fantasy world complete with a shogun and there are politics involved<br/>
as mentioned in one of the links below...looks nice and campy LOL<br/>
