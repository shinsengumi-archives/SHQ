<h3>The Mimiwarigumi</h3>
by <i>sou_ryu_sen14</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440154183">A friend of mine and I are writing a skit set during the Bakumatsu <br/>
and focuses mostly on the conflict between the Shinsengumi and the <br/>
Choshu. Anyway, I'm in a bit of a jam since I have one character who <br/>
is from the Mimiwarigumi. However, I have no idea what the <br/>
Mimiwarigumi uniform looked like. If anyone can help me find a <br/>
discription and/or picture of the Mimiwarigumi uniform, that would <br/>
be greatly appreciated...</div>

Shinsengumi one. If it helps just describe what the men chasing Sakamoto and <br/>
Tatsu in the PMK anime were wearing. That's who they were supposed to be. You <br/>
could also go by what the character of Sasaki in the NHK drama was wearing since <br/>
he was their leader.<br/>
