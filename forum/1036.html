<h3>Slightly OT? Funny article</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661119507">Yesterday I was reading an article in the Boston Globe, it was about the <br/>
sudden interest in kendo lessons in the US. The article said that animes, books, <br/>
movies and other sources help increase interest in kendo. The example of animes <br/>
they gave was Roni Henshin....lol. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, man!  I can just see some poor fool going out there and looking for that title.  :-D  If someone came up to me as a salesclerk in a video/anime store and gave me that title, I'd never be able to stop laughing. Or imagine the poor person going to the R's and finding Rurouni Kenshin and standing there wondering if it's the same...<br/>
 <br/>
Although, I guess the people who might be laughing hardest are kendo instructors who have people coming to them wanting to learn Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu or Gatotsu.  :-D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! That's funny! I wonder if the idiot who wrote the article was trying to use his spell checker to double-check the name? Mine always insist the name should be Reran Denshin!<br/>
<br/>
But phil it might be funny the fist half a dozen times someone asks to learn the Gatotsu, but don't you think after a while they'd just want to pull all their hair out? Sort of like the first few times you use the Babelfish are funny...<br/>
<br/>
While we're off topic anyway, Samurai Rebellion is about to come on the IFC channel at 8:00am ET. If you miss it, I believe it comes on again tomorrow morning at 6:00am ET.<br/>
