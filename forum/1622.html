 </span></blockquote>It was very nice ^^ Though I arrived a bit late and<br/>
missed the homage to the deceased and the bow<br/>
shooting, I managed to see the Byakkotai kenbu, the<br/>
cannon shooting and the beginning of the parade. Lots<br/>
of women trying to take pictures and touching the<br/>
three NHK dorama actors who took part in the parade :D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The parade itself had fewer people than I had<br/>
expected. But it was great nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't take many pictures (most were blurred -_-).<br/>
Perhaps Tama-san was able to get better pictures than<br/>
I. I am trying to upload three pictures I took from<br/>
the parade in the Photos section. They are a bit heavy<br/>
(about 750k each), so be warned. <br/>
<br/>
This Saturday, I intend to go to Saito Hajime's<br/>
memorial service, which will be held at his grave.<br/>

Many of us will be standing beside you in spirit.  I, for one, will be --- Saitou has had a very positive impact on my life by the example of how he lived his... he'll always be one of my heroes.  And, don't forget, if you get the chance, burn incense on our behalf.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and HAVE FUN (which I'm sure you are)!  :-D<br/>
