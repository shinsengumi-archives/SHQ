&gt; You guys!! Tama just sent me a pic she took with her<br/>
&gt; cell phone of the<br/>
&gt; parade featuring NHK Hijikata Koji Yamamoto it&#39;s in<br/>
&gt; the photos section<br/>
&gt; in the first file = Aizu Festival<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was very nice ^^ Though I arrived a bit late and<br/>
missed the homage to the deceased and the bow<br/>
shooting, I managed to see the Byakkotai kenbu, the<br/>
cannon shooting and the beginning of the parade. Lots<br/>
of women trying to take pictures and touching the<br/>
three NHK dorama actors who took part in the parade :D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The parade itself had fewer people than I had<br/>
expected. But it was great nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t take many pictures (most were blurred -_-).<br/>
Perhaps Tama-san was able to get better pictures than<br/>
I. I am trying to upload three pictures I took from<br/>
the parade in the Photos section. They are a bit heavy<br/>
(about 750k each), so be warned. <br/>
<br/>
This Saturday, I intend to go to Saito Hajime&#39;s<br/>
memorial service, which will be held at his grave.<br/>

Many of us will be standing beside you in spirit.  I, for one, will be --- Saitou has had a very positive impact on my life by the example of how he lived his... he&#39;ll always be one of my heroes.  And, don&#39;t forget, if you get the chance, burn incense on our behalf.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and HAVE FUN (which I&#39;m sure you are)!  :-D<br/>
