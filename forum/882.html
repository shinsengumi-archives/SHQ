<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257994677">I just received this in my email from Mr. Hillsborough and thought you'd <br/>
all be interested....<br/>
<br/>
My publisher tells me that the official publication date is January 2005. I<br/>
think they might be available earlier. Amazon.com seems to already be taking<br/>
orders at a big discount. But all of this business is out of my hands.<br/>
