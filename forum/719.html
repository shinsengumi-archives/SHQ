<br/>
Touga desu. Newbie desu. No japanese speaking desu. ^^;;<br/>
<br/>
Anyways. I found a site that sells japanese historical drama with <br/>
english subs. I haven't ordered anything from them yet (*is too broke <br/>
at the moment*), but some looks really interesting, like the <br/>
shinsengumi keppuroku.</div>

We have alot of stuff going on...so you may want to amuse yourself and<br/>
read the hundreds of posts here :p<br/>
yes samuraiflix.com is well known...however the films are bootlegs<br/>
-AND- they want to make tons of money off of them so keep that in<br/>
mind....I mean there is no other way to acquire these works but the<br/>
cost is just astronomical that's all...  <br/>
<br/>
The series is discussed at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>
<br/>
It is a very cool series by the way...very detailed and good pace<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Samuraiflix.com is Merlin's site. He is one of the<br/>
few people that is subtitling some of these types of<br/>
movies. In that particular version of "Shinsengumi<br/>
Keppuroku" he just just got it from the Kiku tv Hawaii<br/>
broadcast. I have the series on vcd from that<br/>
broadcast if you don't mind vcd quality. <br/>
 However, he is the one to support if you want to see<br/>
more subtitled movies. The guys on e-bay that mass<br/>
produce his subitled movies should be avoided like the<br/>
plague since they will be the ones that kill off the<br/>
fansubs.<br/>

If you are too broke for samuraiflix.com (I bought one movie a long<br/>
time ago and the packing, shipping and item good) right now consider<br/>
the following:<br/>
<br/>
1) go to Amazon search for Criterion Dvd, or any VHS copy releases of<br/>
the titles you want and do this special function thingy where you<br/>
input the price you can afford and Amazon will notify you if a seller<br/>
will meet your price...then you can snap up a copy right away<br/>
<br/>
2) search for a college university nearby and see if they have a film<br/>
archive...usually they'll let you view stuff (and you don't always<br/>
have to be a student)<br/>
<br/>
3) search for people who will trade with you...I know a trustworthy<br/>
worthy person email me offlist...but a trade is a trade you don't get<br/>
your movie back and there is no money involved</div>
