<h3>Fujita Goro Memorial</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453191119">Every year around this time in Aizu Wakamatu City in Fukushima<br/>
Prefecture there is a memorial for Fujita Goro who died on September<br/>
28, 1915.  The family even over time has become more "public".<br/>
<br/>
Here is a new pic<br/>

Photo at the Fujita family grave (where ashes are stored).<br/>
Left is the president of the Hino Shinsengumi Club.  The far right is<br/>
the president of the Aizu Shinsengumi Club.  The middle is a<br/>
descendent of Fujita Goro through his second son Tsuyoshi.  If any one<br/>
can help double check the Japanese I'd appreciate it.<br/>

is now selling "I WANT TO DIE A SAMURAI" SHINSENGUMI<br/>
SHIMATSUKI/CHRONICLES one of the finer classic Shinsengumi films<br/>
starring Tomisaburo Wakayama as Kondou directed by Kenji Misumi<br/>
Also, Okita in this film is very very interesting, he has a dark side<br/>
but you have to watch for it....I especially liked Hijikata's fake<br/>
tears after the mysterious death of SErizawa Kamo.  Basically, I think<br/>
the presence of the outstanding actor Raizo Ichikawa as the main<br/>
character makes this a must view film.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  THIS IS NOT THE TOSHIRO MIFUNE FILM (which was not as good)<br/>

I drove through Fukushima in August and saw the poster of Aizu-han Festival.<br/>
The nearest highway rest area from Aizu sells "Okita Souji Hello Kitty"<br/>
goods.<br/>
How about Saito Hajime Hello Kitty?<br/>
