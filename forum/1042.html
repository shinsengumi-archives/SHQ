<h3>A little OT: The Hakkenden</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994635204">This is an older anime that I&#39;ve been trying to watch. It&#39;s about <br/>
eight warriors who are descendents from an inu god and it&#39;s set <br/>
during the feudal age of Japan. I won&#39;t say much but it I thought I <br/>
should mention that the story revolves around the &quot;Murasame&quot; and oni <br/>
and spirits. The story can be hard to follow sometimes because <br/>
there&#39;s a lot of symbolization and drifting in/out of reality. <br/>
There&#39;s also a lot of abuse of power directed towards commoners. Just <br/>
thought I should mention it in case anyone is interested, since in <br/>
one of the chats the murasame sword was discussed...<br/>
