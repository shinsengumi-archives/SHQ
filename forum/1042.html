<h3>A little OT: The Hakkenden</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994635204">This is an older anime that I've been trying to watch. It's about <br/>
eight warriors who are descendents from an inu god and it's set <br/>
during the feudal age of Japan. I won't say much but it I thought I <br/>
should mention that the story revolves around the "Murasame" and oni <br/>
and spirits. The story can be hard to follow sometimes because <br/>
there's a lot of symbolization and drifting in/out of reality. <br/>
There's also a lot of abuse of power directed towards commoners. Just <br/>
thought I should mention it in case anyone is interested, since in <br/>
one of the chats the murasame sword was discussed...<br/>
