<h3>Shinsengumi Nikki</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131510123">I just got the Shinsengumi Nikki today - has anyone read it?  It has<br/>
Nagakura Shinpachi's Roushi Bunkyu Hokokukiji and Shimada Kai's Nikki.<br/>
The bonus is that it has both the meiji era Japanese, and the modern<br/>
equivalent on each page, so I don't have to fry my brain trying to<br/>
read the old Japanese.  The version I have was published in 2003,<br/>
edited by Kimura Sachiko.  I found Nagakura Shinpachi's post script<br/>
particularly interesting:<br/>
<br/>
(I'm paraphrasing)<br/>
<br/>
"This battle record was not written during the trying times of the<br/>
actual battles. This was done after the fact, memories that I<br/>
revisited now and then.  This is the story of what actually happened.<br/>
Because of this, it differs from fictional accounts, and I want it to<br/>
be understood as a true account."<br/>
<br/>
It's somewhere near the top of my to-read list, once I get started,<br/>
I'll post translations of the more interesting/broadly applicable parts.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187168620">In my opinion, it's one of the best Shinsengumi books.  It's also one of the books most <br/>
difficult to read (for me.)<br/>
