He was involved in investigations and left with Itou.  That is his connection to the Sekihoutai --- he survived the attack on Itou's group and stayed with Miki, probably becoming a member of the Second Patrol under Miki's command.<br/>

Ito. He's the one who said that Saitou killed Takeda. He was supposed to have <br/>
seen it firsthand, if I'm not mistaken. Both he and Saito were with Ito's <br/>

the Shinsengumi I never knew who the picture was until I was clued in by <br/>
your site Phil!<br/>
<br/>
All I know about Shinohara is that he was in the spy division and if <br/>
Koki Mitani is to be believed was the one who took the shot at <br/>
Kondou--also his wife fled with Itou's mistress & son to the Satsuma <br/>
clan mansion after Itou's murder when the Shinsengumi were trying to <br/>
round up the wives etc to find out where Itou's crew took off to.<br/>

<h3>Re: [SHQ] Shinohara Question</h3>
by <i>tamagot93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-155056712">Born in Chikugo ( actual Fukuoka prefecture) 10 oct. 1828 in a farmer's <br/>
family. Father's name was Gensuke and mother's name was Taki. Taki was <br/>
the daughter of 11th generation of Shinohara familly.<br/>
Shinohara go to Edo at the age of 31 and met Ito through his friend Kano.<br/>
In Shinsengumi, he was "Shoshi shirabe yaku ken Kansatsu" (same function <br/>
as Yamazaki which consists of "Shoshi shirabeyaku" intelligence agency <br/>
for the outside and "Kansatsu" inspection of activities of the members, <br/>
so investigation of inside.)<br/>
And he was also a Jujutsu teacher.<br/>
<br/>
He married twice. The first wife was called Hagino and probably he might <br/>
  marry before 1863 as their son has 5 years in 1867.<br/>
Shinohara called Hagino and son to Kyoto later when he joined to <br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
( I didn't mention here about Ito and Goryo eji as some facts are <br/>
already known)<br/>
<br/>
After Aburano Koji affair(18 nov), Shinohara escaped and hide in the <br/>
house of a person related to an Imperial prince called Gyoubu Ozaki. <br/>
Shinsengumi come to search him in the morning or 19 but they couldn't <br/>
arrest Shinohara as they didn't dare force someone related to Imperial <br/>
family.<br/>
So Shinohara could move to Satsuma clan's mansion and joined to  Miki there.<br/>
<br/>
Hagino felt an uneasiness in the early morning of 19, and she came out <br/>
to the outside still dark though, then a servant came to see her and <br/>
said simply, "There was a trouble!", and run away soon.<br/>
She headed to Gesshin in, Goryo eji's quarter but nobody was there.<br/>
Then she went to the house of someone she knew in Miyagawa town( that's <br/>
supposed to be Ito's mistress's house) . While she was in that <br/>
house,Shinsengumi came to search her and she heard they saying to the <br/>
master that they had seen Shinohara's wife entered that house and asking<br/>
to hand her over to them.<br/>
Meanwhile, Hagino escaped from the back door and went to Ozaki's house <br/>
along the river bank. As Ozaki told her whereabouts of her husband, she <br/>
went to Satsuma mansion and could see him again in the noon of 20. She <br/>
was also joined by Ito's mistress and Tadao Arai's wife there.<br/>
Later Shinohara and his wife were sheltered in the Satsuma mansion in <br/>
Fushimi and Hagino.<br/>
After Shinohara attempted to shoot Kondo with the others, Hagino had to <br/>
change move different places to hide.<br/>
<br/>
I think writing something more short at the beginning but that become <br/>
horribly long so, to be continued...( when I have time)<br/>
<br/>
(This is the resume from Shinohara's bio from "100 anecdotes of <br/>
Shinsengumi", and "Rekishi dokuhon " Shinsengumi and women" special issue.)<br/>

<h3>Re: [SHQ] Shinohara Question</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115129025">Thank you Tama!!! Fantastic information as always!<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's safe to assume that Shinohara became acquainted with the <br/>
prince Gyoubu Ozaki through Itou. The man had serious connections. he <br/>
was going places no wonder they wanted to get rid of him.<br/>
<br/>
This pretty much validates your Aizu connection( Saitou spying on Itou <br/>
for both sides) there Sec.<br/>
