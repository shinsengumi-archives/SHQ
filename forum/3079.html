Still not 100% sure the Shinsengumi appear in this portrayal---I was <br/>
hoping.<br/>
<br/>
The Byakkotai are sort of part of Shinsengumi fandom by &quot;extension&quot; <br/>
and one of the best portrayals of the Shinsengumi (and also the <br/>
Bakumatsu) happens to be the 1980s film Byakkotai.  There are also <br/>
interesting connections between the specific Byakkotai who died on <br/>
Mt. Iimori with the Fujita family (again it&#39;s all really complicated, <br/>
throught extension, friendships etc but still fascinating)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Spiritus Saitou is sharing some screencaps of this new 2007 Byakkotai <br/>
with me and I&quot;m going to look over them today.  Now with a bigger <br/>
budget and computer effects this epic narrative may take be even more <br/>
compelling to a new generation.<br/>
<br/>
The Byakkotai will always be the tragic &quot;poster boys&quot; of Aizu...and <br/>
the only source of &quot;rehabilitation&quot; of the domain&#39;s narrative.  On a <br/>
national level, Aizu got the attention of the rest of the country in <br/>
much later years *after the Meiji Era (at the height of Japan&#39;s <br/>
fascism) due to the Byakkotai.  HOwever specific reasons for the <br/>
military actions against the domain in 1868 have not been been made <br/>
transparent (it has been written about but it needs to be brought <br/>
into our modern era, our generation and in Eng.) because <br/>
the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of teh Meiji Era with their fake Imperial <br/>
Edict, fake Imperial Banners and unwillingness to accept Aizu&#39;s <br/>
earlier attempts for negotiations points to a simple private grudge <br/>
between the Ishin and the domain (ofcourse it cost the lives of too <br/>
many combatants and civilians and the long term stigamtization of the <br/>
survivors).<br/>
<br/>
At the same time Aizu leaders of the Boshin War generation sort of <br/>
painted themselves into a corner too...only a handful of them could <br/>
actually tell their domain&#39;s story in a published format (perhaps due <br/>
to various political and social pressures).  Incidentally those very <br/>
Aizu leaders had very close relationships with the Fujita family.  <br/>
Thus what we get for Aizu is the Byakkotai and other details of the <br/>
role of the domain during the Bakumatsu gets swept under the <br/>
rug...again Aizu was the &quot;criminal&quot; domain in the eyes of many <br/>
people.  Survivors who became successful were the lucky few and had <br/>
to be grateful for whatever blessings granted to them (even if they <br/>
earned their properity in the Meiji Era through their own sheer <br/>
talent and effort).<br/>

I&#39;m still in the middle of downloading part one so I&#39;m not sure whether the Shinsengumi <br/>
appear in this portrayal either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918420885">Byakkotai 2007 does not even give the Shinsengumi a cameo role<br/>
more shocking still not even a mention of Yamaguchi Jiro (Saitou <br/>
Hajime)which is sad because his grave is even now on tourist maps---<br/>
oh well<br/>

Shout out to Shuyobob/Sara...how does one find a copy of the OLDER <br/>
BYAKKOTAI??? she asked...<br/>
<br/>
well it still in the process of being subbed I assume<br/>
<br/>
but all is not lost!<br/>
<br/>
someone kindly uploaded the trailer of the Byakkotai complete with <br/>
the Shinsengumi<br/>

<br/>
it seems that in terms of historical detail the older Byakkotai <br/>
explains the how and &quot;why&quot; much better than this newer 2007 version <br/>
(which has some historical innaccuracies).  Ofcourse the 2007 <br/>
Byakkotai has a higher level of production quality.<br/>
