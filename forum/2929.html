<h3>Shinsengumi on Wikipedia</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363821761">I am reading Wikipedia Shinsengumi section andI am really surprised the<br/>
power of pop culture.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsengumi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsengumi</a><br/>
&quot;Depictions in Media&quot; is so detailed but description about Shinsengumi<br/>
itself is quite simple.<br/>
Especially &quot;End of the Shinsengumi&quot; is too simple while there is a<br/>
description about porn Shinsengumi game on &quot;Depictions in Media&quot;.<br/>
Isn&#39;t it weird?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933913500">Dear k kobayakawa if wikipedia doesn&#39;t have enough information I hope <br/>
that the many fansites available will help change that situation<br/>
<br/>
have you had a chance to see:<br/>

The Last Fight at Ezo: Enomoto Takeaki and the Wolves<br/>

<br/>
also someone who is a member here did volunteer to study the Shogitai <br/>
with the hopes of understanding the last phase of Harada&#39;s life too so <br/>
I look forward to seeing her work<br/>
<br/>
If we all use our various strengths and backgrounds contribute in any <br/>
way which is convenient, I believe that the internet&#39;s knowledge of <br/>
the Shinsengumi will grow rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
I hope fans around the world are not discouraged by the lack of <br/>
Shinsengumi in texts, because it is more of a matter of looking very <br/>
closely, or adopting a research &quot;angle&quot;.  For example, a fan with an <br/>
interest in British involvement will be surprised that by following <br/>
British diplomats during the Bakumatsu, they will be reading about <br/>
bakufu troop movements in the North (which is ofcourse comprised of <br/>
Shinsengumi).  Or perhaps someone who studies Korea and is interested <br/>
in Satsuma will be able to focus on Saigo Takamori in the early 1870s <br/>
and really gain an understanding of the motivations of winners of the <br/>
Boshin War.<br/>
