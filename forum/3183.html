<h3>Shinsengumi and The Killing of Odaira Hachiro</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484673975">Shinsengumi, during Aizu's effort to take Shirakawa in 1868, was posted to <br/>
Shirasaka Barrier outside Shirakawa, in an effort to repulse the Imperial <br/>
Japanese Army's offensive (see pp. 310-311 of Yamakawa Kenjiro's book "Aizu <br/>
Boshin Senshi"). Yamakawa Kenjiro notes that at this point, it was under the <br/>
command of Yamaguchi Jiro-- also known as Saitou Hajime. While this briefly <br/>
repelled the Imperial army, the local population betrayed the Allied armies <br/>
of the north and forced them to retreat. Chief among these traitors was the <br/>
village headman of Shirasaka Village, named Odaira Hachiro, who had guided <br/>
the Imperial forces in this battle.<br/>
<br/>
Enter Aizu retainer Tanabe Gunji. In 1868, Tanabe Gunji was young-- 18 years <br/>
of age. He survived the war and went, together with other Aizu samurai, to <br/>
exile in Tonami, in the far north of the main Japanese island of Honshu. <br/>
During his exile he heard of what this Odaira Hachiro had done. Unable to <br/>
leave matters at that, he slipped out of Tonami, and after a month on the <br/>
road, arrived in Shirakawa.<br/>
<br/>
In a scene that must have been quite horrific, Gunji found Hachiro and <br/>
killed him. After doing so, he immediately committed suicide. (His grave is <br/>
to be found in the cemetery for Aizu samurai at Matsunami, in Shirakawa <br/>
City) (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://baragaki.fc2web.com/aizukanjinbutsu/jintanabe.htm">http://baragaki.fc2web.com/aizukanjinbutsu/jintanabe.htm</a> for a <br/>
brief biography of Tanabe)<br/>
<br/>
This begs the question......if the village headman in question was the <br/>
headman of Shirasaka....could he have heard of the betrayal from Saitou <br/>
Hajime, who had been at Shirasaka and was in Tonami at the same time that <br/>
Gunji was?<br/>
<br/>
Though we may never know for sure, it's certainly worth some consideration.<br/>
