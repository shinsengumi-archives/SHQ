If anyone is in school can you please check your college library to see if this book is part of the collection.  I'm wondering if the Education Museum where Fujita Goro was employed for a few years is featured in this book (I'd LOVE TO SEE PHOTOS OF THE INSIDE OF THE MUSEUM).<br/>
<br/>
I'll be at the Imperial Palace this weekend....the one in Las Vegas not Japan (^_^) and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas which owns this book will be closed both Saturday and Sunday.<br/>

<br/>
My husband works at Texas A&M, and their library has a copy, according to<br/>
the online catalog.  I'd be happy to check it out -- will email you when I<br/>
get my hands on it, and you can ask me all the questions you want.  I have a<br/>
scanner, too, so could send you scans of pics.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778207241">Hello Bonnie,<br/>
<br/>
We are interested in the Tokyo Education Museum from 1891-1899.  I know that it seems very boring to work at a museum but in the Meiji era they were fascinating places because the modern nation state tried to develop and image and history to present to its citizens in the capital by using these museums.<br/>
<br/>
What is so confusing is that the museum moves, and gets renamed in the Meiji Era (-_-).<br/>
<br/>
My email is secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully by finding all these bits and pieces we can incorporate these details into the e-book which can be a great resource for everyone who wants a really really in depth bio on Saitou in English.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help Bonnie!<br/>
