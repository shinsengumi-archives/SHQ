the one which discusses the mystery woman in the Shinsengumi and the <br/>
popular Love chart replied to one of my posts.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone who knows Japanese wants to read the webmaster&#39;s comments <br/>
visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pa.orange-e.net/?id=g1342122">http://pa.orange-e.net/?id=g1342122</a> (you should find my post <br/>
easily).  It is actually my 2nd post...I couldn&#39;t understand his <br/>
first reply...I&#39;m not sure if I offended him with my <br/>
Japanese/babelfish or not LOL<br/>
<br/>
babelfish says:<br/>
&quot;It is sekiguti of the Mibu ÂQ loyal retainer new selection group <br/>
curator. It probably is to be possible with desire of the mail <br/>
magazine? When that it is, rejoicing, you send. You know the fact <br/>
that the foreign country the reader comes very in honor. Because <br/>
this one English that much is not proud, details (the reply with <br/>
unskillful English) at the mail we would like to give. Then, also in <br/>
the future we ask may.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
basically, the site offers some kind of email newsletter, I ~think~ <br/>
and he said to sign up for it...and I did...<br/>
<br/>
(sigh) this is the like the 2nd person to complain about their poor <br/>
English and I&#39;m trying to communicate in Japanese Babelfish LOL...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to post a list of the most active Japanese Shinsengumi <br/>
Messageboards (BBS is the term they prefer to use) at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> so we can eavesdrop on *their* <br/>
conversations...some posts are -exactly- like ours...weird...it <br/>
could be that the demographics of the posters parallell ours that is <br/>
overwhelmingly female :)<br/>
<br/>
I actually tried to submit the messageboard to a Bakumatsu Japanese <br/>
webring and it keeps returning error messages saying that the <br/>
webaddress <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> is invalid...anyways if we <br/>
ever get on that ring then we are set because all of the major <br/>
Shinsengumi sites are on it. I even tried submitting the original <br/>
ezboard address. :(</div>
