Okita Soji<br/>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>
<br/>
Okita Soji (?? ??), (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the first troop of <br/>
the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate period. He was <br/>
a well-known genius swordsman, being one of the strongest out of the Shinsengumi, <br/>
along with Saito Hajime and Nagakura Shinpachi.<br/>

<br/>
Background<br/>
He was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai family <br/>
in the Shirakawa- han's Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His Great-grandfather was Okita <br/>
Kan'emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His father, Okita <br/>
Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907) and Okita Kin <br/>
(1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita family, Okita Rintaro <br/>
(1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuke <br/>
in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and Okita started <br/>
training at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time, Kondo Shusuke had <br/>
already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijikata Toshizo had not <br/>
yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy and attained <br/>
Menkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 - p.11)<br/>
<br/>
In 1861, Okita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often <br/>
commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he was also <br/>
known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori, p.27 - p.28)<br/>
<br/>
According to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou's son) and Satou Shun'sen (Satou <br/>
Hikogorou's descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high cheekbones, a <br/>
wide month, and a "flatfish" face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he was known as a man who <br/>
smiled and laughed well (not very talkative, however.)<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Period<br/>
Okita changed his name to Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before his departure <br/>
to Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and a <br/>
Fukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander's Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou, also a <br/>
practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the Shinchougumi (the <br/>
Shinsengumi's brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)<br/>
<br/>
Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, with Todo Heisuke being <br/>
the youngest. He was one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (one of <br/>
the original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro assassinations in <br/>
1863. (Oji, p.132)<br/>
<br/>
Equally skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his signature technique was <br/>
named the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (which translates as "Three Piece Thrust"), a <br/>
technique that could attack one's neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. <br/>
(the Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but this is most <br/>
likely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention and it could <br/>
have been derived from an invention of Hijikata's (the Hirazuki.)<br/>
<br/>
It was rumored that his tuberculosis was discovered when he coughed blood and fainted <br/>
during the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say that he contracted the disease after that. <br/>
Both are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very slowly (many years). <br/>
While many of the Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaru was killed by Okita <br/>
during the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shiba Ryoutarou's fiction), it is in fact historically <br/>
inaccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)<br/>
<br/>
Based on Shiba Ryoutarou's fiction, many also believe that Okita and Hijikata were like <br/>
brothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly <br/>
relationship with. Yamanami's seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was an <br/>
extremely painful incident in Okita's short life. (Mori, p.78) There is no record showing <br/>
that Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got along with <br/>
Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
In 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and also served as a <br/>
kenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be <br/>
the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)<br/>
<br/>
Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana called Kikuichi-<br/>
monji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a wakizashi) and <br/>
his so-called "Kikuichimonji Norimune" was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo instead. (Oji, 96)<br/>
<br/>
Death<br/>
During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of Keiou 4, Okita went <br/>
into Matsumoto Ryoujun's hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a guesthouse <br/>
with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces (including <br/>
the Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region, Okita remained in <br/>
Edo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May 30th), 1868. Later <br/>
that night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present Tokyo), under his birth name <br/>
(with Okita Souji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita's grave is not open to the <br/>
public. (Oji, p.252)<br/>
<br/>
The information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that he was born <br/>
in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in 1868 (or on a <br/>
lesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and therefore was <br/>
25 by Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)<br/>
<br/>
Trivia<br/>
It is historical accurate that Okita loved children. During his time in Kyoto, he was often <br/>
seen playing with children and was a baby-sitter to Yagi's sons in Mibu. (Oji, p.100)<br/>
<br/>
He was not particularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved sweets.<br/>
<br/>
Okita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)<br/>
<br/>
Aside from being treated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku (medicine for <br/>
enervation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with Ishida Sanyaku for <br/>
treating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)<br/>
<br/>
There has not been any evidence of an Okita photograph.<br/>

Okita in Fiction<br/>
It is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with historical data about him.<br/>
<br/>
Okita is briefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga series Rurouni Kenshin, which <br/>
takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. A character later on in the <br/>
series, Seta S?jir?, was based on the Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi Keppuroku (and <br/>
therefore, darker than the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in the anime/manga <br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an episode of the anime <br/>
GS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about the <br/>
Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only of killing <br/>
people (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the show's rendition of <br/>
Hijikata.) Okita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru, which is a fictional <br/>
story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (where Okita trains a <br/>
young girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her father and older brother.) He is also <br/>
depicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/manga series Shura no Toki, <br/>
Okita's (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with a warrior from the <br/>
Mutsu, a clan that supposedly practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a request from <br/>
Okita himself from years before.<br/>
<br/>
His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man (sometimes a <br/>
bish?nen). The Latin American dub of Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook Okita for a <br/>
woman, and the Hijikata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the fangirls of <br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane.<br/>
<br/>
While only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a flashback and as a <br/>
possible ghost), Okita's (obviously) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an equally-obviously <br/>
fictional unnamed wife) is one of the three main characters of the series.<br/>
<br/>
His three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are also very similar to the <br/>
character Ukyo Tachibana from the video game series Samurai Shodown.</div>
