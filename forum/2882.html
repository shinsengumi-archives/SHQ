&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okita Soji<br/>
&gt; From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okita Soji (?? ??), (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the<br/>
&gt; first troop of<br/>
&gt; the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate<br/>
&gt; period. He was<br/>
&gt; a well-known genius swordsman, being one of the strongest out of the<br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi,<br/>
&gt; along with Saito Hajime and Nagakura Shinpachi.<br/>

&gt; 6 Okita in Fiction<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Background<br/>
&gt; He was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a<br/>
&gt; samurai family<br/>
&gt; in the Shirakawa- han&#39;s Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His<br/>
&gt; Great-grandfather was Okita<br/>
&gt; Kan&#39;emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His<br/>
&gt; father, Okita<br/>
&gt; Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907)<br/>
&gt; and Okita Kin<br/>
&gt; (1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita<br/>
&gt; family, Okita Rintaro<br/>
&gt; (1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of<br/>
&gt; Kondo Shusuke<br/>
&gt; in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and<br/>
&gt; Okita started<br/>
&gt; training at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time,<br/>
&gt; Kondo Shusuke had<br/>
&gt; already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijikata<br/>
&gt; Toshizo had not<br/>
&gt; yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy<br/>
&gt; and attained<br/>
&gt; Menkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 -<br/>
&gt; p.11)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In 1861, Okita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he<br/>
&gt; was often<br/>
&gt; commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he<br/>
&gt; was also<br/>
&gt; known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori,<br/>
&gt; p.27 - p.28)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; According to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) and Satou Shun&#39;sen<br/>
&gt; (Satou<br/>
&gt; Higokorou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high<br/>
&gt; cheekbones, a<br/>
&gt; wide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he was known<br/>
&gt; as a man who<br/>
&gt; smiled and laughed well (not very talkative, however.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi Period<br/>
&gt; Okita changed his name to Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before<br/>
&gt; his departure<br/>
&gt; to Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; Fukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou,<br/>
&gt; also a<br/>
&gt; practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the<br/>
&gt; Shinchougumi (the<br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi&#39;s brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, with Todo<br/>
&gt; Heisuke being<br/>
&gt; the youngest. He was one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa<br/>
&gt; Kamo (one of<br/>
&gt; the original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro<br/>
&gt; assassinations in<br/>
&gt; 1863. (Oji, p.132)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Equally skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his signature<br/>
&gt; technique was<br/>
&gt; named the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (which translates as &quot;Three Piece<br/>
&gt; Thrust&quot;), a<br/>
&gt; technique that could attack one&#39;s neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder<br/>
&gt; with one strike.<br/>
&gt; (the Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but<br/>
&gt; this is most<br/>
&gt; likely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention<br/>
&gt; and it could<br/>
&gt; have been derived from an invention of Hijikata&#39;s (the Hirazuki.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was rumored that his tuberculosis was discovered when he coughed blood<br/>
&gt; and fainted<br/>
&gt; during the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say that he contracted the<br/>
&gt; disease after that.<br/>
&gt; Both are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very<br/>
&gt; slowly (many years).<br/>
&gt; While many of the Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaru was<br/>
&gt; killed by Okita<br/>
&gt; during the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction), it is in<br/>
&gt; fact historically<br/>
&gt; inaccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction, many also believe that Okita and<br/>
&gt; Hijikata were like<br/>
&gt; brothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared<br/>
&gt; a brotherly<br/>
&gt; relationship with. Yamanami&#39;s seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865<br/>
&gt; was an<br/>
&gt; extremely painful incident in Okita&#39;s short life. (Mori, p.78) There is no<br/>
&gt; record showing<br/>
&gt; that Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got<br/>
&gt; along with<br/>
&gt; Hijikata.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and<br/>
&gt; also served as a<br/>
&gt; kenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by<br/>
&gt; Kondo Isami to be<br/>
&gt; the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana<br/>
&gt; called Kikuichi-<br/>
&gt; monji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a<br/>
&gt; wakizashi) and<br/>
&gt; his so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo<br/>
&gt; instead. (Oji, 96)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Death<br/>
&gt; During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of<br/>
&gt; Keiou 4, Okita went<br/>
&gt; into Matsumoto Ryoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a<br/>
&gt; guesthouse<br/>
&gt; with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate<br/>
&gt; forces (including<br/>
&gt; the Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region,<br/>
&gt; Okita remained in<br/>
&gt; Edo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May<br/>
&gt; 30th), 1868. Later<br/>
&gt; that night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present Tokyo),<br/>
&gt; under his birth name<br/>
&gt; (with Okita Souji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is<br/>
&gt; not open to the<br/>
&gt; public. (Oji, p.252)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that<br/>
&gt; he was born<br/>
&gt; in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in<br/>
&gt; 1868 (or on a<br/>
&gt; lesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and<br/>
&gt; therefore was<br/>
&gt; 25 by Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trivia<br/>
&gt; It is historical accurate that Okita loved children. Duing his time in<br/>
&gt; Kyoto, he was often<br/>
&gt; seen playing with children and was a baby-sitter to Yagi&#39;s sons in the<br/>
&gt; Mibu temple. (Oji,<br/>
&gt; p.100)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He was not particularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved<br/>
&gt; sweets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aside from being treated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku<br/>
&gt; (medicine for<br/>
&gt; enervation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with<br/>
&gt; Ishida Sanyaku for<br/>
&gt; treating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okita in Fiction<br/>
&gt; It is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with<br/>
&gt; historical data about him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okita is briefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga series Rurouni<br/>
&gt; Kenshin, which<br/>
&gt; takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. A character<br/>
&gt; later on in the<br/>
&gt; series, Seta S?jir?, was based on the Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi<br/>
&gt; Keppuroku (and<br/>
&gt; therefore, darker than the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in<br/>
&gt; the anime/manga<br/>
&gt; Peacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an<br/>
&gt; episode of the anime<br/>
&gt; GS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only<br/>
&gt; of killing<br/>
&gt; people (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the<br/>
&gt; show&#39;s rendition of<br/>
&gt; Hijikata.) Okita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru,<br/>
&gt; which is a fictional<br/>
&gt; story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (where<br/>
&gt; Okita trains a<br/>
&gt; young girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her father and older<br/>
&gt; brother.) He is also<br/>
&gt; depicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/manga series Shura<br/>
&gt; no Toki,<br/>
&gt; Okita&#39;s (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with<br/>
&gt; a warrior from the<br/>
&gt; Mutsu, a clan that supposedly practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a<br/>
&gt; request from<br/>
&gt; Okita himself from years before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man<br/>
&gt; (sometimes a<br/>
&gt; bish?nen). The Latin American dub of Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook<br/>
&gt; Okita for a<br/>
&gt; woman, and the Hijikata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the<br/>
&gt; fangirls of<br/>
&gt; Peacemaker Kurogane.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a<br/>
&gt; flashback and as a<br/>
&gt; possible ghost), Okita&#39;s (obviously) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an<br/>
&gt; equally-obviously<br/>
&gt; fictional unnamed wife) is one of the three main characters of the series.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are also very<br/>
&gt; similar to the<br/>
&gt; character Ukyo Tachibana from the video game series Samurai Shodown.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okita Soji<br/>
&gt; &gt; From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita Soji (?? ??), (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first troop of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate<br/>
&gt; &gt; period. He was<br/>

&gt; &gt; 6 Okita in Fiction<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Background<br/>
&gt; &gt; He was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a<br/>
&gt; &gt; samurai family<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the Shirakawa- han&#39;s Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His<br/>
&gt; &gt; Great-grandfather was Okita<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kan&#39;emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His<br/>
&gt; &gt; father, Okita<br/>
&gt; &gt; Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Okita Kin<br/>
&gt; &gt; (1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita<br/>
&gt; &gt; family, Okita Rintaro<br/>
&gt; &gt; (1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kondo Shusuke<br/>
&gt; &gt; in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita started<br/>
&gt; &gt; training at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kondo Shusuke had<br/>
&gt; &gt; already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijikata<br/>
&gt; &gt; Toshizo had not<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy<br/>
&gt; &gt; and attained<br/>
&gt; &gt; Menkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 -<br/>

&gt; &gt; known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori,<br/>
&gt; &gt; p.27 - p.28)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; According to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) and Satou Shun&#39;sen<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Satou<br/>
&gt; &gt; Higokorou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high<br/>
&gt; &gt; cheekbones, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he was known<br/>

&gt; &gt; to Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou,<br/>
&gt; &gt; also a<br/>
&gt; &gt; practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shinchougumi (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shinsengumi&#39;s brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)<br/>

&gt; &gt; kenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kondo Isami to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana<br/>
&gt; &gt; called Kikuichi-<br/>
&gt; &gt; monji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wakizashi) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; his so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo<br/>
&gt; &gt; instead. (Oji, 96)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Death<br/>
&gt; &gt; During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Keiou 4, Okita went<br/>
&gt; &gt; into Matsumoto Ryoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; guesthouse<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate<br/>
&gt; &gt; forces (including<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita remained in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Edo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May<br/>
&gt; &gt; 30th), 1868. Later<br/>
&gt; &gt; that night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present Tokyo),<br/>
&gt; &gt; under his birth name<br/>
&gt; &gt; (with Okita Souji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not open to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; public. (Oji, p.252)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he was born<br/>
&gt; &gt; in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1868 (or on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore was<br/>
&gt; &gt; 25 by Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Trivia<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is historical accurate that Okita loved children. Duing his time in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kyoto, he was often<br/>
&gt; &gt; seen playing with children and was a baby-sitter to Yagi&#39;s sons in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mibu temple. (Oji,<br/>
&gt; &gt; p.100)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He was not particularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved<br/>
&gt; &gt; sweets.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Aside from being treated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku<br/>
&gt; &gt; (medicine for<br/>
&gt; &gt; enervation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ishida Sanyaku for<br/>
&gt; &gt; treating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There has not been any evidence of an Okita photograph.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okita in Fiction<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with<br/>
&gt; &gt; historical data about him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita is briefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga series Rurouni<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kenshin, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. A character<br/>
&gt; &gt; later on in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; series, Seta S?jir?, was based on the Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi<br/>
&gt; &gt; Keppuroku (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore, darker than the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the anime/manga<br/>
&gt; &gt; Peacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an<br/>
&gt; &gt; episode of the anime<br/>
&gt; &gt; GS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only<br/>
&gt; &gt; of killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; people (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; show&#39;s rendition of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hijikata.) Okita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is a fictional<br/>
&gt; &gt; story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (where<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita trains a<br/>
&gt; &gt; young girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her father and older<br/>
&gt; &gt; brother.) He is also<br/>
&gt; &gt; depicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/manga series Shura<br/>
&gt; &gt; no Toki,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita&#39;s (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with<br/>
&gt; &gt; a warrior from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mutsu, a clan that supposedly practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; request from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita himself from years before.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man<br/>
&gt; &gt; (sometimes a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bish?nen). The Latin American dub of Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okita for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; woman, and the Hijikata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fangirls of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Peacemaker Kurogane.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; While only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; flashback and as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible ghost), Okita&#39;s (obviously) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an<br/>
&gt; &gt; equally-obviously<br/>
&gt; &gt; fictional unnamed wife) is one of the three main characters of the series.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; His three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are also very<br/>
&gt; &gt; similar to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; character Ukyo Tachibana from the video game series Samurai Shodown.<br/>

Okita Soji<br/>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>
<br/>
Okita Soji (?? ??), (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the first troop of <br/>
the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate period. He was <br/>
a well-known genius swordsman, being one of the strongest out of the Shinsengumi, <br/>
along with Saito Hajime and Nagakura Shinpachi.<br/>

<br/>
Background<br/>
He was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai family <br/>
in the Shirakawa- han&#39;s Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His Great-grandfather was Okita <br/>
Kan&#39;emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His father, Okita <br/>
Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907) and Okita Kin <br/>
(1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita family, Okita Rintaro <br/>
(1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuke <br/>
in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and Okita started <br/>
training at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time, Kondo Shusuke had <br/>
already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijikata Toshizo had not <br/>
yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy and attained <br/>
Menkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 - p.11)<br/>
<br/>
In 1861, Okita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often <br/>
commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he was also <br/>
known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori, p.27 - p.28)<br/>
<br/>
According to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) and Satou Shun&#39;sen (Satou <br/>
Hikogorou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high cheekbones, a <br/>
wide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he was known as a man who <br/>
smiled and laughed well (not very talkative, however.)<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi Period<br/>
Okita changed his name to Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before his departure <br/>
to Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and a <br/>
Fukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou, also a <br/>
practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the Shinchougumi (the <br/>
Shinsengumi&#39;s brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)<br/>
<br/>
Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, with Todo Heisuke being <br/>
the youngest. He was one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (one of <br/>
the original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro assassinations in <br/>
1863. (Oji, p.132)<br/>
<br/>
Equally skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his signature technique was <br/>
named the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (which translates as &quot;Three Piece Thrust&quot;), a <br/>
technique that could attack one&#39;s neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. <br/>
(the Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but this is most <br/>
likely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention and it could <br/>
have been derived from an invention of Hijikata&#39;s (the Hirazuki.)<br/>
<br/>
It was rumored that his tuberculosis was discovered when he coughed blood and fainted <br/>
during the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say that he contracted the disease after that. <br/>
Both are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very slowly (many years). <br/>
While many of the Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaru was killed by Okita <br/>
during the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction), it is in fact historically <br/>
inaccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)<br/>
<br/>
Based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction, many also believe that Okita and Hijikata were like <br/>
brothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly <br/>
relationship with. Yamanami&#39;s seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was an <br/>
extremely painful incident in Okita&#39;s short life. (Mori, p.78) There is no record showing <br/>
that Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got along with <br/>
Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
In 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and also served as a <br/>
kenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be <br/>
the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)<br/>
<br/>
Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana called Kikuichi-<br/>
monji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a wakizashi) and <br/>
his so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo instead. (Oji, 96)<br/>
<br/>
Death<br/>
During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of Keiou 4, Okita went <br/>
into Matsumoto Ryoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a guesthouse <br/>
with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces (including <br/>
the Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region, Okita remained in <br/>
Edo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May 30th), 1868. Later <br/>
that night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present Tokyo), under his birth name <br/>
(with Okita Souji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is not open to the <br/>
public. (Oji, p.252)<br/>
<br/>
The information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that he was born <br/>
in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in 1868 (or on a <br/>
lesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and therefore was <br/>
25 by Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)<br/>
<br/>

It is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with historical data about him.<br/>
<br/>
