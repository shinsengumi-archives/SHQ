<h3>Translation Nakajima Nobori Portraits</h3>

<br/>
Nakajima Nobori, artist and a member of the Shinsengumi, provided us<br/>
with a valuable record of the &quot;post&quot; Kyoto Shinsengumi (and yes, they<br/>
changed their name and weren&#39;t technically the Shinsengumi any more).<br/>
<br/>
Please notice that when translations are posted to the SHQ, we are<br/>
noting exactly where the original information is coming from---even if<br/>
it is another Japanese site. <br/>
<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa as a historian in training is really going the extra<br/>
mile in terms of citation---and we are appreciative of his effort,<br/>
patience and the overall care he takes in contributing info. SHQ is<br/>
also grateful to other contributrs such as Seven as well.<br/>
<br/>
We are fortunate that alot of Shinsengumi info is now<br/>
online---however, it is becoming a very dangerous trend to &quot;translate&quot;<br/>
or &quot;transcribe&quot;? and post without noting in detail the original<br/>
Japanese source.  Translation without noting the source is also<br/>
plaigiarism.  <br/>
<br/>
Look at books on Japanese history, if the western writer is quoting<br/>
and translating stuff, he or she footnotes exactly the Japanese book<br/>
and page. This prevents translating or quoting out of context (because<br/>
readers can double check the work) or the translator adding *more* to<br/>
what was originally said.  <br/>
<br/>
The reader needs to know where the accurate translation ends, and<br/>
translator commentary begins. It doesn&#39;t matter if we are just fans,<br/>
we can be just as transparent and careful as researchers too (when we<br/>
are discussing history).<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to determine the validity of the work if there are<br/>
paragraphs of text all translated/transcribed but you don&#39;t know which<br/>
sentences and facts came out of the Japanese text.<br/>
<br/>
In my own experience, translators even go to the trouble of explaining<br/>
certain phrases in footnotes or provide the exact phrase in that<br/>
language as well to offer other interpretations.<br/>
