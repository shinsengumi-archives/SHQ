fans have seen it at miburo.com)  <br/>

<br/>
Please make this correction....<br/>
the photo is of Fujita Tsutomu (Goro+Tokio&#39;s 1st son)<br/>
and his wife MIDORI -not- Takagi TOKIO<br/>
<br/>
*yes* I know the file name says tokio-tsutomu but that is due to an <br/>
error...<br/>
<br/>
now many members of this community always wondered why Tokio looked <br/>
so young in the photo...now we know....it&#39;s not her....so basically <br/>
we don&#39;t have a photo of Tokio....but she may be in the latest photo <br/>
we have of senior citizen Fujita Goro...who knows<br/>
<br/>
okay so this isn&#39;t as bad as translating fundoshi as headband....for <br/>
a while we all though Fujita Goro washed his headband everyday....oh <br/>
well<br/>
<br/>
we can all thank Tama for clearing up this mess<br/>
