This isn't a fanfiction, but the title of a SF novel recently published in <br/>
Japan, called "Toshizo Hijikata of Mars".<br/>
It's a kinda space opera, written by well known SF novelist Taira Yoshioka.<br/>
The plot is below.<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, Hijikata Toshizo who must have been killed in war in Goryoukaku had <br/>
gone to Mars! He made a decision to complete an organization like Shinsengumi <br/>
again in order to protect the princess of Mars."<br/>
<br/>
No doubt, an hommage to E.R.Burroughs' classic,"John Carter of Mars"series.<br/>
I'll read it before long to follow Hijikata san's activity with Shinsengumi <br/>
like people on Mars.:-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, why can't we get these books translated into English! It's not fair! <br/>
<br/>
Yet another good reason to learn Japanese I suppose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That my friends is an alternate universe ^_^<br/>
and so is this some kind of allegory thing...perhaps Mars will be<br/>
forced to deal with space invaders from Earth? @_@  Different cities<br/>
on Mars will side with Earthlings etc...wow Shinsengumi+galactic<br/>
warfare...so they'll exchange their swords for what lasers? <br/>
<br/>
sec<br/>
still thinking about the possibility of Nakajima Nobori also involved<br/>
with info gathering for the Shinsengumi...hmmm later in life<br/>
owning/running a firearms shop pretty good way to collect info too if<br/>
you think about it hmmmmmm...see post at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>
<br/>
----------OT-------------<br/>
Sen Sei who started the PMK Fanart/Fanfic contest notified me and said<br/>
I won 2nd place for PMK Saitou (which I know realize I drew a messed<br/>
up left arm)...oh well can't change things drawn in marker LOL!...the<br/>
front page requested votes via email (and I was assuming Sen Sei and<br/>
company were judging)...okay so I'd like to thank everyone, if anyone,<br/>
who voted ^_^ email me for the 1 ryo I promised for each vote submitted...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, before I forget I would like to encourage people to view the<br/>
videos at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kendovj.com">http://www.kendovj.com</a><br/>
you have to be a member to view vids but it only takes a few seconds<br/>
to sign up...once you are registered click on<br/>
kendovideos>masters>senseis AND Kata AND Jodo (tournament footage is<br/>
okay but not a priority compared to senseis/Kata/jodo)<br/>
you will then be taken to pages which look like a messageboard...click<br/>
on "comments" and a pull down list will be revealed<br/>
-ALL- sensei footage is good and you will get to see some dojo<br/>
etiquette too!<br/>
Kata is from the Japan Police Competition<br/>
Jodo vs. Sword was pretty cool ^_^</div>
