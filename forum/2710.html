<h3>Lost Shinsengumi Thesis + other stuff</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105585301">I have to bring up this topic again because it is super super important.<br/>
<br/>
There exists out there a SHINSENGUMI THESIS that's right a JAPANESE<br/>
scholar who saw their historical significance and got his degree from<br/>
studying them ~seriously~ and he had advisors thus his work is going<br/>
to be decent AND in English (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone here part of our mighty Shinsengumi network who lives<br/>
-IN- Utah and can make phone calls?  See I'd do this myself except I<br/>
maxed out my phone card. And the person who promised to help me<br/>
must've forgotten or something.<br/>
<br/>
This is the info I have<br/>
1) author was formerly an employee at the Japanese Cultural Center at<br/>
Weber State<br/>
2) author wrote "'Samurai in Salt Lake' and available at the Weber<br/>
State bookstore for around $5.00<br/>
3) I don't have a name, year or anything!!! or whether it was an MA<br/>
thesis or undergrad thesis or Phd whatever---however it was<br/>
"published" for the school records<br/>
<br/>
-but- I have been searching, searching, searching all databases<br/>
available to me his thesis is just not showing up anywhere which means<br/>
that if someone can call <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://library.weber.edu/">http://library.weber.edu/</a> and ask the<br/>
librarian who handles this sort of thing we may be able to read it.<br/>
The best way to go about it is to find his or her "Samurai in Salt<br/>
Lake" and get their full name to do a search.<br/>
<br/>
Why must we pursue yet more nerdy work?  Because anyone who read Mr.<br/>
Hillsborough's work knows that it is far from comprehensive and<br/>
possibly alot of stuff was left out---this thesis may help us fill in<br/>
the 'gaps'.  <br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
(added to shinsengumihq.com bibliography) thank you to Hirotada<br/>
Tokugawa (M) and Michael from the ninjadojo.com who pointed out the<br/>
importance of this book<br/>
<br/>
Boyer, Samuel Pellman. Naval surgeon; the diary of Dr. Samuel Pellman<br/>
Boyer. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1963.<br/>
<br/>
***the following pdf has stuff on Aizu and HAKODATE battle details<br/>
(please tell any Hijikata fangirl you know to read these scans)<br/>
[download] <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/navalsurgeon.pdf">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/navalsurgeon.pdf</a><br/>
remember the book will not explicitly state "Hijikata Toshizo" however<br/>
all the fighting at Hakodate detailed in this diary basically spells<br/>
out all you wanted to know<br/>
<br/>
***note how the author mentions the civilians cheering for Satsuma one<br/>
day and then Aizu the next<br/>
<br/>
***bibliography now contains a list of the best of the best newspapers<br/>
printed during the Meiji Era or late Bakumatsu --- Meiji papers such<br/>
as the TOKIO TIMES analyze several Bakumatsu events...in English<br/>

Over at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/</a> <br/>
is a discussion of a Phd thesis about Aizu during the Bakumatsu...again<br/>
"Shinsengumi" is not stated (T_T) <br/>
although the author WILL write<br/>
a book later (and I insisted that he write a chapter on the Shinsengumi).<br/>
The dissertation is no longer available for download however if<br/>
someone here is interested I can get it to you just email me---lot's<br/>
of very very interesting battle details (the invasion of Aizu doesn't<br/>
concern -just- Saitou---it did concern Hijikata, Nakajima Nobori,<br/>
Shimada Kai and Tetsu) and ofcourse the others who died there.<br/>

handiwork from Tokyo Women's Normal School (where Tokio and later Goro<br/>

were part of the exhibit too! <br/>

<br/>
Are you feeling sad that you can't read Shinsengumi<br/>
stuff in Japanese?  But do you know another language<br/>
other than English?  <br/>
Like German? French? Spanish? Thai? Filipino? Korean?<br/>
Did you know that there is PLENTY OF BAKUMATSU info in<br/>
other languages?  <br/>
"Shinsengumi" may not be stated but<br/>
"mercenaries of Aizu" will show up one way or the other <br/>
(our boys have many many positive and negative labels).<br/>
Also remember that other cultures will view the Tokugawa and<br/>
even the Meiji Era very DIFFERENTLY from American scholars.<br/>
It has alot to do with whether or not that culture interacted<br/>
with Japan during WWII (this will totally affect how they will write<br/>
about the restoration).</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-771545081">I decided to make some phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
1) The reason why I was unable to locate the author was because title<br/>
of the book "Samurai in Salt Lake" is incorrect---it is "SamuraiS in<br/>
Salt Lake" ISBN:0965116395<br/>
****I spoke to the author, Prof. Collinwood and he said this book was<br/>
expanded but not yet published, he highly recommends the follow up<br/>
book which will be a great work on the Iwakura Mission (1872)<br/>
<br/>
2) No, he did not write a thesis on the Shinsengumi -BUT- HE WANTED<br/>
TO!!!! Like many scholars he got distracted and had to pursue other<br/>
stuff and so forth so it never happened (T_T)<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean? And why is it important that "scholars" get<br/>
interested?  Because they write, publish and preserve.  They do the<br/>
nerd work which needs to be done.  And their writing is the source for<br/>
fandom products (pop-culture etc).<br/>
<br/>
In other words---it is up to us fans to make the Shinsengumi so<br/>
significant that they finally will look into studying them. It is up<br/>
to us (*_*).  The cycle between academia and culture must be nurtured<br/>
otherwise in a few decades the Shinsengumi will simply slip back into<br/>
"cliche" when as we know they were very fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
I hope anyone here who is in college will consider speaking to<br/>
graduate students or professors who specialize in this field and ask<br/>
them about their interests. Do not be surprised if they have never<br/>
heard of the Shinsengumi (remember they are considered to be basically<br/>
insignificant to many) or even AIZU (which is totally scary seeing how<br/>
Satsuma and Choshu battled it out with this domain).  It would be<br/>
helpful if you get a basic understanding of this era rather than ask<br/>
them to tell you everything they know (^_^)---but really you will find<br/>
many of them to be friendly people who are willing to help you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100897622">I know this is an old topic, but I'm new and was catching up on old posts.<br/>
First -- I AM in Utah in the Asian Studies program at a different<br/>
university. There are MANY students in the program here who have<br/>
become VERY interested in samurai of all periods. And, if you mention<br/>
  Shin sen gumi in a room of Asian Studies Majors, you'll get a<br/>
joyously heated discussion. IT IS ALIVE AND WELL IN UTAH. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, it's one subject of my abbreviated thesis (a series of<br/>
shorter, 8-10 page papers written as an addendum to a Grad School<br/>
Application and authorization to pursue publishing). I've been work<br/>
with the works of Hillsborough, Keene, Jansen, Craig, and Totman<br/>
mainly, but I'd love ANY help y'all can give. I speak fluent Thai, but<br/>
my Japanese is still hideously rudimentary. <br/>
<br/>
If y'all could:<br/>
I've run into claims that the "Ideda'ya affair extended the war by two<br/>
years at least" more than 5 times, but I HAVEN'T found an intelligible<br/>
explanation of that claim. Hillsborough doesn't seem to buy it, and<br/>
devotes a few paragraphs to it. The claim is popularly accepted, but<br/>
I'd like a data-based analysis of it.<br/>

Any ideas or sources, folks?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597676478">Sawasdee Khun Meredith,<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very difficult to prove the importance of the Ikedaya <br/>
affair in the context of whether or not it exacerbated Choshu <br/>
hostility or if it extended the life of the shogunate.<br/>
<br/>
Sure it pissed off Choshu---but Choshu would have chosen any chance <br/>
to fight---I think we need a Choshu expert to help explain their <br/>
side of things.<br/>
<br/>
Many western accounts written during that era leave out Ikedaya <br/>
altogether.  Even Japanese texts which cover the "bakufu side" (and <br/>
especially the SHINSENGUMI) such as:<br/>
<br/>
Yamaguchi, Ken. Translated from the Japanese by Sir Ernest Mason <br/>
Satow. Kinsé shiriaku A history of Japan, from the first visit of <br/>
Commodore Perry in 1853 to the capture of Hakodate by the Mikado's <br/>
forces in 1869. Wilmington, Del., Scholarly Resources 1973, 1906 ; <br/>
ISBN: 084201411X<br/>
<br/>
*does *not even mention Ikedaya (perhaps I missed it but...I just <br/>
can't find it in the book).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Ikedaya was key only to the Shinsengumi narrative---but not <br/>
key to the entire "fall of the shogunate" story<br/>
<br/>
Because another dimension which we must pursue is this:<br/>
were the shogunate forces defeated by modern weapons or more <br/>
importantly...Capitalism?  Therefore one although *key raid such as <br/>
Ikedaya would be ultimately ineffective in the overall conflict.<br/>
<br/>
and is the view of the Restoration as a capitalist revolution <br/>
(ultimately with victorious domains controlling various industrial <br/>
and military monopolies) a sound approach?  Maybe it is....<br/>
<br/>
sorry I cannot answer your question---but I know other members here <br/>
may be able to help (^___^)<br/>
<br/>
I specialize in Siam/Thailand (fluent in the language) feel free to <br/>
email me offlist secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com if I can assist you<br/>
<br/>
Thai scholars who study the Bakumatsu are in agreeement with some <br/>
Japanese scholars (Mr. Hirotada Tokugawa mentioned this lone opinion <br/>
that the Restoration was simply the monopolization of land to gain <br/>
taxes to fund one government---controlled by a few men from certain <br/>
domains)---the Thai scholar (I have a copy of this note) mentioned <br/>
that the Bakumatsu was an attempt to gather all farmland---*asses <br/>
the national resources and then decide on the nature of a <br/>
capitalist/industrial complex which followed.  Basically, Sat-Cho <br/>
victors were incredibly ignorant of the the Norther (Eastern) <br/>
domains and what those territories possessed in terms of natural <br/>
wealth.  War = Plunder in other words.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are all happy to hear that the Shinsengumi are alive in <br/>
an academic setting as well as in pop-culture.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for posting!!!!!!<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-92134675">*Lurks from out of the shadows* <br/>
<br/>
I may be wrong (as I have often been), but the<br/>
reasoning that the Ikeda-ya Affair delayed the<br/>
eventual Meiji Restoration has been explained thus: <br/>
<br/>
The Ikeda-ya Affair triggered the Choshu's March on<br/>
Kyoto (or officially Kinmon-no-Hen), as vastly<br/>
exaggerated accounts of how many, many, many Choshu<br/>
men had been massacred reached the province, which<br/>
prompted them to take up arms. <br/>
Then, their almost absolute defeat at Kinmon-no-Hen<br/>
undermined Choshu - militarily, politically and<br/>
economically. Based on this, people have reasoned that<br/>
had it not been for Kinmon-no-Hen (for which Ikeda-ya<br/>
has been credited as one of the direct causes), Choshu<br/>
would have risen up earlier. <br/>
<br/>
There is also the notion that Ikeda-ya (or<br/>
Kinmon-no-Hen rather) actually speeded up the<br/>
Bakumatsu: had it not been such a catalyst for Choshu<br/>
to take action, then their rebellious politics might<br/>
have festered for much longer before coming to the<br/>
boil. <br/>
<br/>
Either way, it was a matter of a few years earlier or<br/>
a few years later. Hope this helps. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes, <br/>
<br/>
Mio. <br/>

<h3>Re: Lost Shinsengumi Thesis + other stuff</h3>
by <i>slvrgriffn</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183121653">(sorry for the delay...my husband has been in and out of the hospital<br/>
and academics had just been on the back burner for a few weeks!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the response. It led to a three hour debate with my advisor<br/>
 about what might have happened if the plot had NOT been discovered<br/>
and Kyoto had burned (or any other of the proposed aspects of the plot<br/>
had  occured). It's been debated that the destruction of Kyoto would<br/>
have had a similarly catalyzing effect on the pro-Bakufu<br/>
factions...Which led to a discussion of the Social Atmosphere in<br/>
Kyoto. Ain't history grand?<br/>
<br/>
I think we've nailed down a focus for my preparatory thesis -- the <br/>
Cultural and Sociological Foundation of the Shinsengumi with emphasis<br/>
on their violence and sociological evolution.  I think -- Mind, I say<br/>
I THINK -- that most of the moronic ideas thrown around my department<br/>
regarding military corps and their movtivations arise from on overly<br/>
politicized point of view.  My colleagues fail to recognize that these<br/>
were INDIVIDUALS making decisions based on their beliefs and past<br/>
experiences. They overemphasize political events without considering<br/>
the social atmosphere (for one thing, I don't think it's wise to<br/>
ignore the potential impact being raised in a region plagued by<br/>
banditry had on a young Kondo and his fellows). <br/>
Anyway! I think I'm trying to construct an academically supported<br/>
thesis which puts their "violence and zealotry" (as a very loudmouthed<br/>
fellow put it yesterday) in context -- not just the political context,<br/>
but how these men INTERPRETED that political context -- and how their<br/>
lives and experiences influenced that interpretation. Every history<br/>
I've read is either political or biographic or economic (with the<br/>
exception of Hillsborough, who is either loved or vilified by anyone I<br/>
ask). Someone needs to look at the organic evolution of the corps.<br/>
<br/>
Whew! <br/>
<br/>
I'll post my inital research subjects in a separate post after this<br/>
one. Thanks!<br/>

<h3>Re: Lost Shinsengumi Thesis + other stuff</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762377601">Dear slvrgriffin<br/>
I think what is lacking, as you've said, is an understanding of the <br/>
background of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
The only text written by an outstanding scholar has been summarized <br/>
here<br/>
<br/>
Steele, M. William. Alternative Narratives in Modern Japanese <br/>
History.<br/>
New York: Routledge Curzon, 2003.Isbn 0415305705 <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
(the Facts section has been revised to make navigating more easy <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/facts.htm)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/facts.htm)</a><br/>
<br/>
More interesting perhaps is that it is more *easier* to paint the <br/>
Shinsengumi to be *villains because their enemies, the Ishin have <br/>
been generalized as men with a vision for a democratic Japan.  <br/>
<br/>
Both sides were motivated by ideals however there is in fact very <br/>
weak evidence to suggest that democracy or an egalitarian society <br/>
(which really exists nowhere in the world) was even on the minds of <br/>
the revolutionaries.<br/>
<br/>
Words like "revolutionary" hold a romantic appeal for people in the <br/>
west and automatically researchers look to the data and filter for <br/>
evidence which would recreate the Ishin to fit their framework.  For <br/>
many, pre-1868 Japan was nothing but a primitive and <br/>
intellectualy "dark" society.  Only after 1868 did Japan see <br/>
the "light" (which was from the West ofcourse).  Thus, the men who <br/>
brought about the revolution must be torch bearers and their <br/>
opposition must be all "evil".<br/>
<br/>
Reading texts on the Bakumatsu and Meiji Era in chronological order <br/>
according to publication date shows how deeply entrenched the bias <br/>
was...only in the 1930s and post WWII do we see western scholarship <br/>
*really look at the Meiji Era for what it was.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am working on Unmasking the Meiji Era (still <br/>
incomplete) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Ishin-1.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Ishin-1.htm</a> (the <br/>
navigation, index, essays, biographies are on the left of the image <br/>
map)which will not only show the real agenda of the Meiji government <br/>
but also their *fear of a *real revolution.  As soon as they came to <br/>
power, they used legal means to be sure that the ideals which the <br/>
west erroneously assigned to them...would never in fact achieve <br/>
fruition.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this mailing list and the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> are <br/>
helpful in your studies. We look forward to learning from you.<br/>

<br/>
Hillsborough's tone in his texts can be improved---however I think if <br/>
his works were personal essays expressing his personal opinion <br/>
then .fine. As a professional journalist and author he should know the <br/>
impact of his product.<br/>
<br/>
even he admits that his work is not 100% history (which we all agree is <br/>
part of the Shinsengumi legacy)---however it is possible to <br/>
categorize "iffy" details as folktales and solid evidence (documents <br/>
relating Aizu and the Shinsengumi for instance) into real history and <br/>
proceed with a study of some sort.  Details which cannot be confirmed <br/>
can easily be footnoted/endnote etc etc (but not abandoned)<br/>
<br/>
this also goes for his other non-Shinsengumi books which are very <br/>
popular ... he and many other researchers are just one step away from <br/>
making some historical figures messianic [Mori Arinori is a good <br/>
example](which in fact damages the humanity of the figures they study <br/>
by undermining their complexity)<br/>
<br/>
an organic view of the corps would be interesting given the interesting <br/>
mix of martial lineages represented in the group<br/>
<br/>
this was our brainstorm<br/>
