<h3>Gintama to be animated! TV Tokyo and Sunrise Project coming soon</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068284663">To those who does not know what Gintama is, it's came first as a <br/>
pirate manga with some of the main characters inspired from our very <br/>
own Shinsengumi men, they even have the same names set in an alternate <br/>
universe. I just wanted to let everyone know that TV Tokyo and Sunrise <br/>
are going to release Gintama as an Anime this May, 2006. Isn't that <br/>
great? *nods* of course it is... LOL! I'm more of an anime person you <br/>
see... But anyway here are the japanese websites... and this news is <br/>
credited to animenation.net.<br/>
