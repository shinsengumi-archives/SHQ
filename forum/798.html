<h3>Advance rumor</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193671712">Well, I&#39;ve been waiting all day to hear from Chris or his manager for clarification on this, but...  From a message from Chris Patton to his fan group:<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Also, ADV announced Peacemaker, which I believe I will have a role in, though of course nothing can be officially confirmed or denied as of yet. (wink wink).&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there another anime by that name or is it what I think?<br/>
<br/>
Small world... I &quot;met&quot; Chris through livejournal and when he discontinued his personal journal a few weeks ago (which was a major bummer because it was always such a delight to read), I joined his yahoogroup fan group to keep tabs on what he was up to.  (He&#39;s extremely personable and in tune with his fans, but I&#39;ve had no desire to pelt him with e-mails of &quot;so what&#39;s new?&quot;... you know what I mean?  It was different when it was through lj.)  Anyway, if he is talking about PMK, I&#39;ll see if he or his manager will keep me up to date so I can pass it on here.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re as unfamiliar with Chris&#39; work as I was (and still am, really, since I&#39;m not into anime in any big way), check the CrystalAcids entry for him at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crystalacids.com/database/actor/patton_christopher.html.">http://www.crystalacids.com/database/actor/patton_christopher.html.</a>  He was lead character in &quot;Pretear&quot; and &quot;Spriggan&quot; and did several episode characters for &quot;Saiyuki.&quot;  He&#39;s done quite a bit of work and just keeps getting busier...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412555914">Ah another which is better sub or dub? Actually the DVDs I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure will come with both the Japanese/English audio. Every anime that <br/>
I have bought has been like that (exclude the hongkong/pirate <br/>
versions on this). Actually it&#39;s quite a treat to watch in pure <br/>
Nihonggo goodness without the subtitles, it&#39;s amazing how much I <br/>
missed when I was watching the fansubs.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho.... Dub very few have been done decently. The only one I can <br/>
pick out as a relatively good dub was the Big O. Kenshin DVDs <br/>
themselve, the english version killed me. My expectations for a good <br/>
dub is not high... <br/>
