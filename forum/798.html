<h3>Advance rumor</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193671712">Well, I've been waiting all day to hear from Chris or his manager for clarification on this, but...  From a message from Chris Patton to his fan group:<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>Also, ADV announced Peacemaker, which I believe I will have a role in, though of course nothing can be officially confirmed or denied as of yet. (wink wink).<<<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there another anime by that name or is it what I think?<br/>
<br/>
Small world... I "met" Chris through livejournal and when he discontinued his personal journal a few weeks ago (which was a major bummer because it was always such a delight to read), I joined his yahoogroup fan group to keep tabs on what he was up to.  (He's extremely personable and in tune with his fans, but I've had no desire to pelt him with e-mails of "so what's new?"... you know what I mean?  It was different when it was through lj.)  Anyway, if he is talking about PMK, I'll see if he or his manager will keep me up to date so I can pass it on here.<br/>
<br/>
If you're as unfamiliar with Chris' work as I was (and still am, really, since I'm not into anime in any big way), check the CrystalAcids entry for him at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crystalacids.com/database/actor/patton_christopher.html.">http://www.crystalacids.com/database/actor/patton_christopher.html.</a>  He was lead character in "Pretear" and "Spriggan" and did several episode characters for "Saiyuki."  He's done quite a bit of work and just keeps getting busier...<br/>

too---when it first started last October I managed to get hold of <br/>
someone through the PMK anime official site (I think their email link <br/>

BUT those Japanese voice actors are so perfect as those characters....I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412555914">Ah another which is better sub or dub? Actually the DVDs I'm pretty <br/>
sure will come with both the Japanese/English audio. Every anime that <br/>
I have bought has been like that (exclude the hongkong/pirate <br/>
versions on this). Actually it's quite a treat to watch in pure <br/>
Nihonggo goodness without the subtitles, it's amazing how much I <br/>
missed when I was watching the fansubs.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho.... Dub very few have been done decently. The only one I can <br/>
pick out as a relatively good dub was the Big O. Kenshin DVDs <br/>
themselve, the english version killed me. My expectations for a good <br/>
dub is not high... <br/>
