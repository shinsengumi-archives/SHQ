<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194517616">Hi hi! I am interested in a few more info about Yagi Hide (aside <br/>
from the NHK show) ^__^*<br/>

Unfortunately, I cannot find any good sources on her and her family <br/>
per se. If someone can point me to the right direction, that will be <br/>
very much appreciated. Thanks guys/gals.</div>

(My conscience pricks me when I think of it.)<br/>
<br/>
The girl called Yagi Hide does not exist really. <br/>
She is the fictitious person of Taiga drama.<br/>
The elder brother and younger brother of a name who are called <br/>
Hidejirou and Tamesaburou were in the actual Yagi family. <br/>
The present Yagi family is the posterity of Hidejirou. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, although the old woman was in the Yagi family of a <br/>
Taiga drama, she does not exist really in practice, either.<br/>
The actual Yagi family is also holding the funeral at the same time <br/>
as death of her of Taiga drama. <br/>
In practice, it was the funeral of the child of Yagi family.<br/>
Probably, other brother would exist in Hidejirou and Tamesaburou.<br/>
(Although Japanese television has little regulation compared with a <br/>
foreign country, it becomes nervous at a child's death.) <br/>
Serizawa Kamo did not help a funeral in the Taiga drama. <br/>
However, actual he acted as a visitor's receptionist together with <br/>
Kondou.<br/>
The scribble which Serizawa wrote to the note remains then still <br/>
now.^_^ <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Tama! This really does help out a -lot-. I was stupefied on <br/>
how come I couldn't figure out anymore of her from the Taiga drama. <br/>
Now I know why.<br/>
<br/>
And yes thank you for discussing the grandmother's death and <br/>
Serizawa's participation. Perhaps this or you have discussed this <br/>
before so please my apologies for the repeat (if any).<br/>
<br/>
I am a little disappointed.. Although probably not as disappointed as <br/>
the person who I am working with. But yet I'd rather know the truth. <br/>
Thank you for your help!<br/>

I am not Tama-san.<br/>
Probably, although I thought that this was your misapprehension, I <br/>
was a little surprised^_^ <br/>
(Possibly, has Tama-san already answered this?) <br/>
<br/>
The Taiga drama had many bold fictions.<br/>
And since it was good at composition, it looked just like the fact.<br/>
My parents and friends were convinced that many are historical facts.<br/>
When they had asked me for explanation, I suffered troubles very <br/>
much^_^<br/>
