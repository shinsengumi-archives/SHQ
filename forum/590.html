<h3>Three tree Saburo Suzuki site</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040336965">I just spent a little time over on the site...  I'm so easy to keep amused.  Suzuki was born on July 12.  My birthday is July 11.  :-D  Too cool!!<br/>
 <br/>
I just copied and pasted the babelfish translation into a Word document, so I'll be spending some time with it (with the usual confusion).  Some of it begins to sound like Saitou to some degree:<br/>
 <br/>
(babelfish translation):<br/>
<br/>
"But, the drunkard as it is accustomed to the house inside the temple, the liquor quantity increases the multi gates steadily, reaches the point where you shirk work.<br/>
Scolding, being not to inquire about that you say absolutely finally it becomes divorce. <br/>
After the divorcing, it renames Arazirou Miki, that way you make just part serve it means.<br/>
But, conduct not to be repaired, it does not change and drinks the liquor to morning and because it reaches the point where and you shirk feudal clan duty, it becomes 2 part exemption."<br/>
 <br/>
So he had a drinking problem, too?  (This is before he joins the Shinsengumi.)  It sounds like he was adopted into a feudal clan after some problem with his family (not included here and I don't understand what they're getting at --- if the family got into trouble or if he got into trouble for wanting to leave school to join the war or if he'd started a private school & numbers were declining because of the war or... <shrug>).  I suppose because I want information so badly on Suzuki, babelfish seems weirder than usual with this translation.  There's some talk about Itou and martial arts, too, but I can't decipher it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it looks like he ended up being Izumi Miki (Japanese order) during the Meiji era.<br/>
