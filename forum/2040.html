<br/>
basically the zip files above are the table of contents to a series <br/>
of books which give translations of major documents from 1844-1894<br/>
very often the books we encounter will offer excerpts or <br/>
*interpretations* of these documents...<br/>
many scholars make the critical mistake of relying on the <br/>
interpretations of OTHER scholars, what you end up with is a <br/>
horrible domino effect so there is a need to take a look at the <br/>
original government papers<br/>
<br/>
if you skim the table of contents you will note economic concerns <br/>
and various issues which led to the Seinan War, and the push for <br/>
more liberal reforms...if anyone would like certain documents to be <br/>
scanned please email me at <br/>
secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com and specify the volume number<br/>
<br/>
for example Nakahara Hisao (Hisao has other spellings) &quot;confession&quot; <br/>
a simple document, was published and spread all over the Satsuma <br/>
domain and the result was a full scale war....his confession is <br/>
often summarized in books about Saigo Takamori...the conditions of <br/>
this confession (torture and Nakahara just put his stamp on the pre-<br/>
written document) are usually left out...the fine print is pretty <br/>
interesting<br/>
<br/>
{{Off-topic}}<br/>
but I&#39;m going to raise the issue anyways<br/>
from many chats and emails I gather that our demographics actually <br/>
ranges from elementary, junior high, high school, university to <br/>
special &quot;senior&quot; status....so many have expressed an intense <br/>
fanatical love for the Shinsengumi and the era...keep in mind that <br/>
many colleges/universities/scholarships DO require writing samples <br/>
and such requirements pre-undergraduate, or in progress <br/>
undergraduate DO NOT CARE about the topic at all...what they are <br/>
looking for is whether or not you can write...so do consider <br/>
researching the Bakumatsu/Meiji Era and find a topic you like (and <br/>
*share*with*us)...interested in the liberal movement?  Well the <br/>
Meiji Era has TONS of these groups complete with speeches, riots, <br/>
and sudden police raids.  Women&#39;s rights, and economic issues are <br/>
well documented in ENGLISH...so don&#39;t miss out on your chance to <br/>
write about something you actually *love*...you should write NOW <br/>
when you have the time (^_^)<br/>
start in your local public library, community college library and <br/>
university library (you can actually obtain day passes to major <br/>
research universities---you DO NOT have to be a student).<br/>

&quot;When I take the sword, be it only the foil, there&#39;s no parent, no <br/>
pupil nor master in my eye.  Even the best of all best friends I <br/>
regard him as the worst enemy whom I must kill.  That is how I <br/>
school myself to the art of swordsmanship.&quot;<br/>
Ryunosuke from &quot;Dai-bosatsu Toge&quot;<br/>
aka the Psycho Guy or better yet THE TERMINATOR WITH A SWORD from <br/>
the movie &quot;SWORD OF DOOM&quot;</div>
