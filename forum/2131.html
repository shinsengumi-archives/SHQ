<h3>Need Confirmation on this...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-281604902">I was trying to clean my desk and went through layers of notes (the <br/>
process is almost like an archaeological dig) and found a note <br/>
saying &quot;Natsume Soseki??? knew Fujita Goro&quot;....this is based on a <br/>
VERY old post from a Japanese messageboard and was confirmed by one <br/>
member here at the SHQ (confirmed in terms of the name of the writer <br/>
NOT whether it was true or not).<br/>
<br/>
I know Natsume Soseki from &quot;I AM A CAT&quot; I only saw the movie...never <br/>
read the translation.<br/>
<br/>
Info on Natsume Soseki...notice his dates and where he became a <br/>
professor<br/>

***one of the pages mentions that a major theme of his work is <br/>
individualism versus group psychology (which is by the way the heart <br/>
of many AIM discussions we have had over several months in regards to <br/>
the Shinsengumi)***<br/>
<br/>
All of my &quot;side research&quot; on the Meiji era has started from these <br/>
random posts on Japanese messageboards (for example Higuchi Ichiyo, <br/>
her father worked for the TMPD too by the way,  living very close to <br/>
the Fujita Family, the Yamakawa family and overall Aizu connection <br/>
which we have known for quiet some time and on and on)....<br/>
<br/>
Natsume Soseki is always mentioned in connection to Mori Ogai...Mori <br/>
Ogai is connected to HIguchi Ichiyo (she had ALOT of guy friends).<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a very OBSCURE connection but I did in fact get this <br/>
off a messageboard and sadly so many of the old sites have crashed or <br/>
their boards have been closed down so I would not be able to find the <br/>
link</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123038468">Coincidences are so funny (and seem to happen so often whether it&#39;s been here or in a silly RPG)... Just 2 days ago, I was doing some research involving Arthurian legends and Soseki&#39;s name came up in association with translating themes across culture.  He reset 5 stories into Japanese context in &quot;Kairo-ko: A Dirge,&quot; first published in 1905.  How ironic if he *was* a friend of Saitou&#39;s and a totally unrelated study of mine should still lead back to him.  :-D<br/>
