<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729160854">Tonight, on TCM (Turner Classic Movies), their TCM import is "Gate of Hell" ("Jigokumon") from 1953, directed by Kinugasa Teinosuke.  Major award-winner --- Palme d'Or (first Japanese film to win the Grand Prix) at Cannes and the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (honorary award since the category wasn't made official until the next year).  13th/14th century samurai love story.  (A note of interest, apparently the director was known for female roles (oyama?) in silent film.)  Shows TONIGHT at 2:30 AM EST, 11:30 PM PST.<br/>
