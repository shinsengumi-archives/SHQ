<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729160854">Tonight, on TCM (Turner Classic Movies), their TCM import is &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; (&quot;Jigokumon&quot;) from 1953, directed by Kinugasa Teinosuke.  Major award-winner --- Palme d&#39;Or (first Japanese film to win the Grand Prix) at Cannes and the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (honorary award since the category wasn&#39;t made official until the next year).  13th/14th century samurai love story.  (A note of interest, apparently the director was known for female roles (oyama?) in silent film.)  Shows TONIGHT at 2:30 AM EST, 11:30 PM PST.<br/>
