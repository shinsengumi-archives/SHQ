 </span></blockquote>Kondou Tamako was born on February 15, 1862. <br/>
Since Isami went to Kyoto one year after she was born, she lived on <br/>
Tsune and Edo. <br/>
After Isami died, they lived in the house of the elder brother of <br/>
Isami. <br/>
She married Miyagawa Yuugorou which is her cousin. <br/>
Yuugorou is the second son of Miyagawa Otogorou which is the elder <br/>
brother of Isami. <br/>
The Kondou family was continued because he becomes the adopted child <br/>
of the Kondou family. <br/>
It was 1876 years. <br/>
She was 15 years old and Yuugorou was 26 years old. <br/>
A son called Hisatarou (Kyutarou?) was born in 1883. <br/>
However, she died of an illness at the age of 25 in 1886. <br/>
Tsune died the six years after. <br/>
And Hisatarou was killed in the Sino-Japanese War as a soldier. <br/>
Therefore, the direct posterity of Isami does not exist. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yuugorou became the 5th generation of Tennen Rishin Ryuu. <br/>
Since Shinsengumi was famous, 3000 or more students existed. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Isami planned to make Tamako and Shuuhei get married. <br/>
However, as for Shuuhei, the relation with Isami has run out. <br/>
A cause is not known. <br/>
However, their parentage was lost. <br/>
And Shuuhei disappeared after Toba-Fushimi war. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787639988">Hmmm... does this mean that an adopted relative isn&#39;t in fact considered a relative when it comes to marriages and such?<br/>
 <br/>
Because I&#39;ve seen a lot of reference to daimyo and the like adopting their sons-in-law as heirs, but never one to a guy who was first adopted and *then* married. <br/>
