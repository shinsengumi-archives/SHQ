I have uploaded to the Files section a scan from the compilation "Meiji <br/>
Nyuusu Jiten." This one is of an article published in the pro-Bakufu <br/>
newspaper "Koko Shinbun," from the 4th month of 1868, describing the notice <br/>
posted at Itabashi-juku regarding Kondou's execution.<br/>
<br/>
May he rest in peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869514976">I thought that the anniversary was in May... and Souji passed away  sometime in June/July by western calender...   Wow, if I  could I would so like to visit one the Shinsengumi's grave  someday.   By any chance, do we have pictures of diffrent  memeber's graves?   Or even the monument that Nagakura build?<br/>
