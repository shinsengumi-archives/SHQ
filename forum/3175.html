<h3>Shinsengumi Discussion</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238611537">Here are the first round questions that are being discussed, I'll <br/>
post them here to facilitate some discussion, and later distill down <br/>
the answers that are gathering in the discussion:<br/>
<br/>
1. What was Kiyokawa Hachiro's ulterior motive for leading the <br/>
Roshigumi and going to Kyoto? <br/>
<br/>
2. Why did some of the Roshigumi head back to Edo while others <br/>
stayed in Mibu? <br/>
<br/>
3. Why was Serizawa Kamo selected as a leader? <br/>
<br/>
4. Why was Serizawa Kamo assasinated? <br/>
<br/>
5. What purpose did the Shinsengumi serve? <br/>
<br/>
6. Why did Kondo Isami end up leading the Shinsengumi? <br/>
<br/>
7. What happened at the Ikedaya incident? <br/>
<br/>
8. Why is the incident at the Ikedaya so notable? <br/>
<br/>
9. Why was Yagi Gennojo's residence made part of the Mibu Roshigumi <br/>
headquarters? <br/>
<br/>
10. What would cause a ronin to join the Shinsengumi rather than any <br/>
of the other factions? What type of person would join the <br/>
Shinsengumi?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586983930">Hello hello,<br/>
has anyone answered Kitsuno's questions or perhaps replied to him off <br/>
list?  Samurai archives is trying to accomplish alot and whenever <br/>
possible we must lend our support.<br/>
<br/>
I can reply however I don't always have my books etc right in front <br/>
of me and lately getting SHQ website up to speed is my number 1 <br/>
priority right now.  <br/>
<br/>
So if someone can give atleast a general answer to Kitsuno please <br/>
help him out---if we don't reply right away it's not because we do <br/>
not care or are ignoring someone...we have hundreds of members who <br/>
can assist and it is likely that many people are really busy w/ <br/>
school and jobs.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071581715">1. His alterior motive was to lead the group to protect the emporer,<br/>
not the shogun and to help Iemochi expell the foriegners.<br/>
<br/>
2.  At this time there was an issue concerning the death of a british<br/>
subject. Brittan was demanding reperations and if diplomatic relations<br/>
failed it could lead to war. Kiyokawa was intent on leading the<br/>
rishigumi to Edo in order to fight if it came to that.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhail, Kondou and Serizawa were rather miffed about being 'lead<br/>
astray' or lied to.. however you look at it and decided to reamain<br/>
behind to protect the Shogun and expell the foriengers.<br/>
<br/>
3. I'm not certain about this question as all I have read has said<br/>
that both Serizawa and Kondou were co-leaders.<br/>
<br/>
Why was Serizawa a leader at all?  It may have been his seniority in<br/>
rank... it could have been because he had his own people who followed<br/>
only him, it could have been due to him being a captain of the Tengu<br/>
Party. His alfa-male personality??? Or maybe cause his brother was in<br/>
the Aizu's police force?  <br/>
<br/>
4. Because he was an asshole. Because his actions (quite nurmerous)<br/>
came to the attention of the head of the Aizu who requested the he<br/>
should be assasinated. He was an extoritionist to say the least, there<br/>
are rumors of rape as well, acts of violence every five damn<br/>
secconds... he was just a rather nasty individual... it seemed as if<br/>
he could do what ever he wanted cause he was the son of a ranking<br/>
samuarai... no need to follow the bushido for him !<br/>
<br/>
5.  The shinsengumi were to protect the shogunates interests in mibu.<br/>
There was lots of anti shogun activity and lawlessness that the reg<br/>
police force couldn't cope with so they were kind of an auxilery force<br/>
and a squad of aizu-clan/ shogun approved assasines/ police force.<br/>
<br/>
6. Because he was co-leader and when serizawa was assinated it just<br/>
seemed like the natural thing.. by the timem serizawa was killed so<br/>
were his most loyal supporters. Everyone else was loyal to Kondou and<br/>
his group.<br/>
<br/>
7. The shinsengumi raided a meeting btwn the anti shogun activists who<br/>
were intending to burn down kyoto and kidnap the emporer. From what I<br/>
have read there were three shinsengumi fatalities.... as far as the<br/>
anti-shogunate ... most of them were killed.<br/>
<br/>
8. I'm guessing becuase of what they prevented (see above) and how<br/>
successfull they were with the small amount of people involved.<br/>
<br/>
9. I dont remember this one... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10. Class. Position. One had to be born a samurai. If a person joined<br/>
the shinsengumi he became a samurai it was boost in statust that had<br/>
never before been available. Or maybe to do something they considered<br/>
important to give thier life meaning or they wanted to slaughter<br/>
people ....  in short... to be something greater than they were, or to<br/>
make a name for themselvs.</div>
