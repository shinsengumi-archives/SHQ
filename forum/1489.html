<div id="ygrps-yiv-59754893">I had posted a short report on Saitou's Sword at my streamload account<br/>

I did [not] announce this report on this list because I was waiting<br/>
for a knowledgeable person to DOUBLE CHECK everything.  And the person<br/>
hasn't gotten back to me yet.<br/>
<br/>
[however] I noticed that some people started to download it<br/>
anyways...so let me warn you...I had gathered some info from some<br/>
books and arranged everything (my university library happened to have<br/>
some very good books in English on swords and fortunately traced the<br/>
lineage of Saitou's sword's maker)...but keep in mind I don't collect<br/>
swords so its like someone writing about car engines without having<br/>
come into direct contact with car engines.  Saitou's sword has a VERY<br/>
interesting history ^_^.<br/>
<br/>
To the people who downloaded the essay, I just uploaded an updated<br/>
version complete with >>images<< which explains the different kinds of<br/>
hamon and pic of the "Aizu Shintogo" tanto forged by the FATHER of the<br/>
Saitou's sword's smith. Yes, there is an *indirect* Aizu connection.</div>
