<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687907109">Ok, I&#39;m now convinced the Goldfish is out to get some of us. First <br/>
Phil&#39;s mysterious message problem has taken her out of the loop <br/>
temporarily. Now I can&#39;t log on with ezboard!!! It&#39;s the fish I tell <br/>
you!!! THAT EVIL GOLDFISH IS OUT TO GET US!!! It&#39;s joined forces with <br/>
ezboard so Barb and I can&#39;t spread the word about it&#39;s plans to <br/>
spread confusion across the face of the globe!!!<br/>
<br/>
On a sidenote, I think it&#39;s also taken over ff.net. That&#39;s why <br/>
they&#39;re slowly becoming PITAs... <br/>

(On a serious note, does anyone know what exactly is going on with <br/>
the message board? Or am I the only one having trouble?)<br/>

 The historical Serizawa Kamo (not our beloved resident scholar) ate a<br/>
