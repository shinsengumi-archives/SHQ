<h3>Goldfish &lt;&lt;&lt; Seeking revenge?</h3>

On a side note...I think I know it's source of hatred for some of us.<br/>
 The historical Serizawa Kamo (not our beloved resident scholar) ate a<br/>
temple carp right?  In Buddhist (goes with Shinto shrines too) culture<br/>
any animals living on temple grounds should not be killed. It's<br/>
baaaaack....</div>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, Barb and I think this might be some sort of evil Ishin conspiracy. Did you notice in the OVA the scene where Katsura is feeding his fish? We think the Evil Goldfish sprang from his pond and is now after those of us who worship the memory of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
