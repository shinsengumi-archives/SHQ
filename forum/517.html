<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687907109">Ok, I&#39;m now convinced the Goldfish is out to get some of us. First <br/>
Phil&#39;s mysterious message problem has taken her out of the loop <br/>
temporarily. Now I can&#39;t log on with ezboard!!! It&#39;s the fish I tell <br/>
you!!! THAT EVIL GOLDFISH IS OUT TO GET US!!! It&#39;s joined forces with <br/>
ezboard so Barb and I can&#39;t spread the word about it&#39;s plans to <br/>
spread confusion across the face of the globe!!!<br/>
<br/>
On a sidenote, I think it&#39;s also taken over ff.net. That&#39;s why <br/>
they&#39;re slowly becoming PITAs... <br/>

(On a serious note, does anyone know what exactly is going on with <br/>
the message board? Or am I the only one having trouble?)<br/>

<h3>Goldfish &lt;&lt;&lt; Seeking revenge?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443219111">I noticed you were able to appease the carp.  I&#39;ve never had any<br/>
problems with logging in on ezboard.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note...I think I know it&#39;s source of hatred for some of us.<br/>
 The historical Serizawa Kamo (not our beloved resident scholar) ate a<br/>
temple carp right?  In Buddhist (goes with Shinto shrines too) culture<br/>
any animals living on temple grounds should not be killed. It&#39;s<br/>
baaaaack....</div>
