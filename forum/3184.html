<h3>A Footnote on the Shinsengumi Uniform + SHQ website tech report</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638756287">This may seem a bit off-topic but I would like to present this <br/>
tidbit to our community.<br/>
<br/>
It is believed that the Shinsengumi uniform of which we are all <br/>
familiar was inspired by those worn by the 47-ronin.  Basically the <br/>
jagged-edge design.  Although the Shinsengumi color scheme (and our <br/>
guys did change their uniform later) may be different the intent to <br/>
evoke the 47 ronin was the goal.<br/>
<br/>
Over time the black-white &quot;look&quot; was incorporated into Shinsengumi <br/>
media perhaps to add more variety.<br/>
<br/>
You see the uniform/design in many places.  Even in movements which <br/>
also claim to stand for &quot;loyalty&quot; for whatever reason:<br/>

<br/>
It is also interesting to note that many Bakumatsu groups like the <br/>
Shinsengumi, Byakkotai (Aizu) and even the Sekihoutai! have all at <br/>
one point or another been hijacked for right-wing, militarists <br/>
purposes because history belongs to &quot;everybody&quot; and they become fair <br/>
game for people with an agenda.<br/>
<br/>
These crazy fringe groups ofcourse do not represent all Japanese <br/>
people.  They are just being outspoken due to the increasingly <br/>
conservative political climate in Japan.<br/>

-------SHQ WEBSITE TECH REPORT--------<br/>
we are in the testing phase of a database search engine thingy<br/>
it is not just a one line [search] function...it will allow for <br/>
comparative and elimination type searches for example:<br/>
<br/>
[keyword 1]  (and/or/not) [keyword 2]<br/>
<br/>
for instance:<br/>
<br/>
Saitou Hajime (not) Itou Kashitarou<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
<br/>
Saitou Hajime (and) Itou Kashitarou<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately the search will not be &quot;yaoi&quot; dynamic such as Saitou <br/>
(x) Itou... (I&#39;m just kidding you sillies...but hey that does sound <br/>
like a good idea!)<br/>
<br/>
sorry for many pages/images being screwed up...I am trying to deal <br/>
with our programmer about this issue and warned her about the <br/>
repercussions of taking stuff offline and starting new <br/>
directories...certain areas of the site are totally non-functioning <br/>
and this is very regrettable</div>
