<h3>Message sent to Yahoo Customer Care</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102495045">I've just sent in a feedback form to Yahoo Customer Care about the <br/>
problems this group is having in delayed and multiple message <br/>
delivery to inboxes.  (And it's not just this group... I'm having <br/>
problems with all of them I receive mail from.)  I've also suggested <br/>
that they create a page where customers can access information about <br/>
problems the system is experiencing for updates, and if one already <br/>
exists, WHERE?, because I can't find one anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered the first message I sent about this problem never got to <br/>
support personnel because I sent it from the wrong text box.  Mea <br/>
culpa...<br/>
<br/>
Will let you know what they say...<br/>
