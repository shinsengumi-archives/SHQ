<h3>Which Chiba is which?</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-523856253">Sec, I do not see that file you said you uploaded on Chiba Dojo the <br/>
other day. I do know that Hillsborough also says that Ryoma studied <br/>
there under Chiba Sadakichi. He does not go beyond that to state what <br/>
this Chiba&#39;s relationship was to Shusaku.<br/>
<br/>
This is where I get confused. You say that Sadakichi was Shusaku&#39;s <br/>
brother? But I saw one website that listed him as his nephew. To make <br/>
matters even more confusing, Hillsborough states that Sadakichi was <br/>
the master of one of the &quot;three greatest fencing schools in Edo&quot; and <br/>
Ryoma was the &quot;head&quot; of this school. <br/>
<br/>
The problem is that if you look up these two, Shusaku&#39;s Genbukan Dojo <br/>
is listed as one of the &quot;three greatest&quot; in Edo. [The other two were <br/>
Shunzo Momonoi&#39;s Shigakukan Dojo (Kyoshin Meichi Ryu) and Saito <br/>
Yakuro&#39;s Renpeikan Dojo (Shindo Munen Ryu).] This might fit since <br/>
Hillsborough calls the other two dojo by the names of the <br/>
swordmasters rather than their official name. (He calls <br/>
them &quot;Momonoi&quot; and &quot;Saito&quot; schools.) But then Ryoma, to be &quot;head&quot; <br/>
of &quot;Chiba Dojo&quot; would have had to study under Shusaku rather than <br/>
Sadakichi?! <br/>
<br/>
Or were there, by Hillsborough&#39;s definition of the dojo names, two <br/>
Chiba dojo in Edo at that time and he has it wrong which of them was <br/>
considered to be &quot;one of the three greatest&quot;? And if so, then were <br/>
did he get that Ryoma was &quot;head&quot; of the more important one? Did <br/>
Sadakichi perhaps succeed Shusaku as master of the dojo?<br/>
<br/>
And what of the other two people he mentions as being the &quot;heads&quot; of <br/>
the other two famous dojo at the time? Takechi Hanpeita of Tosa, he <br/>
says, was &quot;head&quot; of &quot;Momonoi Dojo&quot; and Katsura Kogoro of Choshu <br/>
was &quot;head&quot; of &quot;Saito Dojo&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Another curious thing, I note that on Serizawa&#39;s site it is stated <br/>
that Yamanami studied at the Genbukan? So it becomes more likely then <br/>
that Ryoma and Yamanami would have known each other?! Even if it -was-<br/>
 another school, they would have met each others students I would <br/>
assume?<br/>

<h3>Forgot the P. S. ---Which Chiba is which?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363671134">Before everyone jumps all me for being stupid  I was sort of teasing <br/>
Miss B with the Itto Ryu /Itou reference. That is what Itou taught <br/>
though so I&#39;m guessing his father-in-law whom he succeeded as dojo head  <br/>
might have been a student of Chiba&#39;s?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353804498">Those info are what I can collect.<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma studied in Chaba Sadakichi&#39;s dojo (Called also Ko-chiba &quot;Little <br/>
Chiba&quot; dojo)in Okeya-mach, and Sadakichi is the younger brother of <br/>
Shusaku. And famous sword woman Sanako Chiba, who was the fiance of <br/>
Ryoma was the oldest daughter of Sadakichi.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hpmix.com/home/seiunzi/E3.htm">http://www.hpmix.com/home/seiunzi/E3.htm</a><br/>
Ryoma stayed in Chiba-dojo since 1856 to 58.<br/>
<br/>
As for Yamanami, the only source which mention about his relationship <br/>
with Chiba-dojo is Nagakura&#39;s memoir.( If my memory is correct)<br/>
And according to Nagakura, Yamanami would be in Chiba Shusaku&#39;s dojo <br/>
(Genbukan or Oochiba &quot;Big Chiba&quot; dojo) in Otamagaike.<br/>
<br/>
So, Ryoma and Yamanami are in different establishments. However there <br/>
would be some interchange between those dojo and it isn&#39;t completely <br/>
impossible even if they have ever met.<br/>
<br/>
Toudou Heisuke would be also in Chiba-dojo before joining to Ito-Dojo.<br/>
(It&#39;s not either certain about him) But those three are all Hokushin <br/>
Itto school and they might have some relationship between those <br/>
establishments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646211305">I heard that Watsuki based Kamiya Kaoru on Chiba Sanako. Is it possible that <br/>
Shinguuji Sakura of Sakura Taisen was also based on her? Sakura is from <br/>
Sendai, like Yamanami, and uses Hokushin Itto Ryu-- although her ultimate <br/>
attack is rather unbelievable-- &quot;Haja Kensei Ouka Hoshin&quot; (Cherry Blossom <br/>
Spirit Attack)...<br/>
