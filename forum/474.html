<h3>Burai Scanlations??</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655477353">This might be old news... I just found out about it... On April 4 a <br/>
manga scanlation group named Atlantis dream came out with a teaser <br/>
for Burai. I'm waiting to get this from a messageboard member <br/>
elsewhere, when I do I'll probably upload it. As Tiffany said before <br/>
there is a place where you can get translations but I chose not to <br/>
because I really don't like using paypal... Anyway I'm mightily <br/>
intrigued whether the group will still continue with the project as I <br/>
can only find the Burai project in google's cache and not in <br/>
the "updated" webpage...<br/>
<br/>
Here's the cache<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836794377">I finally got the teaser. I added it to the hosted files (see post: <br/>
manga/jdrama for download). Can't wait to get to work to download it. <br/>
I wonder what this teaser is about?<br/>
<br/>
Oh Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker and Bakumatsu manga is there too.<br/>
<br/>
Bye guys/gals.. ^_^ Yeah... I'm SUPPOSED to be sleeping.. Three more <br/>
hours and the luxury of sleep will be no more...  -_-<br/>
