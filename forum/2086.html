<h3>Fascinating info from Dr. Baelz</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394638600">Serizawa, I read that those chrysanthemum dolls were a specialty of <br/>
Hongo...I wasn&#39;t sure if those place names you mentioned are in <br/>
Hongo but they are VERY beautiful (^_^) *thank*you* for sharing<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
*following info from...<br/>
<br/>
Baelz, Erwin O. E. von, 1849-1913. Awakening Japan: the diary of a <br/>
German doctor: Erwin Baelz, edited by his son, Toku Baelz; <br/>
translated from the German by Eden and Cedar Paul. <br/>
<br/>
*I think people who study Meiji Era Japan would find this book worth <br/>
its weight in gold because you will be exposed to alot of &quot;insider&quot; <br/>
information not to mention Dr. Baelz&#39;s sincere attempts at <br/>
incorporating jiujitsu+kenjutsu into a physical education program <br/>
(summarized in this article here http://www.ao-denkou-<br/>
kai.org/new_page_6.htm)<br/>
<br/>
*he was not an adventurer, mercenary or missionary, but a <br/>
professional with alot of money and access to people in power...but <br/>
at the same time curious and humble in his observations of Meiji Era <br/>
Japan<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Fukuzawa and Yamakawa Kenjiroo see [post <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/2023]<br/>
were not the only ones who were fascinated with the mysteries of the <br/>
human mind<br/>
(written by someone who *OBSERVED* Dr. Baelz treating a <br/>
patient...deals with fox possession and religious ecsctasy...and the <br/>
commentary at the end is a bit odd since Dr. Baelz&#39;s treatments are <br/>
based on science)<br/>

(self-control)<br/>
Page 122<br/>
*Hana, Dr. Baelz&#39;s wife, lost her 12 year old adopted daughter<br/>
*Dr. Baelz frequently compares the Japanese to Roman stoicism<br/>
&quot;Sometimes Hana&#39;s self-control makes me uneasy.  Those who do not <br/>
know the depths of her feelings and the tenderness of her heart <br/>
might regard her as callous.  They would make a great mistake!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Page 118<br/>
*I certainly HOPE that a certain member of the TMPD called upon to <br/>
provide security of the Queen Mother, on more than one occasion <br/>
would not- be subject to this form of treatment (^_^)<br/>
&quot;An evening or two ago I was invited to a Japanese supper at the <br/>
palace of the Emperor&#39;s mother.  The court ladies pressed &quot;sake&quot; on <br/>
me, intending to amuse themselves by making me rather drunk.  I was <br/>
equal to the occasion, however, having a fairly strong head.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Dr. Baelz also treated, and saved the life of Emperor Meiji&#39;s real <br/>
birth mother, Nii no tsubone.<br/>

Page 83<br/>
Mori Arinori was the Minister of education I thinkMori made very <br/>
many important contributions during the era but many western <br/>
scholars will mention that Mori wanted English to be the official <br/>
language of Japan (it is sad that a person&#39;s most radical belief <br/>
ends up defining him historically)  <br/>
&quot;As soon as Mori entered the room, Nishino sprang on him and stabbed <br/>
him in the belly with a great kitchen-knife.  A plain clothes <br/>
policeman (the minister&#39;s constant attendant), armed with a Japanese <br/>
two-handed sword disguised as a swordstick, drew his weapon and <br/>
instantly clove Nishino&#39;s skull.  For some obscure reason it was <br/>
three hours before professional help could be secured for Mori, who <br/>
by that time was unconscious from loss of blood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*I have read 2 accounts of Mori Arinori murder and this is the <br/>
*first time that I have heard of Mori&#39;s bodyguard.interesting how <br/>
much time passed before he was given medical aid<br/>
<br/>
Treated Okuma, the minister of foreign affairs after assassination <br/>
attempt<br/>
Dr. Baelz was also the trusted physician of Yamagata Aritomo and <br/>
NUMEROUS other important figures (e.g. Viscount Enomoto, crown <br/>
prince = emperor Taisho) and often called upon to treat important <br/>
foreign dignitaries.essentially this German doctor knew many people <br/>
on a professional and personal basis.<br/>

PICS (there is a pic of his daughter Uta who died young...it was <br/>
extremely depressing to read his diary entries during that period)<br/>

*Dr. Baelz frequently mentions his BELOVED wife after the birth of <br/>
their son...I believe that entries regarding the courtship of Hana <br/>
were omitted by the folks who published the book because Dr. Baelz <br/>
had the tendency to write down just about -everything- in his <br/>
personal diary....he took a great interest in the status of <br/>
woman...and he was very much a down to earth normal young man<br/>

<br/>
AFAIK, the only &quot;Hongo&quot; that I have heard of nearby is<br/>
Hongo-machi, next to Aizu Wakamatsu. Though<br/>
Hongo-machi is better known for its pottery<br/>
(Hongo-yaki) than chrysanthemum dolls...<br/>
<br/>
Nihonmatsu is a bit far from Aizu, lying eastwards<br/>
from Aizu Wakamatsu.<br/>
