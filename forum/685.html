<h3>1to5.net pre-babelled+zipped</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-636120954">I finally finished babelfishing all 52 of 1to5.net&#39;s pages...all files<br/>
are in Microsoft word format and many files have retained the original<br/>
look of the page...as well as the pics...once you download the files<br/>
you may have to rename them.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that 3-hajime.com seems to have even more info however<br/>
the fish found it easier to translate 1to5.net.  In the future I hope<br/>
to babel all of 3-hajime&#39;s pages and store them offline for reference<br/>
as well.  And I don&#39;t need to warn you about how the fish warp&#39;s the<br/>
Japanese language---however many of 1to5.net&#39;s pages are easier to<br/>
understand than 3-hajime it depends on how the webmaster writes.<br/>
<br/>
My purpose for doing this is <br/>
1) 1to5.net is currently experiencing server downtime and many pages<br/>
will result in messages like &quot;document contains no data or server<br/>
cannot be found&quot;<br/>
2) It is very very painful to keep logging onto the net and<br/>
babelfishing the same pages for just a tiny bit of info<br/>
<br/>
I zipped all 52 pages of 1to5.net <br/>
the file size is 775 kb<br/>

[please] retain files for private use only as reference<br/>
I&#39;m only doing this to save us some time and headaches when using the<br/>
fish...and yes, I have also tried to contact the owner of 1to5.net to<br/>
inform her that I have been referencing her site on shinsengumimb.com<br/>
and here as well.</div>
