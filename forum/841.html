<h3>Sakura Wars/Shinsengumi connection</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530273587">In the "Sakura Wars" movie, in the part where the armored airship <br/>
Shogei Maru launches, there's a guy who turns to 2 minor characters <br/>
and says "So, what're we about to see here?". And these guys <br/>
respond, "Shogei Maru is about to launch! You had no idea?! Have you <br/>
been living in a cave?!" The thing is-- the guy who had no idea what <br/>
was going on looked a lot like Saigou Takamori! loL! And the creator <br/>
of Sakura Wars, Ouji Hiroi, has another series about the Shinsengumi--<br/>
 so perhaps this was intended!! Hah! Take THAT, Saigou..."Cave <br/>
dweller..."...incidentally, he committed seppuku in a cave...strange, <br/>
huh?<br/>
