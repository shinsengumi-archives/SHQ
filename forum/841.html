<h3>Sakura Wars/Shinsengumi connection</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530273587">In the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; movie, in the part where the armored airship <br/>
Shogei Maru launches, there&#39;s a guy who turns to 2 minor characters <br/>
and says &quot;So, what&#39;re we about to see here?&quot;. And these guys <br/>
respond, &quot;Shogei Maru is about to launch! You had no idea?! Have you <br/>
been living in a cave?!&quot; The thing is-- the guy who had no idea what <br/>
was going on looked a lot like Saigou Takamori! loL! And the creator <br/>
of Sakura Wars, Ouji Hiroi, has another series about the Shinsengumi--<br/>
 so perhaps this was intended!! Hah! Take THAT, Saigou...&quot;Cave <br/>
dweller...&quot;...incidentally, he committed seppuku in a cave...strange, <br/>
huh?<br/>
