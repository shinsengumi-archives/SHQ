file name: Seinan+TMPD+FrenchPolice <br/>
there are 4 files (all pdf with citations) from 4 different books<br/>
once you open the folder you will see<br/>
All 4 files=9.81 mb (but worth it trust me)<br/>
<br/>
Frpolice.pdf=photos of what Toshiyoshi Kawaji saw in France during <br/>
his brief but significant visit (the gov. had already decided to <br/>
adopt the French model for the police...the visit was merely a <br/>
formality)<br/>
<br/>
seinancollection1.pdf=drawings and photos (one photo seems to be <br/>
taken right after the war...excellent stuff here<br/>
<br/>
seinancollection2.pdf=photo of Toshiyoshi Kawaji we&#39;ve never seen <br/>
before and a photo of Imperial Army camp (I think)<br/>
<br/>
seinancollection3.pdf=photos of all the important people and I <br/>
inserted a yellow note under a photo of a man named TANI...who <br/>
played a critical role at the seige of Kumamoto castle/garrison</div>
