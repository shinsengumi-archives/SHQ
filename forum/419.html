<h3>Bakumatsu zankoku monogatari</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-241118267">aka "Cruel/Brutal Story at the End of the Tokugawa Shogunate," 1964.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, my brain is TOTALLY fried --- I've just finished watching this <br/>
film and I am **completely** blown away by it.  Whatever you have to <br/>
do to see it, just do it!<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful, gritty look at the internal world of the Shinsengumi from <br/>
just after the Ikedaya Affair to just past the death of Yamanami.  <br/>
Fundoshi theft, homoerotic playfulness, guy talk about women & <br/>
Shimabara (including Kondou's 4 babes), a sweet love story, patrol <br/>
changes, after-hours in the barracks, execution of law breakers, a <br/>
samurai bacchanal, the clash of strong personalities, testing new <br/>
recruits, man's inhumanity to man, history, regrets, blood & gore, <br/>
Saitou --- it's got a little of everything.  The ending is just too <br/>
amazing to even consider hinting at.<br/>
<br/>
The flashback of Serizawa's assassination is pure poetry and exactly <br/>
as I read about it.  I swear, the words came right to life before my <br/>
eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Every Shinsengumi fan should have a copy of it!!!<br/>
<br/>
One thing did hit me over the head like a brick, though --- when the <br/>
captains are announcing themselves in one scene, when it comes to the <br/>
captain of the 9th squad, the man is Abe Juro, not Suzuki.  Anyone <br/>
know why this would be?  I thought Abe Juro was a corporal (source: <br/>
Serizawa Kamo's Biography --- see links on the shinsengumimb main <br/>
page).<br/>
