<div id="ygrps-yiv-147820983">*sighs* Well, I called the few bookstore around my area to see if they had a copy of 47 Ronin and I was told once again that the publisher has pushed the release date of the reprints back once more... this time, indefinetly.   I've looked through Amizon.com and wasn't able to find one either.... well, actually, I did find one, but it was marked something along the lines of "ok condition", which lead me to believe that its probably not in that good of a condition.<br/>
 <br/>
So now I turn to the good people of this mail list ^___________^<br/>
The proposal is this: if your willing to let me borrow the book, I'm willing to make a comission for you (however, I will not be able to start until early June on it).<br/>
 <br/>
Well then, thanks for your time. ^_____________^<br/>

Bushido Of The 47 Samurai,<br/>
by Ichiyusai Kuniyoshi<br/>
Translation by:<br/>
Toshishiro Obata and Panchita Hawley<br/>
260 pages, 8.5 x 11 softcover.<br/>
ISBN: 0-910704-87-2<br/>
<br/>
I'd try emailing the seller and asking for specifics about the<br/>
conditions of the book (because it may end up being a good deal!).  I<br/>
do have access to several Chushingura related books (art included). <br/>
If you would like a list of those books to see if a library near you<br/>
has them you can email me off list secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com</div>
