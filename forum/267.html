<h3>Anime &quot;Sword of 634&quot;---Saito Appearance?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118706394">There was a post on www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/patio/patio.cgi<br/>
The title of the post is "Anecdote of Late Year?"<br/>
<br/>
This is the babelfish translation...telling of an old Saito Hajime<br/>
appearing in an anime...(Usual warning about babelfish)<br/>
<br/>
"It meaning that name of Saito one appears in the kendo cartoon,<br/>
"sword of 634", it does.<br/>
As a story of former times, the alone boy being Kawahara, when you<br/>
practice kendo, the old person coming, you say that try doing the<br/>
bamboo sword.<br/>
It was less crowded in the string and hung the can, practiced<br/>
piercing, but aiming for that can, the old person extended the bamboo<br/>
sword.<br/>
But, the can does not move jerkily.<br/>
When the boy tries seeing, you say that the hole opened in the can.<br/>
You say that with the bamboo sword, the can was carried out.<br/>
That was Saito one of late year.<br/>
<br/>
With it meaning that the anecdote which is said is riding, it does,<br/>
but is this how probably what?<br/>
The う - the む, you question, it becomes.<br/>
Penetrating the being less crowded can which was hung to the string<br/>
with the bamboo sword how, being possible?<br/>
As an anecdote of Saito one, such a story it has been effective?"<br/>
<br/>
There was a reply to the post along the lines that it is uncertain<br/>
whether or not this story was associated with historical S.H.  (The<br/>
important thing to me is that he is in yet -another- anime LOL).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885370165">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the name of the series is "Musashi no Ken"<br/>
(Sword of Musashi). It started out as a manga, and the<br/>
first story arc was made into an anime. It follows a <br/>
boy named Musashi (written with the kanji for 3, 6,<br/>
and 4) from his birth until young adulthood, as he<br/>
learns kendo and tries to become the top kendo<br/>
practitioner in Japan. <br/>
<br/>
There is one flashback scene (to the Showa era) in<br/>
which a swordsman named Yamamoto Chujiro is practicing<br/>
tsuki (thrust) on an empty can hung by a string. One<br/>
day, an old man tries to do it. The can doesn't even<br/>
move, so Yamamoto thinks he missed. But when Yamamoto<br/>
takes a second look at the can...he sees that the old<br/>
man had pierced a hole in the can without even moving<br/>
it. It turns out that the old man was none other than<br/>
Saitou Hajime himself. :)<br/>
<br/>
As for whether this has anything to do with the real<br/>
historical Saitou, I doubt it, but I was amused to<br/>
find yet another reference to him in a manga or anime<br/>
I've read/seen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993984716">The author of the manga "MUSASHI NO KEN", Motoka Murakami also wrote a<br/>
manga called "RON" you can view scans and translations<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/studentkendo/ron.htm">http://www.geocities.com/studentkendo/ron.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Nobuhiro Watsuki seems to be similar to Motoka Murakami, both manga<br/>
artists/writers skillfully incorporate historical figures into their<br/>
fictional works...if you read the scans above you'll find out that the<br/>
hero is defeated by a man, Takaharu Naito (he looks almost exactly the<br/>
way he was portrayed in the manga as he does in real life), who was<br/>
formerly a kendo instructor in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214586204">Definitely agree with you. I will spend money at least to just get <br/>
that DVD. Fortunately though... I have the entire series when it <br/>
first came out as fansubs. A friend of mine, who proudly calls <br/>
himself an Otaku gave me not only his streamload collection but his <br/>
hard disks. I'm certain I have this... I will let you guys know how <br/>
it is! AHHHHH!!!!!!<br/>

I have scanned the pages from the manga and uploaded Tatsuko's<br/>

I wonder, since they drew him as a shadow/silhouette if they actually<br/>
showed him in the episode of the anime.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, they did. It starts by showing other Shinsengumi<br/>
fighting (mostly in silhouette, but their trademark<br/>
blue-and-white uniform can be clearly seen). Then it<br/>
shows the mostly the same scenes from the manga, but<br/>
in color and motion of course. :) Both Saito and<br/>
Chujiro are completely drawn in, so you can see their<br/>
faces. I wish I had the equipment to make a<br/>
screenshot, but I do not. :/<br/>
