about how Nagakura Shinpachi watched foreign silent films (at this <br/>
point I think only the USA+W.Europe and I think Russia?) made them.  <br/>
Nagakura died in 1915, same year as Fujita Goro.  Wouldn't it be <br/>
funny if these two senior citizens went to the movies together and <br/>
watched let's say the Three Musketeers...I'm sure they would take <br/>
great interest in the fencing.  Momoiro-usagi's post brought a smile <br/>
to my face as I imagine his children and grand-children thinking "uh <br/>
oh if Grandpa Nagakura get's bored he's going to start talking about <br/>
his days in the Shinsengumi for the 1,043rd time let's send him to <br/>
the movies" LOL!</div>

reply--amazing ain't it? :-D I think the guys who survived into the <br/>
early 20th century would just as speechless at seeing so many "new"  and <br/>
to them unusual things like phones, electric lights, movies, early <br/>
cars.  I have this image of one of both of them being confronted with a <br/>
car for the first time and  instinctively reaching for a  sword to fend <br/>
off the noisy beast.<br/>
