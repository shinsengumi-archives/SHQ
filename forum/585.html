of maintenance...<br/>

***many of the Japanese boards are discussing newspaper articles, and<br/>
novels printed in newspapers.  The mixture of new fiction and articles<br/>
examining the group from different angles have caused Shinsengumi<br/>
enthusiasts to mistaken the novels as revealing new info (posts go<br/>
something like this "I read xxxx in the newspaper novel is this true?<br/>
 I never heard of this before".<br/>
<br/>
***there was an interesting post that mentions Japanese politicians<br/>
discussing the Shinsengumi on the floor of the Diet or something like that<br/>
<br/>
***there is a book out which babelfish translates as "Shinsengumi<br/>
Revelations" <br/>
<br/>
***the ladies at 3-hajime.com also write "amateur novels"=fanfiction:)<br/>
the most interesting post at 3-hajime.com is about how this one person<br/>
loves Yamaguchi Jiro/u so I replied trying to ask if she felt that<br/>
Yamaguchi Jiro/u was ~different~ from Saitou or if Yamaguchi Jiro/u<br/>
was featured in some manga or anime.  Can it be that there is an<br/>
entire set of different info (fiction/historical) on Yamaguchi Jiro<br/>
for this person to be attracted to him, Yamaguchi J., rather than his<br/>
time in the Shinsengumi?  In any case I found it to be fascinating how<br/>
the appeal of historical Saitou Hajime comes from the way he<br/>
lives...that is his 3 "bodies" as babelfish put it (I think they are<br/>
only counting S.H, Y.J., and F.G) and leaving out Denpachi Ichinohe.<br/>
<br/>
Looks interesting...I haven't had time to babelfish it though<br/>
