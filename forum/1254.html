<h3>Sagara site</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625159820">So, thanks to M regaling a few of us in the chat room last night with a translation of a Japanese site, there is finally information up on my Sagara site.  Unfortunately, I did not get around to Miki, but I did get something up for Shinohara Tainoshin. (Including a cool pic, which I assume is him with a daughter and grandchild... more Shinsengumi grandfathers. MissB, do you find it suspicious that he worked in the Ministry of Justice after the war?  And am I reading it right that he also took a shot at Kondou at some point?) <br/>
 <br/>
M's translation also revealed another miburo connected to Sagara & the Sekihoutai, though I do not think we learned if he actually joined... someone named Moriyama.  Ring any bells with anyone?  (SK?)  He was part of talks that took place two days before the Sekihoutai was created, including two of the court nobles associated with the Sekhoutai (Ayanokouji and Shigenoi) and Satsumi roushi.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, if you are ever curious about Sagara, the Sekihoutai, or the wolves associated with them, check it out.  I announced it some time ago over on the message board, but did not want to promote it here until there was *something* on it.  :-D  Comments and corrections/additions are always warmly received... either here or in the guestbook on the site.  It is thanks to this wonderful group that I have gotten so much information recently.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, actually I find it VERY suspicious. I'm not sure right off if he was the one or not. I'll have to look back through the info I have and see if any of it states who actually took the shot at Kondo. It probably was him though. I don't know if I would have trusted Miki with a gun... Drink and firearms just don't mix! LOL! <br/>
