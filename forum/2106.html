<h3>Another &quot;Book of Five Rings&quot; Translation...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141284421">Yeah, I know there are a million of them. Most focus on how it can be <br/>
transferred to modern-day life. Each has it's own interpretation of <br/>
what Miyamoto Musashi was trying to say. But perhaps this one is a <br/>
bit different...<br/>
<br/>
It's the interpretation of Stephen F. Kaufman, Hanshi 10th Dan. On <br/>
the back it makes the claim that it is specifically for the marital <br/>
artist, the way it was orginally intended. As Kaufman points <br/>
out "There is a significant difference between not getting a deal <br/>
signed and having your head cut off. Business is mental. War is <br/>
mental -and- physical."<br/>
<br/>
Anyone on the list who studies the marital arts have an opinion about <br/>
this particular book? Anyone know a better interpretation? Let us <br/>
know. With so many different interpretations of Mushashi's work on <br/>
the market, it's hard for those of us with no martial arts experience <br/>
or translation skills to know what to trust and what to stay away <br/>
from.<br/>

Can you imagine the MILLIONS of copies which would be sold?  A book <br/>
on "marital artists"....or how about "The Training of the Marital <br/>
Artist"  (^_^)<br/>
I have the Victor Harris book ISBN 0879510188 it is pretty good I <br/>
think<br/>
<br/>
but what is needed is a book with a "straight" translation with tons <br/>
of footnotes and 1 chapter by a martial artist 1 chapter by a modern <br/>
military man and 1 chapter by a historian and 1 chapter by a <br/>
religious studies scholar<br/>
<br/>
although one of Musashi's most interesting characteristics is that he <br/>
claimed no affiliation with any established religion I found many <br/>
passages with a Buddhist influence...this is an example of how the <br/>
foreign and native belief systems within Japan are inseperable from <br/>
its people...religion and culture goes hand in hand in many countries <br/>
of Asia<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840994536">Kaufman's translation of the GoRin No Sho is not one to be taken <br/>
seriously.  The book is not a translation of Musashi's treatise so <br/>
much as Kaufman's interpretation of various translations of the <br/>
book.  I have no idea what his credentials are, but I'm pretty <br/>
certain they don't include Niten Ichi Ryu.  Over at Amazon.com <br/>
there's a pretty good review of the book that echos basically <br/>
everything I'd been told about it.  There is a man called Hyakutake <br/>
Colin who belongs to one of the surviving branches of that art and <br/>
you can read a bit more about it www.hyoho.com.  I'm afraid exactly <br/>
which translation he recommends escapes me at the moment.<br/>
It's been a while since I read the GoRin No Sho, I'm more of a fan <br/>
of Yagyu Munenori's Heiho Kadensho.  Though I belong to Yagyu <br/>
Shinkage Ryu so I'm admittedly biased.</div>
