<br/>
I will be talking about this book at the thread above<br/>
Huffman, James L. "A Yankee in Meiji Japan"<br/>
New York: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2003.<br/>
isbn 0742526216<br/>
<br/>
Edward House, journalist, was connected to THE TOKIO TIMES English<br/>
language paper....he was also REAL CLOSE buddies with MARK TWAIN, WALT<br/>
WHITMAN and ARTEMUS WARD.  He also knew Ulysses S. Grant (who visited<br/>
Japan), John Russell Young, Edmund Clarence Stedman, Okuma Shigenobu<br/>
and Inoue Kaoru.<br/>
<br/>
He was sooo close to Mark Twain that he brought his lady friend Aoki<br/>
Koto on a visit to the States.  The couple stayed with the Twains in<br/>
Hartford.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason why I'm so enthusiastic about English language papers,<br/>
preferably printed in Japan, which covered either Boshin or Seinan War<br/>
is because we can immediately see what kind of news the foriegners got<br/>
and their opinions on the situation---and it's in ENGLISH (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I should be getting a compilation of the TOKIO TIMES via inter-library<br/>
loan.  Tokio Times was printed between 1877-1880.  even though it<br/>
doesn't cover the Boshin War directly...there should be references to it.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has info on English language papers printed in Japan please<br/>
let me know.  I had NO luck finding the paper printed in Yokohoma.<br/>
<br/>
I have now read in 3 different places that during the early to late<br/>
Meiji era people actually COLLECTED newspaper clippings.  Taka,<br/>
Princess Chichibu's nanny collected related articles concerning the<br/>
wedding but that made perfect sense.  People preferred to collect the<br/>
newspapers printed in "color" which illustrates scenes from the Seinan<br/>
War (usually exaggerated romantic accounts).  The prints I shared with<br/>
here in the form of zip files a while back had colorful paintings<br/>
depicting the Seinan War---I presume that those same paintings/prints<br/>
were the ones the newspapers printed.</div>

<br/>
please cut and paste the new link above for the Edward House <br/>
thread...I discuss "TOMMY" it seems that he was popular with the <br/>
ladies because he was very curious about their hoop dresses...VERY <br/>
curious<br/>
<br/>
sadly the paper did not mention which domains the Japanese <br/>
ambassadors represented</div>
