<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019087018">I'm going to give a VERY loose translation. The letter is in classical<br/>
Japanese, which makes my head hurt even more than Babelfish.<br/>

(Dated Keio 1 (1865), August 4)<br/>
<br/>
    The summer heat is still bothering everyone. People are sitting<br/>
around doing nothing, but taxes keep coming in-- you know how that can be.<br/>
     Kyoto is safe for now, but stay alert, because you never<br/>
know...we won't spare anyone who causes problems.<br/>
      Please send my regards to everyone, starting with Sonba-sama<br/>
("valuable mother"-- his or Satou's?). I hope that all is well and<br/>
that things are peaceful. Please also convey my special regards to Mr.<br/>
Ishida Hijikata (Hijikata Toshizou's father-- hence, the "Ishida"<br/>
powder, I suppose).<br/>
<br/>
      This ends my message.<br/>
