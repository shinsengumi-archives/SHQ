<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not know so in detail about this episode. <br/>
I know this episode in fragments. <br/>
It is these things that I know. <br/>
<br/>
Uchiyama Hikojirou was actually assassinated. <br/>
About a criminal, although there are various opinions, it is <br/>
correctly unknown. <br/>
Since Uchiyama performed the bribe or operated the market price of <br/>
rice, he was disliked by people of a town as a bad government <br/>
official. <br/>
(Although I do not know whether this is a true talk, it is a fact <br/>
that he was considered to be a bad government official by people. <br/>
After he was assassinated, people did not actually sympathize with <br/>
him.)<br/>
It is Nishimura Kanefumi's "Shinsengumi-shimatsuki", and Nagakura <br/>
Shinpachi's "Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki" which are being written that <br/>
Shinsengumi was criminal. <br/>
However, these two works are not exact as data. <br/>
The author of "Shinsengumi-shimatsuki" had prejudice in Shinsengumi <br/>
very much.<br/>
The journalist of an Otaru newspaper wrote "Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki" <br/>
based on Nagakura's discourse. <br/>
As for them, both have inconsistency in the contents of description.<br/>
(Incidentally, this episode does not appear <br/>
in "Roushibunkyuhoukokukiji" with more high data value with <br/>
Nagakura's work.) <br/>
There are researchers who acknowledge a Shinsengumi criminal theory. <br/>
And there are researchers who deny it. <br/>
<br/>
Since this book released recently is written in detail about this <br/>
incident, it explains referring to this. <br/>
<br/>
http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4087747131/qid%<br/>
3D1094474771/249-9385455-7181936<br/>
<br/>
"Shinsengumi no enkei"  Noguchi Takehiko work<br/>
Incidentally this book has denied the Shinsengumi criminal theory. <br/>
<br/>
It is "Shinsengumi-shimatsuki" in Meiji 22 (A.D.1889) that the <br/>
Shinsengumi criminal theory was announced at the very beginning. <br/>
"Shinsengumi-shimatsuki" is writing that Uchiyama blamed Kondou with <br/>
the overbearing attitude, when Kondou reported sumo wrestling <br/>
wrestler's incident. <br/>
(Uchiyama disliked Shinsengumi which borrows money from the <br/>
merchants of Osaka forcibly.) <br/>
Kondou who received the very severe insult got angry, and made <br/>
subordinates investigate Uchiyama's thing. <br/>
When it turned out that he is a bad government official, Kondo <br/>
planned his assassination.<br/>
Four persons, Okita, Nagakura, Harada, and Inoue, are criminals who <br/>
performed it. <br/>
This book serves as the only basis of a Shinsengumi criminal theory. <br/>
However, it is very dangerous to trust this. <br/>
Although I had written to the board before, Nishimura Kanefumi, the <br/>
author of this book, was working for Nishi-Honoganji. <br/>
Although Nishi-Honoganji provided Shinsengumi with the place, it was <br/>
the ally of Chosyu in fact. <br/>
Nishimura had a severe prejudice to Shinsengumi. <br/>
After Okita killed Uchiyama, Uchiyama's head was cut and it was <br/>
thrust into the bamboo...."Shinsengumi-shimatsuki" is written such. <br/>
However, there is no such fact. <br/>
Nishimura wrote that Kondou and Hijikata were illiterate barbarians. <br/>
It is dangerous to trust it, although not all of the contents of <br/>
this book are a lie. <br/>
Incidentally, it has become clear that the place where Kondou <br/>
reported sumo wrestling wrestlers' incident was Higashimachi-<br/>
Bugyousyo (East town-Bugyousyo).<br/>
Uchiyama was the government official of Nishimachi-Bugyousyo (West <br/>
town-Bugyousyo).<br/>
Kondou and Uchiyama cannot confront in this incident. <br/>
 <br/>
Although "Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki" is called Nagakura Shinpachi's <br/>
work, the fact is the book edited based on the report serialized by <br/>
the Otaru newspaper. <br/>
Many portions considered to be the Otaru newspaper reporter's <br/>
fiction exist. <br/>
This book is writing that Uchiyama operated the market price of rice <br/>
in cooperation with Chosyu.<br/>
Uchiyama is the government official of the pure government. <br/>
He does not need to conspire with Chosyu.  <br/>
This book makes criminals Kondo, Hijikata, Okita, Nagakura, Harada, <br/>
Inoue, and Shimada. <br/>
This book is writing that Kondo cut Uchiyama first. <br/>
However, this book has the too careless facts. <br/>
It was that Uchiyama was assassinated on May 20 Genji 1 (A.D.1864). <br/>
However, this book is writing that incident, after Ito Kashitarou <br/>
was assassinated (A.D.1867).<br/>
<br/>
About this mistake, Kikuchi Akira of a researcher is writing the <br/>
interesting opinion. <br/>
As for his opinion, although Nagakura talked about another incident <br/>
which arose around 1867, the newspaper reporter has mistaken with <br/>
Uchiyama's assassination talk.<br/>
Although the fact is not known, this book (Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki) <br/>
cannot be used as data of the Uchiyama assassination. <br/>
 <br/>
Or it is written in the diary of Shimada Kai that the injustice of <br/>
the government official of Osaka was investigated. <br/>
The researchers of Shinsengumi criminal theory say that this is <br/>
about Uchiyama. <br/>
(Mr. Noguchi is writing that 60 government officials were in Osaka <br/>
Bugyousyo at the time.<br/>
I think that it is difficult to affirm that it is Uchiyama's thing. <br/>
And isn't it weak as a reason for assassinating Uchiyama?) <br/>
<br/>
As for Nagakura Shinpachi's work"Roushibunkyuhoukokukiji", the talk <br/>
of the Uchiyama assassination is not written. <br/>
Nagakura wrote this book in early stages of Meiji Era. <br/>
Naturally, data value is high. <br/>
However, this book was written in order to restore the honor of <br/>
Shinsengumi. <br/>
Therefore, the inconvenient fact of Shinsengumi may not be written. <br/>
(The researchers of Shinsengumi criminal theory emphasize it. <br/>
In fact, this book is not written at all about the death of <br/>
Yamanami.) <br/>
<br/>
Uchiyama's assassination was on May 20, A.D. 1864. <br/>
There is a letter which Kondou addressed to the acquaintance on the <br/>
same day.<br/>
In the letter, he is sad about the situation of Shinsengumi. <br/>
At the time, Shinsengumi could not play an active part and Kondou <br/>
considered even the dismissal.<br/>
The morale of Shinsengumi was falling very much.<br/>
Mr. Noguchi has regarded the possibility of an upper government <br/>
official's assassination plan as questionable in such a situation. <br/>
It is not a best policy that they go to Osaka and cause trouble at <br/>
the time of such a critical situation. <br/>
<br/>
(Incidentally, this letter has reported that homosexuality is in <br/>
prevalence within Shinsengumi.)^^;;; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SPOILER?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for the episode of the Uchiyama assassination, being adopted in a <br/>
drama is very uncommon.<br/>
Although some reasons are considered, I think that it is the big <br/>
cause that is not suitable in the tale which made Shinsengumi the <br/>
hero. <br/>
Although Uchiyama is a bad man, the story that the powerless old man <br/>
was killed by young men is unjustifiable. <br/>
The fiction differs from the historical fact.<br/>
There is much episode which is not adopted as a drama or a novel <br/>
with the fact of being written to the research document.<br/>
Many those episode is used for a Taiga drama. <br/>
<br/>
In the drama, I looked at Tonouchi Yoshio for the first time. <br/>
(He is the member of Roushigumi at the time of the beginning which <br/>
remained in Kyoto together with Kondou and others.<br/>
In the Taiga drama, he was considered to be a betrayer and was <br/>
assassinated by Serizawa.) <br/>
Although his name is often seen with a research document, it is <br/>
seldom seen in the fiction world. <br/>
In fact, almost all fictions write that only Serizawa group and <br/>
Kondou group remained to Kyoto. <br/>
Tonouchi group does not exist from the beginning in many cases. <br/>
They destroyed completely by conspiracy of Serizawa group and Kondou <br/>
group. <br/>
Tonouchi may have been assassinated by Kondou in fact.<br/>
There is a letter by which Kondou boasted of Tonouchi assassination.<br/>
Tonouchi is not a bad man and this incident arose in the result of a <br/>
struggle for power. <br/>
Do you think that you will adopt such episode supposing you write <br/>
the novel which made Shinsengumi the hero? <br/>
(I think that it is the fun of this Taiga drama to have adopted it <br/>
well.) <br/>

  (Incidentally, this letter has reported that homosexuality is in <br/>
  prevalence within Shinsengumi.)^^;;; <br/>

  As for the episode of the Uchiyama assassination, being adopted in a <br/>
  drama is very uncommon.<br/>
  Although some reasons are considered, I think that it is the big <br/>
  cause that is not suitable in the tale which made Shinsengumi the <br/>
  hero. <br/>
  Although Uchiyama is a bad man, the story that the powerless old man <br/>
  was killed by young men is unjustifiable. <br/>
  The fiction differs from the historical fact.<br/>
  There is much episode which is not adopted as a drama or a novel <br/>
  with the fact of being written to the research document.<br/>
  Many those episode is used for a Taiga drama. <br/>
<br/>
  In the drama, I looked at Tonouchi Yoshio for the first time. <br/>
  (He is the member of Roushigumi at the time of the beginning which <br/>
  remained in Kyoto together with Kondou and others.<br/>
  In the Taiga drama, he was considered to be a betrayer and was <br/>
  assassinated by Serizawa.) <br/>
  Although his name is often seen with a research document, it is <br/>
  seldom seen in the fiction world. <br/>
  In fact, almost all fictions write that only Serizawa group and <br/>
  Kondou group remained to Kyoto. <br/>
  Tonouchi group does not exist from the beginning in many cases. <br/>
  They destroyed completely by conspiracy of Serizawa group and Kondou <br/>
  group. <br/>
  Tonouchi may have been assassinated by Kondou in fact.<br/>
  There is a letter by which Kondou boasted of Tonouchi assassination.<br/>
  Tonouchi is not a bad man and this incident arose in the result of a <br/>
  struggle for power. <br/>
  Do you think that you will adopt such episode supposing you write <br/>
  the novel which made Shinsengumi the hero? <br/>
  (I think that it is the fun of this Taiga drama to have adopted it <br/>
  well.) <br/>
