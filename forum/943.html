The library book was informative however the index was<br/>
ridiculous...you look up guns, firearms, rifles, import/export and you<br/>
get nothing...I accidently stumbled upon slightly more specific info<br/>
about the Minie and  Spencer rifles.  I guess whoever did the index<br/>
just assumed readers would know the make/model/brand of rifles right<br/>
off the top of their heads or something because &quot;Minie&quot; and &quot;spencer&quot;<br/>
are listed.<br/>
<br/>
I have screencaps for <br/>
Shinsengumi Shimatsuki aka Shinsengumi Chronicles or I want to Die a<br/>
Samurai (starring Raizo Ichikawa)<br/>
please feel free to use it for any projects such as write ups or<br/>
summaries, or webpages.<br/>

*I kept noticing the many times Kondo&#39;s farmer background was used<br/>
against him...and many caps will deal with the theme of social class<br/>
<br/>
*I know many of you who have seen this film were saddened by the fact<br/>
Saitou is not portrayed....if you view my caps and [then] go back and<br/>
watch the film you may find him...he is in it just look at the<br/>
images...he is the kenjutsu teacher and he appears in 2 scenes...stop<br/>
rolling your eyes I make a very strong case for my theory<br/>
<br/>
*I couldn&#39;t help but add some inane comments here and there in blue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, sorry I didn&#39;t look this up sooner. I have a book on weapons put out by &quot;The Diagram Group&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Minie&quot; they refer to is not an actual rifle, but a generic term for muzzle-loaders which fired an improved type of bullet, designed in the 1850s by a French army officer named Claude-Etienne Minie. They were used a lot during the Crimean and American Civil Wars. The advantage was that the bullet could be easily shot from a barrel &quot;dirty from much firing&quot;. The guns which used them were far more accurate and had a greater range than earlier muzzle-loaders and many older guns were altered to use the new bullets.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Spencer&quot; is of course the the creation of an American named Christopher M. Spencer. It was a successful repeater that was first patented in 1860. There was a Spencer Carbine made in 1865 which held seven shots, caliber .56&quot;-50 rimfire, and was used during the Civil War. I&#39;m no gun expert, but I doubt it changed much in design during the time period in question. <br/>
