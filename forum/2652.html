<h3>Good Shinsengumi Link + Primarily a Tokio update</h3>

there is an animation at this website which shows Shinsengumi<br/>
relics---really neat!<br/>

[Tokio update]<br/>
We still don't have her start or end dates for the school but we have<br/>
a very solid chronology and details from foreigners who worked there<br/>
or were close friends to staff members. Again, I can only read English<br/>
so this research was difficult but rewarding...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
please do an "edit find" in the body of the page (not the top<br/>
navigation bar) for all references to "Emma" and the new information<br/>
will appear in the chronology for the years 1887-9 {look for the info<br/>
on a green background}.  Her letters contain a description of her<br/>
workplace---which was Tokio's world.  So if Tokio worked at the school<br/>
during those years or even AFTERWARDS--she had in fact several foreign<br/>
co-workers.<br/>
<br/>
Did this American interact with other Japanese? Yes, the handful of<br/>
Japanese women who could speak English and missionaries such as Tsuda<br/>
Ume.  Often her Japanese friends would visit her at her home which was<br/>
right on campus.  <br/>
<br/>
What can we learn from Emma's words or other description available<br/>
throught out the page (yes I know about the typos and how huge the<br/>
page has become--I didn't expect all this info ^_^)...you can learn<br/>
alot like:<br/>
<br/>
the work schedule---Emma was up and writing letters at 6:30 am<br/>
I know that Tokio's cousin, the director Takamine Hideo, worked from<br/>
6am-8pm where does that leave our dorm mother?  Well she had to be<br/>
sure her young students were out of bed and off to class---so Tokio<br/>
was BUSY!  (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
You can truly imagine the atmosphere of the school--note the beautiful<br/>
surroundings, you can see Mt. Fuji from the campus, the trees near the<br/>
Confucian temple grounds.  The school however did move in the late<br/>
1890s under the director's last term to even more spacious<br/>
surroundings to accomodate the increase in students.<br/>
<br/>
What do we want?  We want Emma to tell us about the dorm mothers<br/>
ofcourse.  I spent some time going over the microfilm (which focused<br/>
on her son's bio) and illegible handwriting (some brave researcher did<br/>
type a few of her letters) and could not find this detail.  What we do<br/>
have reveals a woman who loves detail and LOVED to talk about her job.<br/>
<br/>
[However] more biographical can be found in papers not microfilmed and<br/>
therefore not available --- you have to go to Cornell's special<br/>
collections and look for a box of notes by Mr. Herbert Croly who did<br/>
research Emma's time in Japan!  Croly must have interviewed Emma's<br/>
friends as well because he had details not mentioned in the letters I<br/>
read.  Emma's friends were teachers so she listed textbooks she used<br/>
at Tokio's school, and refers to the director by his first name<br/>
"Hideyoshi" (with a 'y') throughout.  Who know maybe Takamine Hideo<br/>
introduced his cousin Tokio to this American woman.  Ofcourse from<br/>
reading the Meiji era novel about a fictional teacher Botchan by<br/>
Natsume Soseki formal introductions were unavoidable....</div>
