<h3>Your chance to tattoo someone...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145773403">Hey, everyone!<br/>
 <br/>
Someone has posted a request over on the livejournal for some advice & feedback about a shinsengumi-themed tattoo.  They already have the makoto flag tattoo-ed on a shoulder and looking for some kind of phrase (and the kanji, I suspect) to go with a fan design they&#39;re having done next.  Now&#39;s your chance to suggest those tattoo-ed phrases you&#39;ve always wanted yourself and never had the guts to do.  :-D<br/>

 <br/>
Can some of you far more knowledgeable than me help them out with some suggestions?  I&#39;d love to show them how crazy we are.   If you don&#39;t have a livejournal account (well, why not?) and want to answer their questions and/or contribute suggestions, I&#39;m willing to pass it on.<br/>
