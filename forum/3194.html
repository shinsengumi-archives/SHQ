<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-485896868">I think that it is impossible to truly determine if people in Kyoto <br/>
were Pro - [insert faction] and the reason is that there was <br/>
no "polling" done in that era.  Even in our modern era polling is <br/>
unreliable and manipulated to get people on a "bandwagon".<br/>
<br/>
For instance, Fukuchi Genichiro was able to print some of his <br/>
arguably pro-bakufu opinions (Fukuchi later was a Meiji newspaper <br/>
editor and became pro-Meiji government due to the desire to seek <br/>
stability in Japan).  We do not know if his pro-bakufu stance during <br/>
the Bakumatsu years were popular or not.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is the people in Kyoto or any situation will have a hard <br/>
time expressing themselves because they will side with whichever side <br/>
can bring stability and peace---at any cost.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the question can be answered with how people interpreted the <br/>
events of  Kinmon no Hen (1864) during which many pro-bakufu domains <br/>
clashed with Choshu forces.  Was this viewed as an attempt BY Choshu <br/>
to aggressively retake political power in Kyoto? OR was this viewed <br/>
by many as Aizu's attempt to suppress another domain.  We must ask <br/>
Choshu experts to explain details to us.<br/>
<br/>
Rekishi Dokuhon is a magazine type publication with a mixed <br/>
reputation however one can be clever and see if the information <br/>
printed can be confirmed with OTHER sources.  We also have to keep in <br/>
mind that publishing in general is difficult and that some <br/>
researchers may find it easier to get things recorded in <br/>
Rekishi...than in other books.  For example let's imagine a <br/>
researcher without mainstream credentials like for instance a PHd in <br/>
history with a specialization in Japan---an "amateur" researcher may <br/>
have found something VERY valuable but may have to publish in Rekishi <br/>
Dokuhon due to the simple circumstance of lack of credentials but <br/>
more likley due to the fact that it is just hard to get published.  I <br/>
think that we as fans must judge on a case to case basis.  <br/>
www.shinsengumihq.com for instance has had to cite Rekishi Dokuhon. <br/>
Things such as rare Shinsengumi photos have even appeared in <br/>
Rekishi....  We also have to keep in mind that many books (not just <br/>
the history magazine Rekishi...) on the shinsengumi were written in a <br/>
non-academic tone with dubious citation and the information therefore <br/>
at times is unreliable as well.  So Rekishi is not the only problem.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some pro-Aizu information:<br/>
<br/>
[May 27,1868]<br/>
"Go in, Aidzu, say we all of us.  Everyone is an Aidzu man now." <br/>
(Boyer 49)<br/>
<br/>
who is "we" ???... we were Americans who were sympathetic towards the <br/>
NORTH as the editor, Barnes, noted.<br/>
---------------------<br/>
[May 29, 1868]<br/>
"The coolies all yell for Aizu---say he is No.1.  The other day they <br/>
yelled as loud for Satsuma.  Now Satsuma is no good;  Aidzu is the <br/>
coming man." (Boyer 50)<br/>
<br/>
so here we have coolies--***normal folks shifting their opinion based <br/>
on the tide of armed conflict<br/>
---------------------<br/>
[June 15, 1868]<br/>
"The latest information from the seat of war is that the tycoon has <br/>
been reinstated as Executive Officer of all Japan by the Mikado.  So <br/>
much for the gallant fighting of Aidzu.  I hope Aidzu will be <br/>
rewarded by the tycoon.  Wonder what old Satsuma will do now.  His <br/>
reign has been of short duration." (Boyer 56)<br/>
 <br/>
Here as the editor and as we all know is simply innaccurate <br/>
information recorded by Boyer in his diary.  Perhaps the value of <br/>
this shred of detail is that he accepts the information he heard <br/>
because HE IS HIMSELF very sympathetic towards Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is truly impossible to gauge whose side the normal folks or <br/>
peasantry sided with.  As Shinsengumi fans we should note that our <br/>
boys are favored and then villified depending on the political <br/>
climate both during and after the Bakumatsu as well.  During the age <br/>
of feudalism the opinion of the man of the street did not "count".  <br/>
The Meiji era was no better---the state CRUSHED dissent ruthlessly <br/>
and muzzled the media effectively (literally no different from the <br/>
Tokugawa). In our present day world we value popular opinion.  <br/>
Therefore to say "whose side was the people on" is a very modern view <br/>
that is hard to determine in that era.<br/>

Craig, Albert M.  Chōshū in the Meiji restoration. <br/>
<br/>
Is the best general reference on the topic.<br/>
If Choshu was insanely popular it would be something short lived <br/>
because the military action Choshu took against the westerners seemed <br/>
the most proactive however the most foolhardy.  Much of the <br/>
population was not fully aware of the military capabilities the west <br/>
was ready to unleash on Japan (and they would LOVE to have been <br/>
provoked and therefore justified in striking back).<br/>
<br/>
I will nudge a Choshu enthusiast and ask her to address this question.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281920528">[The following post was written by Hirotada TOkugawa---yahoogroups is <br/>
not posting his message]<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >people in Kyoto were<br/>
> generally pro-Choshu.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'd like to point out for the sake of argument, Seven, the following <br/>
song which was popular in Kyoto in the spring of Bunkyu 3 (1863), <br/>
upon Matsudaira Katamori's entry into Kyoto (during the torrent of <br/>
Choshu-sponsored assassinations):<br/>
<br/>
"Aizu Higo-sama Kyoto Shugoshoku tsutomemasu<br/>
Dairi hanjou de kuge andon<br/>
toko-Yo no naka you gansu."<br/>
<br/>
(Akama Shizuko, "Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Nazo." Tokyo: Shin <br/>
Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1998, p. 36)<br/>
<br/>
(This can end "you gansho" depending on whose version you're looking <br/>
at. Also, "toko" is just an onomatopoeia used in Japanese folk songs)<br/>
<br/>
A rough translation:<br/>
<br/>
"Lord Aizu Higo is Kyoto Protector<br/>
The Palace prospers, the nobles are relieved<br/>
All is right with the world again"<br/>
<br/>
Some people in Kyoto may have supported Choshu, especially as time <br/>
went on, but think about it: how logical is it for "most" of the <br/>
residents of a city to like the people who go slinking around at <br/>
night murdering, and who, given a chance, wanted to burn their city <br/>
to the ground? This is not to excuse Aizu from blame: there was, for <br/>
example, a recorded instance of Aizu men wanting to torch Nishi-<br/>
Honganji for hiding Choshu runaways in 1864. (see <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/naitouhougyoku/frame11/jinmei-ka.htm)">http://homepage3.nifty.com/naitouhougyoku/frame11/jinmei-ka.htm)</a> <br/>
However, the monk who was doing the hiding, named Kawai Zenjun, was <br/>
from Aizu, and reported the intent of those men to the Aizu <br/>
authorities, who promptly reined them in. After all torching Nishi <br/>
Honganji was a violation of Aizu's military codes, the Rules for <br/>
Commanders and Rules For Soldiers (which Aizu had compiled half a <br/>
century previously)-- these codes clearly state that unnecessary <br/>
destruction of "civilian" property (such as Nishi Honganji) was <br/>
prohibited. The codes appear in Japanese, together with others such <br/>
as the Aizu house code, here: <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Could someone here help me and provide<br/>

but an actual passage from a book, complete with a page number and <br/>
bibliographic citation (title, author, publisher, year)-- please <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264034652">I'd like to post a translation of the item from Aizu's "Shochou<br/>
Kinrei" (Rules for Commanders) here which concerns the incident I<br/>
mentioned regarding the potential burning of Nishi-Honganji which was<br/>
stopped.<br/>
<br/>

"Though it is the enemy's territory, it is *forbidden* to go about<br/>
seizing vegetables and produce, burning the people's houses, killing<br/>
the elderly and young, raping women and girls, stealing rice and gold,<br/>
felling timber without cause, or plucking feathers."<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Aizu held itself to a very high standard of battlefield<br/>
conduct, being one of the most martial domains of northern Japan.<br/>
However, as we have seen, this did not mean that every last Aizu<br/>
samurai followed the code perfectly. However, the fact that the Aizu<br/>
commanders were able to rein the men in shows that the *leadership*<br/>
did its best to follow those rules.<br/>
