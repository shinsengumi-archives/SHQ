<h3>Interesting Detail Soshite Haru no Tsuki</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-702248525">I have uploaded a pic of Saitou from the YAOI manga Soshite Haru no<br/>
Tsuki in the PHOTOS section under &quot;the many faces of Saitou&quot;...I read<br/>
the first chapter months ago and it is just yaoi yaoi yaoi....NOW I<br/>
just checked the characters section at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sanada.from-beneath-you.net/soshite/">http://sanada.from-beneath-you.net/soshite/</a><br/>
and I found it very interesting that Soshite Okita&#39;s childhood friend<br/>
is the Shogun&#39;s Kagemusha.  If you have seen Kurosawa&#39;s film then<br/>
you&#39;ll know that it means shadow warrior or body double (stand in) for<br/>
the important person.  Okita&#39;s friend knows Saitou (that is the<br/>
mystery part) and I thought yaoi mangas did not have good stories!  In<br/>
any case Soshite Saitou is very well designed (okay I&#39;ll say it he&#39;s<br/>
*adorable*) and perhaps the few characters in the series -not-<br/>
involved in the yaoi activities ^_^<br/>
