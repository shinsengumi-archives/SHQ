<h3>Interesting Detail Soshite Haru no Tsuki</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-702248525">I have uploaded a pic of Saitou from the YAOI manga Soshite Haru no<br/>
Tsuki in the PHOTOS section under "the many faces of Saitou"...I read<br/>
the first chapter months ago and it is just yaoi yaoi yaoi....NOW I<br/>
just checked the characters section at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sanada.from-beneath-you.net/soshite/">http://sanada.from-beneath-you.net/soshite/</a><br/>
and I found it very interesting that Soshite Okita's childhood friend<br/>
is the Shogun's Kagemusha.  If you have seen Kurosawa's film then<br/>
you'll know that it means shadow warrior or body double (stand in) for<br/>
the important person.  Okita's friend knows Saitou (that is the<br/>
mystery part) and I thought yaoi mangas did not have good stories!  In<br/>
any case Soshite Saitou is very well designed (okay I'll say it he's<br/>
*adorable*) and perhaps the few characters in the series -not-<br/>
involved in the yaoi activities ^_^<br/>
