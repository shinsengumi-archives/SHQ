<div id="ygrps-yiv-420147856"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   2. Why Shinsengumi was so loyal to the bakufu ? ( i&#39;m not asking to the <br/>
&gt;Aizu clan )<br/>
&gt;   3. Does Shinsengumi has a connection with yakuza era ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I feel I&#39;m best qualified to give an answer to numbers 2 and 3, that&#39;s <br/>
what I&#39;ll do.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost let me say-- you can&#39;t separate Shinsengumi&#39;s &quot;loyalty&quot; <br/>
into &quot;sections&quot; so easily. Aizu was ordered by the Bakufu to take charge of <br/>
the Shinsengumi. Ultimately the Bakufu was above everything in terms of <br/>
administrative structure, and in terms of &quot;who ran the show,&quot; they were it. <br/>
However, this functioned *through* Aizu. The Bakufu issued orders to Aizu to <br/>
take charge of the group of men who became Shinsengumi-- almost like a <br/>
&quot;guardian&quot; might take charge of an orphan (these orders can be seen in <br/>
&quot;Kyoto Shugoshoku Shimatsu&quot;, which is the work of Saitou Hajime&#39;s <br/>
acquaintance Yamakawa Hiroshi). It was Bakufu money, but Aizu supervision. <br/>
Without Aizu, this group of men becomes almost no different from any other <br/>
ronin walking the streets of Kyoto. The big sign you see in most depictions <br/>
of the Shinsengumi&#39;s headquarters reads something like &quot;By Authority of Lord <br/>
Aizu, Protector of Kyoto&quot;--- this can be compared to a British box of cereal <br/>
or detergent (I&#39;ve seen them with my own eyes, so I know) having a little <br/>
inscription that reads &quot;By Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen&quot;. By having <br/>
that added bit of authority, Shinsengumi sets itself apart from the other <br/>
ronin wandering the streets of Kyoto, who mainly couldn&#39;t openly say that <br/>
they had the patronage of so-and-so.<br/>
<br/>
Still with me? Good!<br/>
<br/>
Now, with the &quot;no legitimacy without Aizu&quot; concept being the case, you do <br/>
have a point in talking about &quot;loyalty to the Bakufu&quot;. This is because <br/>
ultimately, the legitimacy that Aizu gives Shinsengumi is merely the <br/>
Shogun&#39;s legitimacy, for which Aizu acts as a conduit. After all, it was by <br/>
order of the Shogunate that Aizu came to Kyoto, and without that legitimacy, <br/>
Aizu also doesn&#39;t have much authority in Kyoto. A medium sized domain from <br/>
the middle of nowhere in northeastern Japan? No way it&#39;d be able to do <br/>
anything without the legitimacy of the central government!<br/>
<br/>
So if you think of &quot;legitimacy&quot; as being like a flow of water, the flow <br/>
starts with the Bakufu, flows *through* the pipe or conduit (Aizu), and <br/>
reaches its destination (Shinsengumi).<br/>
<br/>
As for your question about the Shinsengumi&#39;s loyalty to the Bakufu-- the <br/>
answer is that it wasn&#39;t rigidly loyal. Yes, it stuck with Tokugawa forces <br/>
to the end, but there&#39;s more to it than that. Kondou Isami, toward the end <br/>
of his time in Kyoto, was in frequent contact with Goto Shojiro-- a man of <br/>
Tosa-- and apparently professed great admiration for the man, though they <br/>
only met once. Even the Bakufu officials were not rigid-- they met with men <br/>
of Tosa and Satsuma. Case in point-- Ryoma-- yes, *that* Ryoma-- warned the <br/>
Shogunate that Satsuma was planning to have its way by force. Nagai Genba <br/>
(information on whom appears on the SHQ site and who had frequent contact <br/>
with Shinsengumi), in the name of the Shogunate, met with Ryoma face to <br/>
face-- and even arranged for Goto Shojiro&#39;s meeting with Kondou.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that still doesn&#39;t answer your question, I know, but stay with me, <br/>
because I&#39;m about to get to that.<br/>
<br/>
As I said earlier, in the beginning of its short history, Shinsengumi was <br/>
basically nothing without Aizu acting as a conduit for the Bakufu legitimacy <br/>
to flow to it. Now, after a certain point (roughly 1866), this was to <br/>
change, and *that* is where it is appropriate to ask &quot;Why was the <br/>
Shinsengumi so loyal to the Bakufu?&quot; The reason for this is that in that <br/>
time period, the Bakufu&#39;s gorojuu-shuu (Senior Councilors, basically Cabinet <br/>
Ministers for the Shogun) signed a document that made the Shinsengumi <br/>
&quot;bakushin&quot;-- Bakufu retainers (&quot;bakufu no gokerai-tachi,&quot; in simpler <br/>
Japanese). The ranks of &quot;bakushin&quot; include such men as Enomoto Takeaki, <br/>
Nagai Genba, Otori Keisuke, and Katsu Kaishu (ALL directly involved with <br/>
Shinsengumi on a face-to-face basis)-- and all these men owe EVERYTHING to <br/>
the Bakufu. They get paid by the Bakufu, they get their authority and jobs <br/>
from the Bakufu, and everything they do is affected by the fact that they <br/>
serve the Bakufu.<br/>
<br/>
So at that point-- why was the Shinsengumi so loyal to the Bakufu? The <br/>
answer is: the same way that someone getting paid for working in a company <br/>
might be loyal to that company-- because without that position, he has no <br/>
job, no money, his family will starve, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi was defeated at Toba-Fushimi and fled to Edo in early 1868. Why <br/>
did they stick with the now *former* Bakufu? Part of it was because of their <br/>
implication (however false or contrived) in the murder of Sakamoto Ryoma <br/>
(which even a work as incomplete and shallow as Romulus Hillsborough&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Shinsengumi&quot; talks about, citing primary data), and part of it was because <br/>
they had nowhere else to go.<br/>
<br/>
This continued, from the time where the senior Shinsengumi men could have <br/>
become daimyo (the &quot;Koyochinbutai period,&quot; I&#39;ll call it), then Aizu, then <br/>
Sendai, then Hakodate...they stuck with the Bakufu forces and the northern <br/>
clans because, well...what awaited them pretty much anywhere else was death.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to your question about &quot;are the Shinsengumi connected to Yakuza?&quot; <br/>
the answer lies in the Yakuza boss known as &quot;Aizu no Kotetsu&quot;. This man, who <br/>
if I recall correctly at one time worked in the Aizu mansion in Edo (hence <br/>
his nickname), was a major presence in the underworld of Kyoto. While I <br/>
don&#39;t have much data on him, I know for a fact that after Toba-Fushimi, he <br/>
buried the Aizu and Kuwana dead (when no one else would or was even allowed <br/>
to), paying for the burials out of his own pocket. Since Shinsengumi were <br/>
among the Aizu dead, I believe it is safe to assume that he buried his fair <br/>
share of Shinsengumi dead, too. Secretarytocapt3 has had more experience <br/>
researching the Yakuza than I have, so perhaps she would further explore <br/>
this topic.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;ve been able to answer things to some extent. While I&#39;m basing my <br/>
views on the primary data I&#39;ve read (Meiji-era newspapers, journals, <br/>
government documents), as well as the secondary data (books by historians), <br/>
you should NOT have to take my word at face value...try to look for things <br/>
on your own, and never be afraid to question &quot;why?&quot;. Ever. It&#39;s by <br/>
questioning things that historians get stuff done.<br/>

Makoto to one&#39;s self<br/>
Sincerity is water which flows from one&#39;s heart, it is inexhaustible <br/>
and gives life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never read a step by step account as to how Kondou Isami or <br/>
other prominent figures in the Shinsengumi may have concluded to <br/>
adopt this term---however keep in mind that people across the <br/>
political spectrum also drew on this word frequently such <br/>
as &quot;loyalty/sincerity to the emperor&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shinsengumi and Yakuza connection is mentioned here please click <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
You may say &quot;NO WAY, the Shinsengumi should not mess with those scum!&quot;<br/>
however, way way way in the past...yakuza have existed for a very <br/>
long time serving as almost its own social class which ends up being <br/>
an economic safety net for ronin, social misfits and outcasts.  <br/>
Yakuza not surprisingly rose in power alongside the merchant class <br/>
during the end of the Edo Era.  There were also divisions and <br/>
specific labels for yakuza as well.  The term &quot;yakuza&quot; is very <br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, yakuza ran the red light district for a long time <br/>
before the Shinsengumi were even born.  When you think of yakuza try <br/>
not to picture &quot;modern&quot; yakuza.  Ofcourse historically, there were <br/>
flashy dressing thug yakuza on the street too.  HOwever, the ones who <br/>
had &quot;real&quot; power acted....like RESPECTABLE SAMURAI OR MERCHANT <br/>
FAMILIES (*_*).  Some people colleted artwork depicting samurai <br/>
(often actors portraying samurai)---some also collect artwork <br/>
depicting famous yakuza who became &quot;folk heroes&quot;---thus from a social <br/>
point of view, yakuza were at times viewed as Robin HOod type <br/>
figures.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that -if- the Shinsengumi had more deeper ties with the <br/>
yakuza it would be because yakuza are information brokers.  If the <br/>
Shinsengumi wished to be successful in their jobs they would try to <br/>
be on good terms with the yakuza and even buy information from the <br/>
yakuza.  From the Edo Era, Meiji and modern era, yakuza and law <br/>
enforcement have sought a strange &quot;balance of power&quot;.  If that <br/>
delicate arrangement is disturbed one or the other side would take <br/>
action.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   4. Is it wrong if  I say &quot;makoto&quot; was Shinsengumi way of life / <br/>

<br/>
You can say it was an ideal the group adopted---but like all &quot;ways of <br/>
life&quot; ultimately the individual decides how he can interpret it.<br/>

<br/>
I grew interested in the Shinsengumi from the anime/manga Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin.  Later I became fascinated with the historical Saitou Hajime <br/>
(Fujita Goro) and the larger Aizu narrative.  <br/>
I owe alot to the Shinsengumi for teaching me about bias:  <br/>
1) from people who are pro Ishin and Meiji revisionist texts<br/>
2) from Shinsengumi fans who romanticized the Miburo and try to white <br/>
wash them<br/>
3) people who confuse history with fiction and the subsequent <br/>
disillusionment with all things <br/>
4) I like the &quot;free&quot; expressions of creativity I see in Shinsengumi <br/>
fandom---I especially like original works<br/>
5) I&#39;ve never really researched stuff like this before---so I picked <br/>
up alot of neat little tricks to find stuff in the library etc etc<br/>
<br/>
Although now I focus on history (because I cannot afford manga/anime) <br/>
I still do alot of fanfic writing and drawing although I don&#39;t <br/>
subject the public to those efforts (^___^)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452114428">Ah, I forgot to post a message with the scans, didn&#39;t I?    I&#39;ve been reading more about the <br/>
Ichimura brothers.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a few theories in regard of Ichimura Tetsunosuke&#39;s death date, while many <br/>
believe that Ichimura joined Saigo Takamori&#39;s army and died during the Satsuma Rebellion <br/>
in 1877, some believe that he died from an illness in 1873. <br/>
<br/>
The uploaded scans support the latter theory.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Rather than saying that the Shinsengumi has a connection with yakuza era, I&#39;d say that <br/>
there&#39;s a connection between the ultranationalists from the samurai class and the yakuza.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never read a step by step account as to how Kondou Isami or <br/>
&gt; other prominent figures in the Shinsengumi may have concluded to <br/>
&gt; adopt this term---however keep in mind that people across the <br/>
&gt; political spectrum also drew on this word frequently such <br/>
&gt; as &quot;loyalty/sincerity to the emperor&quot;.<br/>
&gt; -----------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;   3. Does Shinsengumi has a connection with yakuza era ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi and Yakuza connection is mentioned here please click <br/>
&gt; on &quot;Books Which Mention the Shinsengumi&quot;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may say &quot;NO WAY, the Shinsengumi should not mess with those scum!&quot;<br/>
&gt; however, way way way in the past...yakuza have existed for a very <br/>
&gt; long time serving as almost its own social class which ends up being <br/>
&gt; an economic safety net for ronin, social misfits and outcasts.  <br/>
&gt; Yakuza not surprisingly rose in power alongside the merchant class <br/>
&gt; during the end of the Edo Era.  There were also divisions and <br/>
&gt; specific labels for yakuza as well.  The term &quot;yakuza&quot; is very <br/>
&gt; general.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More importantly, yakuza ran the red light district for a long time <br/>
&gt; before the Shinsengumi were even born.  When you think of yakuza try <br/>
&gt; not to picture &quot;modern&quot; yakuza.  Ofcourse historically, there were <br/>
&gt; flashy dressing thug yakuza on the street too.  HOwever, the ones who <br/>
&gt; had &quot;real&quot; power acted....like RESPECTABLE SAMURAI OR MERCHANT <br/>
&gt; FAMILIES (*_*).  Some people colleted artwork depicting samurai <br/>
&gt; (often actors portraying samurai)---some also collect artwork <br/>
&gt; depicting famous yakuza who became &quot;folk heroes&quot;---thus from a social <br/>
&gt; point of view, yakuza were at times viewed as Robin HOod type <br/>
&gt; figures.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that -if- the Shinsengumi had more deeper ties with the <br/>
&gt; yakuza it would be because yakuza are information brokers.  If the <br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi wished to be successful in their jobs they would try to <br/>
&gt; be on good terms with the yakuza and even buy information from the <br/>
&gt; yakuza.  From the Edo Era, Meiji and modern era, yakuza and law <br/>
&gt; enforcement have sought a strange &quot;balance of power&quot;.  If that <br/>
&gt; delicate arrangement is disturbed one or the other side would take <br/>
&gt; action.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recommend Yakuza: Japan&#39;s Criminal Underworld, Expanded Edition <br/>
&gt; by David E. Kaplan (Author), Alec Dubro<br/>
&gt; Yakuza are also mentioned here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/NSNR.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/NSNR.htm</a><br/>
&gt; -----------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;   4. Is it wrong if  I say &quot;makoto&quot; was Shinsengumi way of life / <br/>
&gt; philosophy?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can say it was an ideal the group adopted---but like all &quot;ways of <br/>
&gt; life&quot; ultimately the individual decides how he can interpret it.<br/>
&gt; -----------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;   5. ( Just for the people who love Shinsengumi ),, Would you ( if <br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t mind ) give me your private reasons why you love them ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I grew interested in the Shinsengumi from the anime/manga Rurouni <br/>
&gt; Kenshin.  Later I became fascinated with the historical Saitou Hajime <br/>
&gt; (Fujita Goro) and the larger Aizu narrative.  <br/>
&gt; I owe alot to the Shinsengumi for teaching me about bias:  <br/>
&gt; 1) from people who are pro Ishin and Meiji revisionist texts<br/>
&gt; 2) from Shinsengumi fans who romanticized the Miburo and try to white <br/>
&gt; wash them<br/>
&gt; 3) people who confuse history with fiction and the subsequent <br/>
&gt; disillusionment with all things <br/>
&gt; 4) I like the &quot;free&quot; expressions of creativity I see in Shinsengumi <br/>
&gt; fandom---I especially like original works<br/>
&gt; 5) I&#39;ve never really researched stuff like this before---so I picked <br/>
&gt; up alot of neat little tricks to find stuff in the library etc etc<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although now I focus on history (because I cannot afford manga/anime) <br/>
&gt; I still do alot of fanfic writing and drawing although I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; subject the public to those efforts (^___^)<br/>

Well, although I read Kenshin, I thought that everyone there was<br/>
purely fictional.^^° Only when I started reading the Peace Maker manga<br/>
I grew interested in the shinsengumi. But I would not start<br/>
researching or anything...but around that time I also wrote for the<br/>

<br/>
Rei Shinoda was asking about the *Bakumatsu era, during which the <br/>

As stated in my post, yakuza &quot;history&quot; mostly lore, goes way back in <br/>
the past.<br/>
<br/>
Yakuza, samurai and politicians also had common ground in very high <br/>
profile martial arts societies as well during the Meiji (which had <br/>
members from the military and police).<br/>
<br/>
The quote posted at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Seymour, Christopher. Yakuza Diary <br/>
Atlantic Monthly Press ISBN: 087113604X <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tells of the origins of the Aizu-Kotetsu gang which traced its <br/>
roots to the birth of its first leader Senkichi in 1836. &quot;Isao <br/>
Kondo&quot; was the leader of &quot;Shinsei-gumi&quot; and he needed to place <br/>
redundant members of the Shinsengumi. These men were incorporated <br/>
into the gang was formally established in 1888 and used the name <br/>
Aizu-Kotetsu. Aizu was their native region and Kotetsu was the <br/>
favored brand/type of sword of the boss.&quot; (Seymour 70-72)<br/>
<br/>
again, I&#39;m sure Seymour who had heard this lore from a member of the <br/>
yakuza cannot guarantee its accuracy.  As I mentioned in my post, <br/>
there were practical reasons why the Shinsengumi *may have sought to <br/>
be on good terms with the powerful yakuza which in fact did run the <br/>
red-light district (the shinsengumi patrol area).  Yakuza families <br/>
mimicked samurai and merchant families and often had blood line <br/>
lineages where the &quot;business&quot; was passed onto the oldest son (unless <br/>
he is overthrown).</div>

<br/>
For example,  in (western calender) May 1863, Serizawa&#39;s  faction and Kondo&#39;s faction <br/>
eliminated Tomouchi Yoshio and his third faction and  the group was then made of two <br/>
factions (instead of three.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029973504"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   But, in &quot;MibuGishiDen&quot;, why they look so poor ???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shinsengumi was paid, but they weren&#39;t paid a great deal. Receiving reward <br/>
money from the Emperor for, say, distinguished service at the 8.18.1863 <br/>
incident, or the Ikedaya incident, was a big thing-- THAT was big money. <br/>
Another issue to bear in mind is that these men started out poor, so even if <br/>
they received a lot of money, they wouldn&#39;t go about making themselves *not* <br/>
look poor right away.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, when they were paid by the Shogunate, they also weren&#39;t paid an <br/>
incredibly high amount...but they were better off than before (this appears <br/>
in Mibugishiden-- the Shinsengumi go through &quot;bakushin toritate&quot;-- which <br/>
means they are made hatamoto, or retainers of the Shogun). The best off the <br/>
Shinsengumi were going to be monetarily and status-wise, at least on paper, <br/>
was right before they headed to fight the Imperial army in Kai Province. <br/>
Kondou was to become a daimyo with a 100,000 koku income, Hijikata would <br/>
have 50,000, the captains would have 30,000, and the junior officers 10,000 <br/>
(see page 102 of Kikuchi Akira&#39;s &quot;Toba-Fushimi no Tatakai Kara Nagareyama <br/>
Made,&quot; in &quot;Saitou Hajime no Subete) However, this was never to become <br/>
reality.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Could anybody tell me, except &quot;Kiyokawa Hachirou/Serizawa Kamo&#39;s probs&quot;, <br/>
&gt;are there another &gt;internal problem in Shinsengumi????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. There were periodically issues with people leaving. Also, early on, <br/>
there was the issue of Okura Isetake, Arakida Samanosuke, and Kusunoki <br/>
Kojuro, the Choshu spies who joined Shinsengumi early on, and were killed in <br/>
the fall of 1863. (see Itou Tetsuya&#39;s timeline which appears at the end of <br/>
the book &quot;Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot;.) Most famous is the incident of Itou <br/>
Kashitarou&#39;s group leaving-- this would later come back to haunt Kondou, who <br/>
was shot by the survivors of the group in early 1868 (see page 157 of <br/>
Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&quot;). Another survivor of that <br/>
group, Kano Washio, was the man who positively identified the newly captured <br/>
Kondou later that year. Here is a picture of him: <br/>

<br/>
There were also many other people who were executed for various reasons. <br/>
However, Nagakura records even those who were executed on the memorial that <br/>
he inscribed for Shinsengumi, a translation of which appears here: <br/>

*-*-*<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was ever know what Yamanami&#39;s reasons for trying to leave were.   I&#39;ve read/heard many diffrent reasons, the most popular is that he wasn&#39;t happy with the way the Shinsengumi was heading.   He disagreed with many of Kondou&#39;s views and ways of doing things.    The Shinsengumi did not hold the same values (I guess you can say) from when they had first began and this seemed to trouble him.<br/>
<br/>
Thats pretty much all I know it a nutshell ^^;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056368845">There are several speculations on Yamanami&#39;s reason to leave the Shinsengumi. Officially, <br/>
it is still a mystery, even though a disagreement in philosophy on top of a rivalry with <br/>
Hijikata is the most accepted theory. There&#39;s also a theory that Yamanami committed <br/>
suicide without ever leaving the Shinsengumi.<br/>

&gt;    Why did Yamanami Keisuke try to leave Shinsengumi ?<br/>
&gt;    Was it JUST b&#39;coz misunderstnding ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *-*-*<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it was ever know what Yamanami&#39;s reasons for trying to leave were.   I&#39;ve <br/>
read/heard many diffrent reasons, the most popular is that he wasn&#39;t happy with the way <br/>
the Shinsengumi was heading.   He disagreed with many of Kondou&#39;s views and ways of <br/>
doing things.    The Shinsengumi did not hold the same values (I guess you can say) from <br/>
when they had first began and this seemed to trouble him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thats pretty much all I know it a nutshell ^^;<br/>
