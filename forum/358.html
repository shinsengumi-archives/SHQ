<h3>Burai S.H. as Nobori Nakajima&#39;s S.H.</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-812406363">Probably the best example to express how historic S.H. is increasingly<br/>
blended with his fictional incarnations....<br/>
<br/>
"Burai" (scans on miburo.com) S.H. "posing" as Nobori Nakajima's S.H.<br/>

***now I know for sure that the letters on his kimono say "mountain"<br/>
it is in my Japanese dictionary but I wasn't positive until reading<br/>
this Japanese site<br/>
<br/>
***does anyone know if it is typical to have words written on one's<br/>
clothing?  Or was Nobori Nakajima going for symbolism again...just the<br/>
posture of his original work screams "symbolism"...S.H. as some kind<br/>
of god of war pose...holding severed heads and stepping on someone's<br/>
back like that (shudder)<br/>
please see our fellow member's site for Nobori Nakajima's work<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah-- the Chushingura (47 Ronin) had their names written on their haori. <br/>
Also, Sagara Sanosuke's "Aku" is another good example. The "yama" in <br/>
Nakajima's portrait might hark back to the "yama" of "Yamaguchi Jirou".<br/>
