<h3>For nlf7</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038404362">Nlf7:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to second secretarytocapt3 and Kaneyoshi&#39;s comments, and say<br/>
how happy I am to have you here. It is outstanding to see an<br/>
individual such as yourself take a proactive approach to this topic,<br/>
and the misconceptions that arise from it.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, I&#39;d like to make a request, which I believe<br/>
secretarytocapt3 made earlier. Could you please tell us what books<br/>
you&#39;ve been using (Japanese and English) for your Shinsengumi<br/>
research? We have a list of books which mention Shinsengumi on the SHQ<br/>
website (www.shinsengumihq.com, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been to<br/>
already), and we would be delighted to add more titles to that list.<br/>
This isn&#39;t for any single person among us, but rather for ALL of us in<br/>
the non-Japanese speaking (and in some cases also the<br/>
Japanese-speaking) fandom, so that we can better understand these men<br/>
we are interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I have perused some of your articles on Wikipedia (especially your<br/>
work on the Kondou and Okita articles), and I would like to applaud<br/>
your efforts there, as well. It often takes great courage to be able<br/>
to remind people to keep fact and fiction separate, especially in a<br/>
topic like this one, which has been so colored and often skewed by<br/>
popular portrayals. However, I&#39;d like to suggest that you add a<br/>
&quot;References&quot; section to both articles, so that we know on Wikipedia as<br/>
well, where your information is coming from. I say this in all<br/>
honesty-- I&#39;m curious to see what other books there are out there!<br/>
<br/>
Also, please allow me to say that I hope that with such an attitude<br/>
toward spreading knowledge, that you consider writing an article or<br/>
book on Okita. Wikipedia is good in its own right, but as you know,<br/>
articles are open to being edited or deleted at anytime. By writing<br/>
something-- anything-- you&#39;d be a trailblazer-- to the best of my<br/>
knowledge, at this time there are no biographies of Okita in print form.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;d like to reiterate that if you&#39;d like to write or publish<br/>
anything related to history, any editor or publication will likely ask<br/>
that you follow industry standards in citation.  Even if you do not<br/>
plan to publish, when you attend school your teachers will also force<br/>
you to adopt a citation format as well.<br/>
<br/>
The current most widely used format in the United States and now at<br/>
the international level is MLA (or something very similar to it).  You<br/>
can learn more about this easy format here:<br/>

<br/>
An example of the format for the MLA citation:<br/>
&quot;blah blah blah bakumatsu info blah blah blah&quot; (Madison 34)<br/>
(author last name, page number)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really as easy as listing the books at the bottom of your webpage<br/>
like this:<br/>
(author last name, first name. title either in bold or underlined.<br/>
location published: company, year.)<br/>
With journal and magazine articles, though, there&#39;s a bit of a<br/>
different format.<br/>

UNIVERSE. Los Angles: Makoto Publishers, 2007.<br/>
<br/>
For webpages we at the shinsengumihq.com actually link right back to<br/>
the very webpage and note the person who translated from Japanese to<br/>
English<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not trying to make fandom boring/tedious however we are trying<br/>
to acknowledge the hard work and valuable contributions of Japanese or<br/>
western scholars, and protect ourselves from plaigiarism (which is a<br/>
prosecutable offense).<br/>
<br/>
**********************<br/>
Note on Wikipedia<br/>
Wikipedia allows ANYONE to go in and edit or delete your information.<br/>
 I think that you can provide basic information on wikipedia and link<br/>
to your own personal website with additional information---that&#39;s<br/>
really a safe way of protecting your work.  If you write a wikipedia<br/>
article it is also necessary to cite your information.<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note as a longtime Kondou fan, I&#39;d also like to thank<br/>
you for pointing out that the &quot;Kotetsu&quot; that he is said to have<br/>
posessed was most probably not a real one. The book &quot;Swordsmith<br/>
Nagasone Kotetsu Okisato,&quot; an English text written by Yasu Kizu,<br/>
confirms what you pointed out: Kondou&#39;s sword was not a true Kotetsu,<br/>
but instead was a sword made by Minamoto Kiyomaro, the foremost<br/>
swordmaker of the shinshinto period, and roughly contemporary to<br/>
Kondou Isami. Apparently faked Kotetsu swords were common even during<br/>
the life of Kotesu himself, and he is said to have remarked on seeing<br/>
a fake &quot;The blade is mine but the signature is not.&quot; (from page 8 of<br/>
the Yasu Kizu book).<br/>
