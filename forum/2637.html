<h3>A few doujinshi pages ^_^</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736325556">Greetings to all the Shinsengumi lovers of this world! ^_________^<br/>
  <br/>
  Alright then, these are 8 pages I did because I was deeply inspired  (and hooked) on a fanfic I&#39;m currently reading called &quot;The Courtship of  Lady Tokio&quot; by Misaki Toyodome.   Now,  Misaki didn&#39;t  ask me to draw this, I did it on my own out of pure urge to see what  this one particular scene would look like.   I was extreamly  nervous when I sent her the links to the pages and I am overly excited  that she loves them.   She loves them so much that she suggested I  share these pages with the SHQ mailing list (BTW are the SHQ & Spy  division under the same e-mail address for the mailing  list?).   So, without further adue, the small section of  fanfic turned doujinshi:<br/>

  If any of you haven&#39;t read this fic, you should.   It is  exquisitly writen.   The fanfic can be found both on  fanfiction.net (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/1/)">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/1/)</a> & on  hakubaikou.com ... the one on FF.net is more far ahead then the one on  Hakubaikou&#39;s site.   Anyways, I hope you guys all enjoy this  as much as Misaki did (I know secretarytocapt3 enjoys the fic  ^.^).   So, &#39;till later!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161414945">Ah. Very nice style, Bunneh.   I like your rendition of Souji, in particular.  Also -- the pages are laid out very well!   <br/>
<br/>
Make sure to drop these for Hakubaikou as well. She&#39;s massively behind in updates, but still alive.    <br/>
<br/>
Of course, the only question I have is where is Tokio?<br/>

  <br/>
  Where is Tokio-chan?   She didn&#39;t appear in this scene so I  didn&#39;t draw her, but she did turn up in the next scene (which I didn&#39;t  make).   I did try to make a few sketches of her but didn&#39;t  really like them, so they&#39;re still in my room somewhere ^^;    I&#39;m glad you liked this.   It really makes me happy when people  like what I make.  ^_____^<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900738492">Dear Bunneh, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for doing this! I may be biased, but I<br/>
really did like it - it&#39;s got a proper manga feel to<br/>
the way it flows, which I particularly appreciate<br/>
because I always have the manga in mind when I write,<br/>
and Souji is pure class. Ah, may Shinsengumi doujinshi<br/>
thrive and prosper, thanks to the hard work of<br/>
talented people like you. <br/>
Actually, purely out of curiosity, I put it out there<br/>
as a general question (this might belong on the Spy<br/>
Division list, and if so, feel free to chastise me),<br/>
do any of the Shinsengumi fans here have major<br/>
problems with the fic? I know I&#39;ve taken huge<br/>
liberties in the writing process, but I do try to put<br/>
the history in there properly, and I was just<br/>
wondering what criticisms the experts here had.... <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, <br/>
<br/>
Mio. (misaki toyodome) <br/>
