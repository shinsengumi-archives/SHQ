<h3>Saito&#39;s kinshin punishment</h3>
by <i>tamagot93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065139135">I post here more info about a topics which roused your interest during last <br/>
chat.<br/>
As I have no books here , I can put only the things I found on the web now.<br/>
Ito, Nagakura and Saito's Kinshin affair is mentioned here,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.1to5.net/saito/history/sumiya.html">http://www.1to5.net/saito/history/sumiya.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I guess you know already this site, still I add few explanations, Ito stayed <br/>
in Kondo's room and Saito in Hijikata's room until the final sentence of <br/>
Kinshin was given. So Saito didn't stayed all along during his real kinshin times, <br/>
in Hijikata's room. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Nevetherless, webmistress wonders also, why it was Saito who stayed with <br/>
Hijikata instead of Nagakura, and she gave her own supposition; [Hijikata gave <br/>
Saito a mission to approach Ito as a spy before this affair.Only, Saito went a <br/>
little bit too far, and Hijikata was displeased about it. But Saito who knew <br/>
Hijikata would never really punish him, could laugh about it.<br/>
Probably, Hijikata heard Saito's report, though grunted.]<br/>
<br/>
I put also the definition of "Kinshin".<br/>
"One of the punishments with which the person of the status more than Samurai <br/>
was sentenced at the Edo period. The place in which concerned person lives <br/>
was appointed, the entrance was closed, and free action was not allowed."<br/>
<br/>
I think, NHK drama would show this episode too(and I hope so. I want to see <br/>
this epispde with these actors!), as I constate some tendency of the <br/>
scriptwriter up till now.<br/>
I'll post about Sano's legend and Matsubara affair later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195265371">So Saitou waited in Hijikata's room for his sentence. Yes, it is<br/>
inconvenient for Hijikata if Saitou stays in his room.<br/>
I think this is as the webmistress for 1to5.net says the perfect set<br/>
up for the Itou Affair.  When Saitou separates from the Shinsengumi,<br/>
Itou will think "ofcourse Saitou separates from the Shinsengumi he was<br/>
punished by them!"  Sacrifice a rule or break a rule, to catch big<br/>
fish...Itou. Poor Nagakura.<br/>
secretarytocapt3 thinks "kinshin" = vacation for Saitou<br/>
