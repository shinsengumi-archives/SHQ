<h3>Program on History Channel</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409234349">I just ran into this (it&#39;s almost over... they&#39;re explaining the 47 Ronin right now) when I clicked on the tv to wake up.  I thought I had seen it before, but maybe it was something else I saw.  This documentary seems much better.  Anyway, the program is &quot;Samurai&quot; and includes commentary by our friend Romulus Hillsborough and by Karl Friday (among others).  It&#39;s showing again later this afternoon on my cable system (4PM MST & PST).  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s also available for purchase on the History Channel website.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t tape it.<br/>
 <br/>
Again, it&#39;s nothing most of us here don&#39;t already know, but the 30 minutes I&#39;ve seen have been amazing with lots of old photographs of samurai and Japanese culture and very well organized --- much better than the PBS documentary.<br/>

Just checked the History Channel site:<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the program &quot;The Samurai&quot; from History Matters.<br/>
 <br/>
Uh oh... Perry just arrived in Edo Bay!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519361604">Mark Ravina is talking about Saigou and his samurai during the last battle.  Isn&#39;t this the author who so many here have been reading?  Talking about his inability to commit seppuku because of injuries and his men taking his head and hiding it (thanks to MissB, who told me about this controvery, my current fic plays on that).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll shut up now... I was just surprised to see Ravina pop up.  :-D<br/>
