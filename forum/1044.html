<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306049090">Quite by accident I discovered seasons 2,3 & 4 of a show called <br/>
Hatchobori Seven which can best be described as an late Edo era version <br/>
of  NYPD Blue/Law & Order/Hill Street Blues your basic continuing <br/>
character crime drama show.<br/>
<br/>
It features all sorts of cool little details in the props and plot <br/>
points to thrill and inspire the writers among us.  (note it is much <br/>
easier to focus on said details when there is a lack of mind-numbing <br/>
male eye candy to distract :-D)<br/>
<br/>
On a Shinsengumi related note Hatchobori Seven&#39;s lead --Inspector Aoyama <br/>
is played by Murakami Hiroaki who portrayed Hijikata in Shinsengumi <br/>
Keppuroku (unfortunately in this he&#39;s sporting a most unflattering--for <br/>
him--haircut) He&#39;s very good in this as well, provided you don&#39;t mind <br/>
his character coming  across a bit like RK&#39;s Hiko Seijuro at times.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731142994">I just saw the episode with the love letters in the company of my<br/>
Koichi Sato vodoo doll (sec clears throat) I mean plushy...I<br/>
immediately recalled the story SK told us about how Hijikata forwarded<br/>
some love letters to the students of Shieikan.  Was he trying to send<br/>
a message...something along the lines...work hard become a great<br/>
swordsman, strive for the ideals of the samurai, and become a ladies man!<br/>
Could you imagine the officer in the Shinsengumi in charge of sorting<br/>
mail?  Why I&#39;m sure the ladies would refrain from writing their real<br/>
names on the envelope and so the guy would have to do the &quot;smell&quot;<br/>
test...perfumed letters for Vice Chief Hijikata...unperfumed letters<br/>
go in the &quot;business&quot; bin and as usual Saitou gets -no- mail (only the<br/>
occasional death threat signed in blood) :P<br/>
In Hatchobori 7 remember the other officers were discussing how cruel<br/>
it is to not even reply to the letters?...I wonder if he replied to<br/>
any of his letters.<br/>
I posted in the merchandise section of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> a<br/>
collage of actual Shinsengumi stuff being sold (scanned from a book I<br/>
borrowed from one of our members) and there was stationary...there<br/>
should be romantic stationary with Hijikata&#39;s poetry pre-printed on it.<br/>
Lastly, the whole business with pretending to be Aoyama is funny...I<br/>
wonder if anyone in the Shinsengumi pulled this stunt...you know going<br/>
around saying &quot;I&#39;m Hijikata&quot; (to attract the ladies)...what is the<br/>
penalty for identity theft? LOL!<br/>
