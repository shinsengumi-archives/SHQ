<h3>Taking suggestions</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-824976513">As Barb has already mentioned, I've made two quizzes for the <br/>
Shinsengumihq.com site. These first two are meant more or less as <br/>
test quizzes while I learn exactly how everything works. Now that <br/>
I've gotten the hang of it, I'm looking for suggestions! I've already <br/>
discussed a quiz with Barb that will be centered around testing a <br/>
person's knowledge of the Shinsengumi, especially the odder facts <br/>
we've come across. Considering the way things are set up, it will <br/>
probably work best as a true or false type quiz. Also, I want to do <br/>
improved versions of the test quizzes and a movie/anime type quiz <br/>
about the shows the Shinsengumi have appeared in, and a specifically <br/>
PMK quiz. I'm looking for suggestions on questions and answers for <br/>
all of these.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also willing to do a Sekihoutai quiz if our resident Sagara fan <br/>
will be willing to lend a hand with planning it out. Does anyone have <br/>
any suggestions other than what's already been listed? And NO, taking <br/>
a hike, a long walk off a short pier, and playing in traffice DO NOT <br/>
COUNT!!!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I want everyone to have a say in these. I feel a group <br/>
effort can only improve the quality of what eventually gets posted on <br/>
the site. If possible, we can discuss this the next time we schedule <br/>
a chat. So go over to Shinsengumihq.com, take the two tests already <br/>
on site, and think over what you'd like to see on them. Thanks ahead <br/>
of time! Looking forward to hearing what everyone has to say!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299169268">I think it'll be fun to have a most compatible type quiz. For example, if you like sweets - obviously Okita, or if you like to smoke - Hijikata, stuff like that... and make it really funny.  and this is according to PMK, cuz I don't think RK provided that much info on the other captains except for Saitoh and Okita.<br/>
