<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698809030">Someone once asked me the question about what NHK Saito was carving in the <br/>
drama.<br/>
In the early episodes, what he made was not clear but recently the thing  <br/>
finally showed up  and you can see the photo here, if you don&#39;tmind the spoiler.<br/>

Article said what Saito makes is a kind  of Kokeshi (wooden folkloricdoll)  <br/>
and he had made already several examples and gave one to Yagiboy and one to <br/>
Sano for his marriage present. Currently he is making still another one but we <br/>
don&#39;t know for whom he&#39;ll give it to the next time.<br/>

&quot;originally made as a toy for children of farmers&quot;<br/>
[historical] Saitou&#39;s mother was a farmer<br/>

Kokeshi dolls can get to be very fancy<br/>
