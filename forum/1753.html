<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698809030">Someone once asked me the question about what NHK Saito was carving in the <br/>
drama.<br/>
In the early episodes, what he made was not clear but recently the thing  <br/>
finally showed up  and you can see the photo here, if you don'tmind the spoiler.<br/>

Article said what Saito makes is a kind  of Kokeshi (wooden folkloricdoll)  <br/>
and he had made already several examples and gave one to Yagiboy and one to <br/>
Sano for his marriage present. Currently he is making still another one but we <br/>
don't know for whom he'll give it to the next time.<br/>
