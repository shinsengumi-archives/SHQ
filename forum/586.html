 <br/>
Okay, so tell me if you think I'm interpreting this correctly.  (Great... I need a translator for a babelfish translation...)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>After assassination of the older brother November 18th<br/>
 </span></blockquote>while moving aside the body to the Satsuma feudal clan residence, we would like to aim for Kondo's assassination, you want.<<<br/>
<br/>
Itou is killed and Suzuki retrieves his body and takes it to someone's house, probably the house where their party (political party, that is) was being headquartered since it's the clan residence.  Suzuki wants to kill Kondou in vengeance (and begins planning?).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>On December 9th the Kondo road is attacked with the Kyoto ink dyeing, but because it is injured, it ends.<<<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What the heck is "Kyoto ink dyeing"?<br/>
<br/>
Suzuki puts his plan into action and attacks Kondou, but is injured in the attempt, so he gives up on trying to kill him.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>It participated in Toba Fushimi war and the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>raising/holding soldier it did afterwards as red information party second captain. In new selection group vengeance you had run about, but without being able to carry out it received the restoration, was Meiji and became the policeman, Tsuruoka chief of police era threw the private funds to hospital construction.<<<br/>
<br/>
Clear enough that he fought at Toba-Fushimi and then went to the Sekihoutai to become second patrol captain, and that when all was said and done, he became a policeman (oh, I just **LOVE** the fanfic possibilities there... I may drop all other stories in progress for a while to focus on what could happen with that scenario... poor Sanosuke!!) during the Meiji and donated money for hospital construction (was his family wealthy or was he just donating from his salary? I've never heard anything about what his and Itou's background was).  To jump ahead a little in the quote, are they saying he became the Chief of Police for some place called Tsuruoka?<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but that second sentence throws me completely.  Well, actually, first of all --- uh, how did he survive the massacre of the Sekihoutai????  I wonder if it was just Sagara, as founder of the Sekihoutai, who was prosecuted and executed and Watsuki destroyed them all for literary effect.  Argh... the need to *know* is going to kill me!!  But this:  "In new selection group vengeance you had run about, but without being able to carry out it received the restoration" --- any clues anyone??  Is restoration referring to finding a direction in life again (by finding a place in the police) OR are they saying that after failing in his attempt at vengeance against the Shinsengumi, he was reconciled to be able to accept possibly working with other former Shinsengumi members who had also become police (though I can't EVER see him being able to stomach Saitou, which may have been an interesting dilemma for Kawaji)?  Or a combination of both concepts maybe?  <br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I know the time is referred to as Restoration, but I don't think that's what was meant here.  Maybe it is referring to that ("received the restoration, was Meiji"), but even that doesn't help, especially regarding his stint in the Sekihoutai.  Maybe it means that he was aimless after the assassination of his brother, found a cause by fighting at Toba-Fushimi and joining the Sekihoutai, then after the Sekihoutai debacle he was reconciled to the Meiji Restoration (i.e. they "forgave" him being Sekihoutai like they "forgave" former Shinsengumi and Aizu samurai and accepted them into the police force)?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>After that rest of life you sent with Ishioka of the hometown and 1919, lived to 83 years old.<<<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so he dies in 1919 at age 83 (wahoo!!!  Now I know... he's older than Sagara, who was born in 1839).  But what is "sent with Ishioka of the hometown"?<br/>
<br/>
Masayoshi and Serizawa Kamo, could one of you **PLEASE** look at it and straighten some of this out?  We have so little info on Suzuki... he deserves a little bit of TLC in the face of all the attention so many other captains get.  :-D  This humble Sekihoutai fan would love to know more, too.<br/>
phil (whose mind is now running like it's on speed!  Gee, thanks, for yet ANOTHER story idea, Tiff!!)<br/>

<br/>
***yeah, talk about confusing...the reason why I don't think he became<br/>
Chief of Police is because on other sites about Saitou the webmasters<br/>
will always mention their direct superiors so like in Saitou's case<br/>
the Kawajii's babelfish name always comes up.  But who knows...maybe<br/>
he changed his name to Tsuruoka?!?  There is plenty of stuff on Itou<br/>
in Japanese but his bio is the most garbled so I never bothered to<br/>
post links.<br/>

***no,no,no I think Suzuki tried to seek revenge but failed to do so<br/>
and had to accept THE restoration of the emperor and new polticial<br/>
order.  I think the establishment of the modern police dept was quiete<br/>
extensive because we have info of which ward/region/dept Saitou was<br/>
assigned to...I'm sure everyone was scattered about although you never<br/>
know about those kenjutsu tournaments because in that bit of info<br/>
Saitou's opponent's dept was listed...fanfic possibility that one of<br/>
the 2 of Saitou's opponents was Suzuki under another name:)<br/>

terms of the Shinsengumi's activities Saitou was really involved and<br/>
he was kind of famous...while Suzuki's name doesn't turn up that much<br/>
so perhaps the police dept. didn't realize his background?<br/>

<br/>
When Miki returns to Edo, Toudou Heisuke from the<br/>
Shinsengumi invites him to join the Shinsengumi. In<br/>
the 1st year of the Genji Era, he joins the<br/>
Shinsengumi, along with his elder brother.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, both change their names: the elder<br/>
brother names himself as Kashitarou and the younger<br/>
brother as Mikisaburou.<br/>
<br/>
He was the Captain of the 9th Division and was also<br/>
involved in the Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Having the fief of Satsuma as their supporter, he<br/>
becomes a Kinri Goryo Eji.<br/>
<br/>
After the murder of his elder brother, on November<br/>
18th, he stays at the fief house of Satsuma, planning<br/>
the murder of Kondou.<br/>
<br/>
On December 9th, he is one of the people who shoots<br/>
Kondou while Kondou was walking at Sumizome, in Kyoto,<br/>
but they manage only to wound Kondou, without killing<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
After taking part in the War of Toba and Fushimi, he<br/>
became the Captain of the 2nd Division of the<br/>
Sekihoutai.<br/>
<br/>
He tried many things to exact revenge upon the<br/>
Shinsengumi, but he found himself in the new era<br/>
without fulfilling his wishes.<br/>
<br/>
He became a policeman in the Meiji Era, and when he<br/>
was an Officer at the Tsuruoka police, he spent all<br/>
his money to build a hospital (hospitals?)<br/>
<br/>
After that, he spent the rest of his life in Ishioka,<br/>
his homeland, living till the 8th year of the Taisho<br/>
Era, dying at the age of 83.<br/>

 <br/>
Thank you *SO* much!!!  If only we had a way of paying you & Masayoshi a salary just to sit back, drink tea and translate Japanese sites for us!  :-D  I shudder to think of all the things we'd have to be able to contemplate on.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>also involved in the Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was Saitou also considered part of Intelligence?  (Not asking you directly, SK, but anyone who knows.)  I think I'm becoming hung up on this idea that maybe he & Suzuki associated with each other in Kyoto (it's the drinking thing, which I could still be misinterpreting from the babelfish translation) and could've been a reason why Saitou seems to have been accepted so readily within Itou's group.  Not that they necessarily would've questioned *anyone's* decision to leave, even with Saitou's loyalty to Hijikata, since I get a sense that Itou left on somewhat "friendly?" terms with Kondou and there were plenty of defections, but it just still seems so strange no one suspected Saitou.  And, of course, Saitou could've used any one of a number of excuses to explain why he would want to exit the Shinsengumi.  But still...<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>He tried many things to exact revenge upon the<br/>

without fulfilling his wishes.<<<br/>
 <br/>
RK fanfic fodder if I ever saw it!!!  ;-D  Just when I thought SaiSa couldn't get any more "angstier" than it already is...  I've already made the decision to make Suzuki part of my story "Yasou," but I haven't quite decided how yet.  I'm also not sure I'm capable of doing justice to a confrontation between Saitou and Suzuki... so much potential emotional power even *without* considering Sano's friendship towards both men.  Suzuki has so much more reason to hate Saitou and want his blood than Kenshin ever had.<br/>
 <br/>
SK (or anyone), if you have any more information on why Itou left, what his arguments with Kondou were, I'd love to know for scholarly and writerly reasons.  With many thanks in advance.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>That's more or less what the fishy part says...<<<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote><snort>  the fishy part...  Great line, SK!<br/>
 <br/>
SK or Masayoshi, sometime could you give us the rest of the story from that site, the info on him before he joined the Shinsengumi?  So much reference to private schools, the family, and what sounds like his adoption into another family...<br/>
