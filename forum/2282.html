<h3>I guess this would be my introduction for you all.</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197854360">1) I hate my real name. My s/n is Akaiken hogo which roughly <br/>
means "red sword that defends" in japanese<br/>
<br/>
2) when I first heard of the shinsengumi, it was from my friends <br/>
talking about ruroni Kenshin, then I read an article about <br/>
peacemaker and started watching the DVDs<br/>
<br/>
3) I dunno if I have a fave shinsengumi member, I don't really know <br/>
that much about them all to choose.<br/>
<br/>
4) as I said Ive seen dvds 1-3 of peacemaker, and I saw the samurai <br/>
X movie,which has saito, but it takes place after the revolution.<br/>
<br/>
5) I don't have a favorite quite yet, so I wouldn't know.<br/>
6) Not really.<br/>
