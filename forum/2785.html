<div id="ygrps-yiv-852200501">If Itou Kashitarou had a son.....<br/>
<br/>
What would he be like? That's the thing I wondered when we began our<br/>
A/U rpg Far Frontier and that ended up spawning a series of original<br/>
yaoi novels co written with my friend & rp partner in crime Anne Cain.<br/>
<br/>
And since our "bad bad boy" Toshiro Itou is very much his "father's"<br/>
son, we thought we'd do a fanfic contest featuring daddy Itou. ^_^<br/>
<br/>
It can be fluffy or angsty, het or slash, sweet or sexy. ^_^ <br/>
<br/>
Your Itou/other character(s) can be from any universe the Shinsengumi<br/>
are in NHK/RK/PMK/ Assorted Movies. <br/>
<br/>
The length should be 1,0001,500 words<br/>
<br/>
The deadlinelet's make it easy to rememberJuly 4, 2006<br/>
<br/>
The prizeoh yes there is a prize  A copy of The Dragon's Disciple the<br/>
new illustrated yaoi novel featuring the fictional Toshiro Itou by<br/>
Barbara Sheridan and Anne Cain . <br/>
<br/>
