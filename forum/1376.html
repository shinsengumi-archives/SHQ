folder: Seinan+TMPD+FrenchPolice<br/>
file: "seinanwarmaps.pdf"  (PDF files + Library citation)<br/>
size: 53 MB!!!! why?  Because the maps are color coded and I used <br/>
the web pallet thing...we are talking about a bit over 50 maps <br/>
people ^_^<br/>
<br/>
*The book does not have an isbn you can't just order a collection of <br/>
these war maps anywhere...<br/>
<br/>
Book...<br/>
Shinpen Seinan Senshi Fuzushu<br/>
1977<br/>
<br/>
*please get the free adobe acrobat reader because pdf files allow <br/>
you to zoom in on text, images and it keeps everything nice and neat<br/>
<br/>
*I scanned the book backwards because I thought it would be like <br/>
most Japanese books...wrong...so the first maps you see will take <br/>
place near the [end] of the war amongst hills and mountain passes <br/>
(recall the newspaper article which mentions Fujita Goro)...as you <br/>
progress towards the beginning of the war you will see how all the <br/>
fighting was around more populated/urban areas (this is why the <br/>
government ended up burning people's homes...more on that in the <br/>
report)...to get a good general overview go to map #3 (the maps are <br/>
numbered do not use the numbering system in the pdf file---use the <br/>
numbers the author actually wrote ON the maps)</div>
