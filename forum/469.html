<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060588730">Sorry if this is highly off topic. Don't worry I won't post something <br/>
like this anytime soon... BUT...<br/>
<br/>
Since I love this group so much (got so much info from you guys) and <br/>
partly because I'd feel bad if no one used my account (no dsl), I <br/>
thought I'd let you guys know that for a couple of days I'll have <br/>
those hosted at <br/>
<br/>
www.streamload.com/green_2<br/>
<br/>
Password is midori<br/>
<br/>
I can't really give anyone summaries as I haven't seen/read most <br/>
these myself. Sorry.. If you recognize a title that is related to the <br/>
group or would be nice to see (please e-mail me). Oh please keep this <br/>
amongst ourselves. Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79594676">"Lone Wolf and Cub" is classic. I don't know too much<br/>
about it, but "Blade of the Immortal" is another one<br/>
probably worth the download from what I have read<br/>
about it in the past.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166138036">First... Thanks for the suggestions...<br/>
<br/>
Next I guess not highly OT anymore... Since I finally got that Burai <br/>
Teaser scanlation and the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker. It's in the <br/>
manga section. There's another manga named Bakumatsu that I added but <br/>
I don't know what it's about.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: I'm probably going to un-host the jdrama section from about <br/>
right now before I go to sleep and will put it back up sometime in <br/>
the afternoon. The only reason for this is I'd like to prioritize <br/>
those people first who wants to download manga since it's smaller <br/>
pieces and faster to download.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254482090">Thank you Wounds for this resource:)<br/>
<br/>
The other title Bakumatsu along with the Burai teaser is at the [end]<br/>
of the manga list.  Be patient with the service...I got server related<br/>
messages saying "x is not available right now etc etc etc" so you may<br/>
be missing a chapter here and there and you will be informed:<br/>
ones which gave me trouble RK, Lone Wolf and Cub, Blade of the<br/>
Immortal, Mononoke Hime (haven't tried Ghost in the Shell).<br/>
<br/>
The Bakumatsu... title is 0_o is yaoi...Okita is basically a young<br/>
teenage girl (in a man's body) who falls for Hijikata and fends off<br/>
advances from the other captains (Saitou included)<br/>
<br/>
Burai however is not yaoi (according to other net resources...I've<br/>
only read the translations and scanlations Wounds has provided)...I<br/>
love Tokio!  Burai Tokio would've been a great addition to the PMK cast!!!<br/>

I paid for the hosting already should last until the 21st... I'm not <br/>
sure if it will last as long as the 21st though, since the server is <br/>
counting the MBs that get downloaded and so far half of it has <br/>
already been used. So it may/may not last till the 21st.  The <br/>
jdrama/jfilms are also back online. I plan to continuously host the <br/>
other "relevant" files though, probably through a different server <br/>
after this one expires.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283381221">Ur welcome...<br/>
<br/>
Oh! I didn't know Bakumatsu was yaoi! Those people who are not <br/>
supposed to be reading yaoi or squeamish, please do not download this <br/>
title or other manga that has yaoi on it. Will fix the name of that <br/>
so that it says "yaoi" somewhere...<br/>
<br/>
100% sure burai is not yaoi.. :O) But hey most of us like yaoi <br/>
anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... I've checked the server, it's telling me all the files are <br/>
online. The only thing I could think of is if someone is currently <br/>
downloading the same file as you are. Other than that I'm stumped. <br/>
Hopefully it's not a whole lot of chapters that are missing. <br/>
<br/>
Well the server is telling me that the MBs for download is half-way <br/>
through so I'm not sure if it will last until the 21st. Those who are <br/>
downloading jdrama/jfilms are taking the most of the MBs so I took <br/>
them out last night. They're back online though so those people can <br/>
continue. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, I plan to host the "relevant" files on a different server <br/>
after this one expires.<br/>
<br/>
That's it for now... Bye...<br/>
