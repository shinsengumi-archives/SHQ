<h3>IN MEMORY OF A GREAT MAN</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-499076076">Well, this is the 25th of April. The day Kondou Isami was executed by <br/>
the Ishin. I think it would be appropriate for everyone to take a <br/>
moment to reflect on this great man&#39;s life. After all, he WAS the <br/>
Commander of the group we&#39;ve all come to love and admire. Without <br/>
him, the Shinsengumi would never have existed. To some he was a <br/>
teacher and a friend. To others he was a leader and a source of <br/>
inspiration. To many he was an enemy not to be taken lightly. But in <br/>
the end he was just a man who never surrendered his ideals and was <br/>
willing to die for what he believed. For that he has my deepest <br/>
respect always.<br/>
<br/>
May your memory never fade from this world, Kondou-sama.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m positive it was the 25th. I&#39;ve double-checked with all the sites <br/>
I know of right off hand (including the www.tamahito.com site) and <br/>
they all agree on that date. However, it should be remembered that <br/>
there was a calender change a couple years later, so all dates are <br/>
actually off from what they should be by about a month. That&#39;s why it <br/>
can get so confusing. Some sites will show the &quot;corrected&quot; date, <br/>
while others will show the date as it was at the time of the <br/>
incident.  <br/>
<br/>
Hm, I don&#39;t have anything to confirm this by right off hand, but I <br/>
think the anniversary of Hijikata&#39;s death is just around the corner <br/>
on May 11th. &gt;_&lt; I&#39;d better hear some nice words for my Hijikata-sama!<br/>
