<h3>Re-intro + misc.</h3>
by <i>jiaxin_nyo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-307972779">First of all, thank you all for the information regarding Yamanami-<br/>
san and his death. =3 It&#39;s very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Second . . . secreatarytocapt3, even if I don&#39;t know you that well, <br/>
I&#39;ll miss you. I&#39;m sure we all will. Good luck on all your continuing <br/>
research and any future projects!<br/>
<br/>
Third (Sorry to cram everything in one post . . . ): Re-intro.<br/>
<br/>
1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you would like us <br/>
to <br/>
know about you)<br/>
Name: Wu Jia-xin (Mandarin; yes, it&#39;s real. No, it&#39;s not really what <br/>
most people call me, but I like it.)<br/>
Nickname/Screen name: if I&#39;m not using my Mandarin name, you will <br/>
find me registered under &quot;Kitsunehime&quot;<br/>
Currently trying to learn Japanese . . . give or take a few months <br/>
(*cough*years*cough*) I may be of help in the field of translation. <br/>
^^;<br/>
<br/>
2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi?<br/>
Well . . . I first came across them from watching RK . . . but I <br/>
never really developed an interest in them until I watched PMK. From <br/>
there . . . it pretty much amounts to an obsession. ^^;<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>
 . . . Okita Souji-san. X3 Because of his (supposedly?) wonderful <br/>
persoality and humor. *ahem*not to mention good looks*ahem* One <br/>
cannot overlook his renowned swordsmanship and somewhat tragic demise <br/>
either.<br/>
Hijikata-san may come in second . . . his resolve regarding the <br/>
Shinsengumi is just amazing.<br/>
<br/>
4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>
Just PMK, RK tv, part of Kaze Hikaru, Soshite Haru no Tsuki, and one <br/>
other manga I can&#39;t quite remember . . . In short, I&#39;m pretty much <br/>
limited to what I can get online. ^^; I tried to rent Mibu Gishi Den <br/>
and Gohatto, but the store didn&#39;t have it . . . TT_TT<br/>
<br/>
5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do <br/>
you <br/>
think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>
I don&#39;t think I can really answer this well . . . I haven&#39;t seen any <br/>
of the live-action versions.<br/>
But I have to say, I love all the PMK portrayals. X3 For example, <br/>
Okita-san . . . is just too cute. I also love how he is portrayed as <br/>
a demon of the sword. Hijikata-san . . . Good looks. X3 Charisma. <br/>
What seems to be a nice person under the gruff exterior he must <br/>
present for the world. The joker trio . . . need I say more? Saitou-<br/>
san . . . can&#39;t even begin to explain with this one. X3<br/>
But the KH incarnations are fun too . . . Okita-san has that same <br/>
cute, almost whimsical personality. Hijikata-san, again, seems to <br/>
have something besides what he wants others to see. Saitou-san . . . <br/>
even if he might not be quite as aesthetically pleasing as other <br/>
version, still kicks a$$.<br/>
<br/>
6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>
particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>
Tetsu and Tatsu were (possible) real people?<br/>
 . . . *mind goes blank* . . . I can&#39;t recall the other one. O.o</div>
