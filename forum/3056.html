<h3>6/10/1867</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533701915">What exactly happened on 6/10/1867? I've found vague references to<br/>
"105 Shinsengumi members [being] "employed" by the Bakufu", but what<br/>
is this refering to, and what did it mean in concrete terms?  I've<br/>
flipped through hillsoborough's book trying to find it, but since I<br/>
don't know what to look for, I haven't had much luck. At first I<br/>
thought it might mean they were given "official" status, but the<br/>
Japanese term used in the Shinsengumi Rekishi Gunzo book is<br/>
"Meshikakae", which seems to mean someone hired for thier martial<br/>
ability, like a mercenary, so that seemed a bit odd, although the<br/>
actual verb means "To make one a vassal/retainer", or to "take one<br/>
into employment" - so I'm trying to figure out exactly what this edict<br/>
or whatever it was... was.  If anyone with Hillsborough's book knows<br/>
what page it is covered on, that would be great too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

 </span></blockquote>No....that's not really it. You can't really talk about "samurai status" as <br/>
a hard and fast rule. In many domains, you had to buy the right of bearing <br/>
swords, but by the 1860s, just the fact that you could have people from ANY <br/>
status join a group like Shinsengumi and carry swords, without (barring <br/>
knowledge to the contrary) needing to buy "samurai" status, shows that just <br/>
by joining Shinsengumi and carrying swords, one could have de facto samurai <br/>
"status". The issue of sword-carrying and name-bearing is a problematic one, <br/>
and yes, even despite the image of four airtight classes, there is no <br/>
ironclad rule, and there are a lot of exceptions. But I'm getting off-topic <br/>
here, so I'll continue with a definition of "bakushin-toritate".<br/>
<br/>
Bakushin-toritate roughly rendered, means "Conferring of the status of <br/>
Shogunal retainers". Shogunal *sanction* they already had-- why else would <br/>
they be included in the myriad of samurai who guarded the rivers that the <br/>
Shogun traversed to get to Kyoto in the early period? (1863-ish-- this is in <br/>
a map Hijikata drew, and included in a letter) Bakushin-toritate means that <br/>
they were now shogunal retainers, just like anyone else who was born into <br/>
that status (e.g. hatamoto like Takenaka Shigekata, and any of the myriad <br/>
gokenin).<br/>
<br/>
It was that status of Tokugawa retainer that allowed, for instance, Kondou <br/>
Isami to meet face-to-face with someone like Nagai Naoyuki, who was a <br/>
high-ranking hatamoto (senior Tokugawa retainer). Nagai started out as <br/>
Kondou's senior in terms of rank, back in early '63, but by late 1867, <br/>
following the aforementioned bakushin-toritate, he could meet with Nagai <br/>
face to face. Nagai, a man  born into a daimyo family and adopted by a <br/>
high-ranking hatamoto, who had been involved with supervising naval training <br/>
in Nagasaki, commanding one of the Shogunate's first Western-style warships, <br/>
and was a wakadoshiyori (junior councilor) and at one time (during <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori's, and later Kondou's, arrival in Kyoto) city magistrate <br/>
of Kyoto, was most definitely WAY above Kondou in terms of birth status. <br/>
However, thanks to this promotion, they were essentially equals in rank.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was obvious that they already had de facto sanction, but thanks for<br/>
clarifying that this was the official "announcement" - What was the<br/>
motivation behind this? I assume the Shogun saw some sort of advantage<br/>
of making them official vassals.  As for the social classes, it looks<br/>
like they got pretty hazy near the end of the Edo period. Thanks for<br/>
the clarifications.</div>

<h3>Mystery of Yamanami&#39;s Origins Solved?!</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367528506">The origins of Yamanami Keisuke are unclear. Several sources record him as <br/>
being the son of "Yamanami, a sword instructor of the Sendai domain". It <br/>
just so happens that I have copies of sections from "Sendai Boshin-shi" <br/>
(written by Fujiwara Ainosuke, published (or more correctly, REpublished) in <br/>
1980) that may have the answer to who his father was.<br/>
<br/>
According to p. 717, which lists all the hereditary sword instructor <br/>
families of the Sendai domain, there is *no* Yamanami. However, at the end <br/>
of the list of instructor families, there is a name that is given-- family <br/>
*and* given name, as though compared to the rest, he was a newcomer.<br/>
<br/>
"Sakurada Keisuke, instructor in Hokushin-ittoryu"<br/>
<br/>
Now, according to the Japanese Wikipedia article on Yamanami, he was <br/>
certified in Ono-ha Ittoryu, and later studied Hokushin-ittoryu under Chiba <br/>
Shusaku. I have no further confirmation of this; however, it is notable that <br/>
"Keisuke" is spelled the same way, and that Yamanami did have training in <br/>
the same style. This is my theory (connected to the comments on his <br/>
name-reading in the Japanese Wikipedia article)-- the family name "Yamanami" <br/>
can also be read "Sannan"-- which, this site elaborates, could be spelled <br/>
one of several ways, one of which reads "Third son".<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, "Keisuke" is a "common name," (I believe the Japanese is <br/>
"tsuumyou") which in some families can be inherited. Case in point-- the <br/>
senior Aizu retainer Saigo Tanomo. There were many men in his ancestry who <br/>
carried the "common name" Tanomo-- his formal name sets him apart from them <br/>
(Chikanori). For those who didn't know, Yamanami's formal name was Tomonobu.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that any potential researchers should be on the lookout for, <br/>
if possible, is if Sakurada Keisuke also claimed descent from the Fujiwara, <br/>
as Yamanami did.<br/>
<br/>
Given this preliminary evidence, it is my belief, and my tentative theory <br/>
about Yamanami-- that it would not be ridiculous at all, if Yamanami was the <br/>
"Sannan"-- third son-- of Sakurada Keisuke, that he inherited the "common <br/>
name" of Keisuke, and that when he left Sendai-- something that was <br/>
tantamount to treason and often necessitated name-changing for the sake of <br/>
safety-- he made a pun on "Sannan", changing the characters that spell that <br/>
sound-- which gives us the "Yamanami" that we know today.<br/>
<br/>
Just a theory, but I believe it to be a not entirely meaningless one.<br/>
<br/>

I just wanted to comment that indeed many social classes were greatly <br/>
blurred in 19th century Japan.  Although on one hand it seemed to be a <br/>
mark of distinction to obtain the samurai status, economically speaking <br/>
many people, including the samurai themselves, knew that the money can <br/>
be found in the purportedly "lower" classes.  For example during the <br/>
Meiji era a survey of families who sent their daughters to a public <br/>
school---across the board claimed samurai descent, but many *before <br/>
1868 had engaged in clearly merchant class businesses (this flies <br/>
against the widespread abhorrance of samurai to engage in such work).  <br/>
By far the most econommically dynamic classes were the upper peasant <br/>
and merchant classes.  What killed the samurai class was their obsolete <br/>
role and drain on the economy---samurai no longer and never did <br/>
produced "anything" unlike the lower classes, although as we now they <br/>
fulfilled critical administrative roles.<br/>

It's really important to note this article<br/>
The Farmers of Edo and the Warriors in Kyoto <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Because the Shinsengumi, for the first time are mentioned in a non-<br/>
warrior context, were right smack in the middle of the social pyramid <br/>
blur---they were close friends/associates/adopted siblings to ELITE <br/>
PEASANTS, WELL EDUCATED PEASANTS.  Thus people like Kondou and Hijikata <br/>
had a deep understanding of what was going on because they valued these <br/>
social relationships and clearly, in no way abandoned their associates <br/>
after attaining that feudal "dream" of samuraihood so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I did pose the question to Mr. Hillsborough of whether or not he would <br/>
address what was going in Tama at the time and if he would discuss in <br/>
depth the social background of these figures.  Specifically, rural Edo <br/>
where many members from the Shinsengumi call home has been studied by <br/>
scholars specifically for all that social blurring.  During the Meiji <br/>
Era that region produced incredibly politically active farmers who <br/>
pushed for *real democratic change and surprisingly opposed some of the <br/>
victors of 1868.  Hillsborough asked if I was a sociology major.  I'm <br/>
not---just a concerned and curious member of his audience, but the <br/>
point was ... it is absolutely important to get into the "mindset" of <br/>
Kondou and Hijikata.  Because they did see things differently, after <br/>
all, travelling from rural Edo to Kyoto was an eye opening <br/>
experience...trying to navigate the capital's bureaucracy must've been <br/>
rather difficult for a bunch of "nobodies".  They were fish out of <br/>
water and treated as such.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not their later success contributed to their "their <br/>
conviction of self-importance and their unyielding will to power" <br/>
(Hillsborough 147) and so forth is a possibility, but a slightly <br/>
difficult abstraction to gauge accurately by any historian.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, lust for power is a universal, human trait, not something <br/>
the Shinsengumi monopolized.<br/>
Hillsborough probably has not studied the aftermath of 1868 in great <br/>
detail.  His heroes are the most shockingly ruthless men to hold and <br/>
maintain, political, social, military and educational power.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's actually something that would necessitate a large monograph to get <br/>
through, since the samurai of each domain, the samurai under the Shogunate, <br/>
and the ronin and quasi-samurai such as doctors and "goshi" were all <br/>
different, had different circumstances, different setup, and so on. For <br/>
instance, many domains operated by a system of paying retainers from the <br/>
rice storehouses and making them live within the castle town or elsewhere in <br/>
terms of important domain/municipal locales, but some, like Sendai, actually <br/>
allowed their men to reside on their own land.<br/>
<br/>
But you're right, a work on the topic would be useful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think a case study approach would work for one domain, and could<br/>
afford to be more focused and detailed than a big general examination.<br/>
 It would be far more manageable and would illustrate the thesis even<br/>
if it wasn't completely generalizable to the entire country, and would<br/>
probably make a valid masters or Phd thesis, sort of like Dr. Luke<br/>
Robert's book "Mercantilism in a Japanese Domain: The Merchant Origins<br/>
of Economic Nationalism in 18th-Century Tosa" - focused on one domain,<br/>
during one period, but used to illustrate the topic. It's actually<br/>
pretty interesting, a combination of history and economics.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Precisely-- 18 February 1844 by the Gregorian calendar ("our"<br/>
calendar). However, the predominant works of scholarship in English<br/>
and Japanese usually operate by lunar date and they call the lunar<br/>
month by the name of the Gregorian calendar month. Also, many Japanese<br/>
sites, even accurate ones, give "1.1.1844" without giving any<br/>
explanation about the nuances of Gregorian vs. Lunar calendar. Hence<br/>
"January 1, 1844". But yes, in the end, you're correct-- 18 February<br/>
1844. Which, coincidentally, is only three days after Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori's birthday (by Gregorian reckoning).<br/>
<br/>
Also, when dealing with dates prior to the changeover of 3 Dec 1872<br/>
(lunar) to 1 January 1873 (Gregorian), in order to avoid confusion, it<br/>
is safer to simply use lunar dates and indicate at the start of one's<br/>
work that they are being used-- as is the common practice amongst many<br/>
prominent Western scholars of Japanese history such as Harold Bolitho,<br/>
Conrad Totman, Frank Chance, Karl Friday, and others.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In this site, there is a discussion whether<br/>
1) Sakurada Sakuramaro, chief kenjutsu instructor of<br/>
Sendai, is Yamanami (Sannan) Keisuke or not<br/>
<br/>
2) The kenjutsu style praticed by Sakurada is Hokushin<br/>
Itto or Chuka Itto (it is written as "Chuwa", but read<br/>
as "Chuka", according to Watatani Kiyoshi - Bugei<br/>
Ryuha Daijiten).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there are records here in Brazil related to one<br/>
of Sakurada Sakuramaro's grandsons. His name was<br/>
Sakurada Matsumaro, and he was alive till some 20<br/>
years ago (he was a friend of my grandfather, who was<br/>
from Aizu). Before WWII, he was one of the kendo<br/>
instructors in Brazil.<br/>
<br/>
According to the records,<br/>
<br/>
1) His grandfather was Sakurada Sakuramaro and he was<br/>
one of the kenjutsu instructors of Sendai. This<br/>
implies that Yamanami Keisuke most probably wasn't<br/>
Sakurada Sakuramaro himself.<br/>
<br/>
2) Their kenjutsu style was Hokushin Itto ryu. This<br/>
implies that either Chuka Itto ryu was abandoned (at<br/>
least its name) or it was something that was passed<br/>
only to the head of the family, which I think it's<br/>
more likely. So, the head (first son) would inherit<br/>
Chuka Itto ryu and all the others would learn Hokushin<br/>
Itto. According to this hypothesis, Yamanami Keisuke<br/>
would have been proficient in Hokushin Itto, not<br/>
Chuka, which  explains why the name Chuka Itto ryu<br/>
isn't associated with Keisuke.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I've never seen Hillsborough's book (yet) but I think he's mixing two <br/>
events. After Ikedaya, the Bakufu offered to give Kondou a position as a <br/>
"yoriki"-- a police inspector. This would have made him a functionary of the <br/>
Bakufu and for all practical purposes, at least a gokenin (2nd-tier vassal) <br/>
if not a hatamoto (direct vassal). He refused at that point. However, a few <br/>
years later when the bakushin-toritate of 1867 happened, he did not refuse-- <br/>
he became a hatamoto, and even became a wakadoshiyori (junior councilor). <br/>
This is, in my opinion, yet another instance of Hillsborough getting very <br/>
cocky with his limited understanding of (a) Shogunal procedure and protocol <br/>
and (b) his confused and confusing narrative, and creating something that, <br/>
while not a lie, is not really the truth, either.<br/>

<br/>
"In October (it doesn't say when, but I assume the month following the<br/>

of the Shinsengumi were invited to officially join the ranks of the<br/>

corps, from Kondo and Hijikata on down, undoubtably and indisputably<br/>
coveted the official ranking within the Tokugawa Hierarchy, Kondo<br/>
refused the offer."<br/>
<br/>
This says right out that they were *all* offered a position, and it<br/>
seems that he is also saying that Kondo unilaterally declined it. He<br/>
goes on to say that this is because he felt that the Shinsengumi had<br/>
not fulfilled all of its objectives because it still had not me the<br/>
goal of removing the foreigners. His included footnote only describes<br/>
hatamoto, but doesn't give any sort of source for the above.</div>

something else.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, I am hardly surprised that he makes a blanket statement like "Although <br/>
the entire corps, from Kondo and Hijikata on down, undoubtably and <br/>
indisputably coveted the official ranking within the Tokugawa Hierarchy, <br/>
Kondo refused the offer." Note the key words there: "...undoubtably and <br/>
indisputably coveted the official ranking..." How can he back this up? Am I <br/>
supposed to take the word of a man who openly considers Shinsengumi no <br/>
better than ravenous dogs? Does he have a journal or record where Kondou <br/>
says "I want this post really really bad"?<br/>
<br/>
"A generous monthly stipend was attached." makes it sound like the Shogunate <br/>
was throwing a side of beef to hungry wolves. If you worked for the Shogun, <br/>
compared to being a poor dojo master, a medicine peddler, or what have you, <br/>
to have a stable stipend (at least on paper) in and of itself was generous. <br/>
Yes, there were retainers of the shogun who were low-ranking and low-paid, <br/>
but Shinsengumi wasn't just any group of people-- if the Shogunate was going <br/>
to take the trouble of retaining them and giving them rank as *hatamoto*, <br/>
which I take as being roughly equivalent in some cases to a cavalry officer <br/>
(I base this conclusion on the hatamoto data in "Edo Machi Bugyo-jiten," by <br/>
Sasama Yoshihiko, ISBN: 978-4760124947), then the stipend *would* be <br/>
"generous". Also, since he doesn't cite his sources I suppose it's pointless <br/>
to ask if he knows what the stipend level was.<br/>
<br/>
"He goes on to say that this is because he felt that the Shinsengumi had not <br/>
fulfilled all of its objectives because it still had not me the goal of <br/>
removing the foreigners..." He gives no sources or footnotes for this one, <br/>
right? The Shinsengumi believed in "sonno-joi," but then again, so did <br/>
(ultimately) people in the Bakufu, as well as Choshu "radicals," and so on. <br/>
However, I would like to see Mr. Hillsborough produce *one* solid piece of <br/>
incontrovertible evidence that Shinsengumi had "removal of foreigners" as an <br/>
objective. Shinsengumi was not formed to drive out foreigners; it did not do <br/>
anything to drive out foreigners in its entire existence, it did not engage <br/>
in slaying foreigners as the assassins serving the "enlightened" Meiji <br/>
rulers of later years did. It even received training from foreigners in <br/>
later years, and following the return to Edo, its uniform, as attested to by <br/>
Ikeda Shichisaburo and quoted in Kikuchi Akira's "Shinsengumi Hyakuichi no <br/>
Nazo" (ISBN 978-4404019981) and "Shinsengumi Jitsuroku" (ISBN <br/>
978-4480056788), was Western-style. Is Mr. Hillsborough weaving fact with <br/>
his own fiction?<br/>
<br/>
The full roster of men-- in fact, a copy of the very same bakushin-toritate <br/>
order-- who accepted Bakushin-toritate (it's been awhile since I looked at <br/>
it, but I believe that 105 is the number of the Shinsengumi who accepted, <br/>
while a handful rejected it, captured, and were made to commit suicide in <br/>
the Aizu offices) appears in "Shinsengumi Seishi," by Tsuri Yoichi <br/>
(Published by Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1998, ISBN 978-4404025708). Kondou is <br/>
on it, Hijikata is on it, and others....now I just have to be sure to make <br/>
scans next time I go to the nearest library that has it, so you can all see.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That clears up a lot.  My interpretation of the book so far is that<br/>
the "expulsion of foreigners" was way up on the shinsengumi "to do"<br/>
list according to hillsborough.  As for the 105 - now I get it - there<br/>
were only 105 members (aside from the ones who declined or fled) - I<br/>
was thinking that only a percentage were chosen. And I'd LOVE to see<br/>
the list. UH might have the book, but I don't know when I'll be<br/>
getting up there again, probably not for a few weeks anyway.</div>
