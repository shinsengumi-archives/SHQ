<h3>6/10/1867</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533701915">What exactly happened on 6/10/1867? I&#39;ve found vague references to<br/>
&quot;105 Shinsengumi members [being] &quot;employed&quot; by the Bakufu&quot;, but what<br/>
is this refering to, and what did it mean in concrete terms?  I&#39;ve<br/>
flipped through hillsoborough&#39;s book trying to find it, but since I<br/>
don&#39;t know what to look for, I haven&#39;t had much luck. At first I<br/>
thought it might mean they were given &quot;official&quot; status, but the<br/>
Japanese term used in the Shinsengumi Rekishi Gunzo book is<br/>
&quot;Meshikakae&quot;, which seems to mean someone hired for thier martial<br/>
ability, like a mercenary, so that seemed a bit odd, although the<br/>
actual verb means &quot;To make one a vassal/retainer&quot;, or to &quot;take one<br/>
into employment&quot; - so I&#39;m trying to figure out exactly what this edict<br/>
or whatever it was... was.  If anyone with Hillsborough&#39;s book knows<br/>
what page it is covered on, that would be great too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

 </span></blockquote>No....that&#39;s not really it. You can&#39;t really talk about &quot;samurai status&quot; as <br/>
a hard and fast rule. In many domains, you had to buy the right of bearing <br/>
swords, but by the 1860s, just the fact that you could have people from ANY <br/>
status join a group like Shinsengumi and carry swords, without (barring <br/>
knowledge to the contrary) needing to buy &quot;samurai&quot; status, shows that just <br/>
by joining Shinsengumi and carrying swords, one could have de facto samurai <br/>
&quot;status&quot;. The issue of sword-carrying and name-bearing is a problematic one, <br/>
and yes, even despite the image of four airtight classes, there is no <br/>
ironclad rule, and there are a lot of exceptions. But I&#39;m getting off-topic <br/>
here, so I&#39;ll continue with a definition of &quot;bakushin-toritate&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Bakushin-toritate roughly rendered, means &quot;Conferring of the status of <br/>
Shogunal retainers&quot;. Shogunal *sanction* they already had-- why else would <br/>
they be included in the myriad of samurai who guarded the rivers that the <br/>
Shogun traversed to get to Kyoto in the early period? (1863-ish-- this is in <br/>
a map Hijikata drew, and included in a letter) Bakushin-toritate means that <br/>
they were now shogunal retainers, just like anyone else who was born into <br/>
that status (e.g. hatamoto like Takenaka Shigekata, and any of the myriad <br/>
gokenin).<br/>
<br/>
It was that status of Tokugawa retainer that allowed, for instance, Kondou <br/>
Isami to meet face-to-face with someone like Nagai Naoyuki, who was a <br/>
high-ranking hatamoto (senior Tokugawa retainer). Nagai started out as <br/>
Kondou&#39;s senior in terms of rank, back in early &#39;63, but by late 1867, <br/>
following the aforementioned bakushin-toritate, he could meet with Nagai <br/>
face to face. Nagai, a man  born into a daimyo family and adopted by a <br/>
high-ranking hatamoto, who had been involved with supervising naval training <br/>
in Nagasaki, commanding one of the Shogunate&#39;s first Western-style warships, <br/>
and was a wakadoshiyori (junior councilor) and at one time (during <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s, and later Kondou&#39;s, arrival in Kyoto) city magistrate <br/>
of Kyoto, was most definitely WAY above Kondou in terms of birth status. <br/>
However, thanks to this promotion, they were essentially equals in rank.<br/>

<h3>Mystery of Yamanami&#39;s Origins Solved?!</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367528506">The origins of Yamanami Keisuke are unclear. Several sources record him as <br/>
being the son of &quot;Yamanami, a sword instructor of the Sendai domain&quot;. It <br/>
just so happens that I have copies of sections from &quot;Sendai Boshin-shi&quot; <br/>
(written by Fujiwara Ainosuke, published (or more correctly, REpublished) in <br/>
1980) that may have the answer to who his father was.<br/>
<br/>
According to p. 717, which lists all the hereditary sword instructor <br/>
families of the Sendai domain, there is *no* Yamanami. However, at the end <br/>
of the list of instructor families, there is a name that is given-- family <br/>
*and* given name, as though compared to the rest, he was a newcomer.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sakurada Keisuke, instructor in Hokushin-ittoryu&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, according to the Japanese Wikipedia article on Yamanami, he was <br/>
certified in Ono-ha Ittoryu, and later studied Hokushin-ittoryu under Chiba <br/>
Shusaku. I have no further confirmation of this; however, it is notable that <br/>
&quot;Keisuke&quot; is spelled the same way, and that Yamanami did have training in <br/>
the same style. This is my theory (connected to the comments on his <br/>
name-reading in the Japanese Wikipedia article)-- the family name &quot;Yamanami&quot; <br/>
can also be read &quot;Sannan&quot;-- which, this site elaborates, could be spelled <br/>
one of several ways, one of which reads &quot;Third son&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, &quot;Keisuke&quot; is a &quot;common name,&quot; (I believe the Japanese is <br/>
&quot;tsuumyou&quot;) which in some families can be inherited. Case in point-- the <br/>
senior Aizu retainer Saigo Tanomo. There were many men in his ancestry who <br/>
carried the &quot;common name&quot; Tanomo-- his formal name sets him apart from them <br/>
(Chikanori). For those who didn&#39;t know, Yamanami&#39;s formal name was Tomonobu.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that any potential researchers should be on the lookout for, <br/>
if possible, is if Sakurada Keisuke also claimed descent from the Fujiwara, <br/>
as Yamanami did.<br/>
<br/>
Given this preliminary evidence, it is my belief, and my tentative theory <br/>
about Yamanami-- that it would not be ridiculous at all, if Yamanami was the <br/>
&quot;Sannan&quot;-- third son-- of Sakurada Keisuke, that he inherited the &quot;common <br/>
name&quot; of Keisuke, and that when he left Sendai-- something that was <br/>
tantamount to treason and often necessitated name-changing for the sake of <br/>
safety-- he made a pun on &quot;Sannan&quot;, changing the characters that spell that <br/>
sound-- which gives us the &quot;Yamanami&quot; that we know today.<br/>
<br/>
Just a theory, but I believe it to be a not entirely meaningless one.<br/>
<br/>

I just wanted to comment that indeed many social classes were greatly <br/>
blurred in 19th century Japan.  Although on one hand it seemed to be a <br/>
mark of distinction to obtain the samurai status, economically speaking <br/>
many people, including the samurai themselves, knew that the money can <br/>
be found in the purportedly &quot;lower&quot; classes.  For example during the <br/>
Meiji era a survey of families who sent their daughters to a public <br/>
school---across the board claimed samurai descent, but many *before <br/>
1868 had engaged in clearly merchant class businesses (this flies <br/>
against the widespread abhorrance of samurai to engage in such work).  <br/>
By far the most econommically dynamic classes were the upper peasant <br/>
and merchant classes.  What killed the samurai class was their obsolete <br/>
role and drain on the economy---samurai no longer and never did <br/>
produced &quot;anything&quot; unlike the lower classes, although as we now they <br/>
fulfilled critical administrative roles.<br/>

It&#39;s really important to note this article<br/>
The Farmers of Edo and the Warriors in Kyoto <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Because the Shinsengumi, for the first time are mentioned in a non-<br/>
warrior context, were right smack in the middle of the social pyramid <br/>
blur---they were close friends/associates/adopted siblings to ELITE <br/>
PEASANTS, WELL EDUCATED PEASANTS.  Thus people like Kondou and Hijikata <br/>
had a deep understanding of what was going on because they valued these <br/>
social relationships and clearly, in no way abandoned their associates <br/>
after attaining that feudal &quot;dream&quot; of samuraihood so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I did pose the question to Mr. Hillsborough of whether or not he would <br/>
address what was going in Tama at the time and if he would discuss in <br/>
depth the social background of these figures.  Specifically, rural Edo <br/>
where many members from the Shinsengumi call home has been studied by <br/>
scholars specifically for all that social blurring.  During the Meiji <br/>
Era that region produced incredibly politically active farmers who <br/>
pushed for *real democratic change and surprisingly opposed some of the <br/>
victors of 1868.  Hillsborough asked if I was a sociology major.  I&#39;m <br/>
not---just a concerned and curious member of his audience, but the <br/>
point was ... it is absolutely important to get into the &quot;mindset&quot; of <br/>
Kondou and Hijikata.  Because they did see things differently, after <br/>
all, travelling from rural Edo to Kyoto was an eye opening <br/>
experience...trying to navigate the capital&#39;s bureaucracy must&#39;ve been <br/>
rather difficult for a bunch of &quot;nobodies&quot;.  They were fish out of <br/>
water and treated as such.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not their later success contributed to their &quot;their <br/>
conviction of self-importance and their unyielding will to power&quot; <br/>
(Hillsborough 147) and so forth is a possibility, but a slightly <br/>
difficult abstraction to gauge accurately by any historian.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, lust for power is a universal, human trait, not something <br/>
the Shinsengumi monopolized.<br/>
Hillsborough probably has not studied the aftermath of 1868 in great <br/>
detail.  His heroes are the most shockingly ruthless men to hold and <br/>
maintain, political, social, military and educational power.<br/>

&gt; Because the Shinsengumi, for the first time are mentioned in a non-<br/>
&gt; warrior context, were right smack in the middle of the social pyramid <br/>
&gt; blur---they were close friends/associates/adopted siblings to ELITE <br/>
&gt; PEASANTS, WELL EDUCATED PEASANTS.  Thus people like Kondou and Hijikata <br/>
&gt; had a deep understanding of what was going on because they valued these <br/>
&gt; social relationships and clearly, in no way abandoned their associates <br/>
&gt; after attaining that feudal &quot;dream&quot; of samuraihood so to speak.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did pose the question to Mr. Hillsborough of whether or not he would <br/>
&gt; address what was going in Tama at the time and if he would discuss in <br/>
&gt; depth the social background of these figures.  Specifically, rural Edo <br/>
&gt; where many members from the Shinsengumi call home has been studied by <br/>
&gt; scholars specifically for all that social blurring.  During the Meiji <br/>
&gt; Era that region produced incredibly politically active farmers who <br/>
&gt; pushed for *real democratic change and surprisingly opposed some of the <br/>
&gt; victors of 1868.  Hillsborough asked if I was a sociology major.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; not---just a concerned and curious member of his audience, but the <br/>
&gt; point was ... it is absolutely important to get into the &quot;mindset&quot; of <br/>
&gt; Kondou and Hijikata.  Because they did see things differently, after <br/>
&gt; all, travelling from rural Edo to Kyoto was an eye opening <br/>
&gt; experience...trying to navigate the capital&#39;s bureaucracy must&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; rather difficult for a bunch of &quot;nobodies&quot;.  They were fish out of <br/>
&gt; water and treated as such.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whether or not their later success contributed to their &quot;their <br/>
&gt; conviction of self-importance and their unyielding will to power&quot; <br/>
&gt; (Hillsborough 147) and so forth is a possibility, but a slightly <br/>
&gt; difficult abstraction to gauge accurately by any historian.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then again, lust for power is a universal, human trait, not something <br/>
&gt; the Shinsengumi monopolized.<br/>
&gt; Hillsborough probably has not studied the aftermath of 1868 in great <br/>
&gt; detail.  His heroes are the most shockingly ruthless men to hold and <br/>
&gt; maintain, political, social, military and educational power.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just wanted to comment that indeed many social classes were greatly <br/>
&gt; &gt; blurred in 19th century Japan.  Although on one hand it seemed to be a <br/>
&gt; &gt; mark of distinction to obtain the samurai status, economically speaking <br/>
&gt; &gt; many people, including the samurai themselves, knew that the money can <br/>
&gt; &gt; be found in the purportedly &quot;lower&quot; classes.  For example during the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Meiji era a survey of families who sent their daughters to a public <br/>
&gt; &gt; school---across the board claimed samurai descent, but many *before <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1868 had engaged in clearly merchant class businesses (this flies <br/>
&gt; &gt; against the widespread abhorrance of samurai to engage in such work).  <br/>
&gt; &gt; By far the most econommically dynamic classes were the upper peasant <br/>
&gt; &gt; and merchant classes.  What killed the samurai class was their obsolete <br/>
&gt; &gt; role and drain on the economy---samurai no longer and never did <br/>
&gt; &gt; produced &quot;anything&quot; unlike the lower classes, although as we now they <br/>
&gt; &gt; fulfilled critical administrative roles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278136348"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just a reminder, Saitou was born on February 18, 1844...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Precisely-- 18 February 1844 by the Gregorian calendar (&quot;our&quot;<br/>
calendar). However, the predominant works of scholarship in English<br/>
and Japanese usually operate by lunar date and they call the lunar<br/>
month by the name of the Gregorian calendar month. Also, many Japanese<br/>
sites, even accurate ones, give &quot;1.1.1844&quot; without giving any<br/>
explanation about the nuances of Gregorian vs. Lunar calendar. Hence<br/>
&quot;January 1, 1844&quot;. But yes, in the end, you&#39;re correct-- 18 February<br/>
1844. Which, coincidentally, is only three days after Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori&#39;s birthday (by Gregorian reckoning).<br/>
<br/>
Also, when dealing with dates prior to the changeover of 3 Dec 1872<br/>
(lunar) to 1 January 1873 (Gregorian), in order to avoid confusion, it<br/>
is safer to simply use lunar dates and indicate at the start of one&#39;s<br/>
work that they are being used-- as is the common practice amongst many<br/>
prominent Western scholars of Japanese history such as Harold Bolitho,<br/>
Conrad Totman, Frank Chance, Karl Friday, and others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In this site, there is a discussion whether<br/>
1) Sakurada Sakuramaro, chief kenjutsu instructor of<br/>
Sendai, is Yamanami (Sannan) Keisuke or not<br/>
<br/>
2) The kenjutsu style praticed by Sakurada is Hokushin<br/>
Itto or Chuka Itto (it is written as &quot;Chuwa&quot;, but read<br/>
as &quot;Chuka&quot;, according to Watatani Kiyoshi - Bugei<br/>
Ryuha Daijiten).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there are records here in Brazil related to one<br/>
of Sakurada Sakuramaro&#39;s grandsons. His name was<br/>
Sakurada Matsumaro, and he was alive till some 20<br/>
years ago (he was a friend of my grandfather, who was<br/>
from Aizu). Before WWII, he was one of the kendo<br/>
instructors in Brazil.<br/>
<br/>
According to the records,<br/>
<br/>
1) His grandfather was Sakurada Sakuramaro and he was<br/>
one of the kenjutsu instructors of Sendai. This<br/>
implies that Yamanami Keisuke most probably wasn&#39;t<br/>
Sakurada Sakuramaro himself.<br/>
<br/>
2) Their kenjutsu style was Hokushin Itto ryu. This<br/>
implies that either Chuka Itto ryu was abandoned (at<br/>
least its name) or it was something that was passed<br/>
only to the head of the family, which I think it&#39;s<br/>
more likely. So, the head (first son) would inherit<br/>
Chuka Itto ryu and all the others would learn Hokushin<br/>
Itto. According to this hypothesis, Yamanami Keisuke<br/>
would have been proficient in Hokushin Itto, not<br/>
Chuka, which  explains why the name Chuka Itto ryu<br/>
isn&#39;t associated with Keisuke.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is the quote - tell me what you make of it:<br/>
<br/>
(P. 63)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In October (it doesn&#39;t say when, but I assume the month following the<br/>
execution of Serizawa Kamo) in recognition of thier loyalty, the Roshi<br/>
of the Shinsengumi were invited to officially join the ranks of the<br/>
hatamoto, the so-called eighty thousand knights of the Tokugawa<br/>
Shogun.  A generous monthly stipend was attached.  Although the entire<br/>
corps, from Kondo and Hijikata on down, undoubtably and indisputably<br/>
coveted the official ranking within the Tokugawa Hierarchy, Kondo<br/>
refused the offer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This says right out that they were *all* offered a position, and it<br/>
seems that he is also saying that Kondo unilaterally declined it. He<br/>
goes on to say that this is because he felt that the Shinsengumi had<br/>
not fulfilled all of its objectives because it still had not me the<br/>
goal of removing the foreigners. His included footnote only describes<br/>
hatamoto, but doesn&#39;t give any sort of source for the above.</div>

&gt; This is as an aside, but I&#39;m pretty sure that the book &quot;Blood and<br/>
&gt; Makoto etc.&quot; states that only 105 members were included in the<br/>
&gt; bakushin toritate. I don&#39;t have it on hand at the moment - but, was<br/>
&gt; this so, and/or what was the 105 referring to? I&#39;ll find the actual<br/>

members. 105 seems like an arbitrary number, unless there was some<br/>
method for choosing them. Or, if it was all members, and this 105 is<br/>
something else.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252197810"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Here is the quote - tell me what you make of it:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(P. 63)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;In October (it doesn&#39;t say when, but I assume the month following the<br/>
&gt;execution of Serizawa Kamo) in recognition of thier loyalty, the Roshi<br/>
&gt;of the Shinsengumi were invited to officially join the ranks of the<br/>
&gt;hatamoto, the so-called eighty thousand knights of the Tokugawa<br/>
&gt;Shogun.  A generous monthly stipend was attached.  Although the entire<br/>
&gt;corps, from Kondo and Hijikata on down, undoubtably and indisputably<br/>
&gt;coveted the official ranking within the Tokugawa Hierarchy, Kondo<br/>
&gt;refused the offer.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simple. I don&#39;t have my text resources on me, but according to the <br/>
biographies of THIS site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bakusin.com/taishi10.html">http://www.bakusin.com/taishi10.html</a> (which I can <br/>
vouch for as being unbelievably thorough and accurate-- checks out with <br/>
pretty much all the texts I&#39;ve seen) the Bakushin-toritate that they DID <br/>
accept was in the 6th month of Keio 3. What Hillsborough probably refers to <br/>
is another occasion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This says right out that they were *all* offered a position, and it<br/>
&gt;seems that he is also saying that Kondo unilaterally declined it. He<br/>
&gt;goes on to say that this is because he felt that the Shinsengumi had<br/>
&gt;not fulfilled all of its objectives because it still had not me the<br/>
&gt;goal of removing the foreigners. His included footnote only describes<br/>
&gt;hatamoto, but doesn&#39;t give any sort of source for the above.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, I am hardly surprised that he makes a blanket statement like &quot;Although <br/>
the entire corps, from Kondo and Hijikata on down, undoubtably and <br/>
indisputably coveted the official ranking within the Tokugawa Hierarchy, <br/>
Kondo refused the offer.&quot; Note the key words there: &quot;...undoubtably and <br/>
indisputably coveted the official ranking...&quot; How can he back this up? Am I <br/>
supposed to take the word of a man who openly considers Shinsengumi no <br/>
better than ravenous dogs? Does he have a journal or record where Kondou <br/>
says &quot;I want this post really really bad&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A generous monthly stipend was attached.&quot; makes it sound like the Shogunate <br/>
was throwing a side of beef to hungry wolves. If you worked for the Shogun, <br/>
compared to being a poor dojo master, a medicine peddler, or what have you, <br/>
to have a stable stipend (at least on paper) in and of itself was generous. <br/>
Yes, there were retainers of the shogun who were low-ranking and low-paid, <br/>
but Shinsengumi wasn&#39;t just any group of people-- if the Shogunate was going <br/>
to take the trouble of retaining them and giving them rank as *hatamoto*, <br/>
which I take as being roughly equivalent in some cases to a cavalry officer <br/>
(I base this conclusion on the hatamoto data in &quot;Edo Machi Bugyo-jiten,&quot; by <br/>
Sasama Yoshihiko, ISBN: 978-4760124947), then the stipend *would* be <br/>
&quot;generous&quot;. Also, since he doesn&#39;t cite his sources I suppose it&#39;s pointless <br/>
to ask if he knows what the stipend level was.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He goes on to say that this is because he felt that the Shinsengumi had not <br/>
fulfilled all of its objectives because it still had not me the goal of <br/>
removing the foreigners...&quot; He gives no sources or footnotes for this one, <br/>
right? The Shinsengumi believed in &quot;sonno-joi,&quot; but then again, so did <br/>
(ultimately) people in the Bakufu, as well as Choshu &quot;radicals,&quot; and so on. <br/>
However, I would like to see Mr. Hillsborough produce *one* solid piece of <br/>
incontrovertible evidence that Shinsengumi had &quot;removal of foreigners&quot; as an <br/>
objective. Shinsengumi was not formed to drive out foreigners; it did not do <br/>
anything to drive out foreigners in its entire existence, it did not engage <br/>
in slaying foreigners as the assassins serving the &quot;enlightened&quot; Meiji <br/>
rulers of later years did. It even received training from foreigners in <br/>
later years, and following the return to Edo, its uniform, as attested to by <br/>
Ikeda Shichisaburo and quoted in Kikuchi Akira&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi Hyakuichi no <br/>
Nazo&quot; (ISBN 978-4404019981) and &quot;Shinsengumi Jitsuroku&quot; (ISBN <br/>
978-4480056788), was Western-style. Is Mr. Hillsborough weaving fact with <br/>
his own fiction?<br/>
<br/>
The full roster of men-- in fact, a copy of the very same bakushin-toritate <br/>
order-- who accepted Bakushin-toritate (it&#39;s been awhile since I looked at <br/>
it, but I believe that 105 is the number of the Shinsengumi who accepted, <br/>
while a handful rejected it, captured, and were made to commit suicide in <br/>
the Aizu offices) appears in &quot;Shinsengumi Seishi,&quot; by Tsuri Yoichi <br/>
(Published by Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1998, ISBN 978-4404025708). Kondou is <br/>
on it, Hijikata is on it, and others....now I just have to be sure to make <br/>
scans next time I go to the nearest library that has it, so you can all see.<br/>
