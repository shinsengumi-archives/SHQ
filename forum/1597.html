<h3>Shinsengumi manga?</h3>
by <i>enma_o</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110917975">Hi!<br/>
 <br/>
Looking back through the archives, there was someone who posted about how they&#39;d found some Shinsengumi manga (Burai and Kaze Hikaru, and also IIRC some yaoi one called Bakumatsu) on IRC. I also think they were sharing them over Streamload at some point.<br/>
 <br/>
Is there anyone who has these and would be willing to share them? Or at least point out where I can find them? <br/>
 <br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Linda/enma-ou the manga fanatic<br/>

use the password &quot;makoto&quot; for Kaze Hikaru and all files<br/>
<br/>
also download rare paintings and woodcuts dealing with the Seinan <br/>
War...as far as I know these pics cannot be found anywhere online <br/>
(PDF format all these pics are from library books)...also got a <br/>
different pic of Toshiyoshi/Toshinaga Kawaji<br/>
