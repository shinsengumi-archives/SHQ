<h3>Shinsengumi manga?</h3>
by <i>enma_o</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110917975">Hi!<br/>
 <br/>
Looking back through the archives, there was someone who posted about how they'd found some Shinsengumi manga (Burai and Kaze Hikaru, and also IIRC some yaoi one called Bakumatsu) on IRC. I also think they were sharing them over Streamload at some point.<br/>
 <br/>
Is there anyone who has these and would be willing to share them? Or at least point out where I can find them? <br/>
 <br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Linda/enma-ou the manga fanatic<br/>

<br/>
also download rare paintings and woodcuts dealing with the Seinan <br/>
War...as far as I know these pics cannot be found anywhere online <br/>
(PDF format all these pics are from library books)...also got a <br/>
different pic of Toshiyoshi/Toshinaga Kawaji<br/>
