<div id="ygrps-yiv-542438472">They have already moved the Shinsengumi site to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/shinsen_gumi/">http://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/shinsen_gumi/</a><br/>
and the former address is linked to &quot;Yoshitsune&quot; (Hero of the next year <br/>
indeed) one now.<br/>
So they are still keeping our hero&#39;s site and there is no reason to get <br/>
up a panic. (or it&#39;s only me who has been panicked?)<br/>
<br/>
As for the saving flash, there is a free and practical one here,<br/>

called FLASH MANIA, but the problem is this one has only Japanese <br/>
language explanation.<br/>
<br/>
However, I try to put some explanation as this one is quite simple to use.<br/>
At first you put the link above to any translation site to find the <br/>
download button.<br/>
<br/>
And once the soft is downloaded, and installed, started, you can see the <br/>
black screen with some buttons below.<br/>
<br/>
When you click on the button &quot;S&quot; of the search, you can see the list of <br/>
flashes you&#39;ve downloaded. (So you can download at first any flash <br/>
normally on your browser) Then you can choose the flash you wish save and<br/>
you right clicked the chosen file. There are two option in Japanese but<br/>
you can see at least (S) for save and (D) for delete.<br/>
Choosing (S) option you can save the file where you want on your PC.<br/>
And the button &quot;O&quot; is open and &quot;M&quot; is misc.<br/>
<br/>
May be I explain badly and it seems complicated, but once you do try it, <br/>
it would be more simple and easy, I think.<br/>
And I don&#39;t know for the Mac, sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334303222">For Mac all you have to do is go onto Safari and click<br/>
view and source. Look up the html of the flash pics<br/>
with the ends .swf and copy and poaste it to your url<br/>
safari space. Once the flash pic loads go to File and<br/>
Save as. ttyl (Got those instructions from<br/>
someone...but who?)<br/>
