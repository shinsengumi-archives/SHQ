<h3>The Fictional Joys of Kinshin Pt1</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630452679">Well, just finished watching the latest NHK episode this one following <br/>
last week's appeal  to Matsudaira on the Kondou is an Arrogant <br/>
Dictatorial Ahou Petition and it shows that following that incident the <br/>
petitioners were confined to quarters in a bunch --except ring leader <br/>
Nagakura who got to go to Edo with Kanryuu, Kondou and someone I didn't <br/>
know to ask the Shogun's councilor's to get Tokugawa to come to <br/>
Kyoto--or back to Kyoto as the case may be.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  Okita popped by to say hello to the detainees and made a hand <br/>
motion/comment about how badly the room smelled (evidentially kinshin <br/>
does not give one bathing privileges however Saitou did not look any <br/>
worse for the ordeal.)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting too was the fact that Hijikata singled out the actual <br/>
transcriber of the petition for seppuku....Remember KOndou was in Edo <br/>
and Yamanami was out wandering around/ meeting his bimbo Akesato for the <br/>
first time so there was no one to object save for Inoue and Okita who <br/>
went along with it rather unwillingly it seemed.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this is total fiction or if it has any basis in fact?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nagakura and other five people got angry with Kondou's haughtiness, <br/>
and they did petition presentation at Matsudaira Katamori. <br/>
Matsudaira reconciled Kondou with them well. <br/>
And Kondou went to Edo by the request of the upper levels after <br/>
that. <br/>
Although Nagakura was suspended, he went to Edo together with <br/>
Kondou. <br/>
While they were in Edo, the member of the name of Katsurayama <br/>
committed hara-kiri. <br/>
Understanding as a historical fact are only these things. <br/>
<br/>
Why did only Nagakura go to Edo with Kondou among home confinement <br/>
persons? <br/>
Since Kondou was going to meet the samurai of the upper class of the <br/>
Matsumae domain during Edo stay, some researchers are surmising that <br/>
he took Nagakura. <br/>
(Although it was existing appearance, Nagakura is from Matsumae and <br/>
many of his acquaintances were in Matsumae.) <br/>
<br/>
Was only Katsurayama made to commit hara-kiri why? <br/>
This is not understood.<br/>
It is said that a certain opinion is because only Katsurayama <br/>
resisted compromise. <br/>
Or in other opinion, there is a thing that he whose class is the <br/>
bottom most fell victim as a warning to other members. <br/>
And it is said that it was Hijikata's act arbitrarily without <br/>
consultation. <br/>
Also after that, execution between the Kondou absences was performed <br/>
several times. <br/>
About this, Hijikata's lawyer seems to be disadvantageous.^^;;;<br/>
(I cannot think that he had such authority....I murmur based on the <br/>
opinion of some researcher....I do not give up.) <br/>
In fact, there are many opinions among researchers about Hijikata's <br/>
having had what level of authority in Shinsengumi. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, although Saitou goes into the group of Itou as a spy, <br/>
about this episode, he is innocence.<br/>
Although he informs Kondou of the affair of a petition, it is the <br/>
fiction of this drama. <br/>
