<h3>Geographic polls</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349902295">In light of recent interest in where our community has concentrations of members, it might be interesting to give everyone a chance to show just what corners of the globe the Shinsengumi have reached.<br/>
 <br/>
Understanding that where people live can be a sensitive and private issue, two polls are about to go up with various countries and geographic locations as options.  The world is a very big place and poll options limited, so there are two polls: one for the Americas/Asia/Australia and the other for Africa and Europe.  If your specific country isn't listed, please don't feel slighted.  No offense was intended.  Also, no infomation is collected or recorded in regards to answers, and all features of the SHQ Yahoogroups site are available *only* to members, so no one will be able to determine where you're coming from.<br/>
 <br/>
The polls are set to be open indefinitely so that new members can contribute and I encourage everyone to check back periodically to see results.  They can be accessed at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq</a> .<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you'll take a minute or two and help us learn a little more about our community!<br/>
