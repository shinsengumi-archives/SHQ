<h3>Training of Samurai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697357656">I remembered a long time ago someone had posted up an excerpt from the Nisshinkan Doshikun, so I went to look at it and successfuly found it.   Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t answer my question.   I wanted to know, other then swordmanship, what other sort of martial art (if any) were young boys taught as they grew up?   I would imagine some for of jujitsu would be taught just in case you somewhow were unable to use your sword.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717860948">I can gather the specific ryuuha (school) names of the various martial <br/>
traditions of Aizu-han, as they appear in the domain encyclopedia &quot;Hanshi <br/>
Daijiten&quot;-- however I know for sure that the sons (and daughters!) of Aizu <br/>
were taught:<br/>
<br/>
*Several forms of sword<br/>
*Archery<br/>
*Spear<br/>
*Gunnery<br/>
*Artillery<br/>
*Swimming<br/>
*Horsemanship<br/>
*Jujutsu<br/>
*Tactics<br/>
*Naginata<br/>
<br/>
Also some martial arts I have no idea about, like shubojutsu...<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps, even a little.<br/>

If you want more Nisshinkan related action go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a><br/>
do a keyword search for &quot;byakkotai&quot;<br/>
to get clips on the NEW Byakkotai (starring J-rock/pop stars)<br/>
look for the clip where Nisshinkan students go swimming (*^_^*)<br/>
<br/>
Here I angst over whether or not this new miniseries will follow the <br/>
old series and show the Shinsengumi !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>

Honest, I&#39;m going to be very very very upset if they fail to address <br/>
Hijikata and Yamaguchi Jiro (Saitou) in Aizu...it&#39;s such a no <br/>
brainer really for the writers....<br/>
All these guys and Nakajima Nobori were at the Bonari Pass in Aizu <br/>
as well...a major battle<br/>
I&#39;m telling you if anyone can do a good Joushitai story---that <br/>
writer is going to be a millionaire---however it seems to be a trend <br/>
where producers &quot;play it safe&quot; and are too afraid to try anything new<br/>
<br/>
My favorite part in the old series<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm</a><br/>
is when these young guys are hanging around and waiting to see <br/>
Hijikata (^__^) they are so dweeby and cute</div>
