<h3>Contents of a Habachi Table</h3>
by <i>kirasaige</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-527422404">A while back I posted about a co-worker who 40 years back had <br/>
purchased a Habachi Table in Japan in a antique store. The table <br/>
drawers were swollen shut with the humidity and when he brought it <br/>
hope he set it before a fire till it dried out enough to open the <br/>
drawers. Inside he found two small boxes that were very very light to <br/>
the touch.<br/>
<br/>
Well last week I was finally able to catch up with him and set up a <br/>
meeting with Tokiko (I&#39;ll get her last name later, I thought i had <br/>
it). She is the mother of my best friend and loves history. Born and <br/>
raised in a Budhist Temple, her father was the high monk. <br/>
<br/>
The first contents of the box were four items. The first item she <br/>
pulled out was the letter. The paper was very light and almond <br/>
colored, but the writing on it was very bold. She had no problem <br/>
reading it. Inside the letter was a snake skin that had been wrapped <br/>
around what looked like cotton. The skin was so dry that it was <br/>
crumbling. Inside the lid of the box was some writing.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m not sure where the date was written, if it was in the lid or <br/>
on the letter. But Tokiko San said that it was written the 6th year <br/>
of Kaei. When we looked it up, it was 1854. A year after Commodore <br/>
Perry arrived. <br/>
<br/>
The letter in a nutshell was from Miyawaki San explaining that the <br/>
snake inside was being given as a gift of monetary luck. The design <br/>
on the snake was the same as the coin with the square hole in the <br/>
middle. <br/>
<br/>
Under the letter and snake skin were three talismans. Two small ones <br/>
and then a large one. She tried opening the large one, but it had <br/>
never been opened before and was VERY fragile. She said that it is <br/>
the kind of talisman not to be opend otherwise what ever fortune or <br/>
protection it was providing would go away.<br/>
<br/>
In the second box was a scroll. I wish i had gotten a picture of it <br/>
undraveled. It was a red one. And Tokiko San said that these <br/>
talismans can still be purchased at any shrine in Japan. When she and <br/>
her daughter began to unravel the scroll, it was as strong as the <br/>
paper the letter was written on. It didn&#39;t tear or rip. (much to my <br/>
delight, my poor heart was in my throat) She said that the scroll was <br/>
a protection scroll of the 9 Kami-samas or 9 spirits. She was not <br/>
able to translate the scroll, much.<br/>
<br/>
The wood the boxes are made of is called Kiri or Paulownia. She said <br/>
it was very common to use this kind of wood because the bugs didn&#39;t <br/>
like it and it was very light. <br/>
<br/>
The Talismans came from Komeira Shrine.<br/>
<br/>
I have posted my myspace site where I have posted the pictures.<br/>

This was such an exciting thing. Thanks for letting me share.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. The gentleman who owns these was wondering if there was any way <br/>
to determine their monetary value?<br/>
<br/>
I would also like your opinions on these items. :)</div>

<br/>
I had trouble with this link:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>can you turn it into a tinyurl (I tried to do this and only got the<br/>
myspace login page) or post the pics to photobucket?<br/>
<br/>
I think to determine the value of these items you&#39;d need to find an<br/>
expert of Japanese antiques and you can start by calling museums with<br/>
Japanese collections.  The museum may be able to refer you to someone<br/>
knowledgeable who can help.  Generally these people specialize in very<br/>
specific things like paintings or prints, netsuke, blades and so<br/>
forth.  You have many wonderful items so please keep us up to date if<br/>
you learn more about them! (^_^)</div>
