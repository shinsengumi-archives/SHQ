<h3>The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082927450">Oh wow!  I just finished watching "Sword of Doom" on this week's IFC Samurai Saturday and they just showed a promo for the new "The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi," with Beat Takeshi (the guy who played Hijikata in "Gohatto" --- maybe he was too old for the role, but I love this guy).  They're advertising it as being in theatres this summer.  Anyone know, is this actually coming out in the US?  Looks to be another blend of humor and adventure... looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.<br/>

<br/>
I never get to see the whole Sword of Doom movie  I always come in near <br/>
the end *whine*  So how many did he kill? I think he took out the entire <br/>
shinsengumi except for the ones killing Serizawa. And was it me or did <br/>
Serizawa get gatotsued?<br/>

<br/>
Ryunosuke, was also INSANE :D , and the last scene took place in his <br/>
mind...note how the bamboo screens seemed to increase by many fold.  <br/>
Kihachi Okamoto is an awesome director and Tatsuya Nakadai, who <br/>
trained briefly in the Kashima Shinryu lineage according to Friday's <br/>
book, did an outstanding job in the role.  Ryunosuke is based on a <br/>
historical figure connected with the Shinsengumi[!] and or one of <br/>
the other police forces.  Nakadai's role in Sword of Doom and <br/>
Harakiri/Seppuku made him my favorite "Gold Era of Japanese Film" <br/>
actor. I really wish they would translate the novel Daibosatsu-Toge <br/>
already....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808410429">I actually tried to count...I estimate around 50 in the entire <br/>
movie...Kev do you have a number? :D  Its such a horrible body count <br/>
scene...I read in an essay that Okamoto told Nakadai that he is <br/>
supposed to be a shark in a school of anchovies or something along <br/>
those lines.  I think Serizawa got hiratsuki-ed<br/>
<br/>
Anyways the same director, Kihachi Okamoto also does comedies such <br/>
as Kiru! (Kill!) and Red Lion (which I have not seen). Kiru! pokes <br/>
fun at the 7 bungling samurai and the whole bit about the bamboo <br/>
sword (it's sad Nakadai gets to make fun of Harakiri/Seppuku which <br/>
made him an international star).<br/>
<br/>
*the guy who wrote the screenplay for Sword of Doom also wrote the <br/>
screenplay for 7 Samurai too<br/>
<br/>
Ryunosuke is just "misunderstood"...he isn't ~that~ evil...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Has to be more than that in the entire movie... although Ryunosuke isn't responsible for the slaughter when he and the group go out to waylay... uh oh... is it Shimada (not *our* Shimada Kai)?  <br/>
 <br/>
I noticed this time that a Kojima bit the dust.  I missed the beginning of the film, so I'm not sure of all the connections... if this Kojima was meant to be from the family associated with Kondou.  I have the film recorded; just been lazy about spending time with it.  With all the initial Mito connections, though, it's becoming curiouser and curiouser to me about exactly who Sagara's family were and if he possibly had *any* association with the early group that became the Shinsengumi.  I'm tired and I've got so much searching to do... sigh.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>Anyways the same director, Kihachi Okamoto also does comedies such as Kiru! (Kill!) and Red Lion (which I have not seen). <<<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven't seen "Red Lion" either, but Sagara and the Sekihoutai are in it  (in a very minor role, I've read).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>Kiru! pokes fun at the 7 bungling samurai<<<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one I've seen (it's been shown on IFC) and it's a delight!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>Ryunosuke is just "misunderstood"...he isn't ~that~ evil...<<<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, sure... :-D  The guy's exactly as his father said he was.  Saitou must've been on patrol that night.  Now, if *he* had been at that party... shorter film.<br/>
 <br/>
phil<br/>
P.S.  And Barb, thanks for the release info on "Zatoichi."  It might make it to Phoenix for about a week.  The problem is I don't have anyone to take me halfway across town where it'll show up... boooo...<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-203075571">First, I just uploaded the other article I meant to<br/>
send to the group on the Shogitai in the Files<br/>
section. Also, I added an English translated excerpt<br/>
from Daibosatsu Toge. The English isn't very good and<br/>
some translated terms could have probably used better<br/>
words, but it is the only thing in English from that<br/>
story. This particular part is the attempt on Hachiro<br/>
Kiyokawa's life...of course...if you have seen "Sword<br/>
of Doom" you know what happens. I was trying to<br/>
conserve space here so you may want to zoom in<br/>
somewhere between 75% to 100% depending on how much<br/>
your eyes can take. If someone wants me to I can try<br/>
to do the excerpt over again later.<br/>
<br/>
 I counted the bodies at the end of Sword of Doom<br/>
years ago and it is somewhere in the late 40's range I<br/>
think. Believe it or not there is a movie called<br/>
"Orochi" with Raizo Ichikawa that rivals this endings<br/>
bodycount too and probably more. The Lone Wolf and Cub<br/>
movies had high bodycounts near the end of most of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
 The thing about Sword of Doom is if it had continued<br/>
in the sequels you would have seen him get up the next<br/>
day after he passed out, join the Tenchugumi, some bad<br/>
stuff happens to him in that, and he continues to<br/>
suffer. His son plays an important role to any hope in<br/>
his "salvation" as the story goes along. The story was<br/>
originally written as a Buddhist parable about<br/>
suffering.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
