<h3>The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082927450">Oh wow!  I just finished watching &quot;Sword of Doom&quot; on this week&#39;s IFC Samurai Saturday and they just showed a promo for the new &quot;The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi,&quot; with Beat Takeshi (the guy who played Hijikata in &quot;Gohatto&quot; --- maybe he was too old for the role, but I love this guy).  They&#39;re advertising it as being in theatres this summer.  Anyone know, is this actually coming out in the US?  Looks to be another blend of humor and adventure... looks like it&#39;s going to be a lot of fun.<br/>

<br/>
I never get to see the whole Sword of Doom movie  I always come in near <br/>
the end *whine*  So how many did he kill? I think he took out the entire <br/>
shinsengumi except for the ones killing Serizawa. And was it me or did <br/>
Serizawa get gatotsued?<br/>

<br/>
Ryunosuke, was also INSANE :D , and the last scene took place in his <br/>
mind...note how the bamboo screens seemed to increase by many fold.  <br/>
Kihachi Okamoto is an awesome director and Tatsuya Nakadai, who <br/>
trained briefly in the Kashima Shinryu lineage according to Friday&#39;s <br/>
book, did an outstanding job in the role.  Ryunosuke is based on a <br/>
historical figure connected with the Shinsengumi[!] and or one of <br/>
the other police forces.  Nakadai&#39;s role in Sword of Doom and <br/>
Harakiri/Seppuku made him my favorite &quot;Gold Era of Japanese Film&quot; <br/>
actor. I really wish they would translate the novel Daibosatsu-Toge <br/>
already....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808410429">I actually tried to count...I estimate around 50 in the entire <br/>
movie...Kev do you have a number? :D  Its such a horrible body count <br/>
scene...I read in an essay that Okamoto told Nakadai that he is <br/>
supposed to be a shark in a school of anchovies or something along <br/>
those lines.  I think Serizawa got hiratsuki-ed<br/>
<br/>
Anyways the same director, Kihachi Okamoto also does comedies such <br/>
as Kiru! (Kill!) and Red Lion (which I have not seen). Kiru! pokes <br/>
fun at the 7 bungling samurai and the whole bit about the bamboo <br/>
sword (it&#39;s sad Nakadai gets to make fun of Harakiri/Seppuku which <br/>
made him an international star).<br/>
<br/>
*the guy who wrote the screenplay for Sword of Doom also wrote the <br/>
screenplay for 7 Samurai too<br/>
<br/>
Ryunosuke is just &quot;misunderstood&quot;...he isn&#39;t ~that~ evil...<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has to be more than that in the entire movie... although Ryunosuke isn&#39;t responsible for the slaughter when he and the group go out to waylay... uh oh... is it Shimada (not *our* Shimada Kai)?  <br/>
 <br/>
I noticed this time that a Kojima bit the dust.  I missed the beginning of the film, so I&#39;m not sure of all the connections... if this Kojima was meant to be from the family associated with Kondou.  I have the film recorded; just been lazy about spending time with it.  With all the initial Mito connections, though, it&#39;s becoming curiouser and curiouser to me about exactly who Sagara&#39;s family were and if he possibly had *any* association with the early group that became the Shinsengumi.  I&#39;m tired and I&#39;ve got so much searching to do... sigh.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen &quot;Red Lion&quot; either, but Sagara and the Sekihoutai are in it  (in a very minor role, I&#39;ve read).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Kiru! pokes fun at the 7 bungling samurai&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one I&#39;ve seen (it&#39;s been shown on IFC) and it&#39;s a delight!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Ryunosuke is just &quot;misunderstood&quot;...he isn&#39;t ~that~ evil...&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, sure... :-D  The guy&#39;s exactly as his father said he was.  Saitou must&#39;ve been on patrol that night.  Now, if *he* had been at that party... shorter film.<br/>
 <br/>
phil<br/>
P.S.  And Barb, thanks for the release info on &quot;Zatoichi.&quot;  It might make it to Phoenix for about a week.  The problem is I don&#39;t have anyone to take me halfway across town where it&#39;ll show up... boooo...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203075571">First, I just uploaded the other article I meant to<br/>
send to the group on the Shogitai in the Files<br/>
section. Also, I added an English translated excerpt<br/>
from Daibosatsu Toge. The English isn&#39;t very good and<br/>
some translated terms could have probably used better<br/>
words, but it is the only thing in English from that<br/>
story. This particular part is the attempt on Hachiro<br/>
Kiyokawa&#39;s life...of course...if you have seen &quot;Sword<br/>
of Doom&quot; you know what happens. I was trying to<br/>
conserve space here so you may want to zoom in<br/>
somewhere between 75% to 100% depending on how much<br/>
your eyes can take. If someone wants me to I can try<br/>
to do the excerpt over again later.<br/>
<br/>
 I counted the bodies at the end of Sword of Doom<br/>
years ago and it is somewhere in the late 40&#39;s range I<br/>
think. Believe it or not there is a movie called<br/>
&quot;Orochi&quot; with Raizo Ichikawa that rivals this endings<br/>
bodycount too and probably more. The Lone Wolf and Cub<br/>
movies had high bodycounts near the end of most of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
 The thing about Sword of Doom is if it had continued<br/>
in the sequels you would have seen him get up the next<br/>
day after he passed out, join the Tenchugumi, some bad<br/>
stuff happens to him in that, and he continues to<br/>
suffer. His son plays an important role to any hope in<br/>
his &quot;salvation&quot; as the story goes along. The story was<br/>
originally written as a Buddhist parable about<br/>
suffering.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
