<h3>Ishin Players Needed</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89638215">We have several people now playing major roles in the Shinsengumi <br/>
RPG. However there are still several Captains and other fairly well-<br/>
known members who are still available, among them Harada Sanosuke <br/>
(surprisingly). And so far NO ONE has volunteered to be part of the <br/>
Ishin! Not even a taker from the RK folks for Hitokiri Battousai!<br/>
<br/>
Alright folks, we know some of you out there have got to want to <br/>
play! No need to worry if you&#39;re holding out because you don&#39;t <br/>
consider yourself to be &quot;knowledgeable&quot; enough about the Shinsengumi. <br/>
We&#39;re not following exact history here. In fact, history has pretty <br/>
much alreay gone out the window! Just the basics you&#39;ve picked up <br/>
from here and by watching RK and PMK will do. That&#39;s really all you <br/>
need to know. And the game isn&#39;t all that time consuming either. I&#39;m <br/>
involved with another RPG and I&#39;m not having to devote nearly the <br/>
time I originally feared to it. We all have lives to lead off the <br/>
internet after all.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to check out the community later (once the game has <br/>
started, which it has not yet) the url is:<br/>

<br/>
Come on folks! We can&#39;t have all cowboys and no indians! Someone <br/>
needs to take on the roles of Katsura, Takasugi, Sakamoto, Saigo, <br/>
Okubo, the four hitokiri, Yoshida. We&#39;re even accepting Hitokiri <br/>
Battousai (further proof history has long since been disregarded).<br/>
Doesn&#39;t anyone want to be the bad guys? Or is that the good guys? LOL!<br/>
<br/>
So far the list of taken characters is:<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata - MissBehavin<br/>
Ito - Barb<br/>
Suzuki (Miki) - Phil<br/>
Saitou - Angrybee<br/>
Kondou - Wounds<br/>
Okita - Aurus<br/>
Nagakura - Masayoshi<br/>
Ayunee - Sherlgirl<br/>
Yamanami - Tama<br/>
Takeda - Sanada<br/>
<br/>
All others are up for grabs.<br/>
<br/>
-MissBehavin aka Toshizo Hijikata</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145035415">We even need the &quot;behind the scenes guys like Matsudaira Katamori and <br/>
his brother who was in charge of the Shoshidai, we can use the <br/>
Mimiwarigumi to heckle the Shinsengumi etc.Live out your wildest fantasy <br/>
by being Kondou&#39;s mistress or the party girl who keeps running away from <br/>
Saitou LOL<br/>
