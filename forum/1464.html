<h3>Ishin Players Needed</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-89638215">We have several people now playing major roles in the Shinsengumi <br/>
RPG. However there are still several Captains and other fairly well-<br/>
known members who are still available, among them Harada Sanosuke <br/>
(surprisingly). And so far NO ONE has volunteered to be part of the <br/>
Ishin! Not even a taker from the RK folks for Hitokiri Battousai!<br/>
<br/>
Alright folks, we know some of you out there have got to want to <br/>
play! No need to worry if you're holding out because you don't <br/>
consider yourself to be "knowledgeable" enough about the Shinsengumi. <br/>
We're not following exact history here. In fact, history has pretty <br/>
much alreay gone out the window! Just the basics you've picked up <br/>
from here and by watching RK and PMK will do. That's really all you <br/>
need to know. And the game isn't all that time consuming either. I'm <br/>
involved with another RPG and I'm not having to devote nearly the <br/>
time I originally feared to it. We all have lives to lead off the <br/>
internet after all.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to check out the community later (once the game has <br/>
started, which it has not yet) the url is:<br/>
http:/www.livejournal.com/community/miburo_lair<br/>
<br/>
Come on folks! We can't have all cowboys and no indians! Someone <br/>
needs to take on the roles of Katsura, Takasugi, Sakamoto, Saigo, <br/>
Okubo, the four hitokiri, Yoshida. We're even accepting Hitokiri <br/>
Battousai (further proof history has long since been disregarded).<br/>
Doesn't anyone want to be the bad guys? Or is that the good guys? LOL!<br/>
<br/>
So far the list of taken characters is:<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata - MissBehavin<br/>
Ito - Barb<br/>
Suzuki (Miki) - Phil<br/>
Saitou - Angrybee<br/>
Kondou - Wounds<br/>
Okita - Aurus<br/>
Nagakura - Masayoshi<br/>
Ayunee - Sherlgirl<br/>
Yamanami - Tama<br/>
Takeda - Sanada<br/>
<br/>
All others are up for grabs.<br/>
<br/>
-MissBehavin aka Toshizo Hijikata</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145035415">We even need the "behind the scenes guys like Matsudaira Katamori and <br/>
his brother who was in charge of the Shoshidai, we can use the <br/>
Mimiwarigumi to heckle the Shinsengumi etc.Live out your wildest fantasy <br/>
by being Kondou's mistress or the party girl who keeps running away from <br/>
Saitou LOL<br/>
