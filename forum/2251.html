VERY VERY short by detailed article (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
"Hide's memoirs reveal what happened to ordinary people caught up in <br/>
the reverberating public events that set Japan on its modern <br/>
course.  The overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867 wrenched <br/>
Hide, her family and friends from the security of their inherited <br/>
status....they now had to scramble to make a living."<br/>
