<h3>Images from 1988 Sagara book</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286675854">Sec just had to knock me upside the head to remember to open a word document in her zip file to get me to realize this isn't the same book as the biography.  The images are from "Sagara Sozo to sono doshi ; Soma Daisaku to Tsugaru Tanomo"  (translation?) written by the man who wrote the biography, Hasegawa Shin, and published by Kodansha (Tokyo).  Obviously, I don't know what all of them are and can only guess at a few (many probably being Hasegawa), so I don't know their relevance to Sagara & the Sekihoutai and bakumatsu/Meiji history.  If anyone who reads Japanese can clue me/us in...<br/>
 <br/>
Again, most images are huge, so the pages take time loading and I'm still working with free space, so they could become unavailable (they've just been uploaded so they *may* not be coming up right now).  Usually bandwidth is available again within the hour.  There are 4 pages with 5 images on each page.  Pages are linked.<br/>

 <br/>
Also, I already had the pages up when Sec woke me up to it being a different book, so ignore headers and page titles.  I'll correct those at a later date.<br/>
 <br/>
AND, even though today is March 3, according to Tama's handy-dandy lunar-solar calendar converter ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv">http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv</a>  --- Year, Month, Day in the boxes, then the two options below are solar/western to lunar at top, lunar to solar at bottom... thank you, Tama!) Sagara was executed on March 26, 1868, on western calendars.<br/>
