<h3>Maps + Sonno Joi Revisited + Stuff</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594970392">I'm skimming<br/>
Totman, Conrad.  The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu 1862-1868<br/>
USA:  The University Press of Hawaii, 1980. Isbn 082480614<br/>
and found the maps to be very useful...I can't remember if we <br/>
already had maps uploaded somewhere...but in any case I have scanned <br/>
(pdf)a map of Edo (you can see where Ueno Hill is located), Kanto <br/>
Plain (Present day Tsukuba Univ where we have a record of S.H. <br/>
teaching kenjutsu is pretty far from Edo/Tokyo) and Toba-Fushimi <br/>
(note presence of swamps)<br/>
<br/>
I inserted the citation in the pdf document...<br/>

[Sonno Joi]<br/>
I realized after skimming a few books that authors will each have <br/>
their own way of attempting to identify the political stance(s) of <br/>
certain groups. People back then may have been asking each <br/>
other..."hey what do you believe in?"<br/>
A. Joi via force<br/>
B. Joi via negotiations<br/>
C. Sonno just outwardly to keep up "appearances" forget Joi we are <br/>
making $$$<br/>
D. Pro/Sincere-Sonno but anti Joi<br/>
E. Anti-Sonno (which existed but not "officially" ofcourse) but Pro-<br/>
Joi<br/>
F. Anti Pro Sonno Joi altogether ^_^<br/>
G. Radical Sonno Joi (which some writers don't define clearly)<br/>
H. You are too confused to care but you ~do~ like that new catchy <br/>
tune "Ee ja na kai Ee ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka"<br/>
<br/>
[Sekihoutai]<br/>
I have been searching jstor.org with the keywords Phil sent me and <br/>
not surprisingly...nothing has shown up...in fact none of the <br/>
detailed indexes of history books even mention them...HOWEVER this <br/>
may be simply due to how things are indexed...so I'm skimming all <br/>
texts<br/>
<br/>
For example...I've been looking for words like "Police" "Tokyo <br/>
Metropolitan Police" "Kawaji" and a whole bunch of what seems to <br/>
be "logical" words in indexes when I should be looking <br/>
for "keihoryo" which some authors translate loosely as the law <br/>
enforcement system...I found shreds of info on the TMPD's adoption <br/>
of the kyu ranking system for kendo/kenjutsu too ^_^ during Fujita <br/>
G's time in the dept.<br/>
<br/>
[Stuff]<br/>
I don't understand the request on starting a forum on the <br/>
messageboard with introductions...do you mean introducing us <br/>
members?  Please explain just tell me what to do exactly.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I think I'd pick that option, as well as the accompanying "Ahou Odori"<br/>
(Moron's Dance).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it might be a good idea to introduce ourselves. I sometimes see<br/>
that on Japanese message boards. If you guys want, I can even prepare<br/>
introductions in Japanese.<br/>
