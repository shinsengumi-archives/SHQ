<h3>Maps + Sonno Joi Revisited + Stuff</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594970392">I&#39;m skimming<br/>
Totman, Conrad.  The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu 1862-1868<br/>
USA:  The University Press of Hawaii, 1980. Isbn 082480614<br/>
and found the maps to be very useful...I can&#39;t remember if we <br/>
already had maps uploaded somewhere...but in any case I have scanned <br/>
(pdf)a map of Edo (you can see where Ueno Hill is located), Kanto <br/>
Plain (Present day Tsukuba Univ where we have a record of S.H. <br/>
teaching kenjutsu is pretty far from Edo/Tokyo) and Toba-Fushimi <br/>
(note presence of swamps)<br/>
<br/>
I inserted the citation in the pdf document...<br/>

[Sonno Joi]<br/>
I realized after skimming a few books that authors will each have <br/>
their own way of attempting to identify the political stance(s) of <br/>
certain groups. People back then may have been asking each <br/>
other...&quot;hey what do you believe in?&quot;<br/>
A. Joi via force<br/>
B. Joi via negotiations<br/>
C. Sonno just outwardly to keep up &quot;appearances&quot; forget Joi we are <br/>
making $$$<br/>
D. Pro/Sincere-Sonno but anti Joi<br/>
E. Anti-Sonno (which existed but not &quot;officially&quot; ofcourse) but Pro-<br/>
Joi<br/>
F. Anti Pro Sonno Joi altogether ^_^<br/>
G. Radical Sonno Joi (which some writers don&#39;t define clearly)<br/>
H. You are too confused to care but you ~do~ like that new catchy <br/>
tune &quot;Ee ja na kai Ee ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[Sekihoutai]<br/>
I have been searching jstor.org with the keywords Phil sent me and <br/>
not surprisingly...nothing has shown up...in fact none of the <br/>
detailed indexes of history books even mention them...HOWEVER this <br/>
may be simply due to how things are indexed...so I&#39;m skimming all <br/>
texts<br/>
<br/>
For example...I&#39;ve been looking for words like &quot;Police&quot; &quot;Tokyo <br/>
Metropolitan Police&quot; &quot;Kawaji&quot; and a whole bunch of what seems to <br/>
be &quot;logical&quot; words in indexes when I should be looking <br/>
for &quot;keihoryo&quot; which some authors translate loosely as the law <br/>
enforcement system...I found shreds of info on the TMPD&#39;s adoption <br/>
of the kyu ranking system for kendo/kenjutsu too ^_^ during Fujita <br/>
G&#39;s time in the dept.<br/>

I don&#39;t understand the request on starting a forum on the <br/>
messageboard with introductions...do you mean introducing us <br/>
members?  Please explain just tell me what to do exactly.</div>

(Moron&#39;s Dance).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it might be a good idea to introduce ourselves. I sometimes see<br/>
that on Japanese message boards. If you guys want, I can even prepare<br/>
introductions in Japanese.<br/>
