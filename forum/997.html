 </span></blockquote>Hello and welcome! Yutaru is it?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm one of the resident loudmouths on the list, so you'll be hearing from me quite often. As you'll not doubt notice from going back through the messages, we really are obsessed with digging up the hard facts of these peoples' lives, so you'll be hearing quite a bit about them! <br/>
<br/>
So is there anyone in the group in particular you were trying to find out more about? We'd be glad to fill you in on what we've discovered about them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Irrashaimase Yutaru-chan! Welcome to this wonderful mailing list. <br/>
Not trying to lift our own bench here but I can assure you that if <br/>
you're looking to learn more about the Shinsengumi, this is <br/>
the "English" place to be. Certainly there are Japanese sites out <br/>
there but I don't think any other "English" group can compare to <br/>
this one. Who is your favorite Shinsengumi? What is your favorite <br/>
Anime? Manga? Live-action? Hope to hear from you soon.</div>
