<br/>
Well, I&#39;m one of the resident loudmouths on the list, so you&#39;ll be hearing from me quite often. As you&#39;ll not doubt notice from going back through the messages, we really are obsessed with digging up the hard facts of these peoples&#39; lives, so you&#39;ll be hearing quite a bit about them! <br/>
<br/>
So is there anyone in the group in particular you were trying to find out more about? We&#39;d be glad to fill you in on what we&#39;ve discovered about them.<br/>

Not trying to lift our own bench here but I can assure you that if <br/>
you&#39;re looking to learn more about the Shinsengumi, this is <br/>
the &quot;English&quot; place to be. Certainly there are Japanese sites out <br/>
there but I don&#39;t think any other &quot;English&quot; group can compare to <br/>
this one. Who is your favorite Shinsengumi? What is your favorite <br/>
Anime? Manga? Live-action? Hope to hear from you soon.</div>
