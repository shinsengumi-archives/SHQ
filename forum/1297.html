No, we don't use this way of counting age,called "kazoedoshi"no longer.<br/>
If there is difference of the age for Saito or other persons, they had simply <br/>
mistaken, or probably confused with "kazoedoshi", mentioned in old record.<br/>

<br/>
It is the talk of "Kazoedoshi". The custom does not exist now.<br/>
When I was a child, I heard the talk of the custom. And I regarded <br/>
it as very strange.<br/>
In old Japan, a child becomes 1 years old on the next day, after <br/>
being born. And a new year comes on January 1 and the child becomes <br/>
2 years old. After that, a child grows older on January 1 every <br/>
year. That is, all Japanese grew old on January 1. <br/>
(The child born at the end of December suffers troubles. He is born <br/>
and becomes 2 years old immediately.)<br/>
<br/>
It is meaningless to tell old Japanese "happy birthday". They did <br/>
not regard the day as important. <br/>
Hijikata's birthday is on May 5. However, probably, he did not <br/>
celebrate the day.<br/>
As for Okita, record of a birthday does not remain. <br/>
Although Saitou probably celebrated the new year, he has not <br/>
celebrated the day as his birthday. <br/>

a matter of days...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137162241">And today we are so involved with problems children encounter when they are pressured too young.  It is amazing how much difference there can be between a child who starts school at the youngest age possible for public school entrance and one who is at the other end of that range... and it is only a matter of months.  It would be fascinating to see if being born at the end of the year and suddenly being considered 2 years old when you are only a month old caused problems as adults since they were age-mates with people, like Saitou, who would have been a full year older.  We could start a new reason for people to be troublemakers... look to see when they were born.  :-D<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you, momoiro-usagi, for the details!  I love the psychology that follows things like this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140095400">Actually, they could say that to Saitou since he is as old as the year (considering that ALL people followed kazoedoshi then... we westerners just would not understand why a 2 year-old wasn't as adept as *our* 2-year-old... which makes me wonder if that isn't part of some of the European erroneous thinking about other cultures being backward... I mean, sheesh, if you have ever been around a group of mothers with infants... "Well, my son can already eat meat" "Oh, really?  Well my Jimmy can open pickle jars with his two teeth."  Said infants really don't care and are busily making bubbles with drool.  Know what I mean?)<br/>
 <br/>
It is the poor kids like (SHOOT... I forgot which shogun M mentioned... you know who I mean) who it really would not apply to.  Imagine telling a month-old 2-year-old to "act your age!"?  LOL  I guess that is when shoe size would be more applicable. (as in "act your age, not your shoe size")<br/>
