<div id="ygrps-yiv-871663344">This is a very important question because this is probably the reason<br/>
why some Japanese sites say Fujita Goro dies at age 72...when<br/>
1915-1844=71???<br/>
Blame the Chinese...they count the months in the womb...(sigh)<br/>

No, we don&#39;t use this way of counting age,called &quot;kazoedoshi&quot;no longer.<br/>
If there is difference of the age for Saito or other persons, they had simply <br/>
mistaken, or probably confused with &quot;kazoedoshi&quot;, mentioned in old record.<br/>

<br/>
It is the talk of &quot;Kazoedoshi&quot;. The custom does not exist now.<br/>
When I was a child, I heard the talk of the custom. And I regarded <br/>
it as very strange.<br/>
In old Japan, a child becomes 1 years old on the next day, after <br/>
being born. And a new year comes on January 1 and the child becomes <br/>
2 years old. After that, a child grows older on January 1 every <br/>
year. That is, all Japanese grew old on January 1. <br/>
(The child born at the end of December suffers troubles. He is born <br/>
and becomes 2 years old immediately.)<br/>
<br/>
It is meaningless to tell old Japanese &quot;happy birthday&quot;. They did <br/>
not regard the day as important. <br/>
Hijikata&#39;s birthday is on May 5. However, probably, he did not <br/>
celebrate the day.<br/>
As for Okita, record of a birthday does not remain. <br/>
Although Saitou probably celebrated the new year, he has not <br/>
celebrated the day as his birthday. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137162241">And today we are so involved with problems children encounter when they are pressured too young.  It is amazing how much difference there can be between a child who starts school at the youngest age possible for public school entrance and one who is at the other end of that range... and it is only a matter of months.  It would be fascinating to see if being born at the end of the year and suddenly being considered 2 years old when you are only a month old caused problems as adults since they were age-mates with people, like Saitou, who would have been a full year older.  We could start a new reason for people to be troublemakers... look to see when they were born.  :-D<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you, momoiro-usagi, for the details!  I love the psychology that follows things like this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140095400">Actually, they could say that to Saitou since he is as old as the year (considering that ALL people followed kazoedoshi then... we westerners just would not understand why a 2 year-old wasn&#39;t as adept as *our* 2-year-old... which makes me wonder if that isn&#39;t part of some of the European erroneous thinking about other cultures being backward... I mean, sheesh, if you have ever been around a group of mothers with infants... &quot;Well, my son can already eat meat&quot; &quot;Oh, really?  Well my Jimmy can open pickle jars with his two teeth.&quot;  Said infants really don&#39;t care and are busily making bubbles with drool.  Know what I mean?)<br/>
 <br/>
It is the poor kids like (SHOOT... I forgot which shogun M mentioned... you know who I mean) who it really would not apply to.  Imagine telling a month-old 2-year-old to &quot;act your age!&quot;?  LOL  I guess that is when shoe size would be more applicable. (as in &quot;act your age, not your shoe size&quot;)<br/>
