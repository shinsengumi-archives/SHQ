 </span></blockquote>Choshuu was actually sending many spies into Shinsengumi. <br/>
Although I do not know in detail about them, if I talk about a <br/>
famous spy, I will talk about Kusunoki Kojyuurou.<br/>
His talk appears in &quot;Shinsengumi-monogatari&quot; of the work of <br/>
Shimozawa Kan. <br/>
Kusunoki has joined Shinsengumi by the command of Katsura Kogorou at <br/>
the very early time when Shinsengumi was formed. <br/>
He was the very beautiful boy who did voice gentle to like a woman.<br/>
He was killed by Harada Sanosuke with the sword on September 26, <br/>
1864.<br/>
Yagi Tamesaburou of the second son of a Yagi house spoke about this <br/>
story. <br/>
 <br/>
It was a misty deep morning.<br/>
Tamesaburou which was still a boy was walking in the direction of <br/>
Maekawa&#39;s residence.<br/>
(Maekawa&#39;s residence was used as Shinsengumi headquarters as well as <br/>
the residence of Yagi.)<br/>
Kusunoki stood in front of the gate of Maekawa&#39;s residence.<br/>
Since Kusunoki often played with Tamesaburou, Tamesaburou approached <br/>
him in the intimate feeling.<br/>
Suddenly, Kusunoki raised the loud cry, and he began to run, <br/>
staggering. <br/>
The sword shone behind Kusunoki.<br/>
&quot;Yarou.&quot; someone shouted. <br/>
(Yarou is the word used when speaking ill of a male.)<br/>
Harada came out from the inside of the gate. <br/>
From the inside of the gate, Harada was cutting the back of Kusunoki.<br/>
Kusunoki staggered and escaped into the field which spreads in front <br/>
of Maekawa&#39;s residence. <br/>
Harada pursued him and ran.<br/>
Tamesaburou became fearful and escaped. <br/>
After a while, he went to Maekawa&#39;s residence once again together <br/>
with the families of Yagi.<br/>
Maekawa&#39;s gate was closed firmly.<br/>
When Maekawa&#39;s gate closed, there was always an incident within <br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
And they went to the direction of a field. <br/>
The body of Kusunoki was carried away by Shinsengumi.<br/>
The vegetables of a field were stepped on and were full of blood.<br/>
Then, Tamesaburou got to know that Kusunoki was the spy of Choshuu <br/>
and was killed together with other spies. <br/>
However, Tamesaburou thought it very pitiful that Kusunoki like a <br/>
woman was pursued and killed by very quick-tempered Harada. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
In Maekawa&#39;s residence, other spies as well as him were killed on <br/>
that day. <br/>
Mikura Isetake and Araki Samanosuke were the spies of Choshuu as <br/>
well as Kusunoki. <br/>
They invited the barber to headquarters and had had their sakayaki <br/>
shaved. <br/>
<br/>
(sakayaki is the portion which shaved the hair of a head. The <br/>
customs of sakayaki began from the Muromachi period. If hair is not <br/>
shaved when a samurai wears armor, a head is steamed and it is very <br/>
dangerous.^^;;; <br/>
People of other classes also performed these customs at the Edo <br/>
period. When set to Bakumatsu, it was in fashion not to shave <br/>
sakayaki among samurais. However, the samurais who value manners <br/>
shaved sakayaki every morning, and prepared appearance. For them, <br/>
the barber came every morning.) <br/>
<br/>
Mikura and Araki sat on the veranda and were making the barber <br/>
prepare hair. <br/>
Saitou and Nagakura absorbed their footstep and approached behind <br/>
Choshuu spies. <br/>
Saitou and Nagakura stabbed and killed the back of the spies of <br/>
Choshuu. <br/>
Matsui Ryuzaburou, Echigo Saburou, and Matsunaga Kazue who looked at <br/>
it escaped. <br/>
(Naturally, they are also the spies of Chosyuu.) <br/>
Although Okita and Toudou pursued spies, they were not able to catch <br/>
spies. <br/>
<br/>
This incident arose ten days after Serizawa group assassination. <br/>
Therefore, Serizawa&#39;s assassination was made into what these spies <br/>
performed. <br/>
Of course, the truth is different.^^;;; <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About other spies, I do not know well. <br/>
There is an opinion that Saeki Matasaburou was a Choshuu spy. <br/>
In the Taiga drama, he became a Shinsengumi member from the domestic <br/>
of Yagi house, and flattered Serizawa. <br/>
And he was killed by Serizawa by trifling mistake. <br/>
He of a historical fact is not related to Yagi house. <br/>
He was killed by Serizawa. The reason is not known. <br/>
Since he stole Serizawa&#39;s important thing, there is an opinion that <br/>
he was killed by Serizawa. <br/>
Or since he raped the girl whom Serizawa wanted, he is said to have <br/>
been killed by Serizawa. <br/>
<br/>
However, an opinion completely different from these exists. <br/>
There is an opinion that he was the spy who went into Shinsengumi by <br/>
the command of Yoshida Toshimaro. <br/>
And since he betrayed Choshuu, he was killed by Yoshida. <br/>
<br/>
It is not known whether this is a true story. <br/>
To the last, it is one of the talks told. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or there is an opinion that Niimi Nishiki was the spy of Choshuu. <br/>
This is the opinion which Kimura Sachihiko of Ryozen museum has <br/>
said. <br/>
Ryozen museum is a museum which is exhibiting the articles left by <br/>
the departed of Ishin-shishis. <br/>
(In Shinsengumi relations, many articles left by the departed of <br/>
Shimada Kai exist.) <br/>
This museum is located in Kyoto. <br/>
Ryozen shrine which deified Ishin-shishis exists in the <br/>
neighborhood. <br/>
Furthermore, the cemetery of Ishi-Shishis, such as Sakamoto Ryoma <br/>
and Takasugi Shinsaku, exists. <br/>
Katsura Kogorou built here for Ishin-shishis. <br/>
According to Mr. Kimura&#39;s opinion, Niimi is deified in Ryozen <br/>
shrine. <br/>
Katsura deified him here. <br/>
Only Ishin-shishis which had a contribution to the Meiji government <br/>
is deified in this shrine. <br/>
Mr. Kimura thought that Niimi was spying within Shinsengumi by the <br/>
command of Katsura. <br/>
<br/>
I think that this opinion is very much interesting. <br/>
I think that Choshuu was really fearful enemy for Shinsengumi if <br/>
this was true.<br/>
It means that Shinsengumi had had an enemy&#39;s spy in one of <br/>
captains....Fear!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It is this extent that I know. <br/>
