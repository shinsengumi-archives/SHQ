<h3>Answer to the Towel Question</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-187428302">On 3-hajime.com<br/>
entry 6/12 the webmaster attempts to answer the "towel" question<br/>
"It is case of question, but "the one skin is dispersed", "the towel<br/>
is wound in the neck", "destroying the foot, it sits down", because,<br/>
it is the behavior whose manners are bad, at the normally, no one does<br/>
public place, don't you think?. But, his own house and before and the<br/>
like inside the companion who temper can know, relaxing, it is tend to<br/>
do such behavior, but the person, Saito one, such regarding to the<br/>
place where it relaxes, never did not do such behavior, in other<br/>
words, that much Saito one is the manifestation of the thing that it<br/>
was "the fold correct" person. Perhaps, as for without doing such<br/>
behavior for Saito one, extremely being natural, it is not to be<br/>
only-too-natural thing, probably will be? The kind of answering which<br/>
raises to excessive part is not possible, there is no excuse. Then,<br/>
the impoliteness it does."<br/>
<br/>
Basically, folding your legs when you sit in public, or wrapping a<br/>
towel around one's neck when you are "sweating" (?) is rude in<br/>
public(?)...but ofcourse you can "kick back" or "relax" at home...but<br/>
even at home Saitou didn't do these things...he is like a "fold<br/>
correct" person (VERY VERY proper)...being proper and neat is natural<br/>
to Saitou it seems but perhaps not "natural" to most<br/>
people...(strangely there is an equivalent phrase in Thai which goes<br/>
like this "like a folded clothe" which means proper/neat usually<br/>
associated with women---women who are sooooo well mannered they don't<br/>
"move").  <br/>
<br/>
I was skimming some stuff on the French Police and some of the things<br/>
the TMPD adopted and alot of emphasis is placed on the appearance of<br/>
officers...they have to consistently appear neat and impeccably<br/>
clean...so I'm wondering if Saitou became increasingly "proper" as he<br/>
aged...we are talking about Mr. Drinking Contest here. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking about the "eyes from which light shone"<br/>
phrase...and it hit me...there is also an equivalent Thai phrase for<br/>
this too (all of this is very interesting to me---can you tell?<br/>
LOL!)...because in Thai there is a phrase "you have eyes but you don't<br/>
have a shine(to your eyes)" which means you have a pair of eyes but<br/>
you don't know how to "use" them (in other words your vision is<br/>
"dull") and "you have a shine (to your eyes)" which means insight into<br/>
appraising things or a natural talent.<br/>
"Shine" in both phrases can only be used in connection to eyes and not<br/>
anything else.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936200888">That whole thing about how neat Saito was reminds me of the horror stories of women who were married to career military men. Especially those who lived on the bases where the higher ups themselves would come around and inspect the housing of it's personnel. Anyway, it's a common complaint that the husbands become so used to the order and discipline of the military that when they come home they actually give their houses the "white glove" inspection.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine Saito doing that to Tokio?!<br/>

One thing I've always liked about RK Saitou... his general laid back nature and his little "rebelling" at not wearing his jacket completely buttoned-up... kind of like his agreeing to work for the Meiji government (because they need him, obviously), but he's going to hold out on being a *completely* proper Meiji cop as a way of retaining some independence.  How neat can he be when he lets cigarette ash fall all over the place and at least in the manga, fills ashtrays to overflowing?  Ah, but I guess that's Tokio's responsibility, even if she probably did have a maid to do the housework.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196153229">Barb...that was HILARIOUS!!!<br/>
yeah, and Tokio had a career too...how much time could she spend on<br/>
housework?  It is clear that hist. Saitou was a really consistent guy<br/>
set (disciplined) in his ways...he was probably really really strict<br/>
with his sons too.  Soba is really a fast/easy dish to make so I<br/>
wonder if Tokio chose soba as a shortcut to making a real meal :P<br/>

I'm glad N.Watsuki streamlined the design could you imagine how dorky<br/>
SAitou would look in the uniform?  I always loved RK Saitou's<br/>
jacket/collar.<br/>
Phil...I just read that although the French Police placed great<br/>
emphasis on the appearance of their personnel certain ranks were<br/>
allowed to go to work in casual wear (basically high ranking guys note<br/>
the pic of Toshiyoshi Kawaji with arms folded wearing a suit). I<br/>
imagine that if indeed Fujita Goro was somehow involved in information<br/>
gathering (French police ofcourse had an equivalent division basically<br/>
one guy can have as many as 10-20 other guys doing the footwork and he<br/>
would write up a report)...I imagine that he wouldn't have to wear a<br/>
uniform all the time either...only on formal occasions.<br/>
<br/>
[OT SOBA THEORY]<br/>
*I have a hunch based on other Japanese sites about when the group<br/>
which would become the Shinsengumi had to check into inns--they signed<br/>
guestbooks...and back then there was a "tab" system at<br/>
inns/restaurants maybe someone found Saitou's tab at a soba restaurant<br/>
or something (usually sold in stalls like seen in the manga because it<br/>
is a cheap dish but I'm sure some restaurants had it as a specialty).<br/>
 Otherwise why would PMK rip off of RK SAitou's love of soba?  A long<br/>
long time ago I used to post a link to an Aizu tourist type site and<br/>
there was an ad for a noodle dish (soba I think based on the bamboo<br/>
rack thing under the noodles). </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042911705">You bring up a good point Phil... :O)<br/>
Saitou is rebellious in his own "controlled" way. I don't think RK <br/>
Saitou would actually go home and "inspect" the house if it is to his <br/>
liking. But if he did, Barb captured the Hajime x Tokio moment for me.<br/>
At home I think RK Saitou would probably be dong as he just did at <br/>
work and have an ashtray full of cigarette butts... Then Tokio will <br/>
get crosses on her forehead as she smells him smoking inside the <br/>
house again... She'll go into their study room but RK Saitou would <br/>
know right away that he's busted so he either hides the ashtray into <br/>
the drawer (under the table or behind some books) to avoid an <br/>
argument... or make it even more messier and wait for Tokio to come <br/>
in so they can start "bantering" (that's if he's feeling humorous... <br/>
Now all this would be set at night when every door is closed and Mrs. <br/>
Saitou has given instructions not to wake the children by going <br/>
outside and such... because I really do think RK Saitou would be nice <br/>
enough to smoke outside, even if he is a baddie...<br/>
<br/>
Ah well.... Come on and give us your Saisa version Phil...  "Futae no <br/>
Kiwami" isn't enough. ^_^<br/>

Oh, yeah, wounds... go right ahead and start giving me excuses for *more* stories in progress.  :-D  Another one of those ideas that others should fly with... just how strict is RK or PMK Saitou at home?
