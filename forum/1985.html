<h3>NEW big pic of the Nakano sisters</h3>

<br/>
A BIG pic of Takeko (on the left) and Yuuko (on the right) from pp.<br/>
186-187 of "Samurai: The World of the Warrior," by Stephen Turnbull.<br/>
(Otherwise a piece of **** book full of plagiarism and innacuracy, fun<br/>
to make fun of and useful to keep on your shelf to throw at people<br/>
trying to sell you widgets or discount brake fluid)<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:<br/>
<br/>
-Takeko's eyebrows are shaved.<br/>
<br/>
-Takeko has hiked up her kimono and is tying it in place.<br/>
<br/>
-True to Yuuko's memoirs, Takeko has tried to spare her from battle,<br/>
so she (Yuuko) looks a lot more clean.<br/>
<br/>
-Both sisters are wearing old Japanese-style lip gloss (I hesitate to<br/>
call it 'lipstick')<br/>
<br/>
-Both sisters are barefoot.<br/>
<br/>
-Takeko's kimono design is simpler, showing that she's older than<br/>
Yuuko, whose kimono is more colorful.<br/>
<br/>
-Another sign of Yuuko's younger age is her hair reaching down to the<br/>
middle of her back.<br/>
<br/>
And other stuff (I'm in a bit of a rush now ^^)<br/>
