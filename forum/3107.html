<h3>For all SHQ Members</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-420783826">Dear SHQ members, recently I became acquainted with a programmer who is<br/>
willing to assist in the installation of a database to the website to<br/>
increase its functionality.<br/>
The new look of the site, designed by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ai-dax.com">http://www.ai-dax.com</a> will not<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of many ongoing projects at the SHQ which include:<br/>
<br/>
1) addressing the backlog of history related updates contributed by<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa<br/>
2) updating the site with more info (contributions by secretarytocapt3<br/>
and also Michael, again there is a backlog of info I have to update)<br/>
3) ofcourse any new contributions from the public and members of this<br/>
community<br/>
4) continue to install the new ai-dax layout to each and every page on<br/>
the site (this is a labor intensive process which I have still not yet<br/>
completed)<br/>
and now we have this new technical based matter which presented itself<br/>
<br/>
the programmer is not charging a huge amount for labor costs (she is<br/>
not charging a per hour rate or anything) and I have explained the<br/>
circumstance<br/>
of SHQ...we are all just fans, completely not for profit and run by<br/>
volunteers and we have NO BUDGET (other than what we force Barb to pay for<br/>
us ^_^).<br/>
<br/>
However she is going to use some and software and perhaps acquire new<br/>
software to make the process easier (again we aren't paying for that<br/>
either<br/>
and she uses a university computer lab to do her work).<br/>
<br/>
I myself will be assisting in the construction of a database which<br/>
will power the search engine and therefore have to devote my free time<br/>
in summarizing, through keywords, each and every single page. That is<br/>
why the cost is kept low.<br/>
<br/>
SHQ's mission is fan based but we clearly also have a deep interest in<br/>
this history. As we've slowly gained a better understanding of the<br/>
Shinsengumi's world we realize how rare this information is in English.<br/>
<br/>
So you may ask 'how can I help?"<br/>
<br/>
You can help by contributing any fanwork (fiction, art, parody,<br/>
multimedia) you wish.<br/>
Volunteer to help list keywords for some page.<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
contribute to the flat rate of this project.<br/>
<br/>
The cost of the installation of the database is $40. However, I hope<br/>
to continue to have a professional relationship with her so that she<br/>
can help solve other technical issues which may arise in the future<br/>
and so forth. So I feel that the amount is justifiable.<br/>
<br/>
I will be paying an additional cost on my own to her because I have<br/>
sat down<br/>
with her gone through the site with her already. Basically she has and<br/>
will be putting in alot of time.<br/>
I would pay the $40 on my own however I was unemployed at the end of<br/>
December (but now I am only underemployed) and I cannot handle the<br/>
financial burden on my own. So if people would like to contribute any<br/>
amount please paypal [shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com]. For the sake of<br/>
complete transparency, I can also<br/>
provide a receipt from this programmer who can verify that she has<br/>
received payment from me as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29600295">Dear Charo,<br/>
Fanwork can be defined any way you want (^_^)<br/>
in the past people donated notes, artwork (it doesn't matter if it is<br/>
AU, roleplays...anything!), cosplay photos, fanfic, we also have<br/>
original audio fics and short films and ofcourse the ever valuable<br/>
translations.<br/>
<br/>
The sky is the limit.<br/>
<br/>
In fact there is no need to adhere to any one "universe" such ar<br/>
Kenshin or Peacemaker---if you have your own interpretation we<br/>
certainly want to see it.<br/>
<br/>
You can find examples here:<br/>
<br/>
Makoto Multimedia Dojo<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Fanart (includes spoofs/parodies)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/art.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/art.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Cosplay (includes permanent body art like tattoos)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Fans are encouraged to define what fanwork means to them so AU is more<br/>
than acceptable.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact I really want fans to come up fantasy "book covers" or fantasy<br/>
manga covers.  For example drawing out an entire manga and writing it<br/>
is very time consuming...however we'd like to see what people would<br/>
design for their story's cover---and they can include a one paragraph<br/>
summary of the plot line (Sort of like what would go on the back of<br/>
the book cover).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time for your contribution and participation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking from first-hand experience, installing a database in the<br/>
website that allows for multiple contributors is a great idea, and<br/>
makes everything far easier to manage and update.  I'm not sure what<br/>
type of database you're planning, but I use Wikimedia (of wikipedai<br/>
fame and infamy) on the Samurai Archives (as of August or so of last<br/>
year), and the ability to update instantly on the fly, and to have<br/>
multiple contributors has absolutely revolutionized the website, and<br/>
has given me renewed energy in research, because now I don't have to<br/>
create a "full and polished" article, format it with HTML, manually<br/>
upload it, manually change all of the related pages, etc. That was<br/>
such a chore that even the thought of adding new research to the page<br/>
had been daunting.  The new software is the reason I've been getting<br/>
into the Shinsengumi, it's given me the opportunity to do more<br/>
research with "immediate" results. Counting myself, there are about 3<br/>
people working on the Bakumatsu, and if anyone is interested in given<br/>
me some feedback (or pointing out any glaring errors), I'd really<br/>
apprecite it - Barbara said she wouldn't mind if I mentioned it, so<br/>
here is the "Shinengumi" category (still at least half the articles<br/>
are stubs, but it's a start):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Shinsengumi">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Shinsengumi</a><br/>
<br/>
My goal is to make this the Japanese history version of wikipedia.<br/>
I've always been extremely unhappy with wikipedia's "failure" to cite<br/>
sources with the Japanese history articles, and the overall poor<br/>
quality of many of the articles, so I run a pretty tight ship to keep<br/>
out bad info (and the ShinsengumiHQ makes it clear that academic<br/>
veracity is top priority as well).  Only people I "approve" can<br/>
contribute (I decided to disallow 'anyone' from editing because of<br/>
some vandals and some poor or outright copied articles that kept<br/>
showing up), but if anyone does feel inclined to help out, let me<br/>
know.  I created the wiki as an alternative to Wikipedia, as a public<br/>
database that anyone can use, and although for now most of the<br/>
articles have come from the Samurai Archives, I consider this more of<br/>
a "public forum" (for lack of a better term) than "my website".<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to seeing the new improvements on ShinsengumiHQ as<br/>
well - I'm really looking forward to a streamlined search. The<br/>
shinsengumiHQ is great, but admittedly I have trouble pinpointing what<br/>
I'm looking for - but this could just be because of my own lack of<br/>
knowing exactly what I'm looking for most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm coordinating a "Shinsengumi" research-discussion group<br/>
starting February 10th (which will last a month), which I'd like to<br/>
try and somehow coordinate with this group, since the discussion and<br/>
research will be starting "at the beginning", and most people signed<br/>
up really don't know much about the shinsengumi - so if anyone has any<br/>
ideas on how or what would be a good idea to do on that front, I'd<br/>
appreciate it! A coordinated effort could benefit the shinsengumiHQ as<br/>
well - further discussion and research is always good.  I don't expect<br/>
any groundbreaking discoveries, but based on the last 2 discussion<br/>
groups, it should result in some good foundations for articles and<br/>
help with the "big picture".</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466197923">Dear Kitsuno,<br/>
Thanks for the invite I'm sure people here will certainly jump in on<br/>
the opportunity to learn more.  I was wondering if you could post<br/>
questions here simultaneously with what is going on in your group. <br/>
HOwever answers may not be so quick because yes, we will if possible<br/>
likely find a answer in a text.  In doing so we hope to have people<br/>
walk away with some evidence (ofcourse we do know texts can be faulty<br/>
but atleast we know where details come from).  <br/>
<br/>
Also it has been my past experience that it is good to state up front<br/>
in a discussion that an answer posted by a person (let's take for<br/>
instance a quote from a book) may not always reflect the personal<br/>
opinion of the poster.  <br/>
<br/>
If the bigger picture of the Bakumatsu will be discussed, then that<br/>
would be awesome.  I know that some people on this list may have<br/>
information which has never been mentioned in western texts before. <br/>
The posting of those details may be a bit jarring to many people who<br/>
have been exposed to just the Imperial narrative etc so I don't want<br/>
people to take things personally or take offense.<br/>
<br/>
Will you also summarize the discussion after it is over as well?  That<br/>
would be a good reference for people.<br/>
<br/>
We can link to the discussion thread and announce it on our blog and<br/>
on our updates page if you'd like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since my only available "location" to hold the research/discussion in<br/>
a private "room" in my forum, it's pretty tough to coordinate with<br/>
this group in real time (and inaccessible to people who aren't signed<br/>
up as a member of the discussion), but I will definately post the<br/>
questions here - I'll figure out a way to work it out. When it's done,<br/>
I'll summarize the whole thing, but based on prior discussion groups,<br/>
we could be looking at a dozen pages of text, so I'll probably put it<br/>
together into a PDF or something.<br/>
<br/>
This time around, the focus is just the Shinsengumi, as few people<br/>
seem to know much about them, and I try to keep the groups focused on<br/>
something specific (prior discussions have been on Kofun (burial<br/>
tombs) and the 47 Ronin).  The bakumatsu in general would be too big,<br/>
but since it is the backdrop, the events are important.<br/>
<br/>
And as for stating that posted information from sources doesn't<br/>
necessarily reflect the position of the person posting it, I agree -<br/>
sometimes, for whatever reason, these things can get personal (much to<br/>
my chagrin) but most people tend to accept that a lot of history is<br/>
perception.</div>

Fundoshi.bluelink.jp/ - Do you wanna buy Japanese Fundoshi? You can find<br/>
dandy loincloth here!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd share in case anyone was interesting in perusing the wide<br/>
selection of available fundoshi... or purchasing one for roleplaying<br/>
purposes.  ;)<br/>
