<h3>Here&#39;s a poser...</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063552208">I wonder which side Suzuki fought on during the Seinan if he moved from the Shinsengumi to Satsuma protection?  Some possible scenarios:<br/>
 <br/>
1) he didn't join the police force until after the Seinan (wasn't it discussed here that many of Saigou's Satsuma samurai joined after the Seinan?) and fought with Satsuma forces against the Meiji;<br/>
 <br/>
2) he had as much reason for vengeance as Saitou, only his reasons were directed at Saigou (who, until someone comes forth with evidence against it, I maintain played a part in the destruction of Sagara and the Sekihoutai), and therefore he fought as part of the Meiji forces against Satsuma;<br/>
 <br/>
3) he'd left old animosities behind him (as Saitou *might* have done as well) and gave his support to the Meiji government for the security of Japan;<br/>
 <br/>
4) he stayed out of it completely for personal and/or philosophical reasons (I don't think anything is mentioned of his being involved in the Seinan on the one site we have).<br/>
 <br/>
Any thoughts?  Any information that might point us to the truth?<br/>

<br/>
(I think it became REALLY popular to join the police dept. after<br/>
Seinan...as mentioned in "Remembering Aizu" because everyone needed jobs)<br/>
<br/>

the Sekihoutai), and therefore he fought as part of the Meiji forces<br/>
against Satsuma;<br/>
<br/>
In the bigger picture...the Seihoutai uprising was sooo brief...I<br/>
imagine him changing his name a few times and signing up as a minor<br/>
officer and no one would be suspicious...*in S.H.'s case he was<br/>
already a police officer and the police were a branch of the military<br/>
so technically speaking he had to go<br/>
<br/>
*if Suzuki was already part of the police dept. then he would be in<br/>
the same situation as S.H.---if not then he would have to volunteer<br/>
and I'm sure the gov. was happy to have volunteers (what needs to be<br/>
checked out is if some kind of draft was implemented)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3) he'd left old animosities behind him (as Saitou *might* have done<br/>

of Japan;<br/>
<br/>
Note: since I believe that actions speak louder than words...and<br/>
Suzuki did donate money to build hospitals he was the kind of the<br/>
person who seemed to be in tune with the suffering around him.  After<br/>
all these wars I imagine there were plenty of injured/maimed people so<br/>
he saw the need for hospitals...he and I believe Saitou may not have<br/>
seen themselves as being "Meiji dogs" (as Shishio would put it) but<br/>
public servants.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder why S.H./Suzuki didn't join the military. Perhaps you got<br/>
paid more being a policeman/inspector?  Or because of their experience<br/>
in the Shinsengumi they felt their skills were more effective when<br/>
concentrated in a local area (like modern police they were assigned to<br/>
districts/wards) while the military is on a national scale.<br/>

<br/>
The babelfish didn't say anything about Seinan (or garbled military<br/>
conflict to suggest the Seinan/Satsuma rebellion)...very often the<br/>
fish says "taking to the field" in regards to participating in a battle.<br/>
<br/>
Any information that might point us to the truth?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>NOne of the Shinsengumi sites which strive to be comprehensive mention<br/>
him...the site I found was the only one...the best bet is root arond<br/>
the big sites and read their message boards</div>
