 </span></blockquote>Captain Sagara would like to remind everyone that he and the Somo Roshitai are always looking for opportunities to set fires and create general mayhem.  Being oppressed?  Figure your literary efforts are at least as good as Shinsengumi Vice Commander Hijikata's?  Trouble with bakufu pests?  Contact Saigou Takamori to make arrangements.  All forms of cash taken (literally).  In an emergency, contact Suzuki Mikisaburou, our Shinsengumi representative, in Kyoto.<br/>

will be in one of the presentations scheduled for this<br/>
month, hopefully it will be over before 6:00 pm.<br/>
Perhaps I will end up showing a little later (like<br/>
8:00 pm?), but I will try my best to show up.<br/>
<br/>
As I am a bit ahead of schedule in my translations and<br/>
in my preparatives, I hope I will have some time to<br/>
chat. I tried the chat applet and it worked fine, so I<br/>
shouldn't have any problem with connection or the<br/>
like.<br/>
