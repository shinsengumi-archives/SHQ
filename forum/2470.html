<div id="ygrps-yiv-541671921">With regards to Hillsborough&#39;s new book, I was planning on buying it  <br/>
directly from the Manhattan Kinokuniya. They first had it listed in their  computer <br/>
that it would arrive by April 30, but the last time I went back  there (around <br/>
two weeks ago), they said it would be available on July 30.  Apparently <br/>
Hillsborough is in frequent contact with the store, but since he&#39;s  not publishing <br/>
it himself, its release is delayed. Hopefully they will have it  by the end of <br/>
this month.<br/>
