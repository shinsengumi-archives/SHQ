<br/>
things to think about:  <br/>
<br/>
[1928] Did Shimozawa Kan&#39;s book &quot;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&quot; (the<br/>
Particulars of the Shinsengumi) lead to the FIRST EVER SHINSENGUMI<br/>
MOVIE?  (silent film)<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s an idea for film majors out there---a short, campy black and<br/>
white silent Shinsengumi movie (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
note:<br/>
<br/>
[1913] Nagakura gave an oral history to a journalist beginning in<br/>
1911. His words were later published in the &quot;Hotaru Shinbun over a<br/>
three-month period in 1913...and embellished by the vivid imagination<br/>
of the journalist...Nagakura&#39;s more historically accurate written<br/>
memoirs constitute the only firsthand account of the five-year history<br/>
of the Shinsengumi. Long before his newspaper inteview, Nagakura had<br/>
lent his written memoirs to an acquaintance...they were never<br/>
returned.&quot; (Hillsborough 184)<br/>
<br/>
[1998] the more historically accurate written account by Nagakura were<br/>
*****discovered and published Shinsengumi senjo nikki :Nagakura<br/>
Shinpachi &quot;Roshi Bunkyu hokoku kiji&quot; o yomu by Sachihiko Kimura;<br/>
Shinpachi Nagakura isbn 4569603335<br/>
<br/>
*****photos of the book were posted on the internet and even had<br/>
post-it notes on it (-_-)  ::thinking:: &quot;shouldn&#39;t they be careful<br/>
with a historical document?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
yet Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki which was LESS accurate is MORE popular<br/>
why?<br/>
because what the audience/researcher/fan is exposed to FIRST matters<br/>
most it seems<br/>
<br/>
If you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp">http://www.amazon.co.jp</a> insert the isbn 4569603335 the<br/>
1998 book (republished in 2003) as of the time I enhanced the timeline<br/>
does not have *one *single review....MANY OTHER Shinsengumi books on<br/>
Amazon have been reviewed by fans thus, the more sensational version<br/>
of anything is more popular<br/>
<br/>
if only I had the money I would love to get this &quot;dry&quot; boring account<br/>
by Nagakura translated!<br/>
<br/>
A case of irony:<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi (Aizu Samurai) wrote a book detailing the role of the<br/>
domain in KYoto and outlined the security structure (very relevant to<br/>
the SHinsengumi) etc, the book is the first attempt by Aizu to<br/>
represent itself in &quot;history&quot; (even Nagakura himself would&#39;ve known<br/>
that his oral narration printed in the newspaper would not be taken<br/>
seriously).  Yamakawa Hiroshi was &quot;interviewed&quot; by the IMperial Guard<br/>
because no doubt his book was provocative.  It was published YEARS<br/>
after he died and even Conrad Totman discuseed this work.  <br/>
<br/>
Irony, the imperial guard couldn&#39;t keep it from the public and in fact<br/>
you can buy it on Amazon right now!<br/>

if you look to the left there should be a bunch of Shinsengumi books<br/>
