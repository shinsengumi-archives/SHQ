<h3>DAI-BOSATSU TOGE (final word on the NOVEL)</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432846703">Dai-Bosatsu Toge<br/>
Great Bodhisattva Pass<br/>
Translated by C.S. Bavier<br/>
By Kaizan Nakazato (1885-1944)<br/>
<br/>
Page 237<br/>
gRyunosuke remained as silent as a forest in snow, and as cool as <br/>
coolness could be.h<br/>
<br/>
I have posted about the movie SWORD OF DOOM directed by Kihachi <br/>
Okamoto starring Tatsuya Nakada and Toshiro Mifune *several* times <br/>
(^_^) SO GO OUT AND RENT IT ON VHS, OR BUY IT FROM AMAZON OR VIEW IT <br/>
ON CABLE but now having finished reading the novel (what was <br/>
translated so far) I realize that it is MORE significant than I first <br/>
thoughtc.the book is hard to find...printed in 1929 few libraries on <br/>
the translation (-_-)<br/>
<br/>
Go to FILES Daibosatsu Excerpt.pdf from k_closson2001<br/>
<br/>
I uploaded scans from the novel DAIBOSATSU TOGE: Great Bodhisattva <br/>
Pass in the Pictures file as please take a look herec.<br/>
Go to FILES Dai-bosatsu Toge from secretarytocapt3 <br/>
<br/>
Now back to the movie.  The film is restricted by time restraints <br/>
while the novel itself is EXTREMELY long and filled with lots and <br/>
lots of action!!!!, martial lore, the origin of swords and lineages <br/>
of various schoolc.and a whole lot **more** Shinsengumi narrative.<br/>
<br/>
*the entire novel has not been translated into Englishcfortunately <br/>
all the parts dealing with the NEW CHOSEN GROUP (the name used by the <br/>
translator) are in English (^_^) for us to read.<br/>
<br/>
*the book calls ronin/roshi groverh or gdetachedh samuraicso the <br/>
translation is kind of literal at times which is pretty good<br/>
*the novel is historically accurate in describing the political <br/>
situation, the role of Matsudaira Katamori and the difficult <br/>
situation Aizu was in <br/>
HOWEVER what I donft understand is why the author felt that the war <br/>
of 1868 was peaceful, I also read in another book how Boshin was <br/>
pretty gpeacefulh as wellc.scarycI guess it was pretty peaceful <br/>
minus Ueno Hill (Edo), Aizu, Hakodate and all the little skirmishes <br/>
here and there which killed a couple thousand<br/>
*Tsukue Ryunosuke was a REAL person, so was Shichibei the thief (seen <br/>
in the movie) there are folk stories surrounding this thief tooc.<br/>
*the novelist has an odd stylecwhen describing all the chambers of <br/>
Shimabara in detail hefll add his opinion that the buildings should <br/>
be preserved for future generations which means he must have toured <br/>
these locations<br/>
<br/>
MissB the reference to Kondo and Hijikatafs personality are all from <br/>
this bookc.Hijikata NEVER forgets or forgivescc.<br/>
<br/>
M as you pointed out before Shimabara was the location of Shiro <br/>
Amakusafs revolt 1637c.according to this novel in 1641 the pleasure <br/>
quarters in Kyoto were moved and people were so excited they <br/>
nicknamed the place Shimabara, because the rebellion was still fresh <br/>
on their mindsc  page 264 gOne is struck with the strangeness of <br/>
fate that the memory of the Christian Persecution is born by the name <br/>
of a license quarters!h<br/>
<br/>
Examples (which will make perfect sense if you watch the film SWORD <br/>
OF DOOM)<br/>
<br/>
Tsukue Ryunosuke first joins the New Chosen Group because he was from <br/>
the same region as Hijikata and Kondo (and youfll see Kondo and <br/>
Hijikata at the Mt. MItake duel)<br/>
Matsu (omatsu) the heroine in the movie is adopted by Miyukidayu <br/>
(Miyuki Tayu) Kondofs womanc.Matsu was the little girl whose <br/>
grandfather was killed by Tsuke right at the beginning of the movie <br/>
at the mountain top<br/>
<br/>
Utsuki Bunnojo, older brother of Hyoma, knew Hijikata Toshizo<br/>
<br/>
Utsuki Hyoma the hero whose older brother was killed by Tsukue <br/>
Ryunosuke (the main character) during a duel at Mt. Mitake, joins the <br/>
NEW CHOSEN GROUP, spends time meditating in Mibudera and even gets <br/>
dragged to Shimabara in the entire chapter devoted to gMibu & <br/>
Shimabarahcand even receives a warning from Kondo<br/>
<br/>
There is an odd character names Yamazaki Yuzuru of Mito, who tried to <br/>
recruit Ryunosuke early in the novel,  his favorite weapon was the <br/>
Katori Ryu quarter-staffc.what totally caught my attention was that <br/>
he kept changing outfitsc.just like Yamazaki Susumucthen finally the <br/>
writer finally says  Yamazaki Yuzuru arrives at headquarters to <br/>
listen about how a thief, the kleptomaniac Shichibei, stole money <br/>
from the New Chosen Groupfs accounting officec. (page 286) gYamazaki <br/>
was very skilled at spying, going about in disguise, upon eroverf <br/>
and edetachedf samurai of different clans.  But Yamazaki Susumu was <br/>
supposed to be from Osaka from what I understand NOT Mito.  This may <br/>
be an example of historical inaccuracies in this book.<br/>
<br/>
As in the movie you will meet Serizawa Kamo, Kondo Isami, Hijikata <br/>
Toshizo (the author pointed out that Toshi was eshortf and agile)<br/>
c.but the book mentions Okita as well but he isnft the ggirlyh man <br/>
we are used to seeing anime or mangac.(page 286) gSoji Okita of the <br/>
New Chosen had been boasting of his strength for some time, and he <br/>
now went to that extent that he wanted a wrestler to get down to the <br/>
garden for a bout. Okita gHey, letfs see who is the better man,h he <br/>
said and he stamped his feet bringing his seat well down as the <br/>
wrestlers do before a bout.h<br/>
So imagine PMK challenging a sumo wrestler (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
There are so many passages dealing with the Shinsengumi I canft <br/>
possibly type them all up!!!!  THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES in the <br/>
movie and the book especially the assassination of Serizawa Kamo <br/>
(which was not shown in the film).<br/>
<br/>
Now before I rant about how totally AWESOME this novel is, how the <br/>
author should have been an action film director and why this would be <br/>
the all time greatest manga everc.Ifll just start my mini <br/>
photocopying project and make all 300 pages available to people who <br/>
email mec.<br/>

Page 320<br/>
gThe colour of the eyes of Ryunosuke was something like a pearl sunk <br/>
in the water.  When the water was clear the eyes shone sharp.  When <br/>
the water was not clear, the eyes were dull.  They were alike coldly <br/>
and gloomily lustrous whether they shone sharp or looked dim.  Now <br/>
his eyes lost that peculiar lustre.h<br/>
<br/>
Every swordsman in this novel has gshinyh eyesc.Kondofs eyes shine <br/>
all the time<br/>
IT IS A REAL shame Ryunosuke and Saito did not meet because the <br/>
character of NHK Saito is VERY similar to Ryunosukec.they both speak <br/>
gcoollyh</div>

Huh?! Then somehow we saw two VERY different &quot;Sword of Doom&quot; movies with <br/>
Toshiro Mifune...<br/>
<br/>
In the movie, Serizawa and Ryunosuke are off in that room with all the bamboo <br/>
screens (?) and Serizawa is telling him he wants him to kill Kondo. &quot;After <br/>
that, Hijikata will be easy to control...&quot; (Yeah, that&#39;s what the Meiji <br/>
government thought too.)  They catch some girl spying on them (for that Utsuki Hyoma <br/>
guy), Ryunosuke says he&#39;ll dispose of her, and Serizawa  leaves. Ryu-chan very <br/>
kindly decides to let her live and tells her she just has to stay there a <br/>
short while.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Hijikata, Kondo, and I -think- Yamanami (or was it Okita?) were <br/>
off in their own little corner and Hijikata is telling Kondo they should go <br/>
ahead and finish off Serizawa.  At some point, in the middle of that weird little <br/>
scene where the girl thinks she sees the ghost of a murdered woman and <br/>
Ryunosuke starts going nuts, it flips over briefly to Hijikata and the others rushing <br/>
into the room Serizawa is sleeping in and killing him. Then it goes back to <br/>
Ryunosuke, who is slashing everything in sight (blinds, Shinsengumi, etc.) and <br/>
screaming &quot;Serizawa! I&#39;ll do it! I&#39;ll kill Kondo for you! Serizawa!&quot; Then it <br/>
just ends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m told there is a sequel to this movie, which I have yet to see. I&#39;m <br/>
wondering how anyone who was stabbed as many times as Ryunosuke was could possibly <br/>
have survived...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679919364">Yes MissB is right they did kill Serizawa in the Kihachi Okamoto <br/>
version of the film (I think it&#39;s time for me to watch the film <br/>
again for the 5th time)...it is different in the novel and as soon <br/>
as I get done scanning it then you guys can read it...<br/>
<br/>
I used to see &quot;screenshots&quot; and essays on the silent version of the <br/>
film done in a very traditional stage style and I frequently get <br/>
them mixed up (^_^) but yeah the Tatsuya Nakadai version is my <br/>
absolute favorite</div>

SATAN&#39;s SWORD<br/>

but it is considerably less well known compared to the one directed <br/>

<br/>
Raizo Ichikawa if you all recall also starred in the <br/>
film &quot;shinsengumi chronicles&quot; also known as &quot;I want to die a <br/>

in the film ENJO (available on dvd everywhere) co-starring Tatsuya <br/>
Nakadai <br/>

 Dai-bosatsu Toge :<br/>
Great Bodhisattva Pass / <br/>
Author: Nakazato, Kaizan, 1885-1944.<br/>
Publication: Tokyo : Shunjusha, 1929<br/>
Document: English (Show vernacular) : Book : Fiction <br/>
Libraries Worldwide: 11   <br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s right folks only 11 libraries *WORLDWIDE* willing to lend it <br/>
out (my copy is from 1929)...and its took over 1 week for my copy to <br/>
travel across the country to me so if you do download the novel <br/>
consider providing it to someone who studies modern literature...I <br/>
actually spoke to a graduate student who gave me a weird look when I <br/>
mentioned this book...he obviously NEVER heard of it and he <br/>
specializes in modern Japanese literature!<br/>
<br/>
The numerous stage/film versions of this novel has GREATLY IMPACTED <br/>
how people view the Bakumatsu and Shinsengumi in general and as soon <br/>
as the characters enter Mibu you willl notice how certain <br/>
descriptions of Kondo and Hijikata have been continued into our own <br/>
time period in various media...it&#39;s overall value is obvious...and <br/>
you heard it from me first any manga artist/writer who can revive <br/>
this story is going to make serious $$$<br/>
