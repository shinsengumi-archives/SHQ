<br/>
Yes, all of them were samurai, mainly from Satsuma, as far as I<br/>
understand (as it says in the RK manga, vol. 1). As for recognizing<br/>
Saitou-- didn&#39;t he change his name? And besides, it&#39;s not like there<br/>
were photos of him from his Shinsengumi days...so I don&#39;t think many<br/>
former Ishin Shishi would&#39;ve recognized him...<br/>

<h3><a href="#msg-145">&gt;</a> Aizu & Satsuma Samurai in the TMPD</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-826290852">According to the book &quot;Remembering Aizu The Testament of Shiba <br/>
Goro&quot; it is mentioned that many former Aizu samurai joined the police <br/>
force...as soon as the Seinan War (aka Satsuma Rebellion) started (Gov. <br/>
vs. Rebelling Satsuma forces led by Saigo Takamori) many of these <br/>
policemen -gladly- participated (as a way of seeking revenge for what <br/>
happened to the Aizu domain)...once the Satsuma Rebellion was <br/>
suppressed former -Satsuma- samurai joined the police force.  <br/>
<br/>
Thus, historical Saitou initially was surrounded by former comrades and <br/>
later former enemies.  So, my guess is some people, perhaps his <br/>
superiors, probably knew him.  And as mentioned by other members <br/>
here, who would want to tap on Fujita Goro&#39;s shoulder and say &quot;don&#39;t I <br/>
know you from somewhere?&quot; :)  <br/>
<br/>
Note: Saitou&#39;s boss Kawajii was himself a former Satsuma samurai.<br/>

Archive under Files.  Title&#39;s &quot;Kitaku.&quot;  That&#39;s how I chose to move <br/>

by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-552496513">Shimazu M., I just replied but when you get the book, near the end <br/>
you&#39;ll come upon the detail about the police dept. needing to recruit lots <br/>
of people because all the former Aizu samurai (now policemen) leave to <br/>
fight in the Seinan War.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think former Ishin Shishi would recognize him because the <br/>
Shinsengumi did wear protective head gear -and- we can&#39;t forget they <br/>
did do alot of fighting at night :)  Besides verbal descriptions can be <br/>
innaccurate as we all know by now...and  historical Saitou&#39;s crosstraining <br/>
in more than one lineage made it hard for people to use his martial arts <br/>
as a way of identifiying him (even if they did see him fight in let&#39;s say <br/>
the police dept. sponsored kenjutsu tournaments).<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m betting that his former Aizu comrades could recognize him...<br/>
because on the battlefield everything is happening so fast HOWEVER if <br/>
you were hanging out at a camp or catching up on news during a <br/>
perimeter patrol...you can actually SEE the person you are talking to etc. <br/>
Even if hundreds and hundreds of combatants participated in the <br/>
defense of the Aizu domain I&#39;m sure many people would take interest in <br/>
the Shinsengumi forces from Kyoto.<br/>

I&#39;m *really* glad to hear you&#39;re taking on the challenge.  This can <br/>
be so much fun... like an early Christmas for the Shinsengumi fan.  <br/>
November 8th we can log on and open up new fanfic. (And it&#39;ll be new <br/>
to me, too, &#39;cause I won&#39;t be reading it until everyone else does.  <br/>
Screwy formats won&#39;t be *my* fault.)  It&#39;s always better to get more <br/>

&gt;I think I&#39;m very confused... and it seems like I&#39;m missing a post<br/>
&gt;somewhere...  I didn&#39;t make the comment Masayoshi included below.  Is<br/>
&gt;anyone else having problems with list mail getting to your mailbox<br/>
&gt;VERY late, showing up out of order, and replies not always showing up<br/>
&gt;on the list site as quickly as usual?<br/>

November 8th we can log on and open up new fanfic. (And it&#39;ll be new to me, too, &#39;cause I won&#39;t be reading it until everyone else does. Screwy formats won&#39;t be *my* fault.)  It&#39;s always better to get more <br/>

you&#39;ll come upon the detail about the police dept. needing to recruit lots <br/>
of people because all the former Aizu samurai (now policemen) leave to <br/>
fight in the Seinan War.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think former Ishin Shishi would recognize him because the <br/>
Shinsengumi did wear protective head gear -and- we can&#39;t forget they <br/>
did do alot of fighting at night :)  Besides verbal descriptions can be <br/>
innaccurate as we all know by now...and  historical Saitou&#39;s crosstraining <br/>
in more than one lineage made it hard for people to use his martial arts <br/>
as a way of identifiying him (even if they did see him fight in let&#39;s say <br/>
the police dept. sponsored kenjutsu tournaments).<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m betting that his former Aizu comrades could recognize him...<br/>
because on the battlefield everything is happening so fast HOWEVER if <br/>
you were hanging out at a camp or catching up on news during a <br/>
perimeter patrol...you can actually SEE the person you are talking to etc. <br/>
Even if hundreds and hundreds of combatants participated in the <br/>
defense of the Aizu domain I&#39;m sure many people would take interest in <br/>
the Shinsengumi forces from Kyoto.<br/>

&gt; Yes, all of them were samurai, mainly from Satsuma, as far as I<br/>
&gt; understand (as it says in the RK manga, vol. 1). As for recognizing<br/>
&gt; Saitou-- didn&#39;t he change his name? And besides, it&#39;s not like there<br/>
&gt; were photos of him from his Shinsengumi days...so I don&#39;t think many<br/>
