<br/>
Yes, all of them were samurai, mainly from Satsuma, as far as I<br/>
understand (as it says in the RK manga, vol. 1). As for recognizing<br/>
Saitou-- didn't he change his name? And besides, it's not like there<br/>
were photos of him from his Shinsengumi days...so I don't think many<br/>
former Ishin Shishi would've recognized him...<br/>

<h3>Aizu & Satsuma Samurai in the TMPD</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-826290852">According to the book "Remembering Aizu The Testament of Shiba <br/>
Goro" it is mentioned that many former Aizu samurai joined the police <br/>
force...as soon as the Seinan War (aka Satsuma Rebellion) started (Gov. <br/>
vs. Rebelling Satsuma forces led by Saigo Takamori) many of these <br/>
policemen -gladly- participated (as a way of seeking revenge for what <br/>
happened to the Aizu domain)...once the Satsuma Rebellion was <br/>
suppressed former -Satsuma- samurai joined the police force.  <br/>
<br/>
Thus, historical Saitou initially was surrounded by former comrades and <br/>
later former enemies.  So, my guess is some people, perhaps his <br/>
superiors, probably knew him.  And as mentioned by other members <br/>
here, who would want to tap on Fujita Goro's shoulder and say "don't I <br/>
know you from somewhere?" :)  <br/>
<br/>
Note: Saitou's boss Kawajii was himself a former Satsuma samurai.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710493530">Well, I've got a story in progress that's flip-flopping between 1878 <br/>

Archive under Files.  Title's "Kitaku."  That's how I chose to move <br/>
between the two broad timelines.  Then there's the VERY <br/>
confusing "Nakushita Kikai" that moves around different points in the <br/>
same day.  That's two examples of how it's done. (Degree of success <br/>
is open to debate.)  Others have done it, too.  Anyone have any other <br/>

<h3>Re: Aizu & Satsuma Samurai in the TMPD</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-552496513">Shimazu M., I just replied but when you get the book, near the end <br/>
you'll come upon the detail about the police dept. needing to recruit lots <br/>
of people because all the former Aizu samurai (now policemen) leave to <br/>
fight in the Seinan War.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think former Ishin Shishi would recognize him because the <br/>
Shinsengumi did wear protective head gear -and- we can't forget they <br/>
did do alot of fighting at night :)  Besides verbal descriptions can be <br/>
innaccurate as we all know by now...and  historical Saitou's crosstraining <br/>
in more than one lineage made it hard for people to use his martial arts <br/>
as a way of identifiying him (even if they did see him fight in let's say <br/>
the police dept. sponsored kenjutsu tournaments).<br/>
<br/>
But I'm betting that his former Aizu comrades could recognize him...<br/>
because on the battlefield everything is happening so fast HOWEVER if <br/>
you were hanging out at a camp or catching up on news during a <br/>
perimeter patrol...you can actually SEE the person you are talking to etc. <br/>
Even if hundreds and hundreds of combatants participated in the <br/>
defense of the Aizu domain I'm sure many people would take interest in <br/>
the Shinsengumi forces from Kyoto.<br/>

Honestly, November 8 seems like SO FAR AWAY, but I know it'll be here <br/>
before I know it or even want it to.  I'll probably still be writing <br/>
it on November 7.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm *really* glad to hear you're taking on the challenge.  This can <br/>
be so much fun... like an early Christmas for the Shinsengumi fan.  <br/>
November 8th we can log on and open up new fanfic. (And it'll be new <br/>
to me, too, 'cause I won't be reading it until everyone else does.  <br/>
Screwy formats won't be *my* fault.)  It's always better to get more <br/>
than less, right?  Isn't that the way Christmas works?  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm *really* glad to hear you're taking on the challenge.  This can be so much fun... like an early Christmas for the Shinsengumi fan.  November 8th we can log on and open up new fanfic. (And it'll be new to me, too, 'cause I won't be reading it until everyone else does. Screwy formats won't be *my* fault.)  It's always better to get more <br/>
than less, right?  Isn't that the way Christmas works?  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my case, it's a matter of Masayoshi being the best dictionary <br/>
around because I can get *phrases*, not just words... and often a <br/>
little language/cultural usage history as well.  I could never have <br/>
done what I wanted to do in my story without that resource.  <sending <br/>

you'll come upon the detail about the police dept. needing to recruit lots <br/>
of people because all the former Aizu samurai (now policemen) leave to <br/>
fight in the Seinan War.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think former Ishin Shishi would recognize him because the <br/>
Shinsengumi did wear protective head gear -and- we can't forget they <br/>
did do alot of fighting at night :)  Besides verbal descriptions can be <br/>
innaccurate as we all know by now...and  historical Saitou's crosstraining <br/>
in more than one lineage made it hard for people to use his martial arts <br/>
as a way of identifiying him (even if they did see him fight in let's say <br/>
the police dept. sponsored kenjutsu tournaments).<br/>
<br/>
But I'm betting that his former Aizu comrades could recognize him...<br/>
because on the battlefield everything is happening so fast HOWEVER if <br/>
you were hanging out at a camp or catching up on news during a <br/>
perimeter patrol...you can actually SEE the person you are talking to etc. <br/>
Even if hundreds and hundreds of combatants participated in the <br/>
defense of the Aizu domain I'm sure many people would take interest in <br/>
the Shinsengumi forces from Kyoto.<br/>
