<br/>
There are three story arcs so far in the first five volumes of Shura No<br/>
Toki.  (Vol 6 is due to be released in September.)  It&#39;s the third of those<br/>
arcs that deals with the Bakumatsu and includes the Shinsengumi.  The series<br/>
as a whole follows the practitioners of a particular unarmed fighting style<br/>
called Mutsu Enmei.  Each arc is about a different character and it jumps<br/>
generations between the arcs.  In fact, it jumps nearly 200 years between<br/>
the second and third arcs, so there&#39;s no characters in common there, and the<br/>
only plot association between them is that the earlier arcs helped establish<br/>
the Mutsu Enmei style as legendary.  With such a loose association between<br/>
arcs, there&#39;s no problem with starting at the beginning of any one of them.<br/>
If you want to begin with the Bakumatsu arc, you should start at the<br/>
beginning of volume 4:<br/>

The link Secretary provided above is actually to Volume 5, which continues<br/>
this arc.  (Although strangely, the Amazon listing doesn&#39;t specify its<br/>
volume number).<br/>
<br/>
The third arc is excellent.  Aside from including the Shinsengumi (which of<br/>
course is what drew me to the series in the first place) it presents the<br/>
best view of the history of the period I&#39;ve seen attempted in an anime.  The<br/>
lead character, Mutsu Izumi, becomes close friends with Sakamoto Ryoma, and<br/>
it follows his endeavors throughout the revolution.<br/>
<br/>
The first two arcs are also fun to watch, but they&#39;re not nearly as<br/>
impressive as the Bakumatsu arc, probably because they aren&#39;t dealing with<br/>
such a turbulent historical era.  (They take place about 20 years apart,<br/>
both in the early years of the Tokugawa shogunate, in order to pit the lead<br/>
characters against first Miyamoto Musashi, and then Yagyu Juubei.)<br/>
<br/>
Because the Amazon listings are sort of confusing (such as not consistently<br/>
including volume numbers), here&#39;s which is which:<br/>
Volume 1 (cheaper version):<br/>

Volume 1 (expensive version):<br/>

It&#39;s not clear from the descriptions why there are two different versions of<br/>
the first volume.  Presumably the more expensive of the two is probably a<br/>
special edition or maybe includes a series box or something, but I don&#39;t<br/>
really know what its extra features are.<br/>
