<h3>SHQ New Look and Technical Issues</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-121639254">Hello,<br/>
As I mentioned before <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ai-dax.com">http://www.ai-dax.com</a> donated a new template <br/>
for us...  you can take a look here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a><br/>
<br/>
however, my question to anyone out there is this:<br/>
-the SHQ server does have a database option<br/>
-SHQ has a shocking 79 pages (which over time may be reduced, <br/>
streamlined and consolidated whatever you call it)<br/>
-Does anyone know how to build a database driven website?<br/>
-if so can you just explain it to me?  because I read stuff online <br/>
and it doesn't make sense (^_^) you can email me at secretarytocapt3<br/>
(a)hotmail.com  we can set up a chat time <br/>
<br/>
we got the info! (actually we are back logged 3 months, during this <br/>
entire time of NO UPDATES on SHQ.com people like Hirotada Tokugawa <br/>
and myself have amassed even more info...like alot really ^_^ as <br/>
usual we await more contributions from anyone on this list or the <br/>
general public, be it fan-work, fanfic fanart cosplay you name it, <br/>
you can post here, email the site and so forth) <br/>
<br/>
we got the graphics!  (the spiffy art)<br/>
<br/>
but we need to make our site more "sleek"<br/>
<br/>
if we can really do a good job with SHQ, future fans which may <br/>
arrive in the future won't have to start with point "A" (as we've <br/>
had to do), they can just read some of our pages and then move on <br/>
quickly to learn whatever they are most interested in...so we need a <br/>
strong layout to make that all happen<br/>
<br/>
with a strong layout the webmaster can cut back time on the manual <br/>
work required in updating and instead use the time for research (I'm <br/>
down to like 6 months where I have access to a research library, so <br/>
for me personally I just want to get an understanding of the history-<br/>
--the manga and stuff I can buy LATER when I have money).<br/>
  <br/>
So if you see alot of "nerd" history stuff on SHQ, that is because I <br/>
am using what I have at my disposal. If you hear otherwise that SHQ <br/>
is not "into" pop-culture then it is a simple misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>

General Announcement<br/>
--------------------<br/>
As you may know Youtube was purchased by Google, thus it discourages <br/>
the posting of copyright material<br/>
for example, if you post a clip of anime being broadcasted in <br/>
Japan---you will get in trouble etc etc<br/>
we don't want anyone to have to deal with legal issues (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Even though Youtube's upcoming policy and strict enforcement will <br/>
really annoy many of us---this may force us to create our own <br/>
Shinsengumi films<br/>
<br/>
oh no...Shinsengumi finger puppets (^_^)</div>
