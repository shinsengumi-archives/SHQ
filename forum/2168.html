<h3>Hillsborough book status?</h3>
by <i>sherlinelee</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-29750962">I tried to order the Shinsengumi book from Romulus Hillsborough off <br/>
Amazon and received (when I began to play my order) an April/May <br/>
target shipping date. This caught me off guard as the book was <br/>
technically supposed to have been released in the second half of <br/>
January.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you tried to dialogue with Ridgeback Press to find out <br/>
the situation?  Their website hasn't updated with anything regarding <br/>
the upcoming release.<br/>
<br/>
I find it rather puzzling... if anything, I would expect RP to have <br/>
excerpts or something to prompt folks to order the book.<br/>
<br/>
Thx.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242811971">Yikes. Let me answer my own question. It seems that the information <br/>
has been updated.<br/>
<br/>
The new date appears to be April 30, 2005 as opposed to Jan 15.<br/>
<br/>
There is now a preview option available on the Amazon listing as well <br/>

(which I _think_ Hillsborough owns or is affiliated with)<br/>
