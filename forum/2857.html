<h3>The Two Rintaro&#39;s</h3>
by <i>sevenofwiki</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-985801444">Mori, p.10, line 1-2<br/>
"one was Inoue Rintaro Gentsune(sp?), whom bought his samurai status (from the Okita <br/>
family) after Okita Katsujiro's death on (lunar calendar) October 20, 1845..."<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p.10, line 3-4<br/>
"Inoue Sozo's younger brother, Rintaro Fusamasa (Rintaro Gentsune's nephew) became an <br/>
adopted son/son-in-law (of the Okita family) to be the head of the Okita family..."<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p.10, line 12-13<br/>
"Based on the family record, it is supposed that Rintaro Fusamasa's father-in-law, aka <br/>
Soji's (step-)father, Rintaro Gentsune, died in 1852. His wife, Soji's mother, died on (lunar <br/>
calendar) Auguest 8, 1862..."<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p.12 line 6<br/>
"During the Shieikan Period... Soji called Rintaro (Fusamasa) 'big brother, big brother'..."<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p,13 line 3<br/>
"Okita Soji's biological father was Katsujiro, as recorded previously, who had died early <br/>
and left (him)..."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From what I could gather, a) Okita Soji's biological father was indeed Katsujiro; b) it is a <br/>
fact that Rintaro Fusamasa was Katsujiro's adopted son; c) there were in fact two Okita <br/>
Rintaro's.<br/>
<br/>
I've been wondering whether Rintaro Gentsune had also adopted Rintaro Fusamasa after <br/>
Katsujiro because, a) Okita Soji is listed in the death records at the family temple as being <br/>
the "2nd son of Okita Rintaro"; b) Soji called Rintaro "big brother" in adulthood; <br/>
c) It's believed that Rintaro Fusamasa was Rintaro Gentsune's son-in-law.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't take the above guess as a fact.  There's indeed no mention of Rintaro Genji's <br/>
adoption of Rintaro Fusamasa as Shimazu Masayoshi has mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
~Seven<br/>
<br/>
PS. In regard of the first Rintaro's formal given name/middle name, I'm really not sure <br/>
whether it's "Gentsune." It couldn't be "Genji" as Shimazu Masayoshi has pointed out. <br/>

Thank you for posting those pages, and for the insights into this data<br/>
which you shared. However, I wanted to comment on your note on the<br/>
Okita Rintaro page at Wikipedia.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >"However, with a family clan name "Fujiwara", this "Fujiwara no<br/>
>Mototsune" would have shared an identical pronunciation with Fujiwara<br/>
>no Mototsune (836-891). Wouldn't a 19th century Japanese man avoid a<br/>
>name like that? If this Inoue Rintaro was born with the formal given<br/>
>name/middle name "Motosune," wouldn't he have also changed it when he<br/>
>changed his name to Okita Rintaro?"<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he received the formal name "Mototsune", it would probably either<br/>
be in honor of that ancestor, or a coincidence. After all, the two<br/>
names are written with different characters, though they're pronounced<br/>
the same-- so there wouldn't be a pressing reason to avoid use of the<br/>
name.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a purely linguistic basis, the name still would be read<br/>
"Mototsune". To pronounce it "Gentsune" would be, at best, irregular,<br/>
as that makes it half "on-yomi" (Sino-Japanese reading) and half<br/>
"kun-yomi" (Japanese reading). I'm not ruling out the possibility of<br/>
this being an exception, as reading Japanese names-- particularly<br/>
premodern ones-- is a tricky business; however, I'm just saying that<br/>
it's not necessarily probable.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, with regards to your information on Rintaro Fusamasa:<br/>
Serizawa Kamo's webpage (Serizawa Kamo being another member of this<br/>
ML)-- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html#,">http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html#,</a><br/>
indicates that at one point, Okita used the formal name "Fusanaga". To<br/>
have a formal name that had a first character "Fusa" would suggest a<br/>
closeness with someone who had the same character in their name--<br/>
which you have brought to our attention as being Rintaro *Fusa*masa,<br/>
as illustrated in the quote from Mori, p. 12, with young Souji calling<br/>
him "Nii-san" (elder brother). <br/>
<br/>
Once again, thank you for your interaction, and for your insight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299483365">Okita Soji's "Fusanaga" is actually "Kaneyoshi." I've confirmed that recently.  Book page are <br/>
available upon request.  Meanwhile, heres the Japanese Okita article at Wikepedia. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/????">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/????</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyways, Thanks for the message, "M". I'll use "Mototsune" from now on until I find any<br/>
evidence agains it. As you probably are aware of, figuring out one's Japanese formal given<br/>
name/middle middle is harder than figuring his family name, given name, or family<br/>
clan name (even for well-educated Japanese.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274624827">Nlf7:<br/>
<br/>
Your point regarding the complexity of name reading is amply<br/>
illustrated by the kanji used to spell "Kaneyoshi". Just by looking at<br/>
the kanji, I can tell that it could be read any of a number of ways:<br/>
"Kaneyoshi", "Fusayoshi", "Fusanaga", "Nobuyoshi", and so on-- the<br/>
confusing nature of which gave rise to Souji's formal name being read<br/>
by some as "Fusanaga". Much like how the characters used to spell the<br/>
last shogun Yoshinobu's name can be read "Yoshihisa", "Yoshinobu", or<br/>
"Keiki"-- which, as I've found in the United States government's<br/>
diplomatic records of that period, confused foreigners to no end.<br/>
<br/>
However, despite the fact that that name should be read "Kaneyoshi",<br/>
what I had said earlier regarding Rintaro Fusamasa still holds true:<br/>
even though the reading is different, the kanji itself-- read "Fusa"<br/>
in Rintaro's case, or "Kane" in Souji's case-- is the same. Which is<br/>
something in support of what you've been saying (as quoted in Mori's<br/>
work) regarding Souji's closeness to Rintaro Fusamasa. Souji may or<br/>
may not have received that kanji from/in honor of Rintaro Fusamasa;<br/>
however, usually in a family, to have two people with the same<br/>
character in their names is not coincidence. Case in point-- (despite<br/>
the fact that in this case, the reading of the character is<br/>
consistent) much of the lineage of the Matsudaira lords of Aizu had<br/>
the character "Kata" in their names (Katasada, Katanobu, Katamori, and<br/>
so on).<br/>
<br/>
As always, my thanks for your efforts.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, the complexity of name reading is amply illustrated by the kanji used to spell <br/>
"Kaneyoshi". I'd always spelt Okita Soji's formal name/middle name as "Kaneyoshi/<br/>
Fusanaga" till recently (like most other formal given names/middle names, it could be read <br/>
more than one way, as you've mentioned.)  Anyways, it's definately "Kaneyoshi," not <br/>
"Fusanaga." On a few occasions, his name was written with Yoshijiro's "yoshi" (not <br/>
by himself, though.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >However, despite the fact that that name should be read "Kaneyoshi", what I had said <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with you 100%.  Please don't take this the wrong way, but is it "Fusamasa" for sure?  <br/>
I haven't been able to confirm that... Maybe it could not be confirmed???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
PS.<br/>
I've just thought of something saved in my Okita folder.<br/>
<br/>
Rintaro's family register (from 1882 or around 1882)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blog.drecom.jp/hinojyukuhonjin_kentoukai/monthly/200506/">http://blog.drecom.jp/hinojyukuhonjin_kentoukai/monthly/200506/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Okita Rintaro is listed as being the the oldest son of the Okita family.<br/>
Okita Mistu is listed as being the the oldest daughter of Kondo Shusuke .)<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
There hasn't been a solid explanation in regard of the fact that Okita Soji is listed in the <br/>
death records at the family temple as being  he "2nd son of Okita Rintaro." What we could <br/>
tell is that both Okita Rintaro's were "retainers" and Rintaro Fusamasa was only going to <br/>
remain as the head of the family until Okita Soji got married.</div>

"Kanemasa", "Nobumasa", or "Nobutada". However, given what you have<br/>
