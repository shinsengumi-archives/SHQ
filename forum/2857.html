<h3>The Two Rintaro&#39;s</h3>
by <i>sevenofwiki</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-985801444">Mori, p.10, line 1-2<br/>
&quot;one was Inoue Rintaro Gentsune(sp?), whom bought his samurai status (from the Okita <br/>
family) after Okita Katsujiro&#39;s death on (lunar calendar) October 20, 1845...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p.10, line 3-4<br/>
&quot;Inoue Sozo&#39;s younger brother, Rintaro Fusamasa (Rintaro Gentsune&#39;s nephew) became an <br/>
adopted son/son-in-law (of the Okita family) to be the head of the Okita family...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p.10, line 12-13<br/>
&quot;Based on the family record, it is supposed that Rintaro Fusamasa&#39;s father-in-law, aka <br/>
Soji&#39;s (step-)father, Rintaro Gentsune, died in 1852. His wife, Soji&#39;s mother, died on (lunar <br/>
calendar) Auguest 8, 1862...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p.12 line 6<br/>
&quot;During the Shieikan Period... Soji called Rintaro (Fusamasa) &#39;big brother, big brother&#39;...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mori, p,13 line 3<br/>
&quot;Okita Soji&#39;s biological father was Katsujiro, as recorded previously, who had died early <br/>
and left (him)...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From what I could gather, a) Okita Soji&#39;s biological father was indeed Katsujiro; b) it is a <br/>
fact that Rintaro Fusamasa was Katsujiro&#39;s adopted son; c) there were in fact two Okita <br/>
Rintaro&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering whether Rintaro Gentsune had also adopted Rintaro Fusamasa after <br/>
Katsujiro because, a) Okita Soji is listed in the death records at the family temple as being <br/>
the &quot;2nd son of Okita Rintaro&quot;; b) Soji called Rintaro &quot;big brother&quot; in adulthood; <br/>
c) It&#39;s believed that Rintaro Fusamasa was Rintaro Gentsune&#39;s son-in-law.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t take the above guess as a fact.  There&#39;s indeed no mention of Rintaro Genji&#39;s <br/>
adoption of Rintaro Fusamasa as Shimazu Masayoshi has mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
~Seven<br/>
<br/>
PS. In regard of the first Rintaro&#39;s formal given name/middle name, I&#39;m really not sure <br/>
whether it&#39;s &quot;Gentsune.&quot; It couldn&#39;t be &quot;Genji&quot; as Shimazu Masayoshi has pointed out. <br/>

Thank you for posting those pages, and for the insights into this data<br/>
which you shared. However, I wanted to comment on your note on the<br/>
Okita Rintaro page at Wikipedia.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;However, with a family clan name &quot;Fujiwara&quot;, this &quot;Fujiwara no<br/>
&gt;Mototsune&quot; would have shared an identical pronunciation with Fujiwara<br/>
&gt;no Mototsune (836-891). Wouldn&#39;t a 19th century Japanese man avoid a<br/>
&gt;name like that? If this Inoue Rintaro was born with the formal given<br/>
&gt;name/middle name &quot;Motosune,&quot; wouldn&#39;t he have also changed it when he<br/>
&gt;changed his name to Okita Rintaro?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he received the formal name &quot;Mototsune&quot;, it would probably either<br/>
be in honor of that ancestor, or a coincidence. After all, the two<br/>
names are written with different characters, though they&#39;re pronounced<br/>
the same-- so there wouldn&#39;t be a pressing reason to avoid use of the<br/>
name.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a purely linguistic basis, the name still would be read<br/>
&quot;Mototsune&quot;. To pronounce it &quot;Gentsune&quot; would be, at best, irregular,<br/>
as that makes it half &quot;on-yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese reading) and half<br/>
&quot;kun-yomi&quot; (Japanese reading). I&#39;m not ruling out the possibility of<br/>
this being an exception, as reading Japanese names-- particularly<br/>
premodern ones-- is a tricky business; however, I&#39;m just saying that<br/>
it&#39;s not necessarily probable.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, with regards to your information on Rintaro Fusamasa:<br/>
Serizawa Kamo&#39;s webpage (Serizawa Kamo being another member of this<br/>
ML)-- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html#,">http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html#,</a><br/>
indicates that at one point, Okita used the formal name &quot;Fusanaga&quot;. To<br/>
have a formal name that had a first character &quot;Fusa&quot; would suggest a<br/>
closeness with someone who had the same character in their name--<br/>
which you have brought to our attention as being Rintaro *Fusa*masa,<br/>
as illustrated in the quote from Mori, p. 12, with young Souji calling<br/>
him &quot;Nii-san&quot; (elder brother). <br/>
<br/>
Once again, thank you for your interaction, and for your insight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299483365">Okita Soji&#39;s &quot;Fusanaga&quot; is actually &quot;Kaneyoshi.&quot; I&#39;ve confirmed that recently.  Book page are <br/>
available upon request.  Meanwhile, heres the Japanese Okita article at Wikepedia. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/????">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/????</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyways, Thanks for the message, &quot;M&quot;. I&#39;ll use &quot;Mototsune&quot; from now on until I find any<br/>
evidence agains it. As you probably are aware of, figuring out one&#39;s Japanese formal given<br/>
name/middle middle is harder than figuring his family name, given name, or family<br/>
clan name (even for well-educated Japanese.)<br/>

<br/>
Your point regarding the complexity of name reading is amply<br/>
illustrated by the kanji used to spell &quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;. Just by looking at<br/>
the kanji, I can tell that it could be read any of a number of ways:<br/>
&quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;, &quot;Fusayoshi&quot;, &quot;Fusanaga&quot;, &quot;Nobuyoshi&quot;, and so on-- the<br/>
confusing nature of which gave rise to Souji&#39;s formal name being read<br/>
by some as &quot;Fusanaga&quot;. Much like how the characters used to spell the<br/>
last shogun Yoshinobu&#39;s name can be read &quot;Yoshihisa&quot;, &quot;Yoshinobu&quot;, or<br/>
&quot;Keiki&quot;-- which, as I&#39;ve found in the United States government&#39;s<br/>
diplomatic records of that period, confused foreigners to no end.<br/>
<br/>
However, despite the fact that that name should be read &quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;,<br/>
what I had said earlier regarding Rintaro Fusamasa still holds true:<br/>
even though the reading is different, the kanji itself-- read &quot;Fusa&quot;<br/>
in Rintaro&#39;s case, or &quot;Kane&quot; in Souji&#39;s case-- is the same. Which is<br/>
something in support of what you&#39;ve been saying (as quoted in Mori&#39;s<br/>
work) regarding Souji&#39;s closeness to Rintaro Fusamasa. Souji may or<br/>
may not have received that kanji from/in honor of Rintaro Fusamasa;<br/>
however, usually in a family, to have two people with the same<br/>
character in their names is not coincidence. Case in point-- (despite<br/>
the fact that in this case, the reading of the character is<br/>
consistent) much of the lineage of the Matsudaira lords of Aizu had<br/>
the character &quot;Kata&quot; in their names (Katasada, Katanobu, Katamori, and<br/>
so on).<br/>
<br/>
As always, my thanks for your efforts.<br/>

&quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;. I&#39;d always spelt Okita Soji&#39;s formal name/middle name as &quot;Kaneyoshi/<br/>
Fusanaga&quot; till recently (like most other formal given names/middle names, it could be read <br/>
more than one way, as you&#39;ve mentioned.)  Anyways, it&#39;s definately &quot;Kaneyoshi,&quot; not <br/>
&quot;Fusanaga.&quot; On a few occasions, his name was written with Yoshijiro&#39;s &quot;yoshi&quot; (not <br/>
by himself, though.)<br/>

I&#39;ve just thought of something saved in my Okita folder.<br/>
<br/>
Rintaro&#39;s family register (from 1882 or around 1882)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
(Okita Rintaro is listed as being the the oldest son of the Okita family.<br/>
Okita Mistu is listed as being the the oldest daughter of Kondo Shusuke .)<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
There hasn&#39;t been a solid explanation in regard of the fact that Okita Soji is listed in the <br/>
death records at the family temple as being  he &quot;2nd son of Okita Rintaro.&quot; What we could <br/>
tell is that both Okita Rintaro&#39;s were &quot;retainers&quot; and Rintaro Fusamasa was only going to <br/>
remain as the head of the family until Okita Soji got married.</div>
