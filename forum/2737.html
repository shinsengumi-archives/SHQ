<h3>Saitou finally becomes a policeman (or, the amazing skills of actors)</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-383053658">This might be a bit off-topic, but I've been totally in actor fan-mode lately.<br/>
   <br/>
  For the last 8 weeks, I've been completely absorbed in a drama called "Jikou keisatsu," about a section of the police that deals with limitations cases (cases that are no longer prosecutable, but still need to be solved).  The main character, Kiriyama, is one of the investigators and is played by Jo Odagiri --- Saitou in NHK's "Shinsengumi!".  Now, it might sound like a dull, serious drama, but it's not.  It's wonderfully comedic and Jo is an absolute scream... nothing like our Saitou.  Don't believe me?  Take a look at him at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/jikou/index.html">http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/jikou/index.html</a> (and he's actually looking pretty normal in that pic).<br/>
   <br/>
  As I've watched the show, I've been constantly reminded of his portrayal of Saitou... probably my very favorite version of him (even over RK Saitou, which was my first love)... because it's so different from Kiriyama.  I know a lot of it is how a character is written, but it takes the actor to bring it to life with their own unique physical quirks in facial expressions and body movements.  I'm continually struck by how HUMAN Odagiri made Saitou, showing a man who lived in shades of gray rather than the black & white most others have portrayed him.  In my humble attempts at writing RK Saitou in fanfics, I've insisted that there WAS a softer side to the man, a part of him that doubts or at least thinks about what he's being asked to do, who does care about people, and Odagiri brought that out while not taking away from his warrior's spirit.  It's really amazing to rediscover such a fine performance when I'm given something completely different and equally fine.<br/>
   <br/>
  I've discovered the same thing with Shosuke Tanihara and Itou.  Honestly, I can't imagine the image of Itou Kashitarou bearing anyone's face but Tanihara's for the rest of my life.  It was because of that performance that I began watching Tanihara's other work, both historicals and modern dramas, and it made his Itou even stronger for me.<br/>
   <br/>
  LOL!  Even with voice actors... I became accustomed to Sparky Thornton's voice as Saitou in the English dubbed version of RK.  He's doing voice work in so many other anime series currently airing in the US and every time I hear it, you KNOW who comes immediately to mind.  ^_^<br/>
   <br/>
  I'm really curious if anyone else has pursued other work done by actors who've portrayed (or VA-ed) members of the Shinsengumi or stumbled upon them in other things.  Did other performances change your perception of their Shinsengumi role or is that performance so burned into your head that it colors how you react to other roles?  Anyone who will forever BE that person in your head?<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725998985">Yajima Norito NHK Takeda...will always be Takeda!!! I love how he uses<br/>
that fan and his snooty expresions and how he always doesn't<br/>
understand why people don't like him.  I think he was a misunderstood<br/>
character in NHK, all he wanted to do was make suggestions and do this<br/>
and that...and no one "understood"  ::LOL::<br/>

<br/>
Shosuke Tanihara NHK Itou...forever because I think he even fits the<br/>
historical description of Itou very well.  Something about his eyes<br/>
really does remind me of the painting of Itou. Ofcourse I know the art<br/>
wasn't meant to be "realistic" it is in fact in the traditional style<br/>
but something about his soft features emphasize his scholarly-ness and<br/>
Tanihara has that "high class" air but he was believable as a former<br/>
dojo owner because he has such a great body (that's why I was so upset<br/>
NHK didn't have him put up a better fight before he was killed).  My<br/>
favorite part with Itou was when he was able to revert from calm cool<br/>
calculating to threatening his own life in that scene with Saitou and<br/>
Nagakura---this really demonstrates Tanihara's skill and I belive that<br/>
he really carried the "drama" very well for the series.<br/>

<br/>
Sato Koichi NHK Serizawa Kamo...I really liked his Mibugishiden Saitou<br/>
but I think he did an even much better job as the "wild duck".  He has<br/>
a rugged sexiness and loose canon attitude down perfect.  I also liked<br/>
how he -handled- Oume (^_^) and I cannot imagine him as a businessman,<br/>
politician or salaryman he will ALWAYS be that sake swigging Kamo.<br/>
<br/>
I think JO was a fascinating Saitou and frankly I would have liked to<br/>
see him as Meiji Era Fujita Goro (even for a few seconds) in an<br/>
epilogue (but I know this was not part of the special).  I found his<br/>
performance in Tanuki Goten (Racoon Princess) opposite Zhang Zhiyi to<br/>
be awkward and stiff and I'm not sure if it was because I had a hard<br/>
time seeing "Saitou" as a pretty dancing prince or not.<br/>

Anyone who will forever BE that person in your head?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Taro Yamamoto (NHK Harada): Can't watch him in Battle Royale without <br/>
seeing Sano - and I saw BR before NHK. Taro just came in and made the <br/>
role of Sano *his*.  He is the only Sano that stands out in my mind <br/>
(other than Peacemaker Sano, but PMK is in a class of it's own!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Masato Sakai (NHK Yamanami):  Another case of the only actor who <br/>
really stands out to me in his role.  He brought in an elegant, quiet <br/>
intesity.  For me, he is Yamanami.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tatsuya Fujiwara (NHK Okita):  Had already seen him in BR.  Then NHK <br/>
made me a fan.  He didn't impress me at the beginning of the series, <br/>
but his performance improved as the series went on and he grew into <br/>
his role.  Then I saw him in BRII and Sabu.  Still a fan.  I can <br/>
watch Tatsuya in other roles and not see him as Souji. [As an aside, <br/>
if anyone's interested, Tatsuya is the lead in Death Note coming out <br/>
in Japan in June.  The manga is great if anyone's into that.  The <br/>
movie trailer is here  www.death-note-movie.com  Once you're in the <br/>
room, click on the computer on the right.  There's also a movie <br/>
poster on the wall to click on and enlarge.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with what has been said about Jo Odagiri and Shosuke <br/>
Tanihara.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone could make some viewing suggestions for any of these actors <br/>
I'd like to hear them.  Thanks!</div>

 </span></blockquote>If it's Tanihara you wish to admire and/or drool over you MUST get one <br/>
of his early films---Fudoh. Sky High is also quite good with freaky cool <br/>
paranormal elements. he was also very good in a small part in Sleepless <br/>
Town and I'm sure Ms. Phil and Sec & Tama will agree that if you can get <br/>
hold of Deborah the Rival you'll be thrilled and amazed. ^_^<br/>
<br/>
He's also done quite a few J-Dramas.<br/>
<br/>
And any film or drama you come across with Koichi Sato (Serizawa)is also <br/>
a good bet.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-247157063">Sakai Masato, to me, did his best job in the recent mini-series about Izumo <br/>
no Okuni. Unlike NHK and Mibugishiden, he was NOT eternally smiling in this <br/>
role.<br/>
<br/>
Kikukawa Rei (Ikumatsu in NHK Shinsengumi) was also great as Izumo no Okuni.<br/>
<br/>
Tabata Tomoko (Kondo Tsune in NHK Shinsengumi) was SO incredibly cute and <br/>
adorable in the film "Daiteiden no Yoru Ni" (Before the Lights Come On).<br/>
<br/>
My favorite depictions of Kondo (and the ones that I feel are most <br/>
realistic) are Shinsengumi Keppuroku and "Byakkotai." I can't remember the <br/>
name of the actor in Byakkotai, but I'm looking for him in other depictions. <br/>
As for the one in Shinsengumi Keppuroku, that was none other than the <br/>
talented Watari Tetsuya. In last year's Yoshitsune taiga, he was Taira no <br/>
Kiyomori...and I gotta say, both as Isami and as Kiyomori, for Watari <br/>
Tetsuya the voice makes the role!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102648090">If historicals interest you, Tanihara was in another last season <br/>
with yet another impressive performance (though I *still* can't get <br/>
used to him in traditional shaved head/topknot after Itou... <br/>
LOL!)... "Ooku - Hana no ran".  Takes place in the court of one of <br/>
the early Tokugawa shoguns (he plays the shogun).  Unfortunately, I <br/>
don't think anyone has undertaken doing subtitles for it, but so <br/>
many Jdramas can be enjoyed without them.  The drama is available <br/>
over on D-Addicts ( http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php?<br/>
search=ooku+hana+no+ran&type=&sub=View+all&sort= ).<br/>
<br/>
If no one has pointed you in these directions, a couple of places to <br/>
find out more about other things our Shinsengumi alumni have been in <br/>
are Drama-Wiki ( http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Main_Page ) and JDorama ( <br/>
http://www.jdorama.com ).  The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) can <br/>
also provide information, but it's not as thorough on Japanese <br/>
actors (http://www.imdb.com).<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, "Deborah the Rival" is not to be missed for anyone who <br/>
likes Tanihara-san and/or needs to laugh.  LOL!  It's still my No. <br/>

<h3>AU Shinsengumi? In Papuwa? Did you know about this already?</h3>
by <i>purplealienmio</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695484947">As I was randomly browsing the internet today, I came<br/>
across a link for an old manga that I was interested<br/>
in over a decade ago, when I wasn't even a teenager,<br/>
and after some nostalgic reminiscing, I was heartened<br/>
to hear there was a sequel. What I was completely<br/>
unprepared for was the appearance of the Shinsengumi<br/>
in this universe. After all, it's a fighting/gag<br/>
comedy with cross-dressing giant fish with legs,<br/>
sexually ambiguous octopus men, horny giant snails and<br/>
various other weird creatures, and the main<br/>
character's catchphrase is "N'baba!" <br/>
<br/>
Did you know about this already? Am I the only one who<br/>
is delighted/disgusted? <br/>
<br/>
(For those of you who might point out that the kanji<br/>
is different, yes it is, but the pronunciation is the<br/>
same.) <br/>
<br/>
The series is PAPUWA!, sequel to Nangoku Shonen<br/>
Papuwa; here's the link, and scroll about halfway down<br/>
the page for this universe's incarnations of our<br/>
favourite boys in blue. <br/>

<h3>[OT] Re: [SHQ] Saitou finally becomes a policeman (or, the amazing	skills of actors)</h3>
by <i>chuckjharris</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-238055361">Ohayo gozaimasu!<br/>
<br/>
First, thank you for the pointer to "Jikou Keisatsu", which I have been<br/>
enjoying (at least the soft-subs... my Japanese isn't nearly up to the<br/>
task of understanding a show like that).<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed another Jo Odagiri starring role this weekend that some on the<br/>
list might enjoy, even if it was not Shinsengumi-related.  I watched the<br/>
movie "Shinobi: Heart Under Blade", which is supposedly a live-action<br/>
version of the anime/manga "Basilisk".  I'm not familiar with<br/>
"Basilisk", so I can't comment on how well the movie follows its source<br/>
material, but I can heartily recommend the movie on its own.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Possible spoilers follow]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The movie is something of a take on Romeo and Juliet, if the Montagues<br/>
and Capulets were ninja clans.  Tokugawa Ieyasu sets the Iga and Hoga<br/>
clans at each other, leaving two young lovers, each the grandchild of<br/>
their respective village's leader, stuck in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
Production values were very high, with beautiful scenery and a haunting<br/>
soundtrack.  The fight scenes were very good; each of the main ninja<br/>
characters had their own specialty, including the best live-action<br/>
version of Kenshin's fighting style that one is likely to see.<br/>
Unfortunately, it was a bit rushed; the story revolves around a series<br/>
of duels between ten ninja, five to a side.  Two hours is just too short<br/>
of a time to develop much empathy for that many characters.  Instead,<br/>
you only get to know the two lovers fairly well, and only two of the<br/>
other ninja really get to explain themselves.  They were all potentially<br/>
interesting characters, and I would have preferred a longer format to<br/>
get to know them better.<br/>
<br/>
I've read a number of complaints about the ending in online forums.<br/>
Being both a fan of Asian cinema and a student of Japanese history, the<br/>
ending was not terribly surprising to me, and I believe it fit the story<br/>
well.  I can, however, see how someone who either doesn't know the<br/>
history of the time period or is more used to Hollywood movie endings<br/>
might not like this (my mother was the same way when she saw "Crouching<br/>
Tiger, Hidden Dragon"... she loved the movie up until the end, but<br/>
couldn't understand why it had such a sad ending). <br/>
<br/>
In short, it's not the kind of movie that's going to change the world,<br/>
but it was a worthwhile use of two hours.  It had an interesting story,<br/>
decent acting, good fight scenes, and more ninja than you can shake a<br/>
stick at... what more can you ask for?<br/>
