<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250115301">Could you please share with this list, if there is something of interest in <br/>
this book. My son works at the University of Washington, and he might have <br/>
library priveleges. If the U of W press printed this book, it should be in <br/>
their collection.<br/>

&gt; Hi, Secretary!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband works at Texas A&M, and their library has a copy, according to<br/>
&gt; the online catalog.  I&#39;d be happy to check it out -- will email you when I<br/>
&gt; get my hands on it, and you can ask me all the questions you want.  I have <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; scanner, too, so could send you scans of pics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bon<br/>

&gt;&gt; If anyone is in school can you please check your college library to see <br/>
&gt;&gt; if<br/>
&gt;&gt; this book is part of the collection. I&#39;m wondering if the Education <br/>
&gt;&gt; Museum<br/>
&gt;&gt; where Fujita Goro was employed for a few years is featured in this book <br/>
&gt;&gt; (I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;&gt; LOVE TO SEE PHOTOS OF THE INSIDE OF THE MUSEUM). </span></blockquote></div>
