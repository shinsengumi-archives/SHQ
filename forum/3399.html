<h3>Shinsengumi and &quot;Corporate Backers&quot;</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904091231">Hi all. Am doing research again, and there's an interesting point I<br/>
thought I'd bring up. Before going to Kyoto, on 1/15/Bunkyu 3,<br/>
Hijikata Toshizo went to the house of Kojima Shikanosuke (village<br/>
headman connected to Kondo and Sato Hikogoro) in Onoji village; he<br/>
paid his respects and received a sword.<br/>
<br/>
1/16, Kondo goes, does the same, receives chainmail.<br/>
<br/>
1/17, Okita and Yamanami do the same, and receive other items.<br/>
<br/>
(Oishi Manabu, "Shinsengumi," (Tokyo: Chuokoron-shinsha, 2001), p. 67)<br/>
<br/>
This ties into the important role that the Tama people were to play in<br/>
the unit's existence. Almost like "corporate backers."<br/>
