<div id="ygrps-yiv-775392772">Sorry, this has probably been mentioned some place and I'm just not remembering...  Do we know how old "Aa Shinsengumi" is... when it was composed... the recording date?  It reminds me of the old nightclub type musicals, which I know became popular in the 1920's in Japan.  Fascinating song... I really like it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154167084">I love it!!!! and its in mp3 format so people have those fancy <br/>
player things can listen to it over and over again...I guess that <br/>
some jpop group will remix it :P<br/>
SK knows...well we can *guess* 50s to early 60s (this more based on <br/>
my knowledge of Thai folk music---same style)...and a guy is sang it <br/>
