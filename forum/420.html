<h3>Heads-up on samurai films on IFC tonight</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362175282">Kevin let me know that IFC (Independent Film Channel) is showing <br/>
three samurai films **tonight** in honor of &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 2&quot; coming <br/>
out.  (Which reminds me, I need to get the SHQ calendar updated!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kill&quot; (1968)<br/>
&quot;Three Outlaw Samurai&quot; (1964)<br/>
&quot;Samurai Spy&quot; (1965)<br/>
<br/>
None are Shinsengumi-related, but I know many of us are still <br/>
interested in samurai films.  There&#39;s also a 15-minute &quot;making of&quot; <br/>
for the new movie.<br/>
