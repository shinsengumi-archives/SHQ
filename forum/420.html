<h3>Heads-up on samurai films on IFC tonight</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-362175282">Kevin let me know that IFC (Independent Film Channel) is showing <br/>
three samurai films **tonight** in honor of "Kill Bill Vol. 2" coming <br/>
out.  (Which reminds me, I need to get the SHQ calendar updated!)<br/>
<br/>
"Kill" (1968)<br/>
"Three Outlaw Samurai" (1964)<br/>
"Samurai Spy" (1965)<br/>
<br/>
None are Shinsengumi-related, but I know many of us are still <br/>
interested in samurai films.  There's also a 15-minute "making of" <br/>
for the new movie.<br/>
