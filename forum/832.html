<h3>Another thought on Saigou & Sagara</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074508864">Something else that's been floating in my mind lately is the idea <br/>
that Saigou didn't necessarily have to have anything against Sagara <br/>
personally (e.g. Sagara wasn't a threat to Saigou's popularity or <br/>
power).  He knew Sagara... knew he would follow orders.  He would've <br/>
had confidence that Sagara would do as he was told and walk into the <br/>
perfect set-up to provide them with support from the masses.  A <br/>
pawn... pure and simple.<br/>
