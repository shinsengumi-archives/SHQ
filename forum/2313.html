<h3>Hijikata in Ezo and Tetsu/Tatsu....</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-599588950">First of all I would like to say that it&#39;s great to be hearing from <br/>
Okita and Angrybee on the ML again. Secondly, thanks to Wu Jia-Xin <br/>
and Yuki for answering as well.<br/>
<br/>
I can answer both of your questions at least a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
Yes Tetsu and Tatsu were both real. And Tetsu really was Hijikata&#39;s <br/>
page. However, they did not join the Shinsengumi until 1867. I think <br/>
Tatsu left the group after either Toba-Fushimi? Or Was it Kofu? But <br/>
Tetsu followed Hijikata all the way to Hakodate, Ezo (Hokkaido).<br/>
<br/>
As for what happened to Hijikata up north... <br/>
<br/>
The basic story as I have it so far is that he left Aizu on a mission <br/>
to get reinforcements, but was unsuccessful for a reason I have yet <br/>
to exactly determine. I think the domain he went to might have also <br/>
been in trouble at that time? He eventually wound up in Sendai and <br/>
had a council of war with Enomoto&#39;s group. It was decided that they <br/>
would go to Ezo and try to build a new government there. Hijikata was <br/>
one of two men appointed as leaders of their army. (? I think this is <br/>
correct. Not sure who the other guy was.)<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata really had no hope of winning a battle at that point. He <br/>
pretty much knew that if he went to Ezo he would be going to his <br/>
death. However he did not care. He said that if he ever made peace <br/>
with his enemies he would not be able to face Kondo in the next life. <br/>
He also told a doctor acquaintance (You&#39;ve probably read this <br/>
before): &quot;I am not going to battle to win. With the Tokugawa <br/>
government about to collapse, it would be a disgrace if no one is <br/>
willing to go down with it. That is why I must go. I will fight the <br/>
best battle of my life to die for the country.&quot; It is believed that <br/>
this is about the time at least one of those pictures of him was <br/>
taken.<br/>
<br/>
Setting out by boat, Enomoto&#39;s group landed on Washinoki beach in <br/>
order to keep Hakodate, an important seaport, from being destroyed in <br/>
a fight. They managed to enter Fort Goryokaku a few days later <br/>
without a struggle. (This was sometime in October, but I do not have <br/>
the dates handy at the moment.) Goryokaku had only been completed a <br/>
few years before and was made for modern warfare, which is why they <br/>
chose it for their headquarters. It was shaped like a star, making it <br/>
hard to approach without being in the line of fire. It was destroyed <br/>
after the war by the Meiji government, but you can still see the <br/>
general outline of it today. They declared their new government <br/>
the &quot;Republic of Ezo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After this Enomoto&#39;s people began to take control of the rest of Ezo. <br/>
they sent word to the Matsumae clan demanding that they join with <br/>
them and were ignored. Enomoto sent Hijikata and his army to force <br/>
them to surrender. There were a few fights in this campaign that as <br/>
far as I can tell Hijikata won, including one surprise raid on his <br/>
camp. He finally succeeded in taking the castle itself. There seems <br/>
to be some debate on how it happened, but the most reliable source <br/>
(Shimada Kai&#39;s diary) says that they entered the fortress by using a <br/>
ladder to climb over a wall and caught the defenders off-guard.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after this, they held a democratic election and Enomoto was <br/>
voted President. Hijikata was voted Army Magistrate and had charge of <br/>
the defence of Hakodate. (People have critized this attempt at <br/>
a &quot;democratic&quot; government, but it seems to me to have been at least <br/>
if not far more &quot;progressive&quot; the the Meiji government.)<br/>
<br/>
It gets a bit fuzzy for me again here. They seem to have been left <br/>
alone for the rest of that winter. It is said that at this time <br/>
Hijikata&#39;s personality was very mild and that his men adored him. The <br/>
people of Hakodate seemed to have respected him as well. <br/>
<br/>
Some attempt was made to gain outside help, but no one wanted to risk <br/>
going up against Great Britain which was allied with the Meiji <br/>
government. Even France had long before withdrawn from its alliance <br/>
with the Shogunate. The sole exception was a few soilders who <br/>
deserted and joined up with Enomoto&#39;s forces. Among these Frenchmen <br/>
was a man named Jules Burnet who would later remember that Hijikata <br/>
was a &quot;true warrior&quot; and that if he had been in a European army he <br/>
would have been a general. (Burnet was the model for Tom Cruise&#39;s <br/>
character in The Last Samurai, BTW. But he was not nearly so heroic. <br/>
He hid on a boat during the final battle. -_-)<br/>
<br/>
These outside &quot;specialist&quot; suggested a plan to Enomoto the next <br/>
spring to take or sink an ironside warship that the Meiji government <br/>
sent against the outlaw republic. It involved both a land and sea <br/>
battle. Hijikata lead the land forces. Both proved to be disasterous <br/>
for the Ezo forces and they retreated back to Hakodate to prepare for <br/>
the final showdown.<br/>
<br/>
During this time Hijikata finished settling things about him. On May <br/>
5, 1869 he gave several items (a letter, the picture of him, a sword, <br/>
and I think a poem?) to Tetsu and ordered him to get out of Hakodate <br/>
and take these things to his family. <br/>
<br/>
Tetsu tried to refuse, saying he wanted to stay and fight. Hijikata <br/>
became angry with him and said that if he didn&#39;t go like he had told <br/>
him to then he would be the one to kill him. Tetsu went and <br/>
eventually managed to slip past the Meiji government&#39;s forces by <br/>
disguising as a beggar. (I am not sure accurate this is because I had <br/>
to use a translator to get most of this part of the story. I could be <br/>
wrong about a thing or two...)<br/>
<br/>
At some point the remaining Shinsengumi members were sent to defend a <br/>
fairly isolated fort called Benten Daiba. (No longer exists.) As head <br/>
of the army Hijikata had to remain at Goryokaku. <br/>
<br/>
(This information came from Momoiro-usagi.)The Meiji government <br/>
finally began it&#39;s attack on May 11, 1869. Enomoto and the others <br/>
were determined to hold the fort, but Hijikata was opposed to their <br/>
plan. &quot;Reinforcements do not come. It is meaningless to hold <br/>
Goryokaku castle.&quot; He was also angry because this decision abandoned <br/>
the Shinsengumi members at Benten Daiba. Enomoto basically told him <br/>
to shut up, but Hijikata would not be stopped. He took some men and <br/>
led a sortie to save the men at Benten Daiba.<br/>
<br/>
What he could not know was that the Meiji government forces were <br/>
already between him and the fort. As his group came out of Hakodate <br/>
and into an area called Ippongi-Sekisyo they encountered this army <br/>
and there was a battle. He is said to have been shot in the abdomen, <br/>
the bullet shattering his lower back and killing him. However they <br/>
never had a body to prove it. It seems most likely that his men took <br/>
it away from the battlefield and hid it someplace. To this day no one <br/>
knows for sure where his final resting place is located.<br/>
<br/>
The saddest irony was that the men he was trying to help remained <br/>
fairly safe. Benten Daiba surrendered on May 15, 1869. It was only <br/>
then that they learned of his fate. One memeber later remembered that <br/>
they &quot;cried like babies who had lost their mother.&quot; Nakajima Nobori <br/>
would later repeat that sentiment on his famous painting of Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
I remeber reading from one website that those who fought with <br/>
Hijikata in Hakodate said that he &quot;was more samurai-like than the <br/>
real samurai and more brave than any other men.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for Tetsu, he sought out the Sato family in Hino as Hijikata had <br/>
instructed him. He was sheltered by them for three years. After that <br/>
it became unclear what happened to him. Some say that he died of an <br/>
illness at age 20. Others that he tried to fight the Meiji government <br/>
again during the Senian War and was killed in battle.<br/>

that, he returned to the hometown and became a merchant. He died of <br/>
an illness in Meiji 5. However, his posterity exists. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tetsu is not sending the sword to Hino. This is the fact which many <br/>
Japanese Shinsengumi fans&#39; people also misunderstand. I also thought <br/>
that Tetsu sent the sword to Hino. It is only Hijikata&#39;s photograph <br/>
and letter which Tetsu sent. It is the fiction of &quot;Moeyo ken&quot; of <br/>
Shiba Ryotaro that Tetsu sent the sword. Kanesada which Hijikata&#39;s <br/>
posterity has is the sword which it left to the Hijikata family, <br/>
when he goes to Kofu. <br/>

Please do not confuse this fictional version of Okita with the real Okita.<br/>
