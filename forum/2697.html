<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663550949">Hey everybody. I&#39;ve been really interested in the shinsengumi<br/>
ever since I caught a brief episode of peacemaker kurogane. However, I<br/>
realize that probably a large portion of the show is made up for tv<br/>
watchers but I was hoping that somebody could give me some information<br/>
on them. Most sites I have been to only repeat the same thing over and<br/>
over. There are a few members im really interested in(no offense to<br/>
others):<br/>
1.Shinpachi Nagakura<br/>
<br/>
2.Hajime Saito<br/>
<br/>
3.Soji Okita<br/>
<br/>
4.Sanosuke Harada<br/>
<br/>
5.Isami Kondo<br/>
<br/>
6.Toshizo Hijikata<br/>
<br/>
7.Their spies<br/>
        Any info that somebody could email me or post would greatly be<br/>
appreciated. I&#39;m still ignorant when it comes to alot of this but<br/>
hopefully with this site I can learn more about the history of the<br/>
shinsengumi.Thank you</div>

it is possible to simply post machine translations on our site however<br/>

we often discuss rumors/theories or any other interesting tidbits on<br/>
this list---we try not to post rumors and theories on the main website<br/>

<br/>
We are part of fandom but assume a professional tone with the sincere<br/>
hope that the Shinsengumi will be taken &quot;seriously&quot; as a historical<br/>
topic but many of us do other fun things too!---that&#39;s why you&#39;ll see<br/>
alot of &quot;nerd work&quot; on the site (^_^) many of us don&#39;t know Japanese<br/>
so we had to expand our approach considerably<br/>

  Hey everybody. I&#39;ve been really interested in the shinsengumi ever  since I caught a brief episode of peacemaker kurogane. However, I  realize that probably a large portion of the show is made up for tv  watchers but I was hoping that somebody could give me some information<br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well... as sad as this might sound, everything else that you&#39;ve  probably read about the Shinsengumi is just about everything that is  known about them (Kondou, Okita, Hijikata, ect.)   Theres  very little info about them, which I guess makes them so  fascinating.  I myself have been looking up info about Nagakura  but can&#39;t can&#39;t anything new from whats already been mentioned all  across the net.   You can read some of the previous enteries  for this mailing list, they&#39;re very helpful to understanding the times  the Shinsengumi lived through.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-499444604">There IS alot of info! Just not in English.  Now when will one of us<br/>
become a millionaire?  (^_^) and translate Nagakura&#39;s more dry and<br/>
historically accurate text, Shimada Kai&#39;s work, Nakajima NObori&#39;s<br/>
record and the newly discovered record book by Yamazaki Susumu and we<br/>
in fact end up with a decent foundation.<br/>
<br/>
It also has ALOT to do with how each person is viewed in fandom for<br/>
example:<br/>
<br/>
Historical Saitou is immensely popular and he has a couple sites all<br/>
to himself by devoted fans (he also crossed over into Aizu fandom<br/>
ofcourse)<br/>
<br/>
Kondou has no Japanese fansite as far as I know (T_T)<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura DOES have a fansite---I just need to find it again<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata has his own COMMUNITY!!!....  (again please see<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm)</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shougo.net/">http://shougo.net/</a><br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.msn.com/shinsengumi00toshizo/">http://groups.msn.com/shinsengumi00toshizo/</a><br/>
again be patient when you read Japanese sites with translators and<br/>
print out info (isolate a good paragraph) and if possible seek someone<br/>
who is willing to help you understand<br/>
<br/>
OKita hasn&#39;t quiet been freed from his fictional self and most sites<br/>
on him are fanfic oriented<br/>
<br/>
My own personal super strategy is somehow to use fandom to continue in<br/>
the pursuit of history.<br/>
I believe &quot;if it isn&#39;t in manga/doujinshi---no one will care&quot;<br/>
SO my idea is if there was a way to communicate to artists and writers<br/>
interesting historical angles for them to draw then maybe we will get<br/>
even more fascinating interpretations.  Hopefully they will be like<br/>
NObuhiro WAtsuki and the author of Kaze Hikaru and mention their<br/>
research as well to attract more friend and encourage them to learn<br/>
more. Because the next fan who picks up a manga may in fact be the<br/>
future scholar who publishes a professional book on the Shinsengumi in<br/>
English...<br/>

<h3>Bit of a timeline regarding the retreat from Kyoto</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165902501">Soo...I was checking the book &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot; today, <br/>
and I turned up some details regarding the retreat from Kyoto. The bit below <br/>
is my combination of pages 96-97, as well as information I&#39;ve previously <br/>
posted here about Kondou and Nagai Naoyuki.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigns on the 9th of December, 1867. On the <br/>
evening of the 12th, Yoshinobu, Matsudaira Katamori, and Matsudaira Sadaaki <br/>
leave for Osaka. The Shinsengumi gets assigned to guard duty at Nijo <br/>
Castle-- and while there, gets the Mito domain annoyed. Thus, rather <br/>
conveniently-- Nagai Naoyuki gets ready to leave for Osaka, and takes the <br/>
Shinsengumi with him on the 14th. Shinsengumi sets up temporary headquarters <br/>
in Osaka at the Tenmangu Shrine, and on the 15th, is ordered to duty at the <br/>
Fushimi-bugyosho (Fushimi Magistrate&#39;s Headquarters), near Kyoto, in <br/>
Fushimi.<br/>
<br/>
SO...to make a long story short-- Yoshimura Kanichiro (of &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; <br/>
fame) and Yamazaki Susumu go on ahead of the main force to set things up in <br/>
Fushimi, and the main body of Shinsengumi arrives on the 16th.<br/>
<br/>
While Shinsengumi was there, Kondou continued to make business trips to Nijo <br/>
Castle. However, on the 18th, on his way back, he was attacked and shot by <br/>
the remnants of Ito Kashitaro&#39;s Goryoeji faction, under Abe Juurou. Thus, <br/>
Kondou was sent to Osaka and cared for by the Shogun&#39;s physician, Matsumoto <br/>
Ryojun (who later went to Aizu). As a result, Hijikata was the one who <br/>
commanded Shinsengumi at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi.<br/>
<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-151282928">So the NHK drama got that pretty much dead on. They had Kano and <br/>
Shinohara of Itou&#39;s group shooting Kondou and didn&#39;t really show <br/>
Yamazaki going on ahead but I that&#39;s pretty much how things played out <br/>
in the TV version.<br/>
