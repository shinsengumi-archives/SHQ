connection is really bad so I can't spend time searching<br/>

Leavell, James Berry.  The Development of the Modern Japanese Police <br/>
System: Transition from Tokugawa and Meiji<br/>
<br/>
*donft worry about the term torishimari gumi, one of many <br/>
transitional labels used for patrolmen when the police system was <br/>
established<br/>
<br/>
Paste 95<br/>
gThe torishimari gumi should be ready to help the people within his <br/>
jurisdiction as well as travelers when he is asked to help.  Even <br/>
when the patrolman is not asked, he should assist individuals in <br/>
difficulty when it seems necessary to do so.h Patrolmen were <br/>
expected to be gpolite instead of rudeh and to serve without <br/>
discriminating between wealthy and poor citizenscA final note of <br/>
interest is that the regulations require the patrolmen to wear their <br/>
trousers while on duty.h<br/>
<br/>
That's right officers please keep your trousers on....I think it <br/>
means that guys may have prefered to wear more traditional clothes <br/>
like hakama rather than western wear.</div>
