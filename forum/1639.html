(Thank you for showing lovely photographs.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although I was not able to see, NHK was broadcasting this festival <br/>
by news. <br/>
My friend was looking at the news by chance. <br/>
She asked me. <br/>
"Who is that man other than Hijikata and Shimada?" <br/>
Since I was not looking at the news, I do not understand the person. <br/>
However, my friend said that he was not a Shieikan member and had a <br/>
flag. <br/>
Therefore, I said to her, "I think that he is Ozeki Masajirou of the <br/>
role putting up the flag of Shinsengumi." .<br/>
(He followed Hijikata to Hakodate. Therefore, it is not strange even <br/>
if Aizu has him.Incidentally, from formation of Shinsengumi in 1863 <br/>
to disappearance of Shinsengumi in 1869, only two persons, Shimada <br/>
Kai and Ozeki Masajirou, were on the register in Shinsengumi, and <br/>
lived to Meiji Era.) <br/>
According to the photograph of Dvc00610, my answer seemed to be the <br/>
correct answer.^^ <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the again lovely photographs. <br/>
