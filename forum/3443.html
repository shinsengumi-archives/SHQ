<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108906250">I will be recording the very very sad step by step process in trying to <br/>
restore SHQ.  Not everything on the old site will be back online because <br/>
we are trying to keep things simple.  If you recall our old hosting <br/>
company was unable to restore the one html file which housed the <br/>
entire site---that's why SHQ died.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways some of the gory details.<br/>
<br/>
Put in 4 hours and just came up with a list of things:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com/37668.html">http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com/37668.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The evolution of SHQ over the past 4 years was<br/>
simple html > html with frames > html with no frames but everything <br/>
looked much better and organized > content management system (I <br/>
was happy until the obliteration of the critical file) > Wordpress (present <br/>
state)<br/>
<br/>
each evolution was not simply "cut and paste" code either...it's all hand <br/>
done page by page (*_*)<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty lies in the fact that SHQ had tons of text and some pages <br/>
with text and images and some pages with just images.  As someone <br/>
with absolutely no tech background prior to working on this--- all this <br/>
has been a real pain for me over the years as I split time between <br/>
research and then trying to figure out how to put it all online.<br/>
<br/>
Sneak Peak: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shinsengumihq.com/shq/">http://shinsengumihq.com/shq/</a><br/>
I practiced working with Wordpress on other blogs recently and <br/>
everything is cool...until I messed with this particular template.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838219944">Hang in there.  I know I'm hoping for the best with this project.<br/>
Technology is always changing [damn it] and no sooner we learn how to<br/>
manipulate one dynamics, here comes another even more complicated to<br/>
learn.  After my 10+ years of working as a web host, I'm ready to go to<br/>
the lulu bin after then introduction of all sorts of new scripts.  I've<br/>
gotten to the point of washing my hands entirely of it and sticking to<br/>
just doing graphics for the clients.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm soooo looking forward to the new site and the information<br/>
that will be available to everyone.  I'm so glad you're willing to<br/>
sacrifice your time to this effort.  THANKS, on behalf of ALL the<br/>
Shinsengumi-ai!<br/>
