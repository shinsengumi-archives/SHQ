<h3>Interesting Find</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14508768">I am trying to wrap up my essay on the history of TMPD, its role in <br/>
the development of modern kendo and the Seinan War (Satsuma <br/>
Rebellion)...then I find even more excellent comparative stuff with <br/>
the French police spy system (no surprise seeing how <br/>
Toshiyoshi/Toshinaga Kawaji and other important folks used the <br/>
French system as a model).  <br/>
<br/>
Seems many spies in the French Police system during the 2nd-3rd <br/>
empire were the most trusted and used as bodyguards for <br/>
the "emperor" as well...does this sound familiar?<br/>
<br/>
Then I find this by using the word "kidotai" as a search...the <br/>
Japanese riot police had extensive experience with dealing with <br/>
massive student protestors (ofcourse we sympathize with the students <br/>
but from my research I have found the students to be *highly* <br/>
organized numbering in the THOUSANDS at times, and sophisticated in <br/>
their attacks to the point of dividing their troops into squads <br/>
(emulating police tactics)...many protestors are armed with <br/>
incendiary devices and primitive firearms they make themselves)<br/>

hours in the library like I did?<br/>
"Kaufmann, Arthur C. Tokyo--one city where crime doesn't pay! : a <br/>
study of the reasons for Tokyo's low urban crime rate and what can <br/>
be learned to help America's crime crisis." <br/>
[the data below is very dated from the late 70s but still gives a <br/>
very general idea of how the riot police function]<br/>
***very short and sweet***please read (^_^)<br/>

<br/>
during my research I found interesting features of the MODERN <br/>
Japanese police which are all influences, whether philosophically or <br/>
in practice, directly descended from the Meiji Era model (Occupation <br/>
forces attempted to decentralized the police system and gave <br/>
patrolmen GUNS ::gasp:: ...as soon as they left the Japanese *re-<br/>
centralized it in many ways returning to the Meiji/Taisho model with <br/>
more democratic restrictions and monitoring)...even modern police <br/>
when talking to an American researcher still quote Kawaji (without <br/>
knowing it)...I found it to be humorous how one researcher would <br/>
write things like  "samurai from a place called Satsuma made up 2/3 <br/>
of the TMPD"...it is sad that researchers don't "push" further in <br/>
their research<br/>
<br/>
even good old fashion Hojojutsu (which has a place in many old <br/>
martial arts lineages which go much farther than simply kenjutsu)<br/>

*according to Dr. Kotaka was used extensively by historical Okita <br/>
Souji...[still] used by *modern* cops today <br/>
