<div id="ygrps-yiv-219418900">Drop everything...<br/>
pause the "Hijikata Singing" file<br/>
stop raking the mulch<br/>
take a break from collecting fundoshi screencaps<br/>
<br/>
In the files section I have uploaded "3-hajimetranslation.htm" <br/>
which is basically a translation of all the relevant pages from the<br/>
site...take a close look at Tokio's bio, and the Seinan War News<br/>
article (I keep mentioning crazy maps and confusing battle<br/>
arrays---well wars before the advent of "modern" communication devices<br/>
are like this).  Those gifted with the Japanese language may want to<br/>
compare and contrast with your own translations.   <br/>
<br/>
[No] this is not nifty or babelfish...it is actually a human<br/>
translation.  A couple of months ago I mentioned this site to an<br/>
acquaintance...she happened to have read RK many years ago...and she<br/>
sent me an email with an attachment of all of her work<br/>
@_@  please send her good karmic thoughts...cuz I don't even know how<br/>
to repay her -_-  I don't even know if I'll meet her again in person!<br/>
<br/>
*Note: The Yaso section is a repeat of what SK translated for us<br/>
already...I didn't know she was translating this part<br/>
<br/>
*She spells things differently Seenan War and Fujita Goroo<br/>
<br/>
*hey, guys remember I said that Tokio was an "outgoing" woman...there<br/>
is alot to support this in the translation...in my personal fanfic I<br/>
have Tokio doing a minor correction on something Fujita Goro had<br/>
written...well Tokio was a writing teacher to a woman ranked as<br/>
"princess" at Aizu<br/>
<br/>
*Things which Saitou "said" are also pretty clear in this translation<br/>
<br/>
*I especially liked the Seinan War article...one of Saigo's guys..."oh<br/>
no the Shinsengumi are coming for us..." (I'm sure he said that in<br/>
real life)<br/>
<br/>
*I used to mention in an email to my sister that hist. Saitou was<br/>
harder to kill than a cockroach...you couldn't kill him even if you<br/>
put him in front of a cannon...no really...LOL! <br/>
which makes me think back to the manga of Yahiko going against that<br/>
dude with a cannon on his arm near the police station <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500055211">I think its case sensitive Makoto (capitalize M)<br/>
for others who may have a similar problem...see the htm document in<br/>
the "Files" section...cool Fujita Goro got to see the Queen Mother...<br/>
