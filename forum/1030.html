I&#39;m leaving out alot of the tedious details...<br/>
<br/>
Announced in 1872 formulated into Conscription Edict of 1873 and went<br/>
into effect 1874  (the origins of conscription can be found as early<br/>
as 1870)<br/>
In 1873 conscription was enforced in Tokyo 1874 Osaka and Nagoya<br/>
<br/>
*guys who were not the head of their families targeted <br/>
<br/>
heirs of farms or family businesses son-in-laws adopted as family<br/>
heirs were also exempted = identical to the French conscription (keep<br/>
in mind TMPD adopted the Parisian model of law enforcement as well). <br/>
The French based conscription system will be reformed with a German model.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been able to find specifics such as age etc I do have<br/>
several more books to skim.<br/>
<br/>
10,000 of the Imperial Guard were from Satsuma, Choshu and Tosa (duh!<br/>
this is why during the Seinan War there were cases of sons fighting<br/>
against their fathers)<br/>
Satsuma samurai fought well during the Seinan War because they were<br/>
well trained in the Imperial Army (and they held important ranks)then<br/>
ofcourse they all sided with Saigo <br/>
*other texts make the generalization that the Imperial Army was poorly<br/>
trained<br/>
Seinan War 1876-1877 if conscription was not in place the rebellion<br/>
would have been disastrous for the new government<br/>
<br/>
Conscription in the 1880s police posts in the countryside (sometimes<br/>
only 2-3 officers) were also telegraph/postal centers (officers were<br/>
trained in prefectural police schools on how to use these systems)<br/>
these police posts linked central gov. to rural areas these police<br/>
enforced conscription laws.<br/>
*it is obvious that people such as Fujita Goro had to stay up to date<br/>
with the latest &quot;technology&quot; keep in mind that he did work in an urban<br/>
area<br/>
<br/>
Police+village officials were supposed to work together and collect<br/>
data on identities+age+physique the army sent doctors to the<br/>
countryside to do physical exams (the word army/police are used<br/>
interchangeably at times in texts) the army will slowly take over the<br/>
enforcement of conscription because evasion of the draft was common.<br/>
Results: introduced villagers to the &quot;world&quot;for the first time they<br/>
got to travel beyond their traditional hans.<br/>
<br/>
Seinan War and the TMPD teaser<br/>
An important quote :P<br/>
&quot;Indeed, the defeat of the Satsuma force owed as much or more to the<br/>
role played by the well-trained, samurai-based Tokyo police<br/>
detachments (over 5,000 men)*&quot; (Chapter 7 The Military D. Eleanor<br/>
Westney 184)<br/>
Note: another book says 6,000 men</div>
