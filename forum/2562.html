<div id="ygrps-yiv-244368394">Recently, there was a Shinsengumi event at Aizu's fall festival. <br/>
Plenty of cosplay and a meeting to discuss history. Some usual<br/>
activities such as club members visiting the hot spring (now a modern<br/>
hotel) where Hijikata spent time healing his wounds and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Please watch this site for an archived video of the events which<br/>
occurred this past weekend (give them a few days):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ntt-east.co.jp/fukushima/mado/archives/index.html#matsuri">http://www.ntt-east.co.jp/fukushima/mado/archives/index.html#matsuri</a><br/>
<br/>
On the same page you will see a vid with the title "Akaeda Higanjishi"<br/>
(warning: this is a 10 minute video!  you may just want to watch 3<br/>
minutes)<br/>
this is connected to an episode which occurred during the seige of the<br/>
castle.  <br/>
According to Akiko Kuno's UNEXPECTED DESTINATIONS (ISBN: 4770016387),<br/>
Yamakawa Hiroshi (then called Taizo) had soldiers dress as farmers,<br/>
dance and play music to enter the castle safely.  Understandably, the<br/>
invaders were very confused about the festive atmosphere--and the Aizu<br/>
samurai passed through enemy lines and entered the castle safely. <br/>
This event was also shown in the film BYAKKOTAI (which also depicted<br/>
the Shinsengumi!).  This film was reviewed by Tama<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm</a><br/>
*there is nothing to suggest that Shinsengumi or SAitou were involved<br/>
in this dress-up strategy--however it would be interesting to explore<br/>
in the world of fiction. It would be interesting to write about RK<br/>
SAitou wearing *feathers*.<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
There are many outstanding blogs in Japanese which cover Shinsengumi<br/>
history, fiction and independent research.  One such blogger happens<br/>
to be one of the most OBSESSED SAitou fan -ever-.  She is also a fan<br/>
of Jo Odagiri (^_^).  <br/>
Her site is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shinneitai.com/html/ahome.htm">http://shinneitai.com/html/ahome.htm</a><br/>
(insert into <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate)">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate)</a><br/>
<br/>
She discusses the NHK Sequel and now her visit to Aizu.<br/>

(she plans to update the blog daily during her stay there)<br/>
she will mention the bronze statue of the Byakkotai, Nisshinkan (the<br/>
rebuilt domain school), and Yamakawa Kenjiro.  Both Yamakawa Kenjiro<br/>
and Yamakawa Hiroshi's connection to the Fujita family are discussed<br/>
briefly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a>  She mentions<br/>
how Kenjiro is a "genius".  He was, and he had some competition too,<br/>
Takamine Hideo (relative, friend, and employer to Mr.and Mrs.<br/>
Fujita)---both Kenjiro and Takamine were skipping grades at<br/>
Nisshinkan---they must've fought over the title of the<br/>
"strongest"--err I mean the "brightest".<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437024868">Kyoto has many festivals<br/>
the Shinsengumi festival would around the date of the Ikedaya Raid---<br/>
this event is sponsored by Shinsengumi clubs from around Japan and <br/>
people and media actually go to the pachinko parlor where Ikedaya <br/>
once stood<br/>
<br/>
The Goryokaku Festival commemorating the death of Hijikata and <br/>
defeat/surrender of Enomoto at Hakodate on Hokkaido occurs around <br/>
May annually<br/>
<br/>
the *AIZU fall celebration and memorial service for Saitou<br/>
occurs in September, according to the blogger the cemetary was <br/>
really crowded this year and she couldn't really see anything <br/>
including the Mugai ryu demonstration<br/>
*Mugai ryu the lineage, one of atleast a couple Saitou Hajime <br/>
supposedly practiced <br/>
<br/>
the events, if any, at Nagarayema haven't really been discussed much <br/>
on Japanese boards<br/>
<br/>
there may be more events connected to museums or key locations in <br/>
Tama ---there is a memorial service at Hijikata's statue at Tama <br/>
around the day of his death too<br/>
<br/>
so basically we have to understand that the Shinsengumi were all <br/>
over the place after the defeat at Toba Fushimi and events are <br/>
really spread out geographically---part of why Aizu is such an <br/>
interesting location is due to the region's emphasis on tourism and <br/>
minor details such as the hot springs  Hijikata used to heal his <br/>
wounds, Kondou's "grave", the BYAKKOTAI, and now there is a renewed <br/>
interest in Shinsengumi fandom for other connected figures such as <br/>
the Yamakawa family (and soon Takagi Morinusuke, brother of Tokio---<br/>
I'm struck by how often posters will praise his bravery as a scout <br/>
and messenger) --- the castle also has a Bakumatsu museum and as <br/>
mentioned in previous posts the "new" photo of Fujita Goro<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto and Aizu have tourist associations you can contact to get <br/>
details, also visit active club sites such as <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hino-shinsengumi.com">http://www.hino-shinsengumi.com</a><br/>
because they actually participate in the cosplay parades and often <br/>
meetings and lectures dealing with the history part and they have a <br/>
calendar of events<br/>

is done (as far as my own suggestions)<br/>
the issue is I didn't research the Shinsengumi in the most efficient<br/>
way possible because of the language barrier--and thus everything was<br/>
very haphazard<br/>
I also included the very very best public databases possible and even<br/>
walk throughs for using google.co.jp to navigate the huge Japanese<br/>

The Meiji Era Policeman<br/>
is ::stereotyped:: as always "SMILING"<br/>
think about RK Fujita Goro's grinning (^_^)<br/>
yes they had to be well mannered but...in literature right from that<br/>
time period...I found 3 instances of the term smiling for example: <br/>
"The smiling officer returned my umbrella" (paraphrased from Hani<br/>
Motoko's memoirs).  I found mention of the smiling ONCE---now I'm<br/>
finding more examples---a disturbing pattern<br/>

Epilogue (work in progress for Tokio page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm)</a><br/>
<br/>
I recently viewed the film Twenty-Four Eyes <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/a74np">http://tinyurl.com/a74np</a><br/>
I didn't expect it to totally reflect upon Tokio's career/life!<br/>
The film dealt with a completely different generation of female<br/>
teachers we're talking late 20s to post WWII. The film by the way<br/>
clobbered an action movie called 7 SAMURAI in the box office. <br/>
Twenty-Four Eyes is an antiwar film expressed through the biography of<br/>
the teacher and her students.<br/>
<br/>
In the film the heroine rides a bicycle out of necessity and wear's a<br/>
"man's suit".<br/>
The principal at the school is worried because she is "from the normal<br/>
school"** "serious about teaching" and "very smart"<br/>
**(likely prefectural normal school)<br/>
<br/>
The heroine had to deal with people judging her based on exterior<br/>
symbols of "modernity" (just as during the Meiji E. students would<br/>
wear western clothing, interact with men and study English).  The<br/>
heroine in fact made her suit from a kimono and rides a bicycle to<br/>
work to avoid taking a boat.  The film is often deceptively simple.<br/>
<br/>
She teaches folksongs (as opposed to JUST state songs) folk songs were<br/>
preserved and taught at Tokyo Women's Normal School (this has more to<br/>
do with Yamaguchi Yukiko--Goro's niece) during the 1880s.  Folk tunes<br/>
were "converted" into western notes at the TWNS.<br/>
<br/>
Futhermore the film captures the partnership between the only 2<br/>
careers available to women: nursing and teaching.  One of the students<br/>
in the film has a sister who is nurse--she promises to support the<br/>
sibling if she can manage to test into the normal school.  During<br/>
Tokio's time many graduates of the normal school also pursued nursing.<br/>
<br/>
The incredibly hard life of female teachers.<br/>
I believe it was in Hani Motoko's narrative that she went to Aomori<br/>
and met a graduate of the Women's Normal School teaching in this<br/>
desolate area.  Again, Tokio would've mentored young women who had to<br/>
move away very far away from home based on their appointments (this is<br/>
why choosing this career was viewed as an act of rebellion).  This<br/>
TOTALLY WAS AGAINST cultural norms of the time where women moved in<br/>
with the family of their husbands---and moved wherever he went. <br/>
<br/>
I had to smile when I realized how Tokio was involved with this<br/>
monumental progress.  As a dorm mother her job was to mentor, educate<br/>
and restrain some young women from going "overboard" with all these<br/>
new ideas---but to even be part of this progress implied an<br/>
understanding and approval of the changes going on.</div>
