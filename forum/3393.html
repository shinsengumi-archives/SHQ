<h3>Welcome New Member ryhorikawa & SHQ NEWS</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242234500">Welcome to all new members of this mailing list and user ryhorikawa <br/>
who is associated with the UW.<br/>
<br/>
I lived in Madison WI for a few years and in fact a bulk of the research <br/>
for SHINSENGUMIHQ (SHQ ) was completed at the UW&#39;s Memorial <br/>
Library and the Wisconsin State Historical Society.  There are <br/>
many &quot;little&quot; treasures and artifacts right in Memorial Union from the <br/>
Meiji Era and some Wisconsinites had interesting connections to 19th <br/>
century Japan. <br/>
<br/>
You may all have already asked yourselves...&quot;well WHAT happened to <br/>
SHQ.com?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, the SHQ hosting company must have experienced a <br/>
technical glitch which erased an html file which is basically where all <br/>
pages of the website are stored (a database pulls info from this html <br/>
file).  The html file was deleted and it&#39;s not clear what happened.  <br/>
FOrtunately Barbara Sheridan had a back up file of everything and from <br/>
this file an e-book will be written.<br/>
<br/>
The e-book will be designed to be user friendly for people new to this <br/>
slice of history and yet written and cited in such a way to make it a <br/>
helpful research resource.  The e-book will be in a pdf format for easy <br/>
download and should any new additional information be added, it will be <br/>
mentioned on an update page.<br/>
<br/>
From examining the SHQ server, it was obvious to me that new visitors <br/>
tended to dwell on popular pages and never visited the really really <br/>
detailed timeline (if one studies it the Shinsengumi narrative emerges).  <br/>
Hopefully by writing an e-book, visitors will be able to have everything in <br/>
front of them and will be able to understand the Shinsengumi and their <br/>
world better.<br/>
<br/>
It took all of us many years of growth, research and reflection on not <br/>
only the Shinsengumi but Aizu-han as well to realize that our fansite can <br/>
be a helpful starting point for people who have just discovered the <br/>
fascinating/notorious/controversial Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
The site will move to a new server and will continue to host fanwork, <br/>
art, vids, stories etc.<br/>
<br/>
This summer, 2008, a first draft of the book will be completed and <br/>
undergo an editing process.<br/>
<br/>
We would also like to throw a &quot;re-opening&quot; party if possible and look <br/>
forward to reconnecting with everyone.<br/>
