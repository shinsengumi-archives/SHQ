a poster named "passenger" and I are trying to communicate :D<br/>
...I hope I represented all of us well with my really really simple<br/>
English...gosh I wish they would stop being so shy (note her command<br/>
of the English language...some of us are still trying to count in<br/>
Japanese LOL!)...I know we have Japanese visitors to shinsengumimb.com<br/>
not only because momoiro-usagi read our posts but because have lurkers<br/>
at like 2-3am...during the daytime in Japan I think.</div>

I imagine you've already done this but let these folks know we'd LOVE to <br/>
hear from them on our messageboard. Hearing their thoughts would be <br/>
fantastic since they have access to the source material we can only <br/>
covet and harass Serizawa and Masayoshi about.<br/>
