a poster named &quot;passenger&quot; and I are trying to communicate :D<br/>
...I hope I represented all of us well with my really really simple<br/>
English...gosh I wish they would stop being so shy (note her command<br/>
of the English language...some of us are still trying to count in<br/>
Japanese LOL!)...I know we have Japanese visitors to shinsengumimb.com<br/>

hear from them on our messageboard. Hearing their thoughts would be <br/>
fantastic since they have access to the source material we can only <br/>
covet and harass Serizawa and Masayoshi about.<br/>
