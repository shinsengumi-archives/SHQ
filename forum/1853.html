<h3>Various Discussions in Japan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865364618"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://8614.teacup.com/hijikata/bbs">http://8614.teacup.com/hijikata/bbs</a><br/>
(translate using <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate)">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate)</a><br/>
<br/>
has daily updates about various lectures being held.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
Mito group historical-records hall <br/>
Topic = "the false charge of the Serizawa duck (Serizawa Kamo) is <br/>
revealed" <br/>
Topic = "Saito 1 and the Yamaguchi house." The relation of Saito 1 <br/>
(Saito Hajime) and Higuchi 1" <<< who is this Higuchi 1?  Does <br/>
anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
Ofcourse we cannot attend these meetings but the importance <br/>
following all of these events is to realize the variety in <br/>
discussion and active/ongoing research<br/>
<br/>
It seems that new documents are found everyweek...take for instance <br/>
a document with Inoue Genzaburo and Rintaro Okita's name was found <br/>
in a house (I think)...and people should be patient/cautious until <br/>
these documents have been verified or atleast closely examined.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480074138">*Yes!* -M- it is Higuchi Ichiyo...I wasn't [sure] because I figure <br/>
that people had the same name...so many people have "ichi" in the <br/>
name I noticed ... the fact that this female novelist lived in the <br/>
same neighborhood as Fujita Goro was mentioned at <br/>
