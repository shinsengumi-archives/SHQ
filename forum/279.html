<br/>
First image: Info about the Shiban or &quot;death squad&quot;. Hijikata in PMK mentions this in ep 20 or 21. It&#39;s a group of 4 people that head in first during a raid. <br/>
<br/>
Second and Third Images: Info about Mibu Gishi Den&#39;s Yoshimura Kanichiro. I&#39;m guessing someone asked if there was really someone in the Shinsengumi by that name. <br/>
