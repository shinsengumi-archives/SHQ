<br/>
First image: Info about the Shiban or "death squad". Hijikata in PMK mentions this in ep 20 or 21. It's a group of 4 people that head in first during a raid. <br/>
<br/>
Second and Third Images: Info about Mibu Gishi Den's Yoshimura Kanichiro. I'm guessing someone asked if there was really someone in the Shinsengumi by that name. <br/>

a kenjutsu teacher in the Shinsengumi AND I did find some book on him<br/>
at amazon.co.jp<br/>
