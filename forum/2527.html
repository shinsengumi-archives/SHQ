<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486662892">it would be cool to have a gathering of members. we can meet in a <br/>
japanese bar and just have fun. it doesn&#39;t have to be all of us in one <br/>
place because we all live in different places of the world. so we set a <br/>
date and everyone in there area meets up in the bar/restaurant and hang <br/>
out. we can take pictures and put them in the group photos. we can <br/>
dress up and just get to know the people in our clan. there should be a <br/>
daiymo for each area so it can get organized right. what do you <br/>
samurais think?</div>

 </span></blockquote> well lets do it! lets find out. lets post a messeage asking whos <br/>
where, beause in the member list some people just don&#39;t put it or never <br/>
set up there profiles. so lets make it happend. this is kind how the <br/>
orginal Shinsengumi started the clan up. so lets give it a try.</div>
