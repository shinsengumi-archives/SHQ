 </span></blockquote>Shinsengumi what exactly?  You mean the NHK drama that's been running <br/>
all year?  It does air on Saturdays in California (with subtitles--lucky <br/>
CA people) and the regular NHK airing is Sundays. The Sunday Japanese <br/>
broadcast is about 6 weeks or so ahead of the subtitled version.<br/>

--Uh yeah, sorry. That drama series.<br/>
It's supposed to be airing right at this moment, but it's not. It's been <br/>
replaced with something about drums. o.O<br/>
Any idea why?<br/>
<br/>
Then, the guide from my reciever/dish tends to be really screwy, so perhaps <br/>
they'll be airing it later on.<br/>
