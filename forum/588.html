<h3>Family Trees</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004841003">My head hurts and no it's not because I've been babelfishing *grin* It's <br/>
because for some reason unknown to me people who keep track of the <br/>
history of Japan's Imperial family don't see the need to put a detailed <br/>
family tree out in the open where poor struggling authors can find it.<br/>
<br/>
Every stinking link I've searched shows me the same little box with the <br/>
same vague info such as Emperor Ninko (Meiji's grandfather) had 7 sons <br/>
and 8 daughters. That's it-- no names of the sons and daughters, no <br/>
names of their children just the generic 7 sons and 8 daughters.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I _need_ to know the names of those 7 sons and 8 daughters and <br/>
their wives/husbands and children, dammit!<br/>
<br/>
Okay I've settled down now. *grin*  If any of you fine people out there <br/>
in Shinsengumi fan land have come across a real chart type family tree  <br/>
for the Imperial family in the 19th century can you let me know?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone should happen to want to know similar information on the <br/>
British royal family for the Sherlock Holmes Meets Saitou fanfic <br/>
challenge I'll be happy to help. I have a big detailed family tree for  <br/>
the British royal family. Those historians know how to make a writer happy.<br/>
