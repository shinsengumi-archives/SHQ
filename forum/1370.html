<h3>TV film&quot;Byakkotai&quot;,review</h3>
by <i>tamagot93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-734968404">I watched this TV film for the first time when it was aired long long time <br/>
ago, and what I can remember now about it is this film made me cry and cry.<br/>
I could just re-watched this one few days ago, It still made me cry, seeing <br/>
those young boys committing suicide, the tragedy of Aizu people so proud and <br/>
loyal.<br/>
<br/>
As the comment about this film in filmography section on SHQ site, this film <br/>
has two parts.<br/>
The first part shows well the complicated situation of Aizu. There is some <br/>
samurai of the domain like chief retainer Tanomo Saigo, who opposed to Katamori <br/>
Matsudaira receiving the office of Protector of Kyoto, because they thought <br/>
that would involve Aizu too much in political conflict.<br/>
They show also the tragic destiny of Shuri Jinbo, who must commit seppuku <br/>
after the defeat of Toba Fushimi, as the responsible of Katamori's abandon.<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi makes an appearance indeed, but they show only Kondo, Hijikata <br/>
and Okita as main characters. There is no Saitou, nor other principal members.<br/>
Nevertheless, Ikedaya Raid scene is awesome one. I like especially Okita <br/>
portrayed by Katsuhiko Nakagawa in this film. Kondo and Hijikata are also good, <br/>
but perhaps I'm now so captivated by NHK Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
The second part entirely focuses on Aizu War with many details.<br/>
It's really hard to see how Byakkotai boys decided to kill themselves, <br/>
suicide of Tanomo Saigo's family including little girls and servants, extermination <br/>
of Nihonmatsu Shounentai ( a unit formed by little boys younger than <br/>
Byakkotai), etc...<br/>
There are also,mortal combat of female unit Joushitai with heroic death of <br/>
Takeko Nakano, gun fighting of brave Yaeko Yamamoto, Battle of Bonari Touge(They <br/>
shows only Hijikata, however we can imagine at that time Saitou strayed from <br/>
Shinsengumi for a while) .<br/>
<br/>
Actors and actress are most prestigious whom you can see in many other films <br/>
like Hisaya Morishige(Okazumi Inoue),Koutaro Satomi(Yorimo Saigo),Morio <br/>
Kazama(Katamori Matsudaira), Yumi Takigawa(Princesse Teru of Aizu),Masaomi <br/>
Kondo(Hijikata) etc...    , <br/>
<br/>
Although many of us might regret absence of Saitou or Tokio in this film, <br/>
watching this one makes us imagine his or her presence, have an idea about what <br/>
happened during the siege of Aizu.<br/>
I have to mention brief appearence of Tokio's brother Morinosuke Takagi as a <br/>
messenger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873332985">Thank you Tama san!<br/>
<br/>
That was a fine review! It sound s like such a good film I wish we could <br/>
see it in the US.  I'll be updating the filmography soon and will <br/>
include your review.<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
See people? It's easy and painless to offer commentary on such things. <br/>
You too can give it a shot. Remember it doesn't matter if we already <br/>
have commentary on a particular show or film we can include as many <br/>
opinions as are offered.<br/>
