<br/>
in regards to Kondou&#39;s execution<br/>
<br/>
I read ~years~ ago that there is more than one way to do this<br/>
<br/>
like in cutting all things with the sword you kind of concentrate on<br/>
using the first 1/3 of the blade (don&#39;t count the hilt), starting from<br/>
the tip. This has to do with the physics of the swing etc etc...the<br/>
part of the blade you want to use is really easy to see on a kendo<br/>
shinai as there is rope/leather which &quot;bind&quot; the bamboo and basically<br/>
divide the the blade into &quot;parts&quot; so to speak.  <br/>
<br/>
Unlike an execution, in seppuku the &quot;second&quot; who beheads the person<br/>
does not cut all the way through...he will cut in far enough to read<br/>
the skin at the front of the neck and pull the blade out which will<br/>
prevent the head from simply &quot;falling&quot; on the ground (this happens in<br/>
a split second)...over time ritual suicide etiquette/procedures will<br/>
change to the point the person who commits suicide can mere point to<br/>
his stomach with a fan and the second will do his job...without the<br/>
person disemboweling himself.<br/>
<br/>
There was a detailed account I read on how in an execution the person<br/>
doing the beheading is going for a certain point on the vertebra (this<br/>
is common sense since he is cutting through...) but ~how~ one can<br/>
accomplish this is beyond me...the point is they wanted the center<br/>
between the base of the neck and shoulder...note that the best swords<br/>
can cut through 2-3 corpses (according to accounts of testing swords).<br/>
<br/>
In the film Shinsengumi! BAnd of Assasins (starring Toshiro)...Kondou<br/>
holds up his poney tail so the executioner can do his job...to me that<br/>
seems weird...it would&#39;ve made more sense to tie his hair up rather<br/>
than hold his hair with his hand....in anycase none of the stuff I<br/>
read really discusses the hair of the person about to be executed.</div>

I&#39;ve heard that in some instances, the second would be someone close to the one who is actually commiting seppuku. (like a friend or something) Because the second shows them &quot;an act of kindness&quot; in ending their suffering after cutting open their stomach. Have you read or heard anything similar? <br/>
<br/>
For women, i&#39;ve read that seppuku is a bit different and involves severing the arteries in the neck. <br/>
<br/>
Btw, the pointing to the stomach with a fan, an example of that is shown in Lone Wolf and Cub when the child had to commit seppuku but had to use the fan because he was too young to use a knife to cut himself open. <br/>

yes, I read the same thing before in several books...if a friend is a<br/>

in terms of killing women...I never read about the artery thing...all<br/>
I read was that if a man was going to execute a woman there was some<br/>
attention paid as to how she &quot;falls&quot;.  If she is kneeling...the<br/>
executioner will cut her in a way that she falls either forward on her<br/>
face or backward (I can&#39;t recall which is the right/wrong way).<br/>
<br/>
but we all gotta remember that the etiquette for stuff like this can<br/>
change dramatically over the years...but I&#39;ve never found like an<br/>
essay written on the topic...these details are mentioned here and<br/>
there in history books.</div>

Woops, I meant, the woman would sever her own arteries in the neck with the knife, not the second. It&#39;s something I read in a book a while back, but I don&#39;t remember what role the second has in it. <br/>
<br/>
I know for men, they tucked away their kimono under their knees in in such a fashion along with placing the wooden pedestal behind and under them to prevent themselves from falling backwards. I forget if this also prevents them from falling forward as well, or makes them only fall forward. <br/>

Okita don&#39;t you think it is interesting/weird as to how these beliefs<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve read that in the scenario that a woman actually kills herself (no<br/>
second to assist)...she will plunge the dagger into her heart...I got<br/>
2 examples to help us understand<br/>
1) The Shambhala Guide to Kendo by Minoru Kiyota isbn1570629277 page 110<br/>
&quot;General Nogi Maresuke...dressed himself in ceremonial garb and<br/>
disemboweled himself while his wife, Shizuko, pierced her heart beside<br/>
him&quot;<br/>
2) The following scenario involves a couple of samurai which took a<br/>
castle...they searched each room and found the body of a<br/>
noblewoman...she had killed herself ...the samurai I guess removed the<br/>
knife and commented that maybe the dagger was not made by Mr. X<br/>
because all weapons knives made by Mr. X would not have been easily<br/>
damaged by bone.  The gist is they thought the knife was a fake. Thus,<br/>
the point is the woman stabbed herself in such a way that it scraped<br/>
bone (sternum?rib?) in the chest area. </span></blockquote></div>

It is interesting. In addition to the beliefs, I wonder when excactly these practices became more ritualized with the wearing of all white, the use of a second, the wooden pedestal, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Hmm, interesting, I thought that the heart would be the hardest to pierce because of all the bone in that area. Now that my interest has been peaked i&#39;ll have to look more into the woman&#39;s side of this hehe. <br/>
<br/>
One other thing I remembered, was there are a few ways to disembowel oneself that i&#39;ve heard about. There&#39;st the regular stab and cut across, but thers&#39;s others that involve manipulating the knife up or down in addition to cutting across. Sounds even more gruesome.... <br/>

<br/>
There is the &quot;u&quot; (like way below the belly button) shaped cut, and <br/>
the &quot;H&quot; shaped cut (which I don&#39;t really understand or ~want~ to <br/>
envision) but there is a strong emphasis to just cut the skin and <br/>
not to cut the intestines themselves...otherwise you committed <br/>
suicide the &quot;wrong&quot; way.  You know its really hard to go up and ask <br/>
knowledgeable people...they&#39;ll probably give you weird looks <br/>
understandably...have you searched on e-budo.com the guys there <br/>
probably discussed all scenarios and possibilities.<br/>

&gt; There is the &quot;u&quot; (like way below the belly button) shaped cut, and <br/>
&gt; the &quot;H&quot; shaped cut (which I don&#39;t really understand or ~want~ to <br/>
&gt; envision) but there is a strong emphasis to just cut the skin and <br/>
&gt; not to cut the intestines themselves...otherwise you committed <br/>
&gt; suicide the &quot;wrong&quot; way.  You know its really hard to go up and ask <br/>
&gt; knowledgeable people...they&#39;ll probably give you weird looks <br/>
&gt; understandably...have you searched on e-budo.com the guys there <br/>
&gt; probably discussed all scenarios and possibilities.<br/>

Okita, as for falling backwards /forwards in the country where I came <br/>
from (*wink*) the national hero (Jose Rizal) made it a point to be <br/>
executed forwards by twisting himself as he got shot (indicating he <br/>

(another symbolism of his innocence and hopes for the future). It <br/>
might be a different case, just thought you&#39;d like to know.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-901854311">My *speculation* would be that it has to do with aesthetics... it&#39;s messy enough, but would be even worse if the intestines were cut (in terms of smell and visuals)... there seems to be a lot of concern about things being neat and clean and not shaming in just about all acts.  Again, that&#39;s just speculation.<br/>
