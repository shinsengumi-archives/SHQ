<br/>
in regards to Kondou's execution<br/>
<br/>
I read ~years~ ago that there is more than one way to do this<br/>
<br/>
like in cutting all things with the sword you kind of concentrate on<br/>
using the first 1/3 of the blade (don't count the hilt), starting from<br/>
the tip. This has to do with the physics of the swing etc etc...the<br/>
part of the blade you want to use is really easy to see on a kendo<br/>
shinai as there is rope/leather which "bind" the bamboo and basically<br/>
divide the the blade into "parts" so to speak.  <br/>
<br/>
Unlike an execution, in seppuku the "second" who beheads the person<br/>
does not cut all the way through...he will cut in far enough to read<br/>
the skin at the front of the neck and pull the blade out which will<br/>
prevent the head from simply "falling" on the ground (this happens in<br/>
a split second)...over time ritual suicide etiquette/procedures will<br/>
change to the point the person who commits suicide can mere point to<br/>
his stomach with a fan and the second will do his job...without the<br/>
person disemboweling himself.<br/>
<br/>
There was a detailed account I read on how in an execution the person<br/>
doing the beheading is going for a certain point on the vertebra (this<br/>
is common sense since he is cutting through...) but ~how~ one can<br/>
accomplish this is beyond me...the point is they wanted the center<br/>
between the base of the neck and shoulder...note that the best swords<br/>
can cut through 2-3 corpses (according to accounts of testing swords).<br/>
<br/>
In the film Shinsengumi! BAnd of Assasins (starring Toshiro)...Kondou<br/>
holds up his poney tail so the executioner can do his job...to me that<br/>
seems weird...it would've made more sense to tie his hair up rather<br/>
than hold his hair with his hand....in anycase none of the stuff I<br/>
read really discusses the hair of the person about to be executed.</div>

I've heard that in some instances, the second would be someone close to the one who is actually commiting seppuku. (like a friend or something) Because the second shows them "an act of kindness" in ending their suffering after cutting open their stomach. Have you read or heard anything similar? <br/>
<br/>
For women, i've read that seppuku is a bit different and involves severing the arteries in the neck. <br/>
<br/>
Btw, the pointing to the stomach with a fan, an example of that is shown in Lone Wolf and Cub when the child had to commit seppuku but had to use the fan because he was too young to use a knife to cut himself open. <br/>

yes, I read the same thing before in several books...if a friend is a<br/>

in terms of killing women...I never read about the artery thing...all<br/>
I read was that if a man was going to execute a woman there was some<br/>
attention paid as to how she "falls".  If she is kneeling...the<br/>
executioner will cut her in a way that she falls either forward on her<br/>
face or backward (I can't recall which is the right/wrong way).<br/>
<br/>
but we all gotta remember that the etiquette for stuff like this can<br/>
change dramatically over the years...but I've never found like an<br/>
essay written on the topic...these details are mentioned here and<br/>
there in history books.</div>

Woops, I meant, the woman would sever her own arteries in the neck with the knife, not the second. It's something I read in a book a while back, but I don't remember what role the second has in it. <br/>
<br/>
I know for men, they tucked away their kimono under their knees in in such a fashion along with placing the wooden pedestal behind and under them to prevent themselves from falling backwards. I forget if this also prevents them from falling forward as well, or makes them only fall forward. <br/>

"General Nogi Maresuke...dressed himself in ceremonial garb and<br/>
disemboweled himself while his wife, Shizuko, pierced her heart beside<br/>
him"<br/>
2) The following scenario involves a couple of samurai which took a<br/>
castle...they searched each room and found the body of a<br/>
noblewoman...she had killed herself ...the samurai I guess removed the<br/>
knife and commented that maybe the dagger was not made by Mr. X<br/>

damaged by bone.  The gist is they thought the knife was a fake. Thus,<br/>
the point is the woman stabbed herself in such a way that it scraped<br/>
bone (sternum?rib?) in the chest area. </span></blockquote></div>

It is interesting. In addition to the beliefs, I wonder when excactly these practices became more ritualized with the wearing of all white, the use of a second, the wooden pedestal, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Hmm, interesting, I thought that the heart would be the hardest to pierce because of all the bone in that area. Now that my interest has been peaked i'll have to look more into the woman's side of this hehe. <br/>
<br/>
One other thing I remembered, was there are a few ways to disembowel oneself that i've heard about. There'st the regular stab and cut across, but thers's others that involve manipulating the knife up or down in addition to cutting across. Sounds even more gruesome.... <br/>

<br/>
There is the "u" (like way below the belly button) shaped cut, and <br/>
the "H" shaped cut (which I don't really understand or ~want~ to <br/>
envision) but there is a strong emphasis to just cut the skin and <br/>
not to cut the intestines themselves...otherwise you committed <br/>
suicide the "wrong" way.  You know its really hard to go up and ask <br/>
knowledgeable people...they'll probably give you weird looks <br/>
understandably...have you searched on e-budo.com the guys there <br/>
probably discussed all scenarios and possibilities.<br/>

Sec... Did you read that somewhere? I would imagine that cutting all <br/>
the way to the stomach's intestines would mean a more assured/faster <br/>
way to die, wouldn't that be the preference or is it required that <br/>
you be conscious for as long as possible when committing seppuku? <br/>
Sounds harsh to me either way....<br/>

Okita, as for falling backwards /forwards in the country where I came <br/>
from (*wink*) the national hero (Jose Rizal) made it a point to be <br/>
executed forwards by twisting himself as he got shot (indicating he <br/>
is not a traitor) and to ensure he fell backwards towards the sky <br/>
(another symbolism of his innocence and hopes for the future). It <br/>
might be a different case, just thought you'd like to know.</div>

I know that in "Ran", during a scene when all the women were killing <br/>
themselves, two of the ladies assisted each other by simultaneously <br/>
plunging their knives into each other's heart.  I meant to watch the <br/>
playback and take notes on how the other women were killing <br/>
themselves, but I never got around to it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-901854311">My *speculation* would be that it has to do with aesthetics... it's messy enough, but would be even worse if the intestines were cut (in terms of smell and visuals)... there seems to be a lot of concern about things being neat and clean and not shaming in just about all acts.  Again, that's just speculation.<br/>
