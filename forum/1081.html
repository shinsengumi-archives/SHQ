<h3>More stuff about Saito</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087562594">I was just over on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toshizo.com/name/">http://www.toshizo.com/name/</a> and if you look under <br/>
Saito's name you come across this info. I couldn't get Babelfish to <br/>
work on the site, BTW. I used my translator. I don't know if Gist <br/>
will work on the site or not.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of speculation about Saito's connections to Aizu. There's a <br/>
statement that "It is said that I learned cutting down with one <br/>
stroke of thw sword style (because it is Aizu, I seem to be Mizoguchi <br/>
cutting down with one stroke of the sword style among cutting down <br/>
with one stroke of thw sword style various factions) at a dojo studio <br/>
in an Aizu feudal clan daimyo's mansion in Edo from these days. It <br/>
seems to be an opportunity that father became friendly with an Aizu <br/>
feudal clan in the intermediate service times." <br/>
<br/>
Then it says "I cut a person at the age of 19 years old by mistake <br/>
and kill you and it is necessary in Edo and say to ? Kyoto when I <br/>
escaped." No explanation on how the "mistake" occured though. Or WAS <br/>
the mistake that he got found out? ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Now this is interesting! "According to the testimony of the people <br/>
who knew him well, looks of Saito during the lifetime assumed that <br/>
the eyebrows were ? which was ? and it seems to have been sharp ? of <br/>
eyes and the tall man who did it. This is Saito of later years, and <br/>
there is the story that was a fat (big of a body) man with a ruddy <br/>
face in one's youth in fact." I suspect that "fat" is not really the <br/>
correct word, but it's the one the stupid translator chose.<br/>
<br/>
There the indication that Saito did everything possible to keep the <br/>
name "Goro Fujita" good. <br/>
<br/>
There is a mention of the mystery wife. It says "In time tail and the <br/>
Aomori times (when he was in the Shimokita peninsula area with the <br/>
exiled Aizu clan) before marrying, I seem to have married a woman <br/>
of "unpleasant ?", which was 4 years old older." "Unpleasant" what <br/>
though? Family? Character? Or is "unpleasant" the wrong word? Curious.<br/>
<br/>
And now for the real interesting part, though I can't understand AT <br/>
ALL what the connection was! It says that "At the time of Aizu war, I <br/>
tried to do it Yaeko Yamamoto ? who enters a castle becomes the <br/>
night, and to cut hair in a short sword by taking the field (Yaeko <br/>
held a gun with a spunky woman and appeared in a battlefield with a <br/>
man), but I am not readily sharp and tell that I "had cut older <br/>
sister time (a tail)?"<br/>
<br/>
Ok Yaeko Yamamoto I know something about! She's mentioned in the <br/>
introduction of "Remembering Aizu"! She was the woman prisoner who <br/>
was sent with the men to the camp in Inawashiro. The reason is that <br/>
her brother was killed outside of Kyoto, so she began to dress in his <br/>
clothing and demand that everyone call her by his name. She was <br/>
supposed to have fought right along side of the men. <br/>
<br/>
But what on earth is it trying to say about her and Saito?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768420584">Well, 3-hajime.com says that S.H.'s father was involved with<br/>
information collecting somehow (its speculation ofcourse)...and Aizu<br/>
was a very important domain...perhaps he did alot of travelling and<br/>
took his youngest son along...S.H. older brother seemed to be the<br/>
bookish type.<br/>
<br/>
yes other sites translated under the fish always talk about long<br/>
eyebrows (I guess when he was really old---sec thinking of Nagakura's<br/>
pic)...sharp eyes/glint/shine in your eyes (I just posted my rant<br/>
about its posssible meanings)...you know I definately read about he<br/>
"gained" some weight but definately not fat because of one of the<br/>
***rumors*** about his visit to the Yagi mansion -after- the<br/>
revolution mentions it...but I would presume that he visited the Yagi<br/>
mansion BEFORE going to the Seinan War as a member of the TMPD...if<br/>
you look at the group picture...you can hardly call him "fat" or very<br/>
tall (estimate 175 cm makes him barely 5.8 ft) for that matter <br/>
<br/>
the word "ruddy" or reddish face in terms of complexion is interesting<br/>
when I was a kid I was trying to understand a term in Thai about the<br/>
character of Guan Yu in (Romance of the Three Kingdoms San Guo<br/>
Yanyi)...as it compares to a deep red/brown fruit...I used alot of<br/>
dictionaries and the word ruddy showed up...perhaps S.H.'s face was<br/>
"ruddy" due to drinking...or he was just dark skinned.<br/>
<br/>
I think because he had a family he would try hard to keep this name<br/>
good/clean and since Matsudaira gave it to him...I think he wanted<br/>
this honored/gift name to stick (maybe after a couple of name changes<br/>
he figured---I'm gonna settle for this one).<br/>
<br/>
In Tokio's bio at both 3-hajime and 1to5.net it mentions her cutting<br/>
her sister's hair (I think)...<br/>
<br/>
I recall that interesting part in Remember Aizu and I always<br/>
thought...what if this is somehow connected to Hara Goro's<br/>
sister...the myster woman Nakajima painted?  Perhaps "spunky" isn't<br/>
the right word when it applies to sword/halberd/rifle wielding women<br/>
both at Aizu and Satsuma...in the file I placed on streamload for all<br/>
to download...that pic of Satsuma women (the book is called Seinan<br/>
Sen-so) on a bridge with swords/halberds was TOTALLY like what<br/>
happened at Aizu.<br/>
<br/>
Wow the myster wife Yaso..."unpleasant"? that's weird...maybe they did<br/>
get a divorce?...that's sad I think its hard for women back then to<br/>
re-marry (unless she keeps it a secret)...but remember back in that<br/>
day divorces are almost always blamed on women (hisssss)...heck maybe<br/>
S.H. wasn't very good at judging character<br/>
