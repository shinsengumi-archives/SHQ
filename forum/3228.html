<h3>NHK + TV ASAHI WARNING TO ME (vids being pulled)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-451669169">Due to this notice, and also NHK saying the same thing<br/>
all vids under<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/secretarytocapt3">http://www.youtube.com/secretarytocapt3</a><br/>
and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/shinsengumihq">http://www.youtube.com/shinsengumihq</a><br/>
<br/>
which shows copyrighted material will be deleted otherwise those <br/>
accounts will be closed by youtube<br/>
<br/>
what does this mean?<br/>
<br/>
it means if you haven't already seen those vids...SEE THEM <br/>
NOW...LIKE RIGHT NOW...I have to delete them probably this evening<br/>
<br/>
now if you simply search youtube for "Byakkotai" you will find <br/>
DOZENS of clips of NHK Shinsengumi, TV ASAHI Byakkotai, TV ASAHI <br/>
ANIME! and so forth still readily available---as for anime, you know <br/>
there are infinite clips<br/>
<br/>
trust me on this...youtube can't and never have enforced any policy <br/>
consistently...now you may wonder how the heck youtube <br/>
was "informed" about (secretarytocapt3)...you see anyone can report <br/>
to youtube copyright infringement.  <br/>
<br/>
I am currently involved in a totally unrelated youtube controversy <br/>
and it seems that a smartass has determined I am the same person (as <br/>
another userid---I have more than one youtube account)...they <br/>
probably took it upon themselves to harass me indirectly---because <br/>
as I said before if ASAHI & NHK want to bug me...they need to PULL <br/>
HUNDREDS OF OTHER VIDS WHICH HAVE SAT ON YOUTUBE FOR MONTHS which <br/>
get several thousand views...my vids barely get any views !!!  This <br/>
kind of harassment has already happened to me, for instance people <br/>
create usernames almost exactly the same as mine and post comments <br/>
mocking "myself".<br/>
<br/>
also I would like to warn everyone here there is this new <br/>
law/article stating that copyrighted music (even if the artist gives <br/>
it for free) cannot be superimposed or applied to moving images they <br/>
have not approved of...which means if you stick a song onto anime <br/>
and make your own fan music vid---you just broke the law.  What does <br/>
this mean?  When you make a music vid...get ready to add your own <br/>
music---yes go out and buy a kazoo or harmonica or gather your own <br/>
band and record it (^_^)---does anyone pay attention to this law?  <br/>
Nope! I actually cite the artist and source of the music in my vids <br/>
or summaries to my vids, often people don't even do that! (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
sadly this totally screws up what Hirotada Tokugawa and I had <br/>
planned, that is a super masterpiece multi-part video/audio <br/>
commentary/music extravaganza which would be our own, historically <br/>
accurate documentary of the Shinsengumi & Aizu-han<br/>
it would detail what Hillsoborough conveniently "left out" but other <br/>
scholars have WRITTEN IN ENG, OR JAPANESE, and Aizu-han's narrative <br/>
is not widely know, we'd like to present it using extracted footage <br/>
from old Shinsengumi films, old version of Byakkotai + new 2007 <br/>
Byakkotai...just to keep things visually appealing.  We would use <br/>
all that film footage to keep it "interesting" however it would be <br/>
again totally accurate info (those films have slight innaccuracies <br/>
or need further explanation)---it looks like we cannot do that <br/>
EITHER (T_T)---and months ago I had painstakingly begun to gather <br/>
footage and extracting scenes using free software only the super <br/>
computer at school can run<br/>
<br/>
If we were going to do some sort of Shinsengumi & Aizu documentary <br/>
using...I dunno...finger puppets, no one would watch it...<br/>
