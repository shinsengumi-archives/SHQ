<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901901180">I don't know if any of you have noticed, but mail seems to be moving along better for the list today... or maybe they just took care of me.  :-)  Anyway, I got this message back from Yahoo this morning --- a form note, but they did receive my complaint and, like I said, messages seem to be reaching the site and my inbox within a normal time-frame again.  If anyone continues to have problems with delivery, either contact Customer Care or e-mail me & I'll follow up with them.<br/>

Error message: None<br/>

Type your feedback here:<br/>
Yahoogroups is experiencing major <br/>
problems delivering list messages, <br/>
especially to those receiving <br/>
individual e-mails. The messages come <br/>
into inboxes as much as 14 hours later, <br/>
sometimes are sent multiple times (one <br/>
list member received a message into his <br/>
inbox *24* times), and sometimes never <br/>
show up at all. For a discussion <br/>
group, this is torture... and it's been <br/>
going on for well over a week. <br/>
Normally when we've encountered <br/>
problems like this, the problem has <br/>
cleared up, but it's not clearing up <br/>
this time.<br/>
<br/>
I've been searching the Help files to <br/>
no avail for what could be causing <br/>
this. May I suggest Yahoo create a <br/>
page where users (of mail and groups) <br/>
can access update information about <br/>
problems the system is experiencing? <br/>
If such a page exists, WHERE is it?<br/>
<br/>
Of the groups I am on, the one <br/>
experiencing the most trauma (because <br/>
it's the most active) is shq. <br/>
<br/>
I and the group are anxiously awaiting <br/>
an explanation for the problems and a <br/>
hopeful cure. Thank you!<br/>
