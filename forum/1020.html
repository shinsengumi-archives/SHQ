<h3>Nagakura Shinpachi biography in progress</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-407690936">So like I said on the message board, I&#39;m going through several sources and <br/>
putting together as thorough a biography of Nagakura as I can possibly find. <br/>
I haven&#39;t gotten very far yet, but here&#39;s what I know:<br/>
<br/>
--Shinpachi was known as Eikichi or Eiji during his childhood.<br/>
<br/>
--He was born in the Matsumae clan&#39;s &quot;kami-yashiki&quot; (upper residence) in <br/>
Edo. Seems that every daimyo had three residences in Edo-- upper, middle, <br/>
and lower. Good way to keep them poor, I suppose, and thus leave them with <br/>
no money to spend on revolt, unless you have domains with trade surpluses <br/>
like Choshuu and Satsuma...<br/>
<br/>
--Shinpachi&#39;s father, Nagakura Kanji, was a retainer of the Matsumae clan, <br/>
with a 150 koku stipend. He was a true product of the Edo era-- part of the <br/>
sub-culture of samurai who lived their entire lives in Edo, but were <br/>
retainers of a domain they&#39;d never seen and probably never would.<br/>
<br/>
--Nagakura&#39;s father spelled the family name with the &quot;naga&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot;, <br/>
but Shinpachi spelled it with the &quot;naga&quot; from the word for &quot;eternity&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
--Nagakura got his start in kenjutsu earlier than Okita. Okita started at <br/>
age 9 in Tennen Rishin Ryuu-- BUT Nagakura entered Okada Juusuke Toshisada&#39;s <br/>
Shintou Munen Ryuu dojo at age 8.<br/>
<br/>
--Nagakura&#39;s birthday is the 11th day of the fourth month of Tenpo 10. By <br/>
our calendar, that&#39;s May 11, 1839 (so we JUST missed it! lol)<br/>
<br/>
More soon.<br/>
