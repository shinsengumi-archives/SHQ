<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005267503">Pearce, Jonathan. "The Far Side of the Moon" USA: Infinity<br/>
Publishing.com, 2001<br/>
ISBN 0741409100<br/>
<br/>
I took some notes please see "FILES"  I saved the file as htm but a<br/>
link didn't show up as a clickable link.  One of the characters,<br/>
Matsunosuke, is an Aizu samurai and good archer.  Although not<br/>
mentioned in the book, Japanese archery kyudo/kyujutsu, has a feature<br/>
where the bow rotates as the arrow is released, hence the need for an<br/>
arm guard because it rotates and hit the other side of your arm.  I<br/>
got screen caps to illustrate this from 1/47 ronin<br/>

I thought I mentioned this because many mainstream martial arts book<br/>
do  not illustrate this detail very well...movies can be great<br/>
learning tools ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Will someone please recommend this book to an English language teacher<br/>
who works in Aizu...selected excerpts from the book can be used to<br/>
enhance the learning experience.<br/>
