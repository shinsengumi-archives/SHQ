<h3>Maekawa Storehouse / PMK</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932959437">FINALLY! Was able to finish PMK last night.... Watched all last 5 <br/>
episodes non-stop. I don&#39;t know personally I think it was rushed, <br/>
but I liked it nonetheless.... Somehow though, my favorite character <br/>
changed from Susumu to Suzu. I feel so sorry for him... The ending <br/>
definitely gives good way for a second series which might not be too <br/>
far off if ADV does license the anime... <br/>
<br/>
No one ever answered my question before whether the Anime started <br/>
with the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker or Peacemaker Kurogane manga. <br/>
I&#39;m just curious because I&#39;d like to see a second season an was <br/>
curious what that might contain...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, while watching Hijikata&#39;s interrogation of that store owner, <br/>
I remembered a few weeks ago I posted a bus tour here in the mailing <br/>
list. The reason I did that was because it had very interesting <br/>
photos on the Maekawa residence particularly the storehouse where <br/>
they did the interrogation of prisoners. The site is in Japanese and <br/>
I can&#39;t find it in my bookmarks right now... Sorry, I&#39;ll put it up <br/>
once I find it. Anyway, the pics are in the location section of the <br/>
photos.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797014303">Really? Suzu?  I used to feel sorry for him too but now I feel kind of<br/>
scared of him 0_O  I think the writers have to show some real skill<br/>
and not just rely on the &quot;you killed my teacher&quot; excuse (which was<br/>
parodied in Kill Bill Vol. 2)...PMK, I love it I love it, but there is<br/>
sooo much of the evil twin model.  Yoshida is the evil twin for<br/>
Hijikata, Okita has an evil twin, and Susu is Tetsu&#39;s evil twin...I<br/>
know even RK  kind of has the evil twin model but in PMK it is very<br/>
very pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
I saw your Maekawa residence pics...there is an actual tour you can<br/>
download at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-shinsengumi.com/">http://www.the-shinsengumi.com/</a> (the link is in the middle<br/>
of the sword)...and they show the floorboards the rooms etc and the<br/>
tour guides act like they are all scared etc...funny<br/>
<br/>
I tried to answer your question by going to fifay.net but the address<br/>
keeps &quot;timing out&quot;...and as of right now it is still &quot;timing out&quot; but<br/>
I think fifay.net has the answer to your question<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14990578">Ah... So it incorporated all volumes... Interesting! Now that might <br/>
be a problem... If the manga goes slowly, then it might take away <br/>
the chances for a second season as interest in the Anime dies down <br/>
in Japan. Hopefully the early licensing of the manga will help keep <br/>
the ball rolling.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for answering my question.... :O)<br/>

so interesting. Which way will he go? What is the alternate route?<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Yes.. I remember you posted that tour... I think I forgot about <br/>
it since I didn&#39;t have decent internet connection back then... Will <br/>
go and see...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for trying to find out... From the stuff that I read it said <br/>
it started with SIP not PMK. Miss Barbara took it a step further and <br/>
said PMK is ongoing and just past the Ikeda-ya incident... I will <br/>
check Fifay.net too....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903844796">Which way will he go? What is the alternate route?<br/>
<br/>
He will concentrate only on Tetsu---this is forshadowed in the first<br/>
episode when Tetsu runs into him on the bridge and Tetsu says &quot;why are<br/>
you walking in the middle of the bridge&quot; (Tetsu was running to sign up<br/>
to get in the Shinsengumi) and Suzu says &quot;we else will I walk&quot;...the<br/>
characters are from the same mold but coming from different<br/>
directions...as long as their last show down doesn&#39;t end with one them<br/>
self combusting then I&#39;ll be happy<br/>
<br/>
*I thought it was interesting how Enishi&#39;s grief in RK is expressed<br/>
physically through his white hair...and it is probably the same<br/>
symbolism with Suzu seeing how in 19th century Japan the platinum hair<br/>
color wasn&#39;t really the &quot;in&quot; thing yet<br/>
