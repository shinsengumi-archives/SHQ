Kon Ichikawa is a reknown director with a background in animation.  In<br/>
this clip he depicts Ikedaya Jigen.  One voice actor Kiichi Nakai will<br/>
go on to play Yoshimura Kani&#39;chiro in MIBUGISHIDEN.  This film is<br/>
based on the famous comic by Hiroshi Kurogane.  Back in 2000 the<br/>
Shinsengumi craze had not really taken root yet (aside from Rurouni<br/>
Kenshin based fandom) thus making this small budget venture &quot;lost&quot; to<br/>
later fans.  Many online communities love this depiction and I myself<br/>
admire the atmosphere and creativity which went into this film.  It<br/>
would have been neat if when a sword cuts through someone you hear the<br/>
sound of tearing paper...<br/>
<br/>
I hope fans everywhere will try making their own Shinsengumi films and<br/>
try any genre using whatever means you have.  Last year I made<br/>
&quot;IkeDIEya&quot; using Easter Eggs...it was fun and the exact opposite of<br/>
Kon Ichikawa&#39;s grim black and white approach...I went with a more<br/>
bright colorful approach because it was &quot;filmed&quot; in my refrigerator. <br/>
Even if Shinsengumi media such as manga and film have entered a<br/>
dormant period fans can continue to have fun by producing their work<br/>
and sharing with a community.<br/>
<br/>
I endeavour to report on the progress of the SHQ site very soon so<br/>
that all our supporter and donors can see where their contributions went.</div>
