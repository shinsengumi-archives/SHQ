<h3>Entering shyly...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476731170">Hi...<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s time to introduce myself... *fidgets slightly*<br/>
By now, some of you already know that all time RK favorite character is Enishi, and might wonder what I&#39;m doing here. Hell, I even feel myself like some kind of intruder... However, I think it&#39;s not exactly a mystery that my second favorite character in the series is Saitou, and that&#39;s why I tend to give him an important role in my fics. So, well, I find tempting any place where I can find interesting information  as well as to hear interesting discussions about him, his past and the Shinsengumi. So here I&#39;m. <br/>
Yet, there is a second reason, since I am in love with PMK series. The guilty party here is composed by Barbara Sheridan and Miss Behavin *points at both* and their deliciously funny Mibu Times/Dispatch. I found that to understand certain jokes I had to know about PMK, so I decided to download several episodes. Since then, I&#39;m lost in addiction. *wails*<br/>
A wave of sadness enveloped me over the past weekend, after I saw episode 23, since it announced that next one would be the ending. Is there any news on any kind of continuation? Is there any place where I can read/download scanlations/translations of the manga? I live where the world ends, in deep South America, so you can imagine, no dreams of getting any copy of the manga at all for a very long time. Any info will be deeply appreciated.<br/>

The first 2 or 3 volumes have been done and I believe it&#39;s on <br/>
fifay.net   You should be able to find it by Googling<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s a wee something that might cheer you up because it seems that <br/>
Hijikata and company were sent on a little undercover assignment....<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I suppose I cannot blame you... *winks*... btw... I want to read more editions of the old newspapers...<br/>
As for addictions, sister&#39;s ghosts are far worse than soba AND cigarrette together... *sighs*<br/>
(talking of which, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fate, or a fixation of dark angsty guys with complicated sibling relationships, but as you can guess by what I said, my fav. PMK character is Yamazaki Susumu...)<br/>
<br/>

dreaded RK Seishounen (sp?)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s true... *wails louder than before* <br/>
Now, I totally agree with you concerning PMK movies, but I think they know better than to play on us some dirty trick in Seissou Hen style. They know that they risk to be promptly Aku-Soku-Zan-ed on sight if they dare. &gt;.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the tips, I&#39;ll try to google during the weekend (free of daughter&#39;s school YEAH!)<br/>
and concerning that undercover assignments...................... Hehe... I guess Hijikata -sama would be almost as happy as when his haikus were stolen... But Okita looks possitively, absolutely gorgeous... <br/>
<br/>
Now about that Ishin Shishi undercover... red on red..., mmm... too flashy? maybe if he tries magenta next time... He should ask advice to Okita-sama. Hehehe...<br/>
