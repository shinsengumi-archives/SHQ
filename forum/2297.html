<h3>Poll on where the SHQ is now.</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453547815">We are soon to reach our One Year anniversary here at the SHQ. At <br/>
this point it would be appropriate to hear from you, the Shinsengumi <br/>
fans, and find out if the SHQ is living up to your expectations. <br/>
Please take a moment to answer the questions in the &quot;Polls&quot; section <br/>
and tell us what you truly feel about the SHQ.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
