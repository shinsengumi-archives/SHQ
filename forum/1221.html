<h3>Good Website on Aizu</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438269078"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/SilkRoad-Lake/6618/index.html">http://www.geocities.co.jp/SilkRoad-Lake/6618/index.html</a><br/>
also has a pic of the town taken in the 37th year of the<br/>
Meiji...pretty densely populated---lots of buildings<br/>
<br/>
futhermore the site discusses the heroic women of Aizu<br/>
including Yamamoto Yaeko...ever wonder how she learned how to use a<br/>
gun?  Her father(?) was an instructor in gunnery...and the whole bit<br/>
about cutting hair is because she and other women had to disguise<br/>
themselves as men<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe I found this link from reading a humorous/silly fanfic<br/>
involving Yamaguchi Jiro wearing a western uniform at Aizu (all the<br/>
men around him noticed how handsome he looked wearing it) and learning<br/>
how to use a gun...and just about every guy (including Hijikata)<br/>
around him chasing after him @_@</div>
