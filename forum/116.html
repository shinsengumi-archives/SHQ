<h3>Files Reminder from the List Wench</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-708479138">A reminder for "old" list members and a bit of FYI for those of you <br/>
who've just joined us (belated welcome!) <br/>
<br/>
It would be most helpful  if you could upload text based <br/>
information/files to the group "Files" area and anything having to do <br/>
with images to the the "Photos" section.<br/>
<br/>
I've been going through and trying to gather the entries as they come in <br/>
to put together pages for the website's "Facts" section. Hopefully I <br/>
will have something up there by the time the weekend rolls around.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you .<br/>
