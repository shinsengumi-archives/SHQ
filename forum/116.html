<h3>Files Reminder from the List Wench</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-708479138">A reminder for &quot;old&quot; list members and a bit of FYI for those of you <br/>
who&#39;ve just joined us (belated welcome!) <br/>
<br/>
It would be most helpful  if you could upload text based <br/>
information/files to the group &quot;Files&quot; area and anything having to do <br/>
with images to the the &quot;Photos&quot; section.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been going through and trying to gather the entries as they come in <br/>
to put together pages for the website&#39;s &quot;Facts&quot; section. Hopefully I <br/>
will have something up there by the time the weekend rolls around.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you .<br/>
