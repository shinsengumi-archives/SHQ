<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607320616">It&#39;s taking me months but I&#39;ve been saving 1to5.net babel translations<br/>
of each and every page offline on my computer for reference and I just<br/>
need these pages<br/>

<br/>
and I&#39;m done!... if anyone has these pages saved in babel language<br/>
please let me know:)<br/>
<br/>
she has the funniest commentary and even did this fortune telling<br/>
thing for people born on the day hist. S.H. was born (I think that is<br/>
the gist of the page)...unlike 3-hajime she has pics of Aizu<br/>
locations, not only bonari pass+buddha hall, summary of a stage play<br/>
starring our Fujita Goro, discusses the poplularit of Okita&#39;s grave<br/>
and lots of neat things<br/>
<br/>
****1to5.net has something really weird info not mentioned elsewhere<br/>
<br/>
****I&#39;ll spare you the [entire] babel trans...greatly paraphrased<br/>
<br/>
1) There is a location (1to5.net has a pic) where Ito and his minions<br/>
and Saito stayed at...at this place Ito (and or his followers)<br/>
&quot;Manufacturing method of English or rocket&quot; and webmaster thinks that<br/>
perhaps S.H. as an Ito follower studied this as well<br/>
<br/>
2) Ito to Saitou &quot;you are young, therefore it is, the white tooth<br/>
saying, the air which was studied various types does the various not<br/>
learning.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
now...on 3-hajime you get an account of Kondou criticizing Saitou for<br/>
his inability to write his name (or the quality of calligraphy)<br/>
<br/>
3) at this &quot;place&quot; &quot;passes about 7 months here. Making provision for<br/>
the surprise attack of new selection group, when sleeping, it<br/>
designates the right arm as under, or designates the left arm as<br/>
under, or discoursed so is, but if Saito left-handedness, everyone you<br/>
sleep backwards the oak and others? With just a little you think.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*at other websites the Itou affair lasted 8 months not 7...webmaster<br/>
is still speculating on the left/right hand thing here</div>
