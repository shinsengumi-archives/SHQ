<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
A companion list to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040830225141/http://groups.yahoo.com/group/miburo/">the Miburo group</a> founded mainly because our original files section is overflowing with great information on the Shinsengumi in general and Saitou Hajime in particular.
</p><p>
We have many knowledgeable and talented members who entertain and educate us with the information they&#39;ve culled from their own research.
</p><p>
Although we believe our interest in Saitou and the Shinsengumi is an honorable, living tribute to these brave men, we aren&#39;t above slipping into Otaku mode now and then and having fundoshi fantasies and plotting ways to clone and   ravish them. *leering hentai grin*
