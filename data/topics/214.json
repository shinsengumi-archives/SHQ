I know there is a police <br/>\nmuseum but I can&#39;t find their main site...other sites list the <br/>\nmuseum&#39;s address and phone number etc...I have also seen *really* <br/>\nfancy military uniforms...lots of embroidery on the sleeve cuffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone knows where I can find a pic of a regular police uniform <br/>\nlet me know.  I noticed that in the anime S.H.&#39;s uniform is a <br/>\nlighter blue than in the OVA Remembrance (very dark navy blue)...it <br/>\nmay be due to the production of the series but I&#39;m wondering how <br/>\nthese uniforms really look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a live action movie from this period which features <br/>\npolicemen?</div>",
