BS knows the review cannot be disputed because<br/>\nthose are facts which BS cannot reconcile with the text which was<br/>\ndesigned a &quot;certain way&quot; to push a certain interpretation.<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi enthusiasts in their native land -do- read and discuss the<br/>\nsame issues we do here, they review books as well too.  This is not a<br/>\nmatter of taking &quot;sides&quot; if some Japanese read BS they may say worst<br/>\nand they&#39;ll even throw more sources at BS to prove the text wrong<br/>\npoint by point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can see the official page of BS on a well known internet book<br/>\nstore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some interesting reviews there too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between those reviews and what BS was unhappy is that<br/>\nthe review -deleted- basically nailed the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nBS needs to go and argue with the Japanese authors not the messenger<br/>\nwho quoted those works.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nPeople have taken similar cases on free speech to the supreme court<br/>\nyou know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd look at us...I&#39;ve been fair and even pimped the book on SHQ! <br/>\nSerious, we probably comprise a large number of people who bought the<br/>\nwork too...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is BS saying? &quot;thanks for buying my BS, but you can&#39;t find errors<br/>\nin it otherwise I get unhappy&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese posts do not mention any names at all.  There are no grounds for<br/>\nlegal action or intimidation whatsover.  I had to delete stuff cuz<br/>\nsomeone wanted to exercise understandably the utmost caution.<br/>\nAgain BS would have to prove the work is BS (^_^)<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we post a short, concise essay about how the Imperial Army was<br/>\nfounded illegally:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) waged war illegally via the use of a FORGED IMPERIAL<br/>\nEDICT--resulting in the deaths of countless of civilians in Aizu and<br/>\nnorthern domains<br/>\n2) bore illegal Imperial standards (because some were made by Okubo<br/>\nToshimichi---this was from a &quot;pro&quot; Okubo bio! ^_^ )<br/>\n3) stole bakufu property (the STONEWALL battleship) and in one<br/>\ncase...bakufu guns (this undermines the popular view that the<br/>\nshogunate was not modernizing, if it wasn&#39;t how come it had so many<br/>\ntoys the Imperialists wanted? The bakufu not the Meiji had already<br/>\nbrought in French personel for modernizing the army!).<br/>\n4) first democratic elections (ok it&#39;s just a small group of guys)<br/>\ntook place amongst samurai at Hakodate---buy the remnants of the<br/>\nbakufu men (Enomoto, western educated, and our Hijikata Toshizo). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe list can go on and on and everything above is from good texts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are not popular views but they are the finer details sacrificed<br/>\nfor the sake of a master narrative designed for a people to feel<br/>\nfierce pride for their nation---without understanding we&#39;re all human<br/>\nbeings, we&#39;re all good and bad---what&#39;s up with the LIES?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd all this info is gonna appear on a humble fansite, all shock full<br/>\nof citation (^_^).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who wants to question us can go right ahead, cross check our<br/>\nwork a million times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not afraid of a different opinion because we stick to the facts.<br/>\n They can present their facts in the same way and we&#39;ll put stuff side<br/>\nby side.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly the Boshin war takes on a new dimension and then you start to<br/>\n understand why people were mad, why they fought and why blood was shed.</div>",

The actions and writings of BS smack of the old-<br/>\nstyle Soviet custom of &#39;disinformation&#39;, which means that if you keep <br/>\non repeating untruths long enough, people start believing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy surpressing objective analysis of his work BS is putting <br/>\ndisinformation into play and what he wrote will eventually become <br/>\nthe &#39;truth&#39; for many who read his work without the benefit of a <br/>\nscholarly analysis of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my regrets is that I even bought that book in the first place, <br/>\ngiven the turn of events. But when I purchased it, I was less <br/>\ninformed about the subject matter than I am now. But people learn. I <br/>\ncertainly will not buy anything else that BS has written in the past <br/>\nor will write in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you mentioned, he should be thanking the researcher. (He should be <br/>\npaying the researcher for correcting his errors!) BS could have used <br/>\nthe critique as an opportunity to write a &#39;revised&#39; edition the next <br/>\ntime the book was printed. This may have increased his sales, because <br/>\nperhaps people would buy a second copy of the book just to get the <br/>\ncorrected information. BS isn&#39;t as smart as he thinks. He just passed <br/>\nup a money making opportunity!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mods think that my comments may get the message board into <br/>\ntrouble, please feel free to delete this post.</div>",
