Well, I don&#39;t remember if I mentioned it there or not, <br/>\nbut they were growing some tobacco (illegally of course) in Japan during the <br/>\nEdo period.

Unless you&#39;re a smoker, you cannot imagine how difficult it is to go through the RK manga after you&#39;ve run out and no prospect for more for hours to come --- I swear Saitou just conjures them out of the air... or like he has some kind of magic pack that replenishes itself.  The number of cigarettes he just tosses aside after he&#39;s just lit it... I could smack him for that!!  So sad to sit here and stare at all those unsmoked cigarettes... ;-)<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (wondering how expensive cigarettes were in Japan at the time... how long they were available only as import... assuming that Japan eventually did create it&#39;s own, but maybe not... hmmm....)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
