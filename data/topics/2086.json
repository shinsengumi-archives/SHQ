E. von, 1849-1913. Awakening Japan: the diary of a <br/>\nGerman doctor: Erwin Baelz, edited by his son, Toku Baelz; <br/>\ntranslated from the German by Eden and Cedar Paul. <br/>\n<br/>\n*I think people who study Meiji Era Japan would find this book worth <br/>\nits weight in gold because you will be exposed to alot of &quot;insider&quot; <br/>\ninformation not to mention Dr. Baelz&#39;s sincere attempts at <br/>\nincorporating jiujitsu+kenjutsu into a physical education program <br/>\n(summarized in this article here http://www.ao-denkou-<br/>\nkai.org/new_page_6.htm)<br/>\n<br/>\n*he was not an adventurer, mercenary or missionary, but a <br/>\nprofessional with alot of money and access to people in power...but <br/>\nat the same time curious and humble in his observations of Meiji Era <br/>\nJapan<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Fukuzawa and Yamakawa Kenjiroo see [post <br/>\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/2023]<br/>\nwere not the only ones who were fascinated with the mysteries of the <br/>\nhuman mind<br/>\n(written by someone who *OBSERVED* Dr. Baelz treating a <br/>\npatient...deals with fox possession and religious ecsctasy...and the <br/>\ncommentary at the end is a bit odd since Dr. Baelz&#39;s treatments are <br/>\nbased on science)<br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelzfox1.jpg<br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelzfox2.jpg<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n(self-control)<br/>\nPage 122<br/>\n*Hana, Dr. Baelz&#39;s wife, lost her 12 year old adopted daughter<br/>\n*Dr. Baelz frequently compares the Japanese to Roman stoicism<br/>\n&quot;Sometimes Hana&#39;s self-control makes me uneasy.  Those who do not <br/>\nknow the depths of her feelings and the tenderness of her heart <br/>\nmight regard her as callous.  They would make a great mistake!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPage 118<br/>\n*I certainly HOPE that a certain member of the TMPD called upon to <br/>\nprovide security of the Queen Mother, on more than one occasion <br/>\nwould not- be subject to this form of treatment (^_^)<br/>\n&quot;An evening or two ago I was invited to a Japanese supper at the <br/>\npalace of the Emperor&#39;s mother.  The court ladies pressed &quot;sake&quot; on <br/>\nme, intending to amuse themselves by making me rather drunk.  I was <br/>\nequal to the occasion, however, having a fairly strong head.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n*Dr. Baelz also treated, and saved the life of Emperor Meiji&#39;s real <br/>\nbirth mother, Nii no tsubone.<br/>\n<br/>\n(plain clothes policeman)<br/>\nPage 83<br/>\nMori Arinori was the Minister of education I thinkMori made very <br/>\nmany important contributions during the era but many western <br/>\nscholars will mention that Mori wanted English to be the official <br/>\nlanguage of Japan (it is sad that a person&#39;s most radical belief <br/>\nends up defining him historically)  <br/>\n&quot;As soon as Mori entered the room, Nishino sprang on him and stabbed <br/>\nhim in the belly with a great kitchen-knife.  A plain clothes <br/>\npoliceman (the minister&#39;s constant attendant), armed with a Japanese <br/>\ntwo-handed sword disguised as a swordstick, drew his weapon and <br/>\ninstantly clove Nishino&#39;s skull.  For some obscure reason it was <br/>\nthree hours before professional help could be secured for Mori, who <br/>\nby that time was unconscious from loss of blood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n*I have read 2 accounts of Mori Arinori murder and this is the <br/>\n*first time that I have heard of Mori&#39;s bodyguard.interesting how <br/>\nmuch time passed before he was given medical aid<br/>\n<br/>\nTreated Okuma, the minister of foreign affairs after assassination <br/>\nattempt<br/>\nDr. Baelz was also the trusted physician of Yamagata Aritomo and <br/>\nNUMEROUS other important figures (e.g. Viscount Enomoto, crown <br/>\nprince = emperor Taisho) and often called upon to treat important <br/>\nforeign dignitaries.essentially this German doctor knew many people <br/>\non a professional and personal basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n*a Matsudaira plays polo<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nPICS (there is a pic of his daughter Uta who died young...it was <br/>\nextremely depressing to read his diary entries during that period)<br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelztitle.jpg<br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelz1.jpg<br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelz2.jpg<br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelzfamily.jpg<br/>\n*Dr. Baelz frequently mentions his BELOVED wife after the birth of <br/>\ntheir son...I believe that entries regarding the courtship of Hana <br/>\nwere omitted by the folks who published the book because Dr. Baelz <br/>\nhad the tendency to write down just about -everything- in his <br/>\npersonal diary....he took a great interest in the status of <br/>\nwoman...and he was very much a down to earth normal young man<br/>\n<br/>\n*secretarytocapt3*</div>",
