When I typed in &quot;Choshu&quot; I got <br/>\npictures of big guys that looked like wrestlers.  But when I typed <br/>\nin &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; I got pages and pages of our favorite swordsmen <br/>\ngroup....It looks like that even though the Ishin Shishi won the war, <br/>\nit&#39;s the Shinsengumi that would be remembered, despite the belief <br/>\nthat &quot;the victors write the history&quot;. Talk about ironic...The <br/>\nShinsengumi at least won the media war.<br/>\n--A-chan</div>",
