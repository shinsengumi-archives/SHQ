Okita, who is usually described as a<br/>\n&gt; bish, is a tall and <br/>\n&gt; &quot;flatfish like&quot; face guy in this manga, and that<br/>\n&gt; would be more real. <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, the artist said she has changed deliberately<br/>\n&gt; the design of Hijikata, <br/>\n&gt; that meant she didn&#39;t care the famous photo or<br/>\n&gt; historical look of him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other main characters you know well having<br/>\n&gt; rather modern hairstyle and no <br/>\n&gt; one has shaved hair or topknot.<br/>\n&gt; However, after being shocked by those character<br/>\n&gt; designs, I can notice that <br/>\n&gt; this manga is not so eccentric as Shinsengumi manga.<br/>\n&gt; I can say this one is rather &quot;classic&quot; of the genre,<br/>\n&gt; I mean more &quot;historical <br/>\n&gt; &quot;or serious than what we can imagine from the first<br/>\n&gt; impression.<br/>\n&gt; There are many well known episodes and details like<br/>\n&gt; the fire at Honjo juku on <br/>\n&gt; the way to Kyoto, Serizawa and Oume etc.<br/>\n&gt; Currently, the Roushitai has arrived at Kyoto and<br/>\n&gt; Shieikan people and <br/>\n&gt; Serizawa group decided to stay despite Kiyokawa&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; plot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That is by no means yaoi type manga ( I think) ,<br/>\n&gt; however seeing Serizawa <br/>\n&gt; drunken asking Hijikata to sit on his lap, or that<br/>\n&gt; same Serizawa commenting on <br/>\n&gt; Hijikata who has killed a man for the first time,<br/>\n&gt; that he (Hijikata) looked like <br/>\n&gt; a young girl who had just lost her virginity, made<br/>\n&gt; me laugh a lot.<br/>\n&gt; The story become strangely fascinating after all and<br/>\n&gt; now, after recent <br/>\n&gt; disappointment with PMK which has been unfortunately<br/>\n&gt; stopped, I have another <br/>\n&gt; interesting Shinsengumi manga to be continued. <br/>\n&gt; And I&#39;m looking forward to see appearance of some<br/>\n&gt; characters from now on.

This post contains some spoilers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ve told already about this manga, but I&#39;m not sure if I posted here <br/>\nor not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m talking about the manga of Misaki Saitou about Shinsengumi &quot;Hinata no <br/>\nOokami&quot;(Wolves in the sunshine) that I&#39;ve just read the 2nd volume recently come <br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put the links to amazon.jp for volumes published for those who might have <br/>\ninterest.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4344804538/ref=pd_bxgy_text_2/249-972\">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4344804538/ref=pd_bxgy_text_2/249-972</a><br/>\n5298-2705928<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/434480533X/qid=1112364620/sr=1-1/ref=\">http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/434480533X/qid=1112364620/sr=1-1/ref=</a><br/>\nsr_1_10_1/249-9725298-2705928<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is the link for the artist&#39;s site.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkclub.or.jp/~misaki-2/shinsengumi/hinata.html\">http://www.linkclub.or.jp/~misaki-2/shinsengumi/hinata.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI guess many of you can&#39;t accept the character design, especially for <br/>\nstrangely effeminate look Hijikata.<br/>\nYes, the guy with long straight hair on the cover isn&#39;t other than him. <br/>\nMyself, when I saw the image for the first time, I thought the guy would be Okita.<br/>\nBut he isn&#39;t. Okita, who is usually described as a bish, is a tall and <br/>\n&quot;flatfish like&quot; face guy in this manga, and that would be more real. <br/>\nAnyway, the artist said she has changed deliberately the design of Hijikata, <br/>\nthat meant she didn&#39;t care the famous photo or historical look of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other main characters you know well having rather modern hairstyle and no <br/>\none has shaved hair or topknot.<br/>\nHowever, after being shocked by those character designs, I can notice that <br/>\nthis manga is not so eccentric as Shinsengumi manga.<br/>\nI can say this one is rather &quot;classic&quot; of the genre, I mean more &quot;historical <br/>\n&quot;or serious than what we can imagine from the first impression.<br/>\nThere are many well known episodes and details like the fire at Honjo juku on <br/>\nthe way to Kyoto, Serizawa and Oume etc.<br/>\nCurrently, the Roushitai has arrived at Kyoto and Shieikan people and <br/>\nSerizawa group decided to stay despite Kiyokawa&#39;s plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is by no means yaoi type manga ( I think) , however seeing Serizawa <br/>\ndrunken asking Hijikata to sit on his lap, or that same Serizawa commenting on <br/>\nHijikata who has killed a man for the first time, that he (Hijikata) looked like <br/>\na young girl who had just lost her virginity, made me laugh a lot.<br/>\nThe story become strangely fascinating after all and now, after recent <br/>\ndisappointment with PMK which has been unfortunately stopped, I have another <br/>\ninteresting Shinsengumi manga to be continued. <br/>\nAnd I&#39;m looking forward to see appearance of some characters from now on. ( <br/>\nSome of you could guess who)<br/>\n<br/>\nTama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
