That&#39;s it-- no names of the sons and daughters, no <br/>\nnames of their children just the generic 7 sons and 8 daughters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I _need_ to know the names of those 7 sons and 8 daughters and <br/>\ntheir wives/husbands and children, dammit!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay I&#39;ve settled down now. *grin*  If any of you fine people out there <br/>\nin Shinsengumi fan land have come across a real chart type family tree  <br/>\nfor the Imperial family in the 19th century can you let me know?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone should happen to want to know similar information on the <br/>\nBritish royal family for the Sherlock Holmes Meets Saitou fanfic <br/>\nchallenge I&#39;ll be happy to help. I have a big detailed family tree for  <br/>\nthe British royal family. Those historians know how to make a writer happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n----Barbara Sheridan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barbarasheridan.net\">http://www.barbarasheridan.net</a></div>",
