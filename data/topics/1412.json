I have <br/>\nseen fist of Legend though and I think that was one of the first <br/>\nmovies that turned me to a Jet Li fan a year ago... On another note <br/>\nif you are going to watch more Chinese films try out Fong-Sai-Yuk and <br/>\nFong-Sai-Yuk II... I believe his mother in that movie is the love <br/>\ninterest of Yun Fat.. I think her name was Michelle Yeo or was it <br/>\nZiyi Zhang? Sorry I get them mixed up, it&#39;s been a while...</div>",
