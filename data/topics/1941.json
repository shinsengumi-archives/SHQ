            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-457271324\">Many years back there was discussion on the internet about how the film <br/>\npossibly contained a cameo of Rurouni Kenshin in the animated feature <br/>\nMillenium Actress.  Essentially someone saw a red headress in the Boshin <br/>\nWar painting (it&#39;s an exact copy of a famous ukiyo-e) and they thought it <br/>\nwas the manga/anime character.  It&#39;s an honest mistake (^_^) still <br/>\nperhaps floating on a fan messageboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still encourage people who have exhausted the live-action Shinsengumi <br/>\nfilms to rent this film---now available widely in vid stores across the USA.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPosted on (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/1941)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/1941)</a><br/>\nDecember 2004 by secretarytocapt3<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ***MILLENIUM ACTRESS*** (contains Shinsengumi cameo AND the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>2nd disk of the dvd<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; shows a Shinsengumi cosplayer they used as a model AND starring RK <br/>\n&gt; Saitou&#39;s voice actor Hiroaki Suzuoki AND animates Boshin War art).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***MILLENIUM ACTRESS*** basically takes you on a tour of Japanese <br/>\n&gt; history via film...and plenty of inside jokes for people who love <br/>\n&gt; chambara....film made me cry...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Recently I had to thank someone for finding me a rare work of music so I <br/>\nhad to extract the entire OST of M.A. as a trade---and I wanted to share it <br/>\nhere as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic info:<br/>\nImdb: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291350/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291350/</a><br/>\nTrailer: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpGrD5wUzKE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpGrD5wUzKE</a><br/>\nMuch better trailer from Japan: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?</a><br/>\nv=0uRjP_LqJcY<br/>\n<br/>\nMillenium Actress is a film .. about films, namely the golden era of <br/>\nJapanese cinema paralleled with the history of Japan from ancient to <br/>\nmodern times (including wars).  The art and writing of this work is top <br/>\nnotch.  If you watch the film and keep in mind that Chiyoko the main <br/>\ncharacter -is- Japan you get a very good interpretation because her <br/>\nmaturity during various periods in history is very fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost all tracks are instrumental with a bit of vocals.  However the last <br/>\nsong is entirely in Japanese and you can preview it here:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E5PmsPwf0E\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E5PmsPwf0E</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthe rest of the OST has a very interesting spiritual, adventure and <br/>\ntechnology mix to it (because the tracks are based on the movies the main <br/>\ncharacter, an actress, performs in).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.megaupload.com/?d=AW79BRS4\">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=AW79BRS4</a><br/>\n(buy) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5u4y5j\">http://tinyurl.com/5u4y5j</a>  (don&#39;t buy the fake CDs on Ebay get it <br/>\nfrom Japan---the CD comes with a music vid)<br/>\n<br/>\ndo not attempt to download this OST from torrent/anime sites as their <br/>\ntracks are incomplete or damaged</div>",
