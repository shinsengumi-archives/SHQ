            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1260551051\">Kijima Matabei- Commander of the Choshu Army at the Kinmon Incident<br/>\n<br/>\nThe manga &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot; just featured the incident in its newest volume, <br/>\nand Kijima is there. If this manga is as accurate as it seems to be, then <br/>\nKondou saw Kijima go down in battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, here&#39;s a bio. Any mistakes I make in translation are my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nBorn Bunka 14, January 8 (February 23, 1817), in Nagato Province, Asa <br/>\nDistrict, Nishitakadomari Village. 2nd son of Kitamura Masatsune. His <br/>\nofficial name was Masahisa, common names were Kamenoshin, Kojiro, and <br/>\nMatabei. Also known as Mori Kitaro. Pen names: Renki, Souzan, Muan Donin, <br/>\nHido.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough born into the family of the unsalaried courier Kitamura, in Tenpo 7 <br/>\n(1836), he was adopted by Kijima Matabei Masatsune (59 koku 8 sho stipend) <br/>\nof Ozu District, Tawarayama Village.<br/>\n<br/>\nTenpo 8 (1837), the family moved to Mine District, Akayasu Village. Tenpo 12 <br/>\n(1841), Matabei studied kenjutsu under Oishi Susumu of the Yanagawa domain, <br/>\nand became an expert in the martial arts. In August of Koka 3 (1846), he <br/>\nwent to Edo and studied in the dojo of Kubota Sukeshiro. Returned to Choshu <br/>\nin Kaei 1 (1848), and succeeded to the Kijima headship in January of Kaei 4 <br/>\n(1851). In November of the same year, he was appointed to the Temawarigumi <br/>\n(presumably the daimyo&#39;s personal entourage), and was made the kago-bugyo <br/>\n(palanquin overseer) for the daimyo&#39;s heir.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn March of Kaei 6, complying with the lord&#39;s orders, he went to Edo, and <br/>\nwas there when Perry&#39;s ships arrived. In December of the same year, he <br/>\nsubmitted a memorial on national defense to the daimyo. Returned to Choshu <br/>\nin May of Ansei 1, and held several successive jobs there- Official <br/>\nExaminer, Household Affairs Manager, and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOctober of Bunkyu 2, he was assigned to Edo, and in March of Bunkyu 3 <br/>\n(1863)-- not long after the Shinsengumi-- he went to Kyoto, and in May he <br/>\nreturned to Choshu again, serving as assistant to the Overseer of Stables. <br/>\nIn June he AGAIN returned to Kyoto, at the head of a rifle brigade made up <br/>\nof hunters. In July he was involved in political affairs, and in September, <br/>\nreturned home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore this, Takasugi Shinsaku had organized the Kiheitai, and not long <br/>\nafterward, on August 18, there was the incident that drove Choshu from <br/>\nKyoto. Kijima worked together and formed the Yuugekigun in November.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Now it gets interesting)<br/>\nGenji 1 (1864)- March- Resigns as commander of the Yuugekigun, becomes <br/>\nassistant to the new commander, Kokuji Shinano. *Infiltrates* Kyoto in April <br/>\nof 1864, returning in May, and taking a strong line in advocating war <br/>\n(against Aizu/Shinsengumi).<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember folks-- Choshu knew PRETTY QUICK about Ikedaya...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn June he changed his name, and left for Osaka, leading the Yuugekitai and <br/>\nRikishitai (Sumo wrestler brigade) in battle at the Kinmon Incident in July. <br/>\nWhile leading the forces from Saga-Tenryuji Temple to Hamagurigomon (outer <br/>\ngate at the Imperial Palace), he was shot at by Aizu forces, and his nephew <br/>\nKitamura Takeshichi acted as his kaishaku (beheading at seppuku). Age at <br/>\ndeath was 49.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourt rank-- Senior 4th rank. Buried at Higashiyama-Reizan in Kyoto, as well <br/>\nas in Hikari City (in the former Choshu) at Iwabiyama Shrine, as well as in <br/>\nhis former home of Mine (pronounced &quot;Mee-neh&quot;) City, West Akayasu.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Source: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ddb.libnet.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/exhibit/ishin/jinmei/Kijima.html)\">http://ddb.libnet.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/exhibit/ishin/jinmei/Kijima.html)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",

The beginning of their <br/>\nassociation, as best as I can tell, is when Nagai arranged for a meeting <br/>\nbetween Kondou Isami and Goto Shojiro of Tosa, in September of Keio 3 <br/>\n(1867).<br/>\n<br/>\nToward the end of their time in Kyoto, Shinsengumi (as Conrad Totman&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;) will attest, were on duty at Nijo Castle. <br/>\nHowever, through some reason that I don&#39;t entirely understand, they had <br/>\nantagonized the Mito domain (Serizawa Kamo&#39;s hometown), and this could have <br/>\nled to serious problems. It be remembered, I hope, that Ito Kashitaro&#39;s <br/>\nfaction was made up of men connected to Mito-- including Ito and Suzuki <br/>\nMikisaburo themselves, who were from another domain in Hitachi Province.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho came to the rescue?<br/>\n<br/>\nNagai Naoyuki.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe reassigned Shinsengumi to Fushimi-- which means he was the one who had <br/>\nthem finally leave Kyoto-- and thus spared them from further antagonizing <br/>\nMito, which was not only a major Tokugawa collateral domain, but also the <br/>\nbirth clan of the shogun, Yoshinobu.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo-- Shinsengumi is reassigned to Fushimi, but Kondo still makes trips to <br/>\nNijo Castle for business. On returning from one of those trips, he was shot <br/>\nat by Abe Juurou and some of the other survivors of the Ito faction, and <br/>\nbarely made it back to Fushimi in one piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was at this point that-- it&#39;s said-- the Shogun Yoshinobu himself came in <br/>\nperson to see the injured Kondou, and gave the Shinsengumi commander the <br/>\nservices of his personal physician, Matsumoto Ryojun. Kondou was apparently <br/>\nso happy that he cried.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER.....there is a rumor that it was not Yoshinobu, but Nagai Naoyuki, <br/>\ndisguised as Yoshinobu, who came to Kondou&#39;s bedside and brought Matsumoto <br/>\nRyojun with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I think that the latter possibility is more likely, especially <br/>\ngiven that the Shogun never really seemed to have met anyone face to <br/>\nface...and that Kondou was in Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s charge, not Yoshinobu&#39;s <br/>\n(even though Shinsengumi HAD become hatamoto-- retainers of the Shogun-- in <br/>\nlate 1867).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it was indeed Nagai Naoyuki, then I am deeply impressed and greatly moved <br/>\nby his double act of compassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, Nagai went north with Enomoto&#39;s fleet, and he and Nakajima Saburosuke <br/>\n(former Uraga Magistrate, and also said to be the first Japanese official <br/>\nwho rowed out to Perry&#39;s black ships) were chosen as Hakodate Magistrates by <br/>\nthe new Ezo Republic under Enomoto Takeaki, Matsudaira Taro, Ootori Keisuke, <br/>\nand....Hijikata Toshizo.<br/>\n<br/>\n(sources: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mirai.ne.jp/~jkj8/bakusin.html,\">http://www.mirai.ne.jp/~jkj8/bakusin.html,</a> <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bakusin.jp/eiketu/nagai.html)\">http://bakusin.jp/eiketu/nagai.html)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",

Tokugawa Yoshimune, the <br/>\ndaimyo of Kii, became the 8th shogun, inaugurating what became the Kyoho <br/>\nera, and when he came from Kii to Edo, he brought with him a group of 16 men <br/>\nwho were his private agents/bodyguards/investigators. In time, these 16 men <br/>\nbecame what&#39;s known as the Oniwabanshu, and passed on the tradition within <br/>\nthe same 16 families. This tradition continued all the way through the Edo <br/>\nperiod, all the way even into the Bakumatsu. These men were just one of many <br/>\ngroups of investigators in the service of the Shogunate, and took their <br/>\norders from the roju (Senior Councilors), wakadoshiyori (Junior Councilors), <br/>\nand metsuke (inspectors). Their duties, depending on their specific <br/>\nspecialty or classification, ranged from security inside Edo Castle (or, <br/>\npresumably, wherever the Shogun was, like Nijo Castle) to <br/>\npatrol/surveillance in Edo. In the Meiji Era, when a concerted effort was <br/>\ncarried out to interview former Shogunate officials, one of those <br/>\ninterviewed was a former Oniwabanshu member-- and his record appears in the <br/>\ncompilation of those interviews, known as &quot;Kyuji Shimonroku&quot;-- loosely, &quot;The <br/>\nRecord of Bygone Days&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n(info from Anna Beerens&#39; translation of &quot;Interview with a Bakumatsu <br/>\nOfficial&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there was interaction between Kondou Isami and <br/>\nthe Oniwabanshu during the Shinsengumi&#39;s duty at Nijo Castle, or their work <br/>\nin the Edo area.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",
