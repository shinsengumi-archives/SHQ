Father&#39;s name was Gensuke and mother&#39;s name was Taki. Taki was <br/>\nthe daughter of 11th generation of Shinohara familly.<br/>\nShinohara go to Edo at the age of 31 and met Ito through his friend Kano.<br/>\nIn Shinsengumi, he was &quot;Shoshi shirabe yaku ken Kansatsu&quot; (same function <br/>\nas Yamazaki which consists of &quot;Shoshi shirabeyaku&quot; intelligence agency <br/>\nfor the outside and &quot;Kansatsu&quot; inspection of activities of the members, <br/>\nso investigation of inside.)<br/>\nAnd he was also a Jujutsu teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe married twice. The first wife was called Hagino and probably he might <br/>\n  marry before 1863 as their son has 5 years in 1867.<br/>\nShinohara called Hagino and son to Kyoto later when he joined to <br/>\nShinsengumi.<br/>\n<br/>\n( I didn&#39;t mention here about Ito and Goryo eji as some facts are <br/>\nalready known)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Aburano Koji affair(18 nov), Shinohara escaped and hide in the <br/>\nhouse of a person related to an Imperial prince called Gyoubu Ozaki. <br/>\nShinsengumi come to search him in the morning or 19 but they couldn&#39;t <br/>\narrest Shinohara as they didn&#39;t dare force someone related to Imperial <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\nSo Shinohara could move to Satsuma clan&#39;s mansion and joined to  Miki there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHagino felt an uneasiness in the early morning of 19, and she came out <br/>\nto the outside still dark though, then a servant came to see her and <br/>\nsaid simply, &quot;There was a trouble!&quot;, and run away soon.<br/>\nShe headed to Gesshin in, Goryo eji&#39;s quarter but nobody was there.<br/>\nThen she went to the house of someone she knew in Miyagawa town( that&#39;s <br/>\nsupposed to be Ito&#39;s mistress&#39;s house) . While she was in that <br/>\nhouse,Shinsengumi came to search her and she heard they saying to the <br/>\nmaster that they had seen Shinohara&#39;s wife entered that house and asking<br/>\nto hand her over to them.<br/>\nMeanwhile, Hagino escaped from the back door and went to Ozaki&#39;s house <br/>\nalong the river bank. As Ozaki told her whereabouts of her husband, she <br/>\nwent to Satsuma mansion and could see him again in the noon of 20. She <br/>\nwas also joined by Ito&#39;s mistress and Tadao Arai&#39;s wife there.<br/>\nLater Shinohara and his wife were sheltered in the Satsuma mansion in <br/>\nFushimi and Hagino.<br/>\nAfter Shinohara attempted to shoot Kondo with the others, Hagino had to <br/>\nchange move different places to hide.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think writing something more short at the beginning but that become <br/>\nhorribly long so, to be continued...( when I have time)<br/>\n<br/>\n(This is the resume from Shinohara&#39;s bio from &quot;100 anecdotes of <br/>\nShinsengumi&quot;, and &quot;Rekishi dokuhon &quot; Shinsengumi and women&quot; special issue.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsecretary wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Pic<br/>\n &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/shinohara.jpg\">http://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/shinohara.jpg</a><br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Book ISBN 4056032831<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Can someone please refresh my memory as to Shinohara&#39;s position in<br/>\n &gt; the Shinsengumi (did skim Serizawa Kamo&#39;s bio)...and the Sekihoutai<br/>\n &gt; connection???<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Thanx<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Yahoo!
