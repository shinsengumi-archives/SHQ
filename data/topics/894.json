Also, I added an English translated excerpt<br/>\nfrom Daibosatsu Toge. The English isn&#39;t very good and<br/>\nsome translated terms could have probably used better<br/>\nwords, but it is the only thing in English from that<br/>\nstory. This particular part is the attempt on Hachiro<br/>\nKiyokawa&#39;s life...of course...if you have seen &quot;Sword<br/>\nof Doom&quot; you know what happens. I was trying to<br/>\nconserve space here so you may want to zoom in<br/>\nsomewhere between 75% to 100% depending on how much<br/>\nyour eyes can take. If someone wants me to I can try<br/>\nto do the excerpt over again later.<br/>\n<br/>\n I counted the bodies at the end of Sword of Doom<br/>\nyears ago and it is somewhere in the late 40&#39;s range I<br/>\nthink. Believe it or not there is a movie called<br/>\n&quot;Orochi&quot; with Raizo Ichikawa that rivals this endings<br/>\nbodycount too and probably more. The Lone Wolf and Cub<br/>\nmovies had high bodycounts near the end of most of<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n The thing about Sword of Doom is if it had continued<br/>\nin the sequels you would have seen him get up the next<br/>\nday after he passed out, join the Tenchugumi, some bad<br/>\nstuff happens to him in that, and he continues to<br/>\nsuffer. His son plays an important role to any hope in<br/>\nhis &quot;salvation&quot; as the story goes along. The story was<br/>\noriginally written as a Buddhist parable about<br/>\nsuffering.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
