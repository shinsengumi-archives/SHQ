However, I&#39;d like to suggest that you add a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;References&quot; section to both articles, so that we know on Wikipedia as<br/>\n&gt; well, where your information is coming from.

Wikipedia is good in its own right, but as you know,<br/>\n&gt; articles are open to being edited or deleted at anytime.

Even if you do not<br/>\n&gt; plan to publish, when you attend school your teachers will also force<br/>\n&gt; you to adopt a citation format as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The current most widely used format in the United States and now at<br/>\n&gt; the international level is MLA (or something very similar to it).

The book &quot;Swordsmith<br/>\n&gt; Nagasone Kotetsu Okisato,&quot; an English text written by Yasu Kizu,<br/>\n&gt; confirms what you pointed out: Kondou&#39;s sword was not a true Kotetsu,<br/>\n&gt; but instead was a sword made by Minamoto Kiyomaro, the foremost<br/>\n&gt; swordmaker of the shinshinto period, and roughly contemporary to<br/>\n&gt; Kondou Isami. Apparently faked Kotetsu swords were common even during<br/>\n&gt; the life of Kotesu himself, and he is said to have remarked on seeing<br/>\n&gt; a fake &quot;The blade is mine but the signature is not.&quot; (from page 8 of<br/>\n&gt; the Yasu Kizu book).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Link on the Kotetsu from Kondou&#39;s page at the SHQ site...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/KondouIsami.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/KondouIsami.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And a new article: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasone_Kotetsu\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasone_Kotetsu</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Those who want to see a (real) Kiyomaro sword can visit this site:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://perso.orange.fr/nipponto/kiyomaro.html\">http://perso.orange.fr/nipponto/kiyomaro.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once again, I thank you, and hope to hear more from you soon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -M.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

The book &quot;Swordsmith<br/>\nNagasone Kotetsu Okisato,&quot; an English text written by Yasu Kizu,<br/>\nconfirms what you pointed out: Kondou&#39;s sword was not a true Kotetsu,<br/>\nbut instead was a sword made by Minamoto Kiyomaro, the foremost<br/>\nswordmaker of the shinshinto period, and roughly contemporary to<br/>\nKondou Isami. Apparently faked Kotetsu swords were common even during<br/>\nthe life of Kotesu himself, and he is said to have remarked on seeing<br/>\na fake &quot;The blade is mine but the signature is not.&quot; (from page 8 of<br/>\nthe Yasu Kizu book).<br/>\n<br/>\nLink on the Kotetsu from Kondou&#39;s page at the SHQ site...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/KondouIsami.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/KondouIsami.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a new article: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasone_Kotetsu\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasone_Kotetsu</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose who want to see a (real) Kiyomaro sword can visit this site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://perso.orange.fr/nipponto/kiyomaro.html\">http://perso.orange.fr/nipponto/kiyomaro.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, I thank you, and hope to hear more from you soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",
