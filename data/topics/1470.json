            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1034014959\">I had to view this 2 disk film in fast forward (but paused for the <br/>\nfight scenes)....<br/>\n<br/>\nLAST SAMURAI (by Samurai Entertainment) Takahashi Hideki<br/>\npurchased from an online merchant...can&#39;t recall address<br/>\n<br/>\nhmmm what can I say...<br/>\nthe film is about several characters whose paths cross several times <br/>\nbefore the Bakumatsu all the way to the Seinan War (in which the <br/>\nlast character dies)....it&#39;s not a spoiler folks the movie ain&#39;t <br/>\npretty but what struck me is that this must&#39;ve been very <br/>\ncontroversial because it offers many *interesting* opinions on the <br/>\nfounding of the new era.  I can imagine some viewers lifting their <br/>\neyebrows at certain points in the script....<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the story is about how a Satsuma Hitokiri became a respected <br/>\nmilitary man in the new government....his friend tries to save him <br/>\nfrom marching on Tokyo (Seinan War) by saying...&quot;Saigo is a big old <br/>\nfool!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Okita Soujiro (there is a FABULOUS indoor fight scene between <br/>\nOkita and the main character---easily the [BEST] I&#39;ve seen in <br/>\nJapanese cinema---and I&#39;ve seen plenty...the actors were splendid)<br/>\nAll of the moves were very clear to see and the choreography offers <br/>\nALOT of variety...truly worthy of depicting Okita S. one of the <br/>\nforemost swordsmen of his day...just this scene alone makes the film <br/>\nworthy buying ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi (the most INTERESTING interpretation on their uniform <br/>\nI&#39;ve ever seen) vs. Mimawarigumi tension<br/>\na bit of Toba Fushimi<br/>\na tiny bit of Hakodate and Takeaki Enomoto<br/>\n<br/>\n3) the main character = master swordsman decent guy who&#39;s outlook on <br/>\nlife changes alot...an important lesson learned from this <br/>\nfilm...don&#39;t go blabbing about what you did during the revolution <br/>\nespecially to seemingly harmless barbers....<br/>\n<br/>\n4) a couple of interesting female characters...<br/>\n<br/>\n***this film covers alot of ground ^_^ (and includes even little <br/>\nthings like the retainers crying their eyes out as the Shogun <br/>\ndeparts from Edo) but it was well written and filmed skillfully and <br/>\nthe director never lost sight of the fact that it is supposed to <br/>\nENTERTAIN as welll (humor here and there some romance too)....I <br/>\nhighly recommend it!!!! However, if you purchase it there is a <br/>\nchance that it may not play on your PC....so no screencaps of the ---<br/>\ndifferent--- Shinsengumi uniform (-_-)...it seems to depend on what <br/>\nversion of Powerdvd you own</div>",
