            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-540047501\">Just wanted to let you guys know that FALLING THROUGH GLASS is now on<br/>\nsale at Liquid Silver Books. The story features Japanese American<br/>\ncollege student Emmi Maeda who falls back to 1864 Kyoto and gets on the<br/>\nwrong side of Hijikata in her quest to find her way back home.  The<br/>\nscene below does&#39;t feature Hijikata-san but it does feature Yamanami and<br/>\neverybody&#39;s favorite miburo Saitou. Enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExcerpt:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Emmi said as the harsh truth sunk it. She<br/>\nwas a prisoner.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s only for tonight,&quot; Kaemon said. &quot;I&#39;ll come<br/>\nback for you tomorrow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEmmi sniffled and nodded. He almost seemed to care.&quot;What about my<br/>\nmirror?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yamanami-san will see that it&#39;s secure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe nodded again and lowered her gaze, determined not to cry in front of<br/>\nthis guy.<br/>\nShe looked up when he spoke again, his tone much softer than it had been<br/>\nall night.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yamanami-san, could you assign a guard to her for the night?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Of course.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Could you choose someone totally trustworthy? Someone who would<br/>\nnever think to<br/>\ntake advantage of the situation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami placed his hand on Kaemon&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;ve been<br/>\nhaving difficulty<br/>\nsleeping lately. Let me lock her mirror away, and then I&#39;ll go stay<br/>\nwith her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKaemon bowed deeply. &quot;I am in your debt, Yamanami-san.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the older man left, Kaemon looked at Emmi a long time, and she<br/>\ntried to<br/>\nfigure out what was going on behind those piercing, dark eyes of his.<br/>\nFor the first time,<br/>\nshe took a long look at her &quot;rescuer.&quot; He was young; she doubted<br/>\nhe was much older than<br/>\nshe was.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, he was awfully good looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami returned from his room, and Kaemon left without saying another<br/>\nword or<br/>\neven looking back.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I won&#39;t lie to you, Maeda-dono,&quot; Yamanami said as they<br/>\nwalked towards a small Lshaped<br/>\nbuilding at the far end of the compound. &quot;The men we have detained<br/>\nare typical<br/>\ndogs, and even though we rearranged them to place empty cells adjacent<br/>\nto yours, they&#39;ll<br/>\nstill be able to glimpse you coming in, so don&#39;t be surprised if<br/>\nthey say things you might<br/>\nnot be used to hearing said to a lady.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnnerved at the thought of being stuck in an actual jail with violent<br/>\ncriminals, Emmi<br/>\nstumbled.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami placed a steadying hand on her arm. &quot;It will be all right.<br/>\nI&#39;ll see to it that<br/>\nyou&#39;re not alone in there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs predicted, the prisoners began calling out when she stepped inside<br/>\nthe jail. Emmi<br/>\nwas glad they spoke so quickly; she couldn&#39;t process it all, but even<br/>\nthe gist of their<br/>\nwords made her want to throw up.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Silence!&quot; Yamanami yelled in a voice infinitely more commanding<br/>\nthan his<br/>\nmeasured speaking tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmmi kept her eyes focused on her feet. She followed the vice-commander<br/>\nto the<br/>\nmiddle of the three small cells that formed the shorter portion of the<br/>\nL. Blankets had been<br/>\nhung on the sides as makeshift walls. Yamanami picked up the clean<br/>\nchamber pot from<br/>\nthe floor outside and placed it in the right corner behind a small<br/>\nbamboo screen.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It isn&#39;t the privacy you&#39;re used to, but I think you&#39;ll<br/>\nbe comfortable enough.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thank you,&quot; Emmi said stepping inside. Though she wanted to<br/>\nscream when<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami shut the door and placed a large iron lock through the wooden<br/>\nbars, she kept<br/>\nsilent.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m going to check on that food tray, and then I&#39;ll be<br/>\nback.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All right.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he left, Emmi unrolled the thin futon mat and curled up in the<br/>\ncenter. She<br/>\nprayed that this was all a nightmare, that she&#39;d wake up and find it<br/>\nhad all been a bad<br/>\ndream. That wish fell apart quickly once the male prisoners began<br/>\ncalling out to her a few<br/>\nminutes later.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They bring you to entertain us?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You smell sweet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I get the first taste.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEmmi covered her ears and hoped Yamanami would return soon. When the<br/>\nouter<br/>\ndoor to the jail slid open, she crawled to the front bars and looked<br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe could make out Yamanami in the dim lantern light. He was carrying a<br/>\ndinner<br/>\ntray. Behind him was another man who veered off towards the<br/>\nprisoners&#39; cells.<br/>\nEmmi gasped when she heard scuffling and what could only be the sound of<br/>\nmen<br/>\nbeing beaten. A man&#39;s voice issued threats and orders of silence.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Pay it no mind, child,&quot; Yamanami said, as he set the tray down<br/>\nthen unlocked the<br/>\ndoor.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They savaged and murdered a woman who was gathering information for<br/>\nthe<br/>\nShogunate. They don&#39;t deserve your mercy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe slipped the open lock through one of the door crossbars, then picked<br/>\nup the tray,<br/>\nand set it on the floor beside the futon. Emmi&#39;s empty stomach<br/>\nrumbled at the smell of<br/>\nthe soup, steaming tea, and flat bread. She noticed that there was<br/>\nenough for two.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I thought I&#39;d sit here with you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami smiled a rather sad smile. &quot;It&#39;s quite safe, I promise<br/>\nyou.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yamanami-san,&quot; a man said.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmmi looked up at the man who had accompanied the vice-commander inside.<br/>\nHe<br/>\nwas dressed in a dark kimono, his black hair pulled back into a high<br/>\nponytail.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Forgive the interruption. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have any<br/>\nfurther trouble tonight from<br/>\nthat scum.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami sighed, and Emmi had the distinct impression that he didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave much of<br/>\na stomach for this part of the job.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thank you, Saitou-san.&quot; He turned back to me. &quot;Maeda-dono,<br/>\nthis is Saitou Hajime,<br/>\nCaptain of the third unit.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEmmi managed to stop herself from saying &quot;I know.&quot; Saitou had<br/>\nbeen portrayed<br/>\nquite often in anime and manga. The drawn versions didn&#39;t come close<br/>\nto grabbing the<br/>\nintensity of the real man.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou bowed to her then addressed his commander once more. &quot;I will<br/>\nbe making<br/>\nrounds through the compound tonight if you need anything.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fierce samurai headed to the door, pausing long enough to order the<br/>\nprisoners to<br/>\ncease their groaning and sniveling else he&#39;d &quot;make them<br/>\nstop&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think he&#39;s more frightening than Hijikata.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You might be right.&quot; Yamanami removed the cover from the food<br/>\ndishes. &quot;We&#39;d<br/>\nbetter eat this before it gets cold.&quot;<br/>\n* * * * *<br/>\n<br/>\nFalling Through Glass on sale now at Liquid Silver Books :<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ydktugj\">http://tinyurl.com/ydktugj</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~ Barbara Sheridan<br/>\nBarbaraSheridan.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barbarasheridan.com/\">http://www.barbarasheridan.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFalling Through Glass the video trailer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/nnve7t\">http://tinyurl.com/nnve7t</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
