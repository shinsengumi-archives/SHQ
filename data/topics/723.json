            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-491774471\">The first time I saw the painting of S.H. at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.miburo.com/info/truesait.jpg\">http://www.miburo.com/info/truesait.jpg</a> by Nakajima Nobori (N.N.) a<br/>\ncouple of years ago I thought...I&#39;ve seen that posture before...the<br/>\nwhole stepping on some poor guy&#39;s back...now I think I&#39;m making some<br/>\nconnections and I have gathered some proof.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of you have seen the painting of Hijikata staring into the<br/>\ndistance wearing a traditional outfit with a tiger design and holding<br/>\na signalling flag.  Obviously, the tiger design was not draw merely<br/>\nfor the sake of aesthetics...but also symbolism...Hijikata&#39;s ferocity<br/>\nas a warrior. To see the pic go here <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tamahito.com/\">http://www.tamahito.com/</a><br/>\n(Hijikata is on the right and Kondo is on the left). So my point<br/>\nis...he uses symbolism in his work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, many gods in both the Chinese and Japanese Buddhist<br/>\npantheon are derived from the Hindu pantheon (they just go through a<br/>\nname change just like Greek&gt;&gt;&gt;Roman gods/goddesses). <br/>\nSo just recall S.H. portrait by N.N. and look at these sculptures of<br/>\nBishamonten<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/students/nrclark/\">http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/students/nrclark/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/bishamonten.shtml\">http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/bishamonten.shtml</a><br/>\nsame or similar postures can also be found in depictions of Siva or<br/>\nother major Hindu goddesses with just one foot on the<br/>\ndwarf/yaksha(usually giants but made small next to a god/goddess) of<br/>\nignorance/fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that N.N. is an artist and he painted all these portraits<br/>\n-and- wrote his memoirs while he was a prisoner of war...so he had<br/>\nplenty of time to think...this was also probably part of his own<br/>\npersonal healing process and a way to salute people he had fought with<br/>\n(he took to the field on numerous occasions during major battles<br/>\nduring the opening of the Boshin war and at Aizu, and he went w/<br/>\nHijikata to Hakodate). So N.N. like all artists are a bit romantic<br/>\n(the guy did own a firearms store AND cultivated orchids too<br/>\ngeez)...note how his portrayal of the mysterious 17 year old heroine<br/>\nof Aizu is shown in battle with a beautiful kimono etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japanese webpage which displayed his work was sadly deactivated<br/>\ndue to inactivity <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Palace/8636/bekkan.html\">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Palace/8636/bekkan.html</a><br/>\nTo me, his work is very valuable...each person has unique features,<br/>\nsome faces capture, fear, anger, pain...one had a man with his hands<br/>\nover a leg wound but he looked eager to return to the battle...one was<br/>\nof a very young boy had blood streaming down his ankles.  The images<br/>\nare graphic but very honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an old thread at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumimb.com\">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> about N.N.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.showMessage?topicID=11.topic\">http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.showMessage?topicID=11.topic</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJust a side note...I know I&#39;m repeating myself from old posts but his<br/>\ninfo on the people he painted are innaccurate...take for instance the<br/>\nguys who stayed to fight at Buddha Hall didn&#39;t all DIE...a couple<br/>\nsurvived I think one guy lived to be 90! But I and perhaps a couple of<br/>\nyou too may wonder if he didn&#39;t make these mistakes on purpose<br/>\nsometimes just to cover for his buddies.  If he painted these while a<br/>\nprisoner I imagine a guard tapping him on the shoulder and asking <br/>\nprison guard:  &quot;who are those guys?&quot;<br/>\nN.N.: &quot;They are friends and sadly they have all perished&quot; (puts the<br/>\nback of wrist to forehead).<br/>\nprison guard: &quot;oh, okay carry on...&quot;<br/>\nN.N. proceeds to paint and paint 40 works<br/>\n<br/>\nEventhough N.N. seemed to have painted them for himself, who would buy<br/>\nportraits of the loser Shinsengumi? N.N. was the son of a merchant and<br/>\nI doubt N.N. was a career artist.  Atleast the prisoners around him<br/>\nmust&#39;ve seen his work because I&#39;ve seen photos of an exhibit (online<br/>\nand each portrait was around -I&#39;m guessing- 2.5&quot;).</div>",
