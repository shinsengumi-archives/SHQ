            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1844955298\">Hi<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to comment on what you said about death garb privately. I&#39;m a <br/>\nstudent of Japanese history in college, so I&#39;ve read authoritative sources <br/>\non the topic. Death garb is usually white because white is the Buddhist <br/>\ncolor of death. However, everyone thinks the Shinsengumi haori was blue <br/>\nbecause of the 47 Ronin&#39;s seppuku kimono. This is incorrect, as the blue <br/>\nseppuku kimono for the 47 ronin comes from kabuki plays, as does the black <br/>\nhaori with the white triangles. So Shinsengumi were inspired more by the <br/>\nkabuki 47 ronin than the real ones-- because as you said, dating back to the <br/>\nChinese origins of that custom, death colors are white, not blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as the 47 ronin are heroes, their history is as murky as that of the <br/>\nShinsengumi if not murkier. Another thing to consider about the 47 ronin is <br/>\nthe black uniform, brand-new armor, etc. that they&#39;re always portrayed with. <br/>\nIt makes no logical sense for 47 men with no income from a liquidated domain <br/>\nto be able to afford all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if you have  any additional questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Masayoshi</div>",
