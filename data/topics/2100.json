As I don&#39;t have a clue what the titles all refer to, there&#39;s no way of knowing what would be most promising.  I bow to M&#39;s knowledge of Japanese and Tama, who is currently reading a book on Sagara (Tama, is your book one of those on the list?)  Also, being in Japanese won&#39;t do me much good at this point.  HOWEVER, it&#39;s information to create a readily accessible bibliography for those who can read Japanese (or for when I hit the lottery... *smirk*)<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve transfered the unique titles to the main entry and on the GJ journal, posted a comment transfering the information on all the editions of the Hasegawa book that came up in your search.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;for Phil, just in case you missed this post<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm26.showMessage?topicID=7.topic\">http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm26.showMessage?topicID=7.topic</a> &lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n:-D  Yes I saw it... and I jotted the URL down *somewhere* at the time.  Kind of auspicious, maybe, that Sagara was born not too long (1839) after Oshio&#39;s &quot;save the people&quot; rebellion (1837)?  Thanks for finding the information and providing the quote. Paints an even more interesting picture.  Book information and link to the mb message have been added.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve also added linked banners to the main SHQ site and the mb on the Info Pages of the Sagara and Sekihoutai journals (both GJ & LJ).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;**when you do research try searching for the more well known friends <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of the person whom you are interested in&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOne of the main reasons I&#39;ve started reading about Tokugawa Nariaki.  :-D  MissB&#39;s reading of Ravina&#39;s Saigou biography has also provided info.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1681483386\">So I get started back on working on my Sagara site, realize I&#39;ve started projecting way too much of my own thoughts into it just in time to have to move from one house & get it ready to sell and into another with an unexpected houseguest, finally get back to thinking about the site... and discover I don&#39;t have a clue now where all of my STUFF is!  (And, Barb, I *still* haven&#39;t found my magnifying glass, so limited dictionary/thesaurus reading for me!)<br/>\n <br/>\nLiveJournal crashed big-time a week or so ago, and desperate to play, I decided to take a look at GreatestJournal (an LJ clone, but with a little more user friendliness and practically unlimited icon storage).  The bell eventually went off in my head --- why not start using journals to collect, organize and store this information where I can get to it quickly, find stuff with reasonable ease (hey... *anything* is better than scattered across notebooks, scraps of paper, computer files, highlighted in books, etc.), and save it to space other than just my hard drive (AND for free)?  And dang, it&#39;ll even give people another way to forward to me any information they find --- they can just leave a comment under the appropriate entry (anonymous posters not being my idea of fun, however, you would have to register with either GJ or LJ to comment --- it&#39;s free & easy & you don&#39;t even have to make use of the journal -- but the journals are set up to accept comments from any registered user).<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, in the interest of doing some service to Sagara Souzou and this website, I offer links to the raw data being compiled for use on the website and the invitation to anyone who comes upon sites, citations, references, honorable mentions, whatever, to just leave the info in a comment.  You can also just look it over, but it&#39;s really raw.  :-D   Because of the Great LJ Crash, the information is available in two places --- on GJ (the site I choose to work from) and mirrored on LJ.  What is currently up is what I could immediately access at my fingertips and off the top of my head, so the entries will be added to, revised, and refined over the coming days as I start going through my notebooks, folders of scraps, files and everywhere else I jotted stuff down in a hurry.  There is also some organization still to be done, mostly in the form of creating entries where I can compile groups of information (and make the LJ journals look pretty).<br/>\n <br/>\nOn Sagara Souzou, specifically (though there is some general Sekihoutai stuff there now):<br/>\nWorking site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sagara_sozo/\">http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sagara_sozo/</a><br/>\nMirror site:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/taichou_sagara/\">http://www.livejournal.com/users/taichou_sagara/</a><br/>\n <br/>\nOn the Sekihoutai in general and its members (including dear Miki):<br/>\nWorking site:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sekihoutai/\">http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sekihoutai/</a><br/>\nMirror site:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/sekihoutai/\">http://www.livejournal.com/users/sekihoutai/</a><br/>\nSetting up the journals and working on the Sagara info totally exhausted me yesterday and this morning, so there&#39;s nothing there yet.  Hopefully tonight.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve also started a secondary research project for personal amusement (and when I need a break from the depressing history of Sagara), related to Sagara and possibly of interest to others here -- Tokugawa Nariaki.  Some think he was crazy, but I find him visionary.  Anyway, I *know* there&#39;s lots of info out there on him, but I&#39;m only just starting out learning about him, so the obvious sources will be missing.  Any recommendations, though, are always welcome.  Just don&#39;t inundate me with websites... taking it a search page at a time.  LOL<br/>\n <br/>\nWorking site:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/rekko/\">http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/rekko/</a><br/>\nMirror site:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/rekko/\">http://www.livejournal.com/users/rekko/</a><br/>\n <br/>\nHoping all this may be useful to someone, someday...<br/>\nphil (still the obsessed & pretty much entirely focused on Sagara these days)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
