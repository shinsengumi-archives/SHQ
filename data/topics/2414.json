I&#39;ve looked through Amizon.com and wasn&#39;t able to find one either.... well, actually, I did find one, but it was marked something along the lines of &quot;ok condition&quot;, which lead me to believe that its probably not in that good of a condition.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo now I turn to the good people of this mail list ^___________^<br/>\nThe proposal is this: if your willing to let me borrow the book, I&#39;m willing to make a comission for you (however, I will not be able to start until early June on it).<br/>\n <br/>\nWell then, thanks for your time. ^_____________^<br/>\n <br/>\n                         -Gladys<br/>\n                                (a.k.a: Bunneh)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
