Remember Mibugishiden was a novel, TV <br/>\nSeries and then a major motion picture...it&#39;s a pity that no one has <br/>\ntranslated the novel into English---some fictional touches aside it <br/>\nwould be a good devue literary work on the Shinsengumi to enter the <br/>\nwest in our generation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe user also has a documentary (in Japanese) on the Bakumatsu with an <br/>\nemphasis on the Shinsengumi.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always what goes on youtube can be pulled anytime due to DMCA <br/>\nregulations on copyright material.</div>",
