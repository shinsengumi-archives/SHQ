The bookish/smarmy Yamanami has caught this <br/>\nbit <br/>\n&gt; of fine print and went to Sasaki with it and that&#39;s pretty much <br/>\nwhere it <br/>\n&gt; left off. The synopsis for this week says:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Since Hachiro Kiyokawa&#39;s plan to make Roshigumi serve for the <br/>\nImperial <br/>\n&gt; Court, instead of the Shogunate is revealed, the leaders of <br/>\nRoshigumi, <br/>\n&gt; including Tadasaburo Sasaki decides to take the members back to <br/>\nEdo. <br/>\n&gt; ........ Keisuke Yamanami brings news that Roshigumi will be sent <br/>\nback <br/>\n&gt; to Edo.

It never<br/>\ndid of course, but those members were to become the<br/>\nShinchogumi (Newly Formed Group). When Kiyokawa and<br/>\nthe men reached Edo they started stirring up trouble<br/>\nin the city. <br/>\n With the news of a possible insurrection against the<br/>\ngovernment and Kiyokawa became known as part of the<br/>\nplot a hit was put out on him. He was killed on April<br/>\n13, 1963 (I would say yesterday was the anniversary,<br/>\nbut I think that date is using the other calendar).<br/>\nAnyways, the government then rounded up and imprisoned<br/>\nthe bad members of the group and those still around<br/>\nbecame the Shinchogumi. I donï¿½t know anything about<br/>\nTadasaburo Sasaki&#39;s role in even of this though.<br/>\n<br/>\n I take it that in the tv series that it will be the<br/>\nend of episode 16 and then in episode 17 that Kondo<br/>\nand company become the Shinsengumi. <br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I did come across another <br/>\ninteresting rumor from a livejournal somewhere (can&#39;t remember right <br/>\nnow)... Saitou seems to be related by blood to Mr. Sasaki? I know.. I <br/>\nknow... All I ever bring to the tables are rumors, just like that <br/>\nother woman of Saitou-sama... But really? This just sparked my <br/>\ninterest because, Saitou joined the Shinsengumi why did he not join <br/>\nthe Mimawarigumi? If he was related to Mr. Sasaki, wouldn&#39;t it have <br/>\nbeen easy? Or was it because his father was a Ronin that it would be <br/>\npreposterous for him to join the other patrol group who were composed <br/>\nof &quot;higher blood/lineage/ etc&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way... You can find more photos on the shinsengumi and <br/>\nSasaki&#39;s grave at this site...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fc.a-vst.jp/location_library/shinsengumi/sasaki.html\">http://www.fc.a-vst.jp/location_library/shinsengumi/sasaki.html</a></div>",
