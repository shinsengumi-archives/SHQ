            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2083182843\">Because I am going to be unemployed for quite some time, I gave <br/>\nmyself a task (with Barb&#39;s permission).  I&#39;m tired of missing films.  <br/>\nAre you?  Wish you&#39;d even been aware of them in the first place?  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a relatively simple matter for me to get information about <br/>\nwhat&#39;s coming up on certain channels, so I&#39;ll be posting a monthly <br/>\nheads up on what&#39;s coming on.  Look for it on the 15th of each <br/>\nmonth.  I&#39;ll also be constantly updating the SHQ Calendar as I gather <br/>\nthe information.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I don&#39;t want you to miss out on a chance to see &quot;Sword of <br/>\nDoom&quot; tomorrow, this month&#39;s list only includes fare from the <br/>\nIndependent Film Channel (IFC) and the Sundance Channel, the two <br/>\nchannels that show the most Japanese film I can access.  In future, <br/>\nit will also include the HBO & Cinemax family of channels, Showtime & <br/>\nThe Movie Channel family, and the Starz family.  If anyone has access <br/>\nto other cable or dish networks with different channels than these, <br/>\nplease feel free to join me in keeping our fellow wolves fed with <br/>\nJapanese fare.<br/>\n<br/>\npachi (or phil)<br/>\n*** <br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is a listing of films being shown on US cable channels from <br/>\nMarch 21, 2004 to April 20, 2004.  All times are Eastern Standard <br/>\nTime (EST).  Always check your own local schedules for show dates and <br/>\ntimes in your area there are variations in cable feeds and the <br/>\nproblem that I&#39;m human and prone to err.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe schedule is available in the Calendar in the Web Features on the <br/>\nSHQ yahoogroup site.  If you receive individual e-mails, link to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq/cal\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq/cal</a> .  The calendar is set to <br/>\nreflect the day starting at 12:00AM and ending at 11:00PM.  Times for <br/>\nfilms have been incorporated into a calendar set for EST.  You can <br/>\nimport calendar entries into your own personal calendar (but pay <br/>\nattention to whether or not it changes show times to your time zone <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if it does or not).  When you click on the title of the <br/>\nfilm, it will give you more information, including an option to <br/>\nimport the entry.  Film show times and lengths have been rounded down <br/>\nor up where necessary (if it starts at 1:50, the start time shows <br/>\n1:45; if it lasts 88 minutes, it&#39;s shown to last 1 hour 30 minutes).  <br/>\nPlay with it and see if it will help you not miss any more of those <br/>\nwonderful films!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll films are subtitled unless otherwise indicated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai Films:<br/>\n<br/>\nSWORD OF DOOM (1966)<br/>\nDirected by Kihachi Okamoto, 119 minutes, B/W<br/>\nShows beginnings of the Shinsengumi and the assassination of Serizawa <br/>\nKamo in the tale about a warped swordsman<br/>\nIFC  3/21: 6:00AM<br/>\n<br/>\nSAMURAI TRILOGY: PART I (1954)<br/>\nDirected by Hiroshi Inagaki, 93 minutes, color<br/>\n17th century drama starring Toshiro Mifune.<br/>\nIFC   3/27: 8:00AM,  3/28: 6:OOAM<br/>\n<br/>\nSAMURAI TRILOGY: PART II (1955)<br/>\n104 minutes, color<br/>\nIFC  4/3: 8:00AM, 2:00PM<br/>\n<br/>\nSAMURAI TRILOGY: PART III (1956)<br/>\n115 minutes, color<br/>\nIFC  4/10: 8:00AM, 1:45PM<br/>\n<br/>\nHIDDEN FORTRESS (1958)<br/>\nDirected by Akira Kurosawa, 139 minutes, B/W<br/>\nIFC  4/17: 8:00AM, 1:45PM<br/>\n<br/>\nONIBABA (1964)<br/>\nDirected by Kaneto Shindou, 103 minutes, B/W<br/>\nIFC  3/29: 12:00PM, 6:00PM<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Japanese films:<br/>\n<br/>\nKIKUJIRO (1999)<br/>\nDirected by Takeshi &quot;Beat&quot; Kitano, 121 minutes, color<br/>\nSome of us know Kitano as Hijikata in &quot;Gohatto.&quot;  Delightful tale of <br/>\na man taking a lonely little boy to his mother.<br/>\nIFC  3/29: 8:00AM, 1:45PM<br/>\n<br/>\nRHAPSODY IN AUGUST (1991)<br/>\nDirected by Akira Kurosawa, 98 minutes, color, English and Japanese<br/>\nRevisiting Hiroshima and Nagasaki through the eyes of a widowed <br/>\nsurvivor and the American nephew (Richard Gere) who visits.<br/>\nSundance Channel  repeats throughout the month: check the Calendar <br/>\non 4/2, 4/3, 4/6, 4/11, 4/12, 4/15, 4/21<br/>\n<br/>\nAUDITION (1999)<br/>\nDirected by Takashi Miike, 115 minutes, color<br/>\nSundance Channel  4/3: 12:00AM   4/8: 2:30AM   4/20: 3:45AM<br/>\n<br/>\nCURE (1997)<br/>\nDirected by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, 111 minutes, color<br/>\nA killer is loose in Tokyo who leaves a cross-shaped scar on his <br/>\nvictims the ghost of Kenshin??<br/>\nSundance Channel  4/6: 2:00AM   4/17: 12:00AM<br/>\n<br/>\nMT.
