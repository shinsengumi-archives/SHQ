            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-578518760\">Actually, one of the more intelligent people wanted to basically <br/>\nrevise the Shinsengumi entirely to adjust to American tastes as I <br/>\nmentioned even modernize them.  The setting would be changed but <br/>\npolitical and internal conflict/story would be the same.  It would <br/>\nbe an alternate universe but not &quot;fantasy&quot;.  And the cast would be <br/>\nPC, multiethnic and have female captains.  They received screenshots <br/>\nof Jin-Roh:The Wolf Brigade and picked up on the idea.  So really, <br/>\nthe basic idea of the Shinsengumi, and swords+martial arts was <br/>\nappealing.  The financial resources was an issue and a strong <br/>\npersonality/host to draw an audience was a major obstacle.  As I <br/>\nmentioned ideas are stolen all the time.  Many people have been <br/>\nexposed to the Shinsengumi at the same time and not always in a <br/>\nformal meeting setting...any one of these people can take the idea <br/>\nto another company.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe company specializes in documentaries and needed ideas to pitch <br/>\nto a cable channel.  NOt the History channel but similar.  In fact <br/>\nthe idea of something to experiment with such as cutting tests with <br/>\nswords was discussed.  They like Action+History under the mask of <br/>\neducation so to speak and this is why they were very open to the <br/>\nidea in the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;the Wolves&quot; were part of our list of key words but they warmed up <br/>\nto swat team faster.  Whatever works for them.  To these folks &quot;The <br/>\nwolves of Mibu&quot; would be too long...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Recommend Tamilyn Tomita.  Speaks excellent English, is Japanese, <br/>\n&gt; and HOT!!!  Kind of famous.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, there are many famous Japanese who can speak English just fine <br/>\nthe problem is the person has no &quot;name recognition&quot; with an American <br/>\naudience.  This goes back to how there aren&#39;t many Asians in showbiz <br/>\nto begin with.  The authoriy figure who submitted a formal proposal <br/>\nwould, to us, be a good host but there were certain reasons why the <br/>\ncompany did not use this person or contact him back ASAP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Alan&quot; &lt;alanw1911@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s unfortunate to hear, but the sad truth.

IRONICALLY, Last<br/>\nSamurai was also part of the failure of this project (the film&#39;s box<br/>\noffice earnings was not &quot;good&quot; enough).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that the company expressed interest first.

So<br/>\nShinsengumi had to be abandoned for Shogun&#39;s Swat Team or just &quot;Swat<br/>\nTEam&quot; and finally &quot;team&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would a company be filled with ignorant people?

Yes, it was a waste of time but it gave me incredible<br/>\ninsight into the business and why we have so many bad movies and poor<br/>\ndocumentaries.
