            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1280573103\">Last year in Japan a new game for the PS2 was released - Bakumatsu Renka<br/>\nShinsengumi.  Not a fighting game, but a dating game!  While this might<br/>\nbe an unconventional portrayal, it&#39;s a lot of -fun-, and not simply<br/>\nbecause the bishonen factor is high...  :)  The story focuses on<br/>\nSakuraba Suzuka, a young girl from Aizu who has trained in kendo.<br/>\nWanting to prove herself, she gets Teruhime&#39;s help and joins the<br/>\nShinsengumi.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe point of the game is to talk to and eventually gain the interest of<br/>\none of the guys.  Except for Suzuka, all of the characters in the game<br/>\nare actual historical figures - even including Shinsengumi members that<br/>\naren&#39;t as well known in the English fandom.  There has been one volume<br/>\nof manga released, in addition to novels and a variety of merchandise.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKizu and I have made a site dedicated to this game, &quot;Bakumatsu Renka<br/>\nShinsengumi no Koibito&quot; at  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://brs.hajimenokizu.com/\">http://brs.hajimenokizu.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://brs.hajimenokizu.com\">http://brs.hajimenokizu.com</a>  Whether you heard of this game last year<br/>\nas news came from Japan or this is the first you&#39;ve seen of it, visit<br/>\nthe site to learn more!  We have a lot of information, and yes,<br/>\npictures.  ^__^  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-SafetyGirl<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
