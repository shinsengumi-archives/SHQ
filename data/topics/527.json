I&#39;m assuming that yes they would want to know where he<br/>\nwas coming from--from a martial arts P.O.V...the answer can be found<br/>\nif the history of kendo itself is examined.  Mainstream kendo books<br/>\n-do- mention its early days in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police<br/>\nDepartment & Army but no dates are given (some say 19XX was when the<br/>\ngov. actually invited a couple of lineages to come up with a<br/>\ncurriculum)...if the tournaments utilized modern rules/regulations I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure if the school/lineage of the practitioner was important.  I&#39;m<br/>\nrepeating what I&#39;ve heard over and over again on martial arts boards<br/>\n(so I deeply apologize if I&#39;m wrong) but distinctions are always made<br/>\nbetween modern kendo (categorized as a sport with rules and scoring<br/>\nsystem) and kenjutsu (its relative/ancestor). So perhaps the<br/>\ntournaments and kendo in general within the police dept. may have<br/>\nserved as a unifying element it&#39;s kind of like saying &quot;wherever you<br/>\nguys are from you will now play by a new set of rules&quot; at least as far<br/>\nas the tournament is concerned.  Like I said a closer examination of<br/>\nthe history of kendo itself is needed (sigh)<br/>\n<br/>\n*even by the time he participated in his first tournament he was no<br/>\nlonger just a cop on the beat...but already an assistant inspector [1877]<br/>\nthe tournament takes place in [1882] at least 5 years after getting<br/>\nthe position...so I&#39;m assuming somewhat respected in his dept.  I<br/>\nthink out of courtesy they wouldn&#39;t try to pry into his background if<br/>\nhe already held a respectable position in the dept....I&#39;m personally<br/>\nsurprised he didn&#39;t participate *more* or -not- at all<br/>\n<br/>\nWarg3791 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm</a><br/>\nonly has hirotaka suzuoki&#39;s voice work?...man I love his voice<br/>\n<br/>\nWarg3791 However, they also state that he didn&#39;t join the police force<br/>\nright away. They<br/>\nlist the year he became a policeman as 1877. But we know he joined<br/>\nsooner than<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\n*yep, on the 3-hajime.com basic chronology 1877 is mentioned as the<br/>\nfirst year connecting S.H. to the police [but] in other places of her<br/>\nwebsite such as the mystery of the 1st wife -1871- the webmaster<br/>\nspeculates this mystery woman may have had a hand in his affiliation<br/>\nwith the pol. dept. which pushes the policework timeline way back.  To<br/>\nme S.H. may have had alot of side jobs and travelled which prevents<br/>\nnosy historians from finding a definate paper trail<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin (Hands out Tylenol to everyone trying to track Saito-sama&#39;s<br/>\nmovements.)....I prefer sake thank you </span></blockquote></div>",

But this is all just speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the origins of the rumor that he taught kendo after the war, I know of one site that mentions this. The Hiten Misurugi Ryuu site states that he was a kendo instructor for a time, but not where: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, they also state that he didn&#39;t join the police force right away. They list the year he became a policeman as 1877. But we know he joined sooner than that. Perhaps they got confused about his leaving for the Senian War and thought that meant this is when he joined? The Saitou Watcher&#39;s Tea Room interestingly enough seems to make this same mistake, also listing the year he joined the police as 1877.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin (Hands out Tylenol to everyone trying to track Saito-sama&#39;s movements.)</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-496796990\">(Speculation bubble appears over head)<br/>\nI&#39;m sure many of the prisoners had martial arts related skills already<br/>\n(yakuza, construction workers, horse thieves all had their own set of<br/>\nstreet fighting skills).<br/>\nMartial arts has, from what I hear, been associated with character<br/>\nbuilding and refinement of the mind.  Since I don&#39;t think these<br/>\nprisoners were the type to sit down in a classroom and learn how to<br/>\nread and write...martial arts seems to be a good way for them to get<br/>\nsome exercise and have law&order and discipline beaten into them if<br/>\nneed be.  A perceptive guard can also gauge the<br/>\nattitude/character/ability of his students/prisoners as well(weed out<br/>\ntroublemakers and do some serious will breaking).  I don&#39;t have any<br/>\ninfo on this prison where N.S. worked at...was it a prison of 100%<br/>\npure &quot;street&quot; felons or political prisoners who would be released<br/>\nafter a while anyways?  In any case,  from the later rebellions and<br/>\nconflicts abroad I figure the government wouldn&#39;t mind having men of<br/>\n&quot;draftable&quot; age fit and ready to fight.  I&#39;m sure the guards had<br/>\nrifles handy so even if it does seem counterproductive to instruct<br/>\nthem in martial arts I&#39;m sure the guards in the towers were ready to<br/>\nshoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nhighly recommended in assisting us from getting into the &quot;male&quot;<br/>\nswording wielding mind<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.e-budo.com\">http://www.e-budo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, Barbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Oh no the fish shields nothing from you.
