However many historians also<br/>\ndiscuss samurai doing &quot;ninja work&quot; as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a different note,when I started using babelfish to search Japanese<br/>\nsearch engines there was a Shinsengumi site that mentions &quot;Saito One<br/>\nno sign ninja/shinobi&quot; ... it was more of a fan site but still I think<br/>\nwhat the webmaster was getting at was that he/she didn&#39;t think Saito<br/>\nOne was a ninja but obviously he could do spy work.  Perhaps Nanae<br/>\nChrono just recognized that information gathering was as &quot;ninja&quot; as<br/>\nyou can get and chose to portray him that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Did Yamazaki actually have a ninja background or is that entirely an<br/>\ninvention of PMK? </span></blockquote></div>",
