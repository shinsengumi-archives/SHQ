They landed in 1870 in a sleepy little town <br/>\ncalled Pagoda Springs Colorado.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly they never counted on most of their old co-workers and enemies to <br/>\nget the same idea. We&#39;ve even had appearances from the great 15th <br/>\ncentury warrior Maeda Toshiie and his lovely wife Matsu and even Saizou <br/>\nthe pig from PMK and Bigfoot  are known to pop in O_O.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t want to be a transplanted Japanese character? We could use long <br/>\nterm and temporary appearances from assorted American townsfolk types.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested or have questions or would like to know more pop me <br/>\nan email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bsher213@...\">bsher213@...</a> or catch me on AIM or Yahoomessenger at <br/>\nbsher213<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBarbara Sheridan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barbarasheridan.net\">http://www.barbarasheridan.net</a><br/>\nThe Blog-- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\">http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/</a></div>",
