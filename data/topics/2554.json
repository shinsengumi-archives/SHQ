(It&#39;s message number 271 at the above address if<br/>\nanyone else wants to check the original.)  The last sentence, about the<br/>\nfamily relationships, was confusing and I&#39;m not sure I translated that part<br/>\ncorrectly, but I think the rest of it is right.  Anyway, here&#39;s what I came<br/>\nup with as a translation:<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, after he repelled the first attack of the western campaign,<br/>\nYamaguchi Jirou (Saitou Hajime) requested a placement in a reconnaissance<br/>\nunit outside the castle, but Saigou Tanomo didn&#39;t permit it and removed him<br/>\nfrom the front lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmediately after that, the western campaign broke through the Shirasaka<br/>\ngateway, which the Shinsengumi had originally been protecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very delicate issue whether it should be called lucky or should be<br/>\ncalled a mistake to have taken such a true battle experienced person from<br/>\nthe scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally,  Saigou Tanomo becomes an uncle to Fujita Tokio by her cousin<br/>\nKazuo&#39;s adoptive father (Numazawa Shichirou).<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------</div>",
