He<br/>\nDOES FIT these personality traits...and to top it off he is the &quot;rare&quot;<br/>\nkind of ulcer patient.  The juvenile ulcer patient...and to make it<br/>\nmore interesting...he&#39;s a leftie. After grilling him with questions I<br/>\nformed from my superficial study I knew that there is &quot;something to&quot;<br/>\nthese kinds of people--after all ulcers have mental causes.<br/>\n<br/>\nok my mini fangirl essay will not and cannot prove that Fujita Goro was<br/>\n1) a juvenile ulcer patient<br/>\nhowever I think that there are some things in the essay which will be<br/>\nof interest to some people<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t upload it to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> because unlike the <br/>\nOkita + TB essay<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthis ulcer essay was based on notes I typed without page numbers,<br/>\nHOWEVER I do know exactly which books everything came from and the<br/>\nauthor&#39;s names are noted after quotes<br/>\n<br/>\noften, shinsengumihq.com will use the good old MLA citation system in<br/>\nan attempt to maintain information integrity <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mla.org/style\">http://www.mla.org/style</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand because this particular piece lacks page numbers wwhich would<br/>\nallow verification I decided not to upload it (T_T)<br/>\n<br/>\nbut it is still....interesting...very interesting<br/>\n<br/>\nif people have questions you can aim me at &quot;badgerturtle&quot; or see me in<br/>\nthe MIRC chat room Bunneh set up...sometimes questions help me recall<br/>\na detail I forgot to include</div>",
