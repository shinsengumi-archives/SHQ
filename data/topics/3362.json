After serving a brief detention after the war, Shimada Kai<br/>\ncontinued to live in the Meiji era and left behind a record of<br/>\nShinsengumi activities.  From past discussions (this is from my memory<br/>\nmind you) he did not wish to seek government employment and this or<br/>\nmay not be connected to his views on the new order.<br/>\n<br/>\nInside the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> website is a search bar in the<br/>\nupper left hand corner and if you type in &quot;Shimada Kai&quot; every page on<br/>\nwhich his name appears should be pulled up for you to browse.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------[Extra Info]--------<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of Shimada Kai&#39;s writing is invaluable in terms of cross checking<br/>\nsome facts and Hirotada wrote a great summary comparing what Shimada<br/>\nsaid about the name &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; and perhaps a more likely explanation:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s in a Name?&quot;--Shimada Kai and the Question of Shinsengumi&#39;s<br/>\nName [return to top]<br/>\n<br/>\nby Hirotada Tokugawa(Shimazu Masayoshi)<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Shimada Kai&#39;s record, the name &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; was received<br/>\nby the Buke-denso (Imperial Messengers) following the unit&#39;s<br/>\nperformance on 8/18/Bunkyu 3. However, Tsuri Yoichi, in &quot;Doujidainin<br/>\nwo mita Matsudaira Katamori&quot; (appearing in &quot;Matsudaira Katamori no<br/>\nSubete&quot;), points out that after the incident, on the day that the<br/>\ngroup received the name &quot;Shinsengumi,&quot; the buke-denso-- Nomiya<br/>\nSadanori and Asukai Masanori-- were confined from meeting with anyone<br/>\non that day, since they were in the list of 20 nobles in Sanjo<br/>\nChunagon Sanetomi&#39;s group who were similarly confined. &quot;Therefore,<br/>\nthere is no way,&quot; Tsuri says, &quot;that they could have been there to<br/>\nbestow the name of &#39;Shinsengumi&#39;. If we are to trust Shimada Kai&#39;s<br/>\nrecord and believe they were the ones who bestowed the name, they<br/>\nwould have had to bestowed it prior to the 8/18 incident. Therefore it<br/>\nis more probable that Katamori or one of the men close to him bestowed<br/>\nthe name instead.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(Tsuri Yoichi, Doujidainin wo mita Matsudaira Katamori, pp. 150-160 of<br/>\nMatsudaira Katamori no Subete, Tsunabuchi Kenjo, ed.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-758019898\">&quot;On the 3rd, 25 or 26 men under Okita, Nagakura, Harada and others,<br/>\nwere gathered in the meeting hall of the Fushimi Magistrate&#39;s offices,<br/>\nand drinking good sake. Around 4 PM they saw Satsuma men rolling<br/>\ncannons into position around Gokomiya, a shrine which had a good<br/>\ncommanding view of the other Bakufu forces&#39; encampment. It seemed that<br/>\nwar was about to start and could come suddenly, so [the Shinsengumi<br/>\nmen] prepared to be deployed at a moment&#39;s notice. That night at<br/>\naround 7, the cannons at Gokomiya erupted. Every building in Fushimi<br/>\nbecame a target. The Magistrate&#39;s office also took about 10<br/>\nhits...vice-commander Hijikata, sensing that this was it, gathered the<br/>\nmen in the courtyard and ordered an all-out offensive. First they<br/>\nbrought out the cannon that was assigned to the magistrate&#39;s office,<br/>\nand then pointing it at the Satsuma positions at Gokomiya, began to<br/>\nfire. The Satsuma forces saw this and zeroed in, unleashing a<br/>\nwithering barrage of fire. After about half an hour the cannonade<br/>\ncontinued, and so Nagakura&#39;s 2nd Unit was detached as an assault team<br/>\nand ordered to disrupt the enemy positions.<br/>\nNagakura and his sergeants Shimada Kai and Ito Tetsugoro led the men<br/>\nover the earthen wall and charged the Satsuma camp. Swinging their<br/>\nswords, Nagakura and his men bravely struck the enemy, Satsuma men<br/>\nunder Nozu Shigekatsu, who were forced to retreat. They gave chase for<br/>\nabout three cho, and then found that the houses on both sides of the<br/>\nroad were aflame, and no advance was possible. Out of options,<br/>\nNagakura and his men withdrew to the earthen wall outside the<br/>\nmagistrate&#39;s office, intending to return inside. However, Nagakura&#39;s<br/>\narmor was heavy and he could not climb over the wall, so his sergeant<br/>\nShimada Kai extended his rifle, and pulled it up over the wall with<br/>\nNagakura hanging off. Those who saw were shocked at the extent of his<br/>\n[Shimada&#39;s] strength.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNagakura, Shinsengumi Tenmatsu-ki, pages 158 to 159.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen awhile; hope you all are doing well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that Shinsengumi saw the cannons later used for<br/>\nthe surprise attack, being rolled into place at Gokomiya. Some of us<br/>\nknow the story of Nagakura being pulled up over a wall at<br/>\nToba-Fushimi; apparently this is it. For the longest time I thought it<br/>\nwas a spear Shimada used, but apparently it was a rifle.</div>",
