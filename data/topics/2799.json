            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1920579244\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a way to explain everything and put an end to the growing confusion...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn volume 20 of RK (not animated unfortunately), which depicts Kenshin&#39;s past with Tomoe, you can see a description of what happens at Ikedaya, from Kenshin&#39;s pov. As we see in that volume, Kenshin never intervened at Ikedaya, only becoming aware of the events once everything is over. He then assists to the Shinsengumi &quot;parade&quot; and exchange a long look with Saito. Kenshin then thinks &quot;J&#39;ai l&#39;impression que je reverrai souvent cet homme...&quot; or if I&#39;m translating from the French version &quot;I was under the impression that I would often see that man in the future...&quot;, implying that they didn&#39;t knew each other yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, in volume 21, once Tomoe is dead (sorry, if I&#39;m spoiling that to anyone, but... where have you been?) Kenshin returns to Kyoto and soon engage in a duel with Saito for the first time. Seeing him, Saito says &quot;Je me disais bien que ce n&#39;Ã©tait pas un sabreur ordinaire... c&#39;Ã©tait donc cela&quot; or &quot;I thought he was no ordinary swordsman... this explains it...&quot;, meaning that he just understood that the man he saw in the crowd after Ikedaya is Battosai. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo knowing this, it then becomes clear that the scene in volume 7 (or episode 28) does not happens at Ikedaya, like many people thinks, but WAY after Ikedaya. It really is a common mistake as I&#39;ve also been under that impression for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary-Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nnlf7 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nlf7@...\">nlf7@...</a>&gt; wrote:                               Only one word has to be corrected, &quot; Ikedaya.&quot; Please refer to my original <br/>\n message for more information.
