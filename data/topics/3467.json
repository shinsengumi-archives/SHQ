I know that it seems very boring to work at a museum but in the Meiji era they were fascinating places because the modern nation state tried to develop and image and history to present to its citizens in the capital by using these museums.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is so confusing is that the museum moves, and gets renamed in the Meiji Era (-_-).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy email is secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully by finding all these bits and pieces we can incorporate these details into the e-book which can be a great resource for everyone who wants a really really in depth bio on Saitou in English.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help Bonnie!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, Bonnie Johnston &lt;bonnielala@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, Secretary!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband works at Texas A&M, and their library has a copy, according to<br/>\n&gt; the online catalog.
