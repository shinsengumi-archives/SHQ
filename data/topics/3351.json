            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-289892800\">Modern Kendo (the kind people usually think about with the guys fighting with bamboo swords and wearing the armor) was mostly influenced by Hokushin Itto Ryu.  Towards the end of the Tokugawa Era and especially during Bakumatsu, there seemed to be a rise in what I like to call &quot;Beater Styles&quot; like Jigen Ryu and Tennen Rishin Ryu, as opposed to styles which relied a bit more on finesse like Yagyu Shinkage Ryu (which I typically refer to as a &quot;Baiting Style&quot;).  Alot of the styles used by the Shinsengumi and their opponents looked to my limited understanding as styles meant to return to the bare bones of swordsmanship.  As my own teacher put it (his Aikido teacher in Osaka is a shihan of Tennen Rishin Ryu), Tennen Rishin Ryu was designed to be quick to pick up so you could get people out fighting as soon as possible.<br/>\nAs a modern analog for what I mean, I&#39;d point to Toyama Ryu and it&#39;s branch styles.  A few years ago my group did a joint seminar with some kenshi from Nakamura Ryu, which is a more modern style drawn from the Toyama kendo taught to Japanese soldiers during the war.  Drawdy Sensei explained that Toyama Ryu was kendo designed to pass along the solid ideas of sword kihon to alot of people quickly.  When our group went up my teacher explained that while Toyama was sword designed to be simple, Yagyu Shinkage Ryu existed during a time when men had nothing better to do than train in swordsmanship all day, so it could be said that Yagyu is kendo at it&#39;s most complicated.<br/>\nAnywho, talking about the &quot;gravity&quot; of Hokushin Itto Ryu, in modern Kendo (I generally use capitol &quot;K&quot; for the modern sport and lower case &quot;k&quot; when talking about Japanese fencing in general, be it gendai or koryu) sometimes when someone makes a really powerful strike with the shinai it can leave deep bruises in the shape of the bamboo strips, even if hit on the kote or men.  Alot of Itto Ryu is centered around the idea of victory in one sure strike called Kiri-Otoshi.<br/>\n <br/>\nRemember, No Matter How Bad Life Gets, There Is Always Beer.<br/>\n-Norm MacDonald<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Barbara Sheridan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bsher213@...\">bsher213@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, March 9, 2008 9:45:45 PM<br/>\nSubject: [SHQ] Kenjutsu people, I need you!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita, Serizawa I hope you guys are still out there in Shinsengumi- land somewhere and see this.
