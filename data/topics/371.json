The messages come <br/>\ninto inboxes as much as 14 hours later, <br/>\nsometimes are sent multiple times (one <br/>\nlist member received a message into his <br/>\ninbox *24* times), and sometimes never <br/>\nshow up at all. For a discussion <br/>\ngroup, this is torture... and it&#39;s been <br/>\ngoing on for well over a week. <br/>\nNormally when we&#39;ve encountered <br/>\nproblems like this, the problem has <br/>\ncleared up, but it&#39;s not clearing up <br/>\nthis time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been searching the Help files to <br/>\nno avail for what could be causing <br/>\nthis. May I suggest Yahoo create a <br/>\npage where users (of mail and groups) <br/>\ncan access update information about <br/>\nproblems the system is experiencing? <br/>\nIf such a page exists, WHERE is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the groups I am on, the one <br/>\nexperiencing the most trauma (because <br/>\nit&#39;s the most active) is shq. <br/>\n<br/>\nI and the group are anxiously awaiting <br/>\nan explanation for the problems and a <br/>\nhopeful cure.
