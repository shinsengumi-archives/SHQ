Hirama Juusuke, who was with Serizawa & Hirayama when they were murdered, survived the attack.  But what happened to him after that?  And what about a Noguchi Kenji, who also was part of Serizawa&#39;s group and the Shinsengumi... what happened to him during all of this wiping out of the Mad Duck club?  Anyone know?
