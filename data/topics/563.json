However, it should be remembered that <br/>\nthere was a calender change a couple years later, so all dates are <br/>\nactually off from what they should be by about a month. That&#39;s why it <br/>\ncan get so confusing. Some sites will show the &quot;corrected&quot; date, <br/>\nwhile others will show the date as it was at the time of the <br/>\nincident.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHm, I don&#39;t have anything to confirm this by right off hand, but I <br/>\nthink the anniversary of Hijikata&#39;s death is just around the corner <br/>\non May 11th. &gt;_&lt; I&#39;d better hear some nice words for my Hijikata-sama!<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
