I&#39;ve been eyeing that site for TOO <br/>\nlong now. Still trying to decide whether actually buying from jpqueen <br/>\nis better than buying from www.sasugabooks.com. I mean the price per <br/>\ntankoubon is high like 5-6 USD but it&#39;s new and shipping is slightly <br/>\nlower and I&#39;ll get it faster unlike Jpqueen. But I don&#39;t know there&#39;s <br/>\nso many other things I want to buy from jpqueen like manga <br/>\nanthologies, doujinshis... They have better prices but shipping kills <br/>\nthe deal... We need to get a &quot;Japanese connection&quot; so to speak. You <br/>\nknow a person who can bid for us in yahoo japan, scour the streets <br/>\nfor doujinshis and tankoubons dealing with Saitou and the <br/>\nShinsengumi. While he/she is at it, we might as well ask that person <br/>\nto find us movies, figures, and possibly &quot;historical&quot; novelties... <br/>\n<br/>\n*Dear Lord... We already have very good language translators... Now <br/>\nall we need is another person to do our shopping for us in Japan*<br/>\n<br/>\nOh for those people who have been looking for Japanese historical <br/>\nbooks per se, sasugabooks has a better collection than Amazon albeit <br/>\nthe price...<br/>\n<br/>\n~wounds</div>",
