            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-238055361\">Ohayo gozaimasu!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, thank you for the pointer to &quot;Jikou Keisatsu&quot;, which I have been<br/>\nenjoying (at least the soft-subs... my Japanese isn&#39;t nearly up to the<br/>\ntask of understanding a show like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoyed another Jo Odagiri starring role this weekend that some on the<br/>\nlist might enjoy, even if it was not Shinsengumi-related.  I watched the<br/>\nmovie &quot;Shinobi: Heart Under Blade&quot;, which is supposedly a live-action<br/>\nversion of the anime/manga &quot;Basilisk&quot;.  I&#39;m not familiar with<br/>\n&quot;Basilisk&quot;, so I can&#39;t comment on how well the movie follows its source<br/>\nmaterial, but I can heartily recommend the movie on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Possible spoilers follow]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie is something of a take on Romeo and Juliet, if the Montagues<br/>\nand Capulets were ninja clans.  Tokugawa Ieyasu sets the Iga and Hoga<br/>\nclans at each other, leaving two young lovers, each the grandchild of<br/>\ntheir respective village&#39;s leader, stuck in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nProduction values were very high, with beautiful scenery and a haunting<br/>\nsoundtrack.  The fight scenes were very good; each of the main ninja<br/>\ncharacters had their own specialty, including the best live-action<br/>\nversion of Kenshin&#39;s fighting style that one is likely to see.<br/>\nUnfortunately, it was a bit rushed; the story revolves around a series<br/>\nof duels between ten ninja, five to a side.  Two hours is just too short<br/>\nof a time to develop much empathy for that many characters.  Instead,<br/>\nyou only get to know the two lovers fairly well, and only two of the<br/>\nother ninja really get to explain themselves.  They were all potentially<br/>\ninteresting characters, and I would have preferred a longer format to<br/>\nget to know them better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read a number of complaints about the ending in online forums.<br/>\nBeing both a fan of Asian cinema and a student of Japanese history, the<br/>\nending was not terribly surprising to me, and I believe it fit the story<br/>\nwell.  I can, however, see how someone who either doesn&#39;t know the<br/>\nhistory of the time period or is more used to Hollywood movie endings<br/>\nmight not like this (my mother was the same way when she saw &quot;Crouching<br/>\nTiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;... she loved the movie up until the end, but<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand why it had such a sad ending). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, it&#39;s not the kind of movie that&#39;s going to change the world,<br/>\nbut it was a worthwhile use of two hours.  It had an interesting story,<br/>\ndecent acting, good fight scenes, and more ninja than you can shake a<br/>\nstick at... what more can you ask for?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tkuruma deshita</div>",

He brought in an elegant, quiet <br/>\nintesity.  For me, he is Yamanami.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTatsuya Fujiwara (NHK Okita):  Had already seen him in BR.  Then NHK <br/>\nmade me a fan.  He didn&#39;t impress me at the beginning of the series, <br/>\nbut his performance improved as the series went on and he grew into <br/>\nhis role.  Then I saw him in BRII and Sabu.  Still a fan.  I can <br/>\nwatch Tatsuya in other roles and not see him as Souji. [As an aside, <br/>\nif anyone&#39;s interested, Tatsuya is the lead in Death Note coming out <br/>\nin Japan in June.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-383053658\">This might be a bit off-topic, but I&#39;ve been totally in actor fan-mode lately.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  For the last 8 weeks, I&#39;ve been completely absorbed in a drama called &quot;Jikou keisatsu,&quot; about a section of the police that deals with limitations cases (cases that are no longer prosecutable, but still need to be solved).  The main character, Kiriyama, is one of the investigators and is played by Jo Odagiri --- Saitou in NHK&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;.  Now, it might sound like a dull, serious drama, but it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s wonderfully comedic and Jo is an absolute scream... nothing like our Saitou.  Don&#39;t believe me?  Take a look at him at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/jikou/index.html\">http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/jikou/index.html</a> (and he&#39;s actually looking pretty normal in that pic).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As I&#39;ve watched the show, I&#39;ve been constantly reminded of his portrayal of Saitou... probably my very favorite version of him (even over RK Saitou, which was my first love)... because it&#39;s so different from Kiriyama.  I know a lot of it is how a character is written, but it takes the actor to bring it to life with their own unique physical quirks in facial expressions and body movements.  I&#39;m continually struck by how HUMAN Odagiri made Saitou, showing a man who lived in shades of gray rather than the black & white most others have portrayed him.  In my humble attempts at writing RK Saitou in fanfics, I&#39;ve insisted that there WAS a softer side to the man, a part of him that doubts or at least thinks about what he&#39;s being asked to do, who does care about people, and Odagiri brought that out while not taking away from his warrior&#39;s spirit.  It&#39;s really amazing to rediscover such a fine performance when I&#39;m given something completely different and equally fine.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve discovered the same thing with Shosuke Tanihara and Itou.  Honestly, I can&#39;t imagine the image of Itou Kashitarou bearing anyone&#39;s face but Tanihara&#39;s for the rest of my life.  It was because of that performance that I began watching Tanihara&#39;s other work, both historicals and modern dramas, and it made his Itou even stronger for me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  LOL!  Even with voice actors... I became accustomed to Sparky Thornton&#39;s voice as Saitou in the English dubbed version of RK.  He&#39;s doing voice work in so many other anime series currently airing in the US and every time I hear it, you KNOW who comes immediately to mind.  ^_^<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m really curious if anyone else has pursued other work done by actors who&#39;ve portrayed (or VA-ed) members of the Shinsengumi or stumbled upon them in other things.  Did other performances change your perception of their Shinsengumi role or is that performance so burned into your head that it colors how you react to other roles?  Anyone who will forever BE that person in your head?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  phil (procrastinating, as usual)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
