Maybe even especially us &quot;barbarians.&quot;  (Okay, so he chose a bunch of Shinsengumi fans to get it done... he&#39;s got the connections.)<br/>\n <br/>\nAs soon as I can get the thing uploaded into some usable space, I&#39;ll post a URL for the whole page so the caption can be read/translated.  The book itself is not easy to translate --- Tama and another man in Japan are both having difficulty reading the text as it&#39;s in such an old form.  I know the little boy is Kawajirou, Sagara&#39;s son, and I&#39;m betting that one of the ladies (probably the one seated) is Kimura Hama, Sagara&#39;s sister.  (At least, I hope it is.)  The man standing next to the monument in an image I uploaded yesterday is the grandson, Kimura Kametarou, when he was 28 --- just a year or two shy of his grandfather&#39;s age when he was executed --- and I think M managed to piece out that the picture was taken in April of Taisho 5.  Both his mother and father were Kojima, so I expect he probably favors the family.  I wish we could see the mon on his sleeve.  It&#39;s probably too much to think he might&#39;ve worn a Kojima or Sagara mon in honor of being at the monument in April.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, a comment about the fan that&#39;s in that previous image... that&#39;s Sagara&#39;s handwriting on the fan and it&#39;s a poem.  The fan and Sagara&#39;s bloody topknot were sent to Kawajirou, who kept them hidden away.  Not sure *who* sent the items to the boy, but it was either at Sagara&#39;s request or the government sent them.  A very generous gentleman in Japan not associated with this list (at least I don&#39;t think he is) is going to be contacting the Folklore Museum in Shimosuwa to see if they can provide him with the text on the fan.  I&#39;m deeply touched he would do that.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo say I am extremely emotional after this is an understatement, but to everyone who has been helping in this quest --- you&#39;re the greatest!!<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n<br/>\nsecretary &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:secretarytocapt3@...\">secretarytocapt3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/SSgrouppic.jpg\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/SSgrouppic.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPhil need not thank me....it&#39;s her good luck I was able to get the <br/>\nbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe image above is cropped because I used the maximum resolution as <br/>\na trade off...Phil has the entire photo to add to her collection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n The all-new My Yahoo! � What will yours do?<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

It has to be *the* source for information on him and all its secrets are locked away from me until I learn to read Japanese.  As if I needed more motivation... Saitou-san was enough.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe 1943 edition (which may be the first it was published) has several pages of plates, which appear to be missing from subsequent editions.  (Tama... this is what is missing from your edition that I asked you about.)  I have no idea what they&#39;re all about other than image 2 to the right has to be an early picture of the main stone memorial at the Sakigaki-zuka/Sagara-zuka in Shimosuwa that the Meiji govt. allowed Ochiai Akira to set up in Meiji 3/1870  (and is that Suzuki&#39;s fan to the left or someone else&#39;s?) and the man in image 9 is Saitou Nobuyuki.  Would love to know who the sour-looking man in image 8 is... *please* don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s *HIM*.  :-D<br/>\n <br/>\nThe images are HUGE, so be patient in allowing the pages to upload AND (especially) if they become temporarily unavailable (they&#39;ll reappear within the hour... just these images eats up over 7MB... they&#39;re stored in their own space).  I was too anxious to make them available to immediately work on resizing or any other space saving tricks.  There are 15 images spread over 2 pages.  Anyone willing to translate captions, I&#39;d love to include those with the images.  (I do have zooms of some of the captions if they&#39;re unreadable, but they seem pretty clear... good job, Sec).
