Wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>\nfunny if these two senior citizens went to the movies together and <br/>\nwatched let&#39;s say the Three Musketeers...I&#39;m sure they would take <br/>\ngreat interest in the fencing.  Momoiro-usagi&#39;s post brought a smile <br/>\nto my face as I imagine his children and grand-children thinking &quot;uh <br/>\noh if Grandpa Nagakura get&#39;s bored he&#39;s going to start talking about <br/>\nhis days in the Shinsengumi for the 1,043rd time let&#39;s send him to <br/>\nthe movies&quot; LOL!</div>",
