            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-890483820\">I&#39;m finding conflicting information for the death of Tsukasa.  The<br/>\nShinsengumi book I have (Blood and Makoto: Shinsengumi - Honor and<br/>\nDetermination of the Mibu Roshi) says that he was killed by Ooishi<br/>\nKuwajiro (and others) after trying to leave the Shinsengumi (&quot;He made<br/>\na request to leave the Shinsengumi, however it was not accepted, and<br/>\nhe was *put to the sword* [zansatsu] by Ooishi Kuwajirou (and<br/>\nothers)&quot;, but the Japanese Wikipedia states he commited suicide. As a<br/>\ngeneral rule, I disbelieve wikipedia first, but I&#39;m still curious. I<br/>\ndid notice on the Shinsengumi HQ site he is listed as showing up on<br/>\nthe grave for Kondo and Hijikata he is listed as one of the people who<br/>\n&quot;Died of Illness, Executed, Assassinated, or otherwise Died Under<br/>\nUnusual Circumstances&quot;.</div>",
