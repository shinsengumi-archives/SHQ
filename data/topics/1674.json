I was panicked. <br/>\nIt is famous to Japanese Shinsengumi fans.<br/>\nHowever, I did not think at all that the foreign Shinsengumi fan <br/>\nknew it. <br/>\nIn order to notice it, you need to know the Japanese name of the <br/>\ncaptains of Yamato. <br/>\nFurthermore, you need to be a Shinsengumi fan. <br/>\nI think that this is miraculous probability. <br/>\n<br/>\nOmisoreitashimashita....^^;;; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough there is almost no Shinsengumi Anime, a parody is seen <br/>\noccasionally^^;;;<br/>\nIncidentally, does Kamo-san know this Anime? <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%8A%80%E6%B2%B3%E7%83%88%E9%A2%A8%E3%<br/>\n83%90%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.imagica.com/shop/j9/bax_s.html<br/>\n<br/>\nKorerano setsumei wo mite watashi wa bakusyou shimashita.<br/>\nTokuni tekigata no namae ga sugoi desu.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Not that much.

Kondou tends to play rather a<br/>\n&gt;secondary role in most manga.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this is the influence of &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot;. <br/>\nThe novels of Shiba Ryotarou give gifted character to the main <br/>\ncharacter, and there is a tendency to set up people around it <br/>\nfoolish. <br/>\nKondo Isami and Ootori Keisuke received this damage by &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot;. <br/>\nThe present Shinsengumi works have followed a setup of &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; <br/>\nmostly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;o.o I haven&#39;t seen the 5th volume yet...

Kondou was shot by the member of the Itou <br/>\ngroup and his shoulder was injured.)<br/>\nAnd they stayed with a samurai called Akizuki Ukyounosuke. <br/>\nFrom February 15 to the 25th, they guarded Tokugawa Yoshinobu who <br/>\nhas behaved himself (kinsin). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tokugawa government ordered them to protect Koufu castle. <br/>\nThis was an artifice for driving out inconvenient Shinsengumi from <br/>\nEdo to reconciliation of new government army and Tokugawa. <br/>\n(Or there is an opinion that there was a secret contract between <br/>\nShinsengumi and Tokugawa government official.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThey organized the army for going to Koufu. <br/>\nThis is Kouyouchinbutai. <br/>\nKondou changed the name into Okubo Yamato. <br/>\nHijikata changed to Naitou Hayato. <br/>\nThey left Edo on March 1. <br/>\nThey marched through the Koushu Highway (Kousyukaidou) toward Koufu.<br/>\nOn the way to Kofu, there was Tama area which is their hometown.<br/>\nPeople of their hometown welcomed their army.<br/>\nThe party was held in many villages along which they passed. <br/>\nTheir pace became late and the schedule was overdue. <br/>\nFurthermore, the mountain path which goes to Koufu from Busyu was <br/>\nheavy snow. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo the contrary, the new government army was very quick. <br/>\nBefore Kouyouchinbutai arrived there, the new government army went <br/>\ninto the Koufu castle.<br/>\nThe new government army had more soldiers and arms than they.<br/>\nHijikata returned for demanding reinforcements to Edo. <br/>\nHowever, the battle started on March 6 before Hijikata returns. <br/>\nThe result was the crushing defeat of Kouyouchinbutai. <br/>\nThey escaped to Edo. <br/>\nWhen they returned to Edo, Nagakura and Harada resisted Kondou and <br/>\nwent away. <br/>\nFurthermore, many soldiers escaped. <br/>\n<br/>\nKondou and Hijikata made their army stay at a place called <br/>\nGoheishinden (March 13). <br/>\nGoheishinden is present Adachi-ku, Tokyo.<br/>\nThey hid true character and stayed at Kaneko&#39;s residence which is <br/>\nthe influential person of this place. <br/>\nKondo read books in this place. <br/>\nHijikata did fishing on the river. <br/>\n<br/>\nEpisode which Miss.B may like ^^;;;<br/>\nWhile Hijikata is doing fishing on the river, all the girls of the <br/>\nvillage have gathered. <br/>\nThey stood on the bank and saw Hijikata. <br/>\nThey did not know that the man was Hijikata of Shinsengumi. <br/>\nGirls gathered for seeing that the very handsome samurai is doing <br/>\nfishing. <br/>\n&quot;A nice man&quot; They gossiped. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey moved the army to Nagareyama on April 2. <br/>\nHowever, their transfer was known by the new government army which <br/>\nwas staying in Kasukabe. <br/>\nThey were surrounded by the new government army on April 3. <br/>\nKondou reported to the new government army as Tokugawa&#39;s samurai&#39;s <br/>\nOkubo Yamato.<br/>\n(However, his true character has become clear immediately.)<br/>\nThey were disarmed by the new government army and they escaped to <br/>\nAizu on April 4. <br/>\nHijikata infiltrated into Edo, in order to save Kondou. <br/>\nEdo was governed by the new government army and was in the very <br/>\ndangerous state for him. <br/>\nHijikata visited Katsu Kaishuu and requested rescue of Kondou. <br/>\nHijikata made the petition write to Katsu. <br/>\nHowever, Hijikata&#39;s efforts were useless. <br/>\nKondou was executed in Itabashi on April 25. <br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata joined Tokugawa&#39;s army on April 10. <br/>\nThey gathered in a place called Kokufudai and composed the army <br/>\nwhich made Ootori Keisuke the top on April 12. <br/>\nThey were divided into three groups and aimed at Aizu. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry for the ability not performing detailed explanation. <br/>\nIt is difficult for me to explain in English. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn fact, I do not understand this question. (Maria-san gomennasai)<br/>\nSeeing the answer of M-san, I understood somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkage de totemo wakariyasukatta desu. M-san.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",
