Serve the shogun with single-minded devotion. Do not measure your loyalty <br/>\nby the standard of other domains. If any Aizu daimyo is disloyal to the <br/>\nTokugawa house, he is no descendant of mine, and on no account are you to <br/>\nobey him.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Do not neglect military readiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Take as fundamental the Way of the Samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Do not confuse the duties of higher and lower ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Older brothers should be respected and younger brothers loved.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. The words of women should be totally disregarded.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Lawbreakers should not be treated with leinience.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Other than elders (&quot;karo&quot;-- high-ranking retainers), no one should have a <br/>\nvoice in determining punishments and rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. If a retainer acts beyond his station, he should be dealt with strictly.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. The money and rice set aside for emergencies are to be used for the <br/>\ncommon people, and only in times of famine.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet reliable access on MSN 9 Dial-up. 3 months for the price of 1! <br/>\n(Limited-time offer) <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\">http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/</a></div>",
