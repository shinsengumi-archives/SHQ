            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-753905920\">*** It is better to purchase the film through this link:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://heretic.bside.com/films/ai\">http://heretic.bside.com/films/ai</a> ($1.99)<br/>\nYou get a download link and that&#39;s it---you don&#39;t have to download no <br/>\nsoftware etc etc<br/>\n<br/>\nThis film is certainly worth MORE than a cup of coffee folks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTechnique<br/>\n<br/>\nCinematography was very well done except one teeny tiny moment where <br/>\nI noted an unintentional wobble.  Color was spectacular.  Digital opening <br/>\nand closing is superb for a work with this budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoreography<br/>\nGREAT!  This is due to the fact that the cast has some experienced actors <br/>\non board and it really paid off.  You have to watch some of the movements <br/>\ncarefully because there are some good details in the fight scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory<br/>\nThe story may have been based on the Buddhist saying: When you meet <br/>\nthe Buddha, kill the Buddha (you can imagine the multitude of <br/>\ninterpretations for this, it is based on non-attachment and killing within <br/>\nyour mind, killing all sentiment towards someone psychologically--not <br/>\nnecessarily literally killing---although in the Lone Wolf and Cub comic there <br/>\nwas a more gross interpretation).  Anyways in this film there is a tie in <br/>\nwith the phrase but you need to replace the word Buddha with &quot;sensei&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe film&#39;s content was actually closer to 10 min and in that short amount <br/>\nof time there was a good narrative.  Honestly I&#39;ve seen MUCH WORST and <br/>\nso this film, IMHO, gets a solid &quot;A&quot;.  It&#39;s every manga fan&#39;s dream and yet <br/>\nit tries to kick up all the cliches we&#39;ve seen a hundred times a bit higher (in <br/>\na good way).  <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than opting for the &quot;supergirl&quot; angle, what you get is a gritty and <br/>\nraw work without going overboard with the &quot;stylized&quot; movements we see <br/>\nin modern j-popish samurai movies (such as the forgettable blood-fest <br/>\nAZUMI).  In fact it&#39;s better to watch a 10 min story which gets to the point, <br/>\nhas some elegant action rather than buy a dvd of AZUMI.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s my understanding that the filmmaker greatly condensed the entire <br/>\nscript due to lack of a budget (something from 10K to 5K) and yet he still <br/>\nmanaged to create something to be proud of. If it was the filmmaker&#39;s <br/>\nintent to demonstrate he can direct action (with one camera and a minimal <br/>\ncrew), then he certainly succeeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today, don&#39;t buy coffee and a pastry...just buy this movie and have your <br/>\npastry.  You&#39;ll be glad you did (AND) you&#39;ll be supporting an indy filmmaker <br/>\ntoo.</div>",
