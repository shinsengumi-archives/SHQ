Although not excited like before, several<br/>\n&gt; persons buy DVD. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Several people here are excited about that, and they<br/>\nare wondering if Toei will produce more Saint Seiya<br/>\nstuff. It was very popular here in the early 90&#39;s, so<br/>\npeople do still remember it.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Incidentally, there is an opinion that Serizawa Kamo<br/>\n&gt; (not you) had <br/>\n&gt; trouble with his syphilis, truly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have read this somewhere too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If syphilis advances, a patient&#39;s brain goes crazy<br/>\n&gt; and it becomes <br/>\n&gt; impossible for him to understand anything.<br/>\n&gt; Researchers explain that <br/>\n&gt; Serizawa drank alcohol and rioted in order to<br/>\n&gt; beguile the sick fear. <br/>\n&gt; The Japanese of that time was threatened by syphilis<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; tuberculosis. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And &quot;hashika&quot; and &quot;korori&quot;, right? ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is a short play performed there at the time of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;cosplay&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here the short play is optional.

Some people<br/>\nknow Sanosuke or Okita, but they are in a few number.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She said. &quot;The Shinsengumi member whom I got to know<br/>\n&gt; at the very <br/>\n&gt; beginning was also Saitou Hajime.&quot; ^^;;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t deny that I knew Shinsengumi first by reading RK<br/>\n^^;;; Only then I read &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; and &quot;Shinsengumi<br/>\nKeppuroku&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I remember I took years to understand what it<br/>\n&gt; meant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ^^;;;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Possibly, was Ikkyu-san broadcast even in Brazil?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it wasn&#39;t, although many old anime were broadcast<br/>\nhere ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Have you watched &quot;Jigoku no Koshien&quot;?

Some older people (20s and higher) do like<br/>\n&gt; tokusatsu too, ranging from Ultraman/Ultraseven to<br/>\n&gt; Changeman (including Magma Taishi!). There was<br/>\n&gt; recently a local anime con with the presence of four<br/>\n&gt; JAM Project members, Kageyama Hironobu, Okui Masami,<br/>\n&gt; Endo Masaaki and Sakamoto Eizo, and their show was a<br/>\n&gt; huge success (I am still a bit dizzy thanks to the<br/>\n&gt; show ^^;;;).

It is wonderful. <br/>\nIn Japan, it only introduced that there was Manga which became <br/>\norigin.

I am glad if they know it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are some hardcore Shinsengumi fans here as well.<br/>\n&gt; Just as a curiosity, the winning &quot;cosplay&quot; of one<br/>\n&gt; anime con in 2001 was about the Shinsengumi killing<br/>\n&gt; Battousai ^^;;; I really got surprised when I saw one<br/>\n&gt; person fighting with a spear and another one coughing<br/>\n&gt; up blood during the masquerade ^^;;;;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Harada and Okita!<br/>\nProbably, it was an interesting work to people who know Shinsengumi. <br/>\nIs a short play performed there at the time of &quot;cosplay&quot;? <br/>\nIn Japan, although much cosplayers gather at the time of comic <br/>\nmarket or other events, the short play is not performed. <br/>\nSince comic market is the place which sells doujinshi, cosplay is a <br/>\nsupporting player. I do not know about the event of only cosplay. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I agree ^^ That&#39;s very good, especially because the<br/>\n&gt; only other &quot;source&quot; of information on the Shinsengumi<br/>\n&gt; here was... the &quot;Gohatto&quot; movie... ^^;;;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Gohatto&quot; thinks that it was disreputable to the fans of <br/>\nShinsengumi. The angry person was also in my surroundings. <br/>\nI am interested in how you have recognized Shinsengumi on that <br/>\nmovie. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout RK, I sensed that it was very strange. <br/>\nWhen RK caused Shinsengumi boom, it differed from the former boom. <br/>\nAlthough the fans in novel or drama of the boom till then were <br/>\ncenters, RK called in the fans of manga or anime. <br/>\nAnd although Okita, Hijikata, and Kondou of the boom till then were <br/>\nthe leading roles, the leading role at that time was Saitou Hajime. <br/>\n<br/>\nI said to RK fan&#39;s friend. <br/>\n&quot;Although the Shinsengumi member most famous for Japan is Okita <br/>\nSouji, a Shinsengumi member famous for countries other than Japan is <br/>\nSaitou Hajime.&quot; <br/>\nAfter my friend thought for a while and understood the meaning, she <br/>\nlaughed. <br/>\nShe said. &quot;The Shinsengumi member whom I got to know at the very <br/>\nbeginning was also Saitou Hajime.&quot; ^^;;<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I remember I took years to understand what it meant<br/>\n&gt; ^^;;;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Possibly, was Ikkyu-san broadcast even in Brazil? ...sugoi desu.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And they will produce the sequel ^^;;; Obviously, as<br/>\n&gt; it is based on a manga, I didn&#39;t expect a jidaigeki or<br/>\n&gt; anyting similar ^^;;; Odagiri Joe reminded me of a<br/>\n&gt; character that appears in the first volumes of Burai,<br/>\n&gt; though. And they could have replaced Aya Ueto for a<br/>\n&gt; cute doll and it would have acted better than her<br/>\n&gt; ^^;;; Let us hope that her acting skills will improve<br/>\n&gt; for the sequel...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A sequel will be next year. It seems that Nomura Yujin (Hijikata of <br/>\nMibugishiden movie) appears on &quot;Azumi2&quot;. (I investigated and found <br/>\nhis information.) <br/>\n<br/>\nBurai....To be sure, that character also wore the white kimono. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you watched &quot;Jigoku no Koshien&quot;? Odagiri Joe<br/>\n&gt; appears in that work too, as Yakyu Jubee, if I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; mistaken ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the actor of &quot;Jigoku Koshien&quot; is not Odagiri. <br/>\nHe is an actor named Sakaguchi Taku.<br/>\nIt seems that he was appearing also on &quot;Azumi&quot; as three brothers&#39; <br/>\nmurderer. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShikashi Kamo san kuwashisugi desu.

But in Brazil, manga is a new kind of<br/>\nmedia and it is something very specific, so it is<br/>\nquite surprising and outstanding that it has sold that<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Although RK is a fiction, history of Japan is<br/>\n&gt; involved. <br/>\n&gt; And a color of Japan is a strong work. <br/>\n&gt; I think that it will be really serious to translate<br/>\n&gt; it as the people <br/>\n&gt; of a foreign country can understand it. <br/>\n&gt; However, I read that translators have translated the<br/>\n&gt; world of RK <br/>\n&gt; very in conscience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, in the Brazilian case, there was a lot of<br/>\nfootnotes, so that people would be able to at least<br/>\nhave an idea of the wordings, characters and concepts<br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the setting of the manga, there are many people<br/>\nwho have a keen interest in Japanese culture (just as<br/>\na curiosity, many people started practicing kendo<br/>\nafter reading RuroKen. Kinda like what Captain Tsubasa<br/>\ndid to Japanese soccer, methinks ^^), especially manga<br/>\nand anime. Some older people (20s and higher) do like<br/>\ntokusatsu too, ranging from Ultraman/Ultraseven to<br/>\nChangeman (including Magma Taishi!). There was<br/>\nrecently a local anime con with the presence of four<br/>\nJAM Project members, Kageyama Hironobu, Okui Masami,<br/>\nEndo Masaaki and Sakamoto Eizo, and their show was a<br/>\nhuge success (I am still a bit dizzy thanks to the<br/>\nshow ^^;;;). The artists themselves were quite<br/>\nimpressed, as their diaries show:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.makusonia.com/cgi-bin/diary/diary.cgi\">http://www.makusonia.com/cgi-bin/diary/diary.cgi</a><br/>\n(Okui Masami&#39;s diary)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mmjp.or.jp/birthday/kage/d/d_new.html\">http://www.mmjp.or.jp/birthday/kage/d/d_new.html</a><br/>\n(Kageyama Hironobu&#39;s diary)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess the interest in the Japanese culture was<br/>\none of the reasons why RuroKen was such a success<br/>\nhere. Obviously, there was also the artwork, the plot<br/>\nand the characters ^^<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is the page of the talk of Watsuki sensei also<br/>\n&gt; translated? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, all the character profiles and the free talks<br/>\nwere translated. I guess the same happened in other<br/>\ntranslations, like in French and in American English.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Translation is more difficult for that page than<br/>\n&gt; story. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For those who are not acquainted to Japanese history<br/>\nand Shinsengumi, it surely is. But the translator<br/>\nhandled the job ^^ Plenty of footnotes on the<br/>\nShinsengumi.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the first few volumes, there was even some<br/>\nextra material explaining things like Japanese<br/>\nhistory, basic Japanese swordsmanship (kendo) jargon<br/>\nand all, including a short essay on the &quot;Miburo&quot;<br/>\nmanga, starring Serizawa Kamo (no, not me, of course<br/>\n^^;;;) who was the model for Jin-eh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think that people who are not interested in<br/>\n&gt; Japanese history and <br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi do not understand the talk of the model<br/>\n&gt; of the character <br/>\n&gt; at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps, but on the other hand, I guess many people<br/>\nalso developed an interest in Japanese history and in<br/>\nShinsengumi thanks to those talks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have heard rumor that there is a fan of very deep<br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi, <br/>\n&gt; about France. <br/>\n&gt; (Since I cannot read French, I cannot confirm it.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps it&#39;s Tama-san ^.^ (just kidding!). But I&#39;m<br/>\nsure there are many Shinsengumi enthusiasts in France.<br/>\nThere are some hardcore Shinsengumi fans here as well.<br/>\nJust as a curiosity, the winning &quot;cosplay&quot; of one<br/>\nanime con in 2001 was about the Shinsengumi killing<br/>\nBattousai ^^;;; I really got surprised when I saw one<br/>\nperson fighting with a spear and another one coughing<br/>\nup blood during the masquerade ^^;;;;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For me, RK is only one of the eccentric Shonen<br/>\n&gt; Manga. <br/>\n&gt; However, it is very wonderful because this Manga is<br/>\n&gt; introducing <br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi to many countries. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree ^^ That&#39;s very good, especially because the<br/>\nonly other &quot;source&quot; of information on the Shinsengumi<br/>\nhere was... the &quot;Gohatto&quot; movie... ^^;;;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She had said that &quot;Ikkyusan&quot; was popular. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yamabushi: &quot;onushi wa doko ni mairareru&quot;<br/>\n(&quot;Where are you going to?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIkkyusan: &quot;kaze ni makasete mairu&quot;<br/>\n(&quot;I go where the wind blows&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYamabushi: &quot;kaze no nai toki wa&quot;<br/>\n(&quot;And if there is no wind?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIkkyusan (playing his shakuhachi): &quot;jibun de fuite<br/>\nmairu&quot; ^^<br/>\n(&quot;I will blow the wind that will take me&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember I took years to understand what it meant<br/>\n^^;;;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By the way, has the talk of &quot;Azumi&quot; movie already<br/>\n&gt; come out here? <br/>\n&gt; With this work, Odagiri Joe is playing the crazy<br/>\n&gt; swordsman. <br/>\n&gt; Since there was much action using a wire, to those<br/>\n&gt; who like a <br/>\n&gt; legitimate sword-play film, it was disreputable, but<br/>\n&gt; it was <br/>\n&gt; comparatively interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And they will produce the sequel ^^;;; Obviously, as<br/>\nit is based on a manga, I didn&#39;t expect a jidaigeki or<br/>\nanyting similar ^^;;; Odagiri Joe reminded me of a<br/>\ncharacter that appears in the first volumes of Burai,<br/>\nthough.

The<br/>\ntranslators were very careful and the Thai audience is very well<br/>\nacquainted with martial arts terminology borrowed from Chinese martial<br/>\narts.

So you have to draw an &quot;X&quot; on your cheek or show<br/>\na picture to the store clerk so they understand.  If you say Rurouni<br/>\nKenshin as the title they will not understand ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nSince many people are now starting to view martial arts films I would<br/>\nlike to recommend:<br/>\n&quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot; DVD directed by Kurosawa (judo, karate,and western<br/>\nboxing takes place in 1887 Yokohama)  I have always preferred<br/>\nKurosawa&#39;s earlier films over his later films such as Kagemusha or<br/>\nRan.  Sanshiro Sugata must be enjoyed over a couple of days at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A Touch of Zen&quot; directed by King Hu...the film was, like SWORD OF<br/>\nDOOM (I propose a new title the &quot;Psychopath Samurai&quot;), given the wrong<br/>\ntitle.  A Touch of Zen is actually a Chinese film so maybe they should<br/>\nhave called it &quot;A Touch of Ch&#39;an&quot; or something ^_^  This film takes<br/>\nplace in a totally different time period from that seen in Crouching<br/>\nTiger or Once Upon a Time in China or Iron Monkey...&quot;A Touch of Zen&quot;<br/>\ncontains wushu/kungfu action with little or no strings attached...the<br/>\nfilm does NOT go for the fairytale feeling as seen in Crouching Tiger<br/>\nso if you want that kind of action this is not for you. There is some<br/>\nstring work in a bamboo grove scene but I assure you no one walks on<br/>\nwater in this movie! Contains best man versus woman fight.  If the<br/>\nmovie was simply about a woman who kicks major *ss then I would not<br/>\nrecommend it (the martial arts genre if filled with strong female<br/>\ncharacters and an argument can be made that KILL BILL butchers the<br/>\nidea of a &quot;strong&quot; woman)...this film is MUCH more.  Banish the<br/>\nhorrible imported kungfu movies of the 70s with wild colors,<br/>\nincompetant dubbing and crazy Shaolin monks from your mind this film<br/>\nis at a whole different level. Amazing story, cinematography and<br/>\nacting makes it perhaps THE BEST martial arts movie to come out of<br/>\nChina.  But labelling it as simply an action film may be wrong as well<br/>\nbecause it deals with femininity (WITHOUT THE CROSS DRESSING!), the<br/>\nart of war, and ethics and morality.  This film contains elements such<br/>\nas the whole &quot;shining eyes&quot; (literally!!!), steady steady stare, and<br/>\nthe famous &quot;stare your opponents down&quot;.  In fact the heroine hardly<br/>\nblinks at times ^_^. The film was made in 1971 but can easily capture<br/>\nan audience in 2004...it was shown at a film festival in L.A. not too<br/>\nlong ago and dazzled the audience with its sophistication and class<br/>\nabsent in many martial arts films.   <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, Serizawa Kamo &lt;serizawakamo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; As for RuroKen popularity, I guess it is quite popular<br/>\n&gt; in the Phillipines and France, just to name other two<br/>\n&gt; countries where RuroKen was published and got popular.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Serizawa Kamo </span></blockquote></div>",

It&#39;s casual way of wearing kimono for men, called &quot;kinagashi &quot;style.<br/>\n<br/>\nA modern styel kinagashi page is bellow. Only difference with Edo period is <br/>\nunderwear, there is few person who wear fundoshi in this time, I think.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sawai/club2/r2nagasi.html\">http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sawai/club2/r2nagasi.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYukata is originally a kind of bath robe for nobility in Heian period.<br/>\nIt become populer in Edo period, and especially for townpeople( both men and <br/>\nwomen). They used to wear it for some occasion like festival or hanami ( <br/>\ncherry blossom viewing),however it considered too casual. For exemple,a wife or a <br/>\ndaughter of Samurai class did never wear yukata at least in public.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Saito and some PMK characters are dressed kinagashi style kimono.<br/>\nYou can notice in Jidaigeki (Japanese costume drama), some people wearing <br/>\nkinagashi style kimono. NHK Harada also appears frequently in kinagashi, but <br/>\ninconvenience of this style is, if you don&#39;t move properly, you are in danger of <br/>\nexpose your fundoshi.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn addition for NHK Hijikata fan,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhk-sc.or.jp/stera/index.html\">http://www.nhk-sc.or.jp/stera/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHave a nice chat.<br/>\n<br/>\nTama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
