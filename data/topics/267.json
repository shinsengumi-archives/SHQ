It turns out that the old man was none other than<br/>\n&gt; Saitou Hajime himself. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for whether this has anything to do with the real<br/>\n&gt; historical Saitou, I doubt it, but I was amused to<br/>\n&gt; find yet another reference to him in a manga or anime<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve read/seen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tatsuko<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Tiffany &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There was a post on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/patio/patio.cgi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The title of the post is &quot;Anecdote of Late Year?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is the babelfish translation...telling of an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; old Saito Hajime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appearing in an anime...(Usual warning about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; babelfish)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It meaning that name of Saito one appears in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kendo cartoon,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;sword of 634&quot;, it does.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As a story of former times, the alone boy being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kawahara, when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; practice kendo, the old person coming, you say that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; try doing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bamboo sword.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It was less crowded in the string and hung the can,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; practiced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; piercing, but aiming for that can, the old person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; extended the bamboo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sword.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But, the can does not move jerkily.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When the boy tries seeing, you say that the hole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; opened in the can.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You say that with the bamboo sword, the can was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carried out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That was Saito one of late year.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; With it meaning that the anecdote which is said is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; riding, it does,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but is this how probably what?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The ÂÂ¤ - the ÂÃ, you question, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; becomes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Penetrating the being less crowded can which was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hung to the string<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the bamboo sword how, being possible?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As an anecdote of Saito one, such a story it has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been effective?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; There was a reply to the post along the lines that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is uncertain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whether or not this story was associated with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; historical S.H.
