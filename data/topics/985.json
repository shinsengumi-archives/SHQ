The book is (gasp) very very very PRO &quot;GREAT SAIGO&quot;<br/>\nhowever I think the detail about the [police] fighting &quot;hand-to-hand<br/>\ncombat with swords and bayonets so vigorously that they fought with<br/>\nSatsuma samurai on an equal basis&quot; (Buck, viii) was used to add some<br/>\nsort of balance to both sides in the conflict.

Not only to both 1to5.net and www.3-hajime.com mention it, I just noticed that the new site with the info on all the Captains says he &quot;suffered a slight illness&quot;. I doubt it could have been anything too serious, because he took several days to go to this medical place about it and then he went straight back into action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat tummy-wrapper thing is in one of my books actually. I suggested that before, but I thought we decided that couldn&#39;t be it? Hm, it could still be that tenugui thing. Perhaps we have it all wrong? Don&#39;t let those clean fundoshi fool you!  It&#39;s not Harada&#39;s equipment you want to avoid, you want to steer clear of Saito&#39;s! LOL! Seriously though, please ask momoiro what the devil they mean!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to buy a translator that frankly works similar to Gist. That&#39;s the only way I can get some sites to come up, which is the only benefit. The Fish won&#39;t work for me most of the time and occasionally Gist won&#39;t either. I have to paste everything onto it, which can be a real pain. As far as doing zip files goes, I&#39;ve never tried to do that before and I have no idea where to start. You&#39;d have to give me a crash course, IF this computer will even co-operate. It can be a real PITA when it comes to zip files. I STILL haven&#39;t been able to retrieve that info about that Shogitai, either from here or your account. It tells me the format isn&#39;t recognized. <br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",

So far I&#39;ve come up with two new clues <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; have led me to a conclusion about what they mean. The first is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; fact that the word &quot;neck&quot; is not necessarily the correct <br/>\n </span></blockquote>translation. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; The evil goldfish also has a tendency to say &quot;neck&quot; when it&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>talking <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; about Kondo&#39;s beheading. So it could actually be talking about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; head, not his neck. The second thing I found was a reference to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a &quot;worktowel&quot; that people wore wrapped around their head to keep <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; sweat out of their eyes. It was in a book on the Edo period and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mentioned that people took these off in the presence of someone <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; higher rank. As I recall, in the Shin Kepp miniseries many of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; scenes that featured training in the dojo showed the Shinsengumi <br/>\n&gt; &gt; memebers wearing just such a towel on their head. So my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>conclusion is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; that this is in fact the &quot;towel&quot; that Saito never wore around <br/>\n&gt; &gt; his &quot;neck&quot; (or rather his head).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I found another reference to Saito being wounded at the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>battle of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Toba-Fushimi in the 1to5.net notes. He went to a medical place <br/>\n </span></blockquote>at the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Kando Izumi bridge on the 19th it says. The assumption made was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; it was for treatment of injures substained during the battle.

I note that the movie also <br/>\n </span></blockquote>had <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Saito referring to Kondo as a &quot;snob&quot;. This becomes VERY relevant <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; light of the info we just received about Kondo&#39;s attitude <br/>\n </span></blockquote>problem and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; the quarrel within the ranks because of it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -MissBehavin </span></blockquote></div>",

In modern<br/>\ntournments there are set time limits---but back then there were no<br/>\nstop watches?!?  The fact that the TMPD adopted a kendo ranking<br/>\nsystem, used till this very day in mainstream kendo, implies that<br/>\ntheir tournaments MUST have had modern restrictions.  Fujita Goro may<br/>\nnot have been able to land a decisive strike in the eyes of the<br/>\nreferee.  It seems that Fujita Goro&#39;s opponent was from a different<br/>\ndepartment/ward so perhaps the opponent&#39;s buddies weren&#39;t happy.  In a<br/>\nkendo book I read, the tournaments were also used to encourage<br/>\nvigorous training in the dept.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I have with Saitou being that severely injured at<br/>\nToba-Fushimi is...he walks with a very impairing limp which to me<br/>\nwould be far too dangerous to send a guy to the Seinan war with that<br/>\n&quot;handicap&quot; to begin with.  The newspaper article clearly narrates that<br/>\nhe was actually on the field with whatever battalion he was assigned to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wrapping a towel around the head/neck...I see you haven&#39;t &quot;let go&quot;<br/>\nof this detail either ^_^...I was thinking back to the film Bakumatsu<br/>\nMono....and the main character&#39;s stomache wound was aggravated by a<br/>\npractice session and he ends up wrapping a towel around his neck.  And<br/>\ndidn&#39;t someone say that guys did that to maintain their health or<br/>\nsomething?  I don&#39;t have my copy of Shinsengumi Kepp. with me but<br/>\ntowels called tenugui are wrapped around your head before you put on<br/>\nthe &quot;men&quot;/helmet for kenjutsu practice...but in this case you HAD to<br/>\nwrap the towel around your head (looks easy but it ain&#39;t trust<br/>\nme)...because the towel is supposed to prevent you from stinking up<br/>\nthe helmet.  I think after the guys take off the &quot;men&quot; they still kept<br/>\nthe towels around their head...some will even wipe their faces with it<br/>\n(eeeeeewwwwww). Hmmm so -wouldn&#39;t- he wrap a towel around his<br/>\nneck/head.  I think we have to ask momoiro about this question ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;warg3791&quot; &lt;Warg3791@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I just looked at the www.3-hajime.com site with a different <br/>\n&gt; translator and it offered a different interpretation of the first <br/>\n&gt; police kendo competition that Saito competed in.
