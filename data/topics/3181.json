Sorry for the inconvenience everyone, but I have to take <br/>\nmy orders from the programmer, she does the sophisticated stuff and <br/>\ndo the grunt work.  I have asked her to keep pages online but she has <br/>\na different work style etc etc<br/>\n<br/>\nThe painting is of Yamaguchi Jiro (we know him as SAitou Hajime).  <br/>\nYamaguchi Jiro led the Shinsengumi in the defense of Aizu.  Ofcourse <br/>\nHijikata Toshizo was the official leader, however due to a foot <br/>\ninjury Yamaguchi had to step up and take charge.  Later on after <br/>\nHijikata and many SHinsengumi had to depart, Yamaguchi Jiro and a <br/>\nhandful of Shinsengumi stayed behind.  Nakajima Nobori mentioned on <br/>\nthe painting that Yamaguchi Jiro had DIED in Aizu---this is ofcourse <br/>\ninnaccurate (^_^).  You see &quot;Yama&quot; (mountain) on his jacket.  <br/>\nYamaguchi Jiro later changes his name to Fujita Goro (his last name)<br/>\n<br/>\nNakajima Nobori&#39;s art is also now a tattoo!<br/>\nCHECK IT OUT here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.html\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lokieternal1&quot; &lt;lokieternal1@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I created a file in photoes and added the pic I was talking about if<br/>\n&gt; anyone has the time or inclanation.
