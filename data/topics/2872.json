Or you can go through and simplify the <br/>\ntext currently online<br/>\n<br/>\ncurrently the page is a bunch of notes, please skim it to get an idea <br/>\nof what we have already and see if you can make it easier to understand<br/>\nanyone who wants to volunteer can email me at secretarytocapt3(a)<br/>\nhotmail.com and I&#39;ll give you the html files to work on<br/>\n<br/>\nI used other sources to get an idea of what the Eagle/Kaiten/Kuaiten <br/>\nhad planned for the Stonewall---Hijikata was on this ship as an <br/>\nobserver<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to note that when you get as many sources as possible <br/>\nand place them side by side you do find considerable differences <br/>\n(this is why I said book A may say something different from book B and <br/>\nwhy it is necessary to put everything together for comparative <br/>\npurposes)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Banryu and Takao would draw up alongside the anchored Stonewall <br/>\nJackson.  Their troops would storm the ironclad with their swords <br/>\ndrawn and before the enemy troops had a chance to defend themselves, <br/>\ncapture the ship and crew...That *grand *plan *failed *miserably was <br/>\non account of rough seas and mechanical failures--cruel fate so <br/>\ninseperably intertwinved with that relentless Sun Goddess.&quot;  <br/>\n(HILLSBOROUGH~ Shinsengumi 172) whenever possible he mentions the sun <br/>\ngoddess (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nvs<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;THE SHINSENGUMI APPEAR ON THE EAGLE&quot; see to get varied accounts and <br/>\nwhy details were varied <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Hakodate.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Hakodate.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nwhere the tone in other accounts were surprised how the <br/>\nKaiten/Eagle/Kuaiten was close to pulling off a major victory ~ <br/>\nbrilliantly with the use of the American flag---other narratives also <br/>\nmentioned that Nomura (of the Shinsengumi) was not shot---but killed <br/>\nwith a pike onboard<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Stonewall *was taken completely by surprise by the Eagle, and from <br/>\nthe accounts on the page you will note how the Stonewall was pretty <br/>\nineffective overall in defending herself in the well timed ambush<br/>\n<br/>\nHillsborough also mentioned the issue of neutrality in regards to the <br/>\nStonewall---however he fell short of stating the truth of the matter:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Imperialists STOLE it from the Shogunate---the ship was paid with <br/>\nShogunate money after all...
