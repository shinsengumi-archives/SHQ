Because it is a very short <br/>\nperiod form  January to September and because I do not know what <br/>\nGOYOOGAKARI means in  relation to sergeant...this part is confusing <br/>\nsergeant in the army or police?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he was fired.  Maybe, I should have used the word <br/>\n&quot;discarged&quot;? First, I looked up dictionary, and Goroo means to <br/>\narrest criminals or the position to arrest criminals.  So, the job <br/>\nhas something to do &quot;sergeant,&quot; and to be a sergeant from <br/>\nGoyoogakari seems to be promotion.  Since Saitoo <br/>\nHajime was appointed to be a sergeant just 2 months after his <br/>\ndischarge from Goyoogakari, it seems that he quit Goyoogakari for <br/>\nthe promotion to be a sergeant. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[QUESTION]About the adoption of the third son is something my <br/>\nfriends are interested in because adoption was so common and the son <br/>\nwas related Tokio...why should it be a secret?  It is strange.  <br/>\nThere is no reason to keep adoption secret in Japanese culture?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In Japanese culture, it is very common to make adoption secret.  One <br/>\nof the reason is we think the blood boundary is extremely <br/>\nimportant.  The idea was much stronger in old times.<br/>\nMaybe, there is an idea that if the child knows he is not real child <br/>\nof his parents, the family cannot keep their solidarity.  Also, we <br/>\nhave respected the blood or genealogy.  Still now, adoption is not <br/>\ncommon like the U.S. and some people want to make it secret in Japan.<br/>\nIt is interesting, I&#39;ve never thought about it...<br/>\n<br/>\n[QUESTION] Also Tokio was like a dorm inspector at the school.  So <br/>\nthe school had a dormitory for students but in the translation it is <br/>\nmentioned that students can stay at her home too or just to visit <br/>\nher home?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt means that Tokio let some students live at her house.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow the system of dorm at that time, but I think not everybody had <br/>\nto live in dorm.<br/>\n<br/>\n[secretarytocapt3 thinks]  Poor inspector Fujita, after a long hard <br/>\nday at work catching criminal scum, writing reports he had to come <br/>\nhome to a house full of....girls LOL!</div>",
