It was the woman as <br/>\nwhom the touch Japanese style Audrey Hepburn ? acted valiantly. Did <br/>\nit seem to be being wise and the advanced one? Mr. Saito -- the <br/>\nEmpress -- a dress figure [ like ] -- admiring -- the time -- the <br/>\ntail -- &quot;-- make it Western style of dress -- is it having said in &quot; <br/>\netc. (*^_^*) . <br/>\nÅÍB<br/>\nthen<br/>\n<br/>\nok so we know maybe he saw her 2-3 days before an important event of <br/>\nsome sort.  Menion of &quot;the time the tail&quot; which is, usually, nifty&#39;s <br/>\nway of saying TOKIO.  This person probably wonders if she wore <br/>\nWestern wear?  But I HIGHLY DOUBT IT because I think older women <br/>\nrarely chose to do so.  Only the new generation, Emperor Meiji&#39;s <br/>\nQueen and what I call the Yamakawa/Oyama Sutematsu Generation <br/>\n(Rokumeikan circle) would have given western fashion a chance.  <br/>\nRemember, those dresses were not comfortable.  Ofcourse all this <br/>\ninfo could be totally wrong if for some reason there was some kind <br/>\nof confusion between &quot;which&quot; Empress?  emperor Meiji&#39;s mother [or] <br/>\nhis wife the queen who was considered by many to be a very <br/>\nprogressive woman. <br/>\n <br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\noff-topic...there seems to be a steroid controversy in the world of <br/>\nbaseball right now...so I was thinking<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would PMK Harada think of all this?<br/>\n<br/>\nPMK Harada &quot;Steroids???? HA!&quot; (rips off shirt)<br/>\n&quot;check out these abs---100% Harada!  Harada never uses steroids!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand that is an example of how my mind works</div>",
