At any rate, as the <br/>\nsouthwesterners were coming up into northern Japan, the Crow Unit was <br/>\nactive, and while I have yet to prove this, they were probably escorts for <br/>\nHijikata and his men, when they boarded Enomoto&#39;s ships at Sabusawa-jima in <br/>\nMatsushima Bay.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir banner was a flying black crow on a white background-- and Hosoya&#39;s <br/>\njinbaori (armor surcoat) was black, with a black yatagarasu (mythical <br/>\nthree-legged crow) on a red circle on the back.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",
