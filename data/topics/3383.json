We know<br/>\nHijikata is mentioned in Jules Brunet&#39;s writing (in French) but are<br/>\nthe docs in the vid---RUSSIAN???  It would be interesting.  We have to<br/>\nremember that the north (Hokkaido) was of special interest to the<br/>\nRussians.  I saw some art out of that era where the Russian bear and<br/>\nother western powers were watching over the naval battles in the north.</div>",
