            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1936200888\">That whole thing about how neat Saito was reminds me of the horror stories of women who were married to career military men. Especially those who lived on the bases where the higher ups themselves would come around and inspect the housing of it&#39;s personnel. Anyway, it&#39;s a common complaint that the husbands become so used to the order and discipline of the military that when they come home they actually give their houses the &quot;white glove&quot; inspection.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you imagine Saito doing that to Tokio?!<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",

But, his own house and before and the<br/>\nlike inside the companion who temper can know, relaxing, it is tend to<br/>\ndo such behavior, but the person, Saito one, such regarding to the<br/>\nplace where it relaxes, never did not do such behavior, in other<br/>\nwords, that much Saito one is the manifestation of the thing that it<br/>\nwas &quot;the fold correct&quot; person. Perhaps, as for without doing such<br/>\nbehavior for Saito one, extremely being natural, it is not to be<br/>\nonly-too-natural thing, probably will be? The kind of answering which<br/>\nraises to excessive part is not possible, there is no excuse. Then,<br/>\nthe impoliteness it does.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, folding your legs when you sit in public, or wrapping a<br/>\ntowel around one&#39;s neck when you are &quot;sweating&quot; (?) is rude in<br/>\npublic(?)...but ofcourse you can &quot;kick back&quot; or &quot;relax&quot; at home...but<br/>\neven at home Saitou didn&#39;t do these things...he is like a &quot;fold<br/>\ncorrect&quot; person (VERY VERY proper)...being proper and neat is natural<br/>\nto Saitou it seems but perhaps not &quot;natural&quot; to most<br/>\npeople...(strangely there is an equivalent phrase in Thai which goes<br/>\nlike this &quot;like a folded clothe&quot; which means proper/neat usually<br/>\nassociated with women---women who are sooooo well mannered they don&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;move&quot;).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was skimming some stuff on the French Police and some of the things<br/>\nthe TMPD adopted and alot of emphasis is placed on the appearance of<br/>\nofficers...they have to consistently appear neat and impeccably<br/>\nclean...so I&#39;m wondering if Saitou became increasingly &quot;proper&quot; as he<br/>\naged...we are talking about Mr. Drinking Contest here. LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also thinking about the &quot;eyes from which light shone&quot;<br/>\nphrase...and it hit me...there is also an equivalent Thai phrase for<br/>\nthis too (all of this is very interesting to me---can you tell?<br/>\nLOL!)...because in Thai there is a phrase &quot;you have eyes but you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a shine(to your eyes)&quot; which means you have a pair of eyes but<br/>\nyou don&#39;t know how to &quot;use&quot; them (in other words your vision is<br/>\n&quot;dull&quot;) and &quot;you have a shine (to your eyes)&quot; which means insight into<br/>\nappraising things or a natural talent.<br/>\n&quot;Shine&quot; in both phrases can only be used in connection to eyes and not<br/>\nanything else.</div>",
