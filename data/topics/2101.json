            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-775266418\">For those of you who haven&#39;t checked you Shinsengumi calender lately, <br/>\nthe anniversary of Toba-Fushimi is coming up this Thursday, Jan 27. <br/>\nThis would be Jan. 3 by the lunar calendar that was in place at the <br/>\ntime. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I recall, what little info we have about the Shinsengumi&#39;s <br/>\ninvolvement places them in Fushimi during the battle. Captain Inoue <br/>\nGenzaburo (one of the original Shieikan members of the group and <br/>\nsupposedly close friend of both Kondo and Hijikata) was shot and <br/>\nkilled during the battle. I&#39;ve read that he followed Hijikata&#39;s <br/>\norders without being daunted during the fighting. Also killed was <br/>\nYamazaki Susumu. Injured earlier, he could not swim to safety when <br/>\nhis boat sank during the retreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the battle, Hijikata tried to charge the Satsuma guns and was <br/>\nforced back. He said afterwards that the &quot;age of the sword and spear <br/>\nhad already passed&quot;. (He was leading this fight because Kondo had <br/>\nrecently been injured in an attempt on his life by the remaining <br/>\nmembers of Ito&#39;s group.) Nagakura and Saito fought at the rear during <br/>\nthe retreat. Saito must have taken a small injury of some sort, since <br/>\nhe went for medical treatment a few days afterwards. It was also at <br/>\nthis time that Shimada Kai had to help Nagakura over an earthen bank <br/>\nor fence he could not get over alone. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing info on the battle from Mark Ravina&#39;s The Last Samurai-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fight began in the evening when Satsuma opened it&#39;s cannons up on <br/>\nthe Bakufu forces at Toba. Satsuma had 900 men there facing the <br/>\nTokugawa&#39;s 2,500 men. At Fushimi, the Bakufu forces had some 3,000 <br/>\ntroops (including Aizu and Shinsengumi) against 500 Satsuma, 725 <br/>\nChoshu, and 200 Tosa. The Bakufu forces were not only larger, but <br/>\nthey had some of the best trained troops in Japan. (The shogun&#39;s <br/>\nFrench-trained infantry for instance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn at least two occassions, Aizu troops rushed the Satsuma and Choshu <br/>\ntroops and forced them to flee despite their inferior weapons. <br/>\nHowever, there were many problems that undermined the Bakufu&#39;s <br/>\nefforts: No real leadership and no particular strategy, troops always <br/>\nin the wrong places at the wrong time, poor morale, and failure of <br/>\nreinforcements to deploy when ordered among other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest blows came at the end, when it became clear the <br/>\nBakufu could lose. Tsu domain&#39;s artillery forces, during a critical <br/>\nengagement on 1/6 (1/30), switched sides. Instead of shelling <br/>\napproaching imperial troops, they began attacking Aizu forces. <br/>\nYoshinobu flees Osaka for Edo upon recieving the news, realizing the <br/>\nbattle is lost.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissB</div>",
