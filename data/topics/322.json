Intuition?<br/>\nBoth?  <br/>\nWhat I found to be very difficult in kendo is to look at the<br/>\nopponent&#39;s entire body while not focusing on just one spothis/her<br/>\neyes (through the metal face guard), hands, feet etc even though many<br/>\nof us in the club are hardly executing the basic strikes correctly,<br/>\nthe instructors are always telling us to keep our eyes on the<br/>\nopponent&#39;s entire frame (many such as myself keep checking on my own<br/>\nwrist etc etc).  This is similar to drivingjust try to get a wide<br/>\nfield of vision without losing focus on anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) &quot; Gettan passed away peacefully while deep in meditation, his<br/>\nrosary in his left hand, his hossu (Zen Master&#39;s whisk)  in his<br/>\nright.&quot; Remember how hist. S.H. died?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) &quot; Famous techniques of Mugairyu include the upward cut from the<br/>\ndraw (gyaku-kesagiri), the horizontal cut across the heart<br/>\n(yoko-ichimonji) and DEEP THRUSTS (TSUKI) MADE WHILE SUPPORTING THE<br/>\nBACK OF THE BLADE WITH ONE HAND. Mugairyu students master the twenty<br/>\nbasic kata of the style, and then go on to learn deeper and secret<br/>\nkata, including kumitachi (two-person forms) with both the long and<br/>\nshort swords.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo from reading other books own martial arts I realized that<br/>\npractitioners, especially during that time period not only studied the<br/>\nart/science of combat but its spiritual dimension AND became very much<br/>\nacquainted with its &quot;lore&quot; the stories of the founders and previous<br/>\nstudents are always handed downif indeed S.H. was part of Mugai Ryu<br/>\nthen he was more than aware of these stories. <br/>\n<br/>\nSekiguchi Shin Shin Ryu Jujutsu (bare handed technique)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bushinjuku.com/arts/bushinarts/sgrjj/sekiguchijj.htm\">http://www.bushinjuku.com/arts/bushinarts/sgrjj/sekiguchijj.htm</a><br/>\nJust pretty cool to read how it was associated with the Tokugawas..<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p199.ezboard.com/fsamuraibujutsufrm36.showMessage?topicID=8.topic\">http://p199.ezboard.com/fsamuraibujutsufrm36.showMessage?topicID=8.topic</a><br/>\n&quot;Sekiguchi Ryu was a favored martial arts system of the Tokugawa<br/>\nShogunate.&quot;<br/>\nYes we all know the Tokugawas favored Yagyu Shinkage ryu (messed up<br/>\nspelling) but this lineage was also highly favored as well<br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least one of the sword lineages S.H. practiced grouped<br/>\nits katas into sets of 5Go in Goro?<br/>\nOkay I&#39;m being stupid againmany lineages have their own ways to group<br/>\nkatas and I&#39;m sure it changesjust lost control there with the<br/>\nspeculating:D<br/>\n<br/>\nI added all the  links at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm22.showMessage?topicID=2=\">http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm22.showMessage?topicID=2=</a>\r<br/>\n.topic<br/>\nthe links all deal with many of the lineages S.H. supposedly<br/>\nstudied/practiced...<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\nI also added links to Barbara/Masayoshi&#39;s humor updates at SHQ</div>",
