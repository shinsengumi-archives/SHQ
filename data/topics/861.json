When they say style of text I wonder if they <br/>\nmean the kanji itself or do they mean in the general way sentences are <br/>\nconstructed etc? Sort of comparing  an English language book from the <br/>\n1800s to one written recently. They&#39;re the same in terms of language yet <br/>\nvery different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;[The Last Samurai]<br/>\n&gt;I was surprised very much by TLS.

Therefore, there are many old fans. <br/>\n&gt;The actor who played Hijikata with this work is playing the elder <br/>\n&gt;brother of Hijikata&#39;s blindness in the Taiga drama.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, Miss B and I are squealing with major delight about now as we have <br/>\ndeveloped a major fangirl crush on Murakami Hiroaki..  I saw him in the <br/>\nNHK series, thought he had an excellent screen presence compared with <br/>\nthe younger actors playing Hijikata and Kondou  but of course hadn&#39;t a <br/>\nclue as to who he was at the time since I&#39;ve only just seen S.K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; About Satou Kouichi (KOICHI SATO)<br/>\n&gt;Have you seen the movie of Shinsengumi in which Mifune Toshirou <br/>\n&gt;performed Kondou Isami? <br/>\n&gt;The actor (Mikuni Rentarou) who is performing Serizawa Kamo with <br/>\n&gt;that work is Satou&#39;s father. <br/>\n&gt;Mikuni is an actor very famous for Japan. And Serizawa which he <br/>\n&gt;performed is also famous. <br/>\n&gt;Therefore, Satou desired to perform Serizawa. &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As SHQ&#39;s resident  Koichi Sato groupie I really appreciate this <br/>\ninformation.  The movie mentioned would be Band Of Assassins, right?  <br/>\nThat&#39;s finally worked it&#39;s way to the  top of my must get  list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Japanese film buffs will recall that Rentaro Mikuni starred in such <br/>\n&gt;classics as BURMESE HARP, Harakiri/Seppuku, KAIDAN and more]<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And just when I thought my &quot;to track down&quot; list had reached an end.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if there&#39;s any aspect of American or western history that <br/>\nMomoiro-Usagi is interested in. I&#39;m sure there are many of us who would <br/>\nlove to repay the favor  of tracking down information  they can&#39;t easily <br/>\nfind in Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBarbara Sheridan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barbarasheridan.net\">http://www.barbarasheridan.net</a></div>",

However, for most Japanese, he <br/>\nis obscurity.<br/>\nI got to know him with the book which I read by chance at the time <br/>\nof a high school student. <br/>\nI thought that it was a very merciless talk. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn Japan, the style of a text has changed to Meiji Era considerably. <br/>\nFurthermore, the text style has changed also after WW2. <br/>\nJapanese people cannot read the text of the Edo period in many <br/>\ncases, either. Please do your best, although I think that there are <br/>\nmany Japanese sites which cannot be translated.<br/>\n <br/>\n[mentioned Romulus Hillsborough&#39;s previous work and future book on <br/>\nthe Shinsengumi]<br/>\nI read a part of the site. <br/>\nIs &quot;RYOMA-Life of a Renaissance Samurai&quot; a novel? <br/>\nIt seems to be interesting as long as I look at a reviews. <br/>\nIs it Shinsengumi which assassinated Ryoma with this book? The <br/>\nreview has said it. <br/>\nThe culprit who assassinated Ryoma is still unknown. <br/>\nSurely, there is an opinion which makes Shinsengumi a culprit. <br/>\nHowever, opinion that Sasaki Tadasaburou of Mimawarigumi <br/>\nassassinated is leading now. But this is testimony of the friend who <br/>\nwas Mimawarigumi, after Sasaki dies. This testimony has many opaque <br/>\nportions and Saigou Takamori is related. Therefore, there is an <br/>\nopinion of a true culprit in Saigou. The fact does not clarify <br/>\n<br/>\n[The Last Samurai]<br/>\nI was surprised very much by TLS. I think that many Japanese were <br/>\nsurprised. TLS was wonderful Jidaigeki although there were many <br/>\nmistakes and strange scenes. Can the present Japanese movie make the <br/>\nmovie which tells Bushido as wonderfully as TLS? <br/>\nIt cannot reply to me. &quot;Twilight Samurai&quot; was a long run in Japan. <br/>\nHowever, I do not so like it. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Jin Roh:The Wolf Brigade]<br/>\nThe work of Oshii Mamoru with what I looked at is only &quot;Jin-Roh&quot;. <br/>\nWhat kind of image do Americans have in wolf? <br/>\nIn Japan, there is the image &quot;loneliness&quot;, &quot;the strongest animal&quot;, <br/>\nand &quot;the ruined animal&quot; .<br/>\nA long time ago, wolfs was in Japan. They were the strongest animals <br/>\nin this island country. <br/>\nThey did not build a group but it liked acting alone. They were <br/>\nruined by man after all. <br/>\nI think that various images are mixed to &quot;Jin-roh&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\n[Hiroshi Kurogane&#39;s Shinsengumi book and the animated film directed <br/>\nby Kon Ichikawa]<br/>\nDVD is not released. <br/>\nThe work makes Manga of Kurogane Hiroshi the original. <br/>\nI have read Manga. <br/>\nThe fan who wants to see handsome Hijikata and handsome Okita seldom <br/>\nreads. However, among the favorite fans of a historical fact, it is <br/>\na popular work. <br/>\n <br/>\nManga of Shinsengumi is planned and announced by some magazines this <br/>\nyear. <br/>\nSome are likely to become a long series although many are short <br/>\nstories. <br/>\nThe day when you read these works may come. <br/>\nIncidentally, manga which I like is this. <br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youngsunday.com/rensai/comics/getsumei.html\">http://www.youngsunday.com/rensai/comics/getsumei.html</a><br/>\n <br/>\nGetsumeiseiki -sayonara Shinsengumi-<br/>\n <br/>\nThis manga is good at depiction of the scene using a sword. <br/>\nNow, only two volumes are put on the market. <br/>\nI think that a series should just continue for a long time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the old &quot;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&quot;, DVD will be released in July <br/>\nand afterwards. <br/>\nThis work built the foundation of the present Shinsengumi <br/>\npopularity. Therefore, there are many old fans. <br/>\nThe actor who played Hijikata with this work is playing the elder <br/>\nbrother of Hijikata&#39;s blindness in the Taiga drama. <br/>\n(In fact, Hijikata had the elder brother of the blindness on 24 <br/>\nyears old.) <br/>\nI saw &quot;Die a Samurai&quot; (Shinsengumi shimatsuki), &quot;TABOO&quot; (Gohatto), <br/>\nand  &quot;Mibugishiden movie&quot; .<br/>\nAlthough &quot;TABOO&quot; was disrepute at the fan of Shinsengumi, it was <br/>\npopular to other people. (Kondou and Hijikata age too much.) <br/>\nThis movie is created based on two pieces of short tales <br/>\nin &quot;Shinsengumi keppuroku&quot; which Shiba Ryoutarou wrote. <br/>\nAlthough this movie is a fiction, it is the truth that there was a <br/>\ndisturbance of homosexuality in Shinsengumi. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mibugishiden&quot; also has TV drama besides a movie. <br/>\nWatanabe Ken was performing Yoshimura Kanichirou. <br/>\nAlthough it is a good work, Saitou of Satou Kouichi or Odagiri Joe <br/>\n(The actor of Taiga drama) cannot be recommended to a favorite <br/>\nperson. <br/>\nFrightful Saitou is appearing. (Do you know Takenaka Naoto?)<br/>\n<br/>\n[momoiro is referring the actor from SHALL WE DANCE...the funny guy <br/>\nnot Koji Yakusho]<br/>\n <br/>\nAbout Satou Kouichi (KOICHI SATO)<br/>\nHave you seen the movie of Shinsengumi in which Mifune Toshirou <br/>\nperformed Kondou Isami? <br/>\nThe actor (Mikuni Rentarou) who is performing Serizawa Kamo with <br/>\nthat work is Satou&#39;s father. <br/>\nMikuni is an actor very famous for Japan. And Serizawa which he <br/>\nperformed is also famous. <br/>\nTherefore, Satou desired to perform Serizawa. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Japanese film buffs will recall that Rentaro Mikuni starred in such <br/>\nclassics as BURMESE HARP, Harakiri/Seppuku, KAIDAN and more]<br/>\n<br/>\n***Rentarou Mikuni is Koichi Sato&#39;s father...cool...</div>",
