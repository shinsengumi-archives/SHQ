Japanese Culture in the Meiji Era Volume 4: Manners and Customs<br/>\nPublished by The Toyo Bunko (The Oriental Libraly)  [sic]<br/>\nHonkomagone 2-chome, 28-21, Bunkyo-ku<br/>\nTokyo, Japan<br/>\nFirst Impression 1957<br/>\nReprint Edition 1969<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In general the idea underlying such customs was,... that the near relatives become for a time special companions of the dead.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs night is the domain of spirits, this makes sense to have night burials.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso considering that the bodies were considered unclean and there were numerous taboos associated with funerals, wakes, burials -- there may have been many pragmatic reasons for night burials.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the lantern -&gt; I&#39;d probably analogize this to the mention of fire, which is described as follows (pg 190).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In some place a fire was built at the house when the casket was being carried out, while in others the leader of the funeral processions or other members thereof carried a flame, and in still others a fire was started at the burial ground before or after interment.  The reasons varied.  Dependent on the locality, the fire served to guide the way, to fend off devils, to purify the surroundings, to light the funeral pyre, to burn trash, to keep people warm, or to accomplish some combination of these purposes, but in any case fire seems to have been a normal accompaniment to the funeral.  A number of dialectical terms suggested that it symbolized the presence of the fire deity.  &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Bodies were usually buried at night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn more modern times funerals are held during the day but the lantern <br/>\nis still present to reflect on this old belief.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen many Chinese films dealing with night burials but the <br/>\nreasoning may not be the same.  Even today in Chinese burials there <br/>\nare lanterns all over the place at the service.<br/>\n<br/>\nmore on death<br/>\nThere are a couple versions of Toshiyoshi Kawaji&#39;s death.  But he <br/>\nisn&#39;t the only one, many important people will have different days on <br/>\nwhich they supposedly &quot;died&quot;.  He died on the way home, OR he died 5 <br/>\ndays after he got home.  Dr. Baelz in his diary mentions during his <br/>\ntreatment of a government official that the family was 100% prepared <br/>\nfor a funeral and they announced that their beloved was DEAD even <br/>\nthough the good doctor said that the man was in a coma state and NOT <br/>\nDEAD.  Simply, deaths are announced when families are PREPARED.  <br/>\nThere are more examples going farther back in history as well.  Even <br/>\nin the early 20th century and Empress, I can&#39;t remember which one, <br/>\npassed away while on vacation but she was treated as alive during her <br/>\ntrip back home.  Once the body was in the palace...THEN her death was <br/>\nmade public.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you want more morbid stuff....I read plenty on cremations and how <br/>\nbodies are prepared........</div>",
