(Not asking you directly, SK, but anyone who knows.)  I think I&#39;m becoming hung up on this idea that maybe he & Suzuki associated with each other in Kyoto (it&#39;s the drinking thing, which I could still be misinterpreting from the babelfish translation) and could&#39;ve been a reason why Saitou seems to have been accepted so readily within Itou&#39;s group.  Not that they necessarily would&#39;ve questioned *anyone&#39;s* decision to leave, even with Saitou&#39;s loyalty to Hijikata, since I get a sense that Itou left on somewhat &quot;friendly?&quot; terms with Kondou and there were plenty of defections, but it just still seems so strange no one suspected Saitou.  And, of course, Saitou could&#39;ve used any one of a number of excuses to explain why he would want to exit the Shinsengumi.  But still...<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He tried many things to exact revenge upon the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Shinsengumi, but he found himself in the new era<br/>\nwithout fulfilling his wishes.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nRK fanfic fodder if I ever saw it!!!  ;-D  Just when I thought SaiSa couldn&#39;t get any more &quot;angstier&quot; than it already is...  I&#39;ve already made the decision to make Suzuki part of my story &quot;Yasou,&quot; but I haven&#39;t quite decided how yet.  I&#39;m also not sure I&#39;m capable of doing justice to a confrontation between Saitou and Suzuki... so much potential emotional power even *without* considering Sano&#39;s friendship towards both men.  Suzuki has so much more reason to hate Saitou and want his blood than Kenshin ever had.<br/>\n <br/>\nSK (or anyone), if you have any more information on why Itou left, what his arguments with Kondou were, I&#39;d love to know for scholarly and writerly reasons.  With many thanks in advance.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;That&#39;s more or less what the fishy part says...&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snort&gt;  the fishy part...  Great line, SK!<br/>\n <br/>\nSK or Masayoshi, sometime could you give us the rest of the story from that site, the info on him before he joined the Shinsengumi?  So much reference to private schools, the family, and what sounds like his adoption into another family...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (time to start frying up some fish and making some kind of meal out of it)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Cosmos/4774/page015.html\">http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Cosmos/4774/page015.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!

Is restoration referring to finding a direction in life<br/>\nagain (by finding a place in the police) OR are they saying that after<br/>\nfailing in his attempt at vengeance against the Shinsengumi, he was<br/>\nreconciled to be able to accept possibly working with other former<br/>\nShinsengumi members who had also become police (though I can&#39;t EVER<br/>\nsee him being able to stomach Saitou, which may have been an<br/>\ninteresting dilemma for Kawaji)?

In new selection group vengeance you had run about, but without being able to carry out it received the restoration, was Meiji and became the policeman, Tsuruoka chief of police era threw the private funds to hospital construction.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nClear enough that he fought at Toba-Fushimi and then went to the Sekihoutai to become second patrol captain, and that when all was said and done, he became a policeman (oh, I just **LOVE** the fanfic possibilities there... I may drop all other stories in progress for a while to focus on what could happen with that scenario... poor Sanosuke!!) during the Meiji and donated money for hospital construction (was his family wealthy or was he just donating from his salary? I&#39;ve never heard anything about what his and Itou&#39;s background was).  To jump ahead a little in the quote, are they saying he became the Chief of Police for some place called Tsuruoka?<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, but that second sentence throws me completely.  Well, actually, first of all --- uh, how did he survive the massacre of the Sekihoutai????  I wonder if it was just Sagara, as founder of the Sekihoutai, who was prosecuted and executed and Watsuki destroyed them all for literary effect.  Argh... the need to *know* is going to kill me!!  But this:  &quot;In new selection group vengeance you had run about, but without being able to carry out it received the restoration&quot; --- any clues anyone??  Is restoration referring to finding a direction in life again (by finding a place in the police) OR are they saying that after failing in his attempt at vengeance against the Shinsengumi, he was reconciled to be able to accept possibly working with other former Shinsengumi members who had also become police (though I can&#39;t EVER see him being able to stomach Saitou, which may have been an interesting dilemma for Kawaji)?  Or a combination of both concepts maybe?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, I know the time is referred to as Restoration, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what was meant here.  Maybe it is referring to that (&quot;received the restoration, was Meiji&quot;), but even that doesn&#39;t help, especially regarding his stint in the Sekihoutai.  Maybe it means that he was aimless after the assassination of his brother, found a cause by fighting at Toba-Fushimi and joining the Sekihoutai, then after the Sekihoutai debacle he was reconciled to the Meiji Restoration (i.e. they &quot;forgave&quot; him being Sekihoutai like they &quot;forgave&quot; former Shinsengumi and Aizu samurai and accepted them into the police force)?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;After that rest of life you sent with Ishioka of the hometown and 1919, lived to 83 years old.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, so he dies in 1919 at age 83 (wahoo!!!  Now I know... he&#39;s older than Sagara, who was born in 1839).  But what is &quot;sent with Ishioka of the hometown&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nMasayoshi and Serizawa Kamo, could one of you **PLEASE** look at it and straighten some of this out?  We have so little info on Suzuki... he deserves a little bit of TLC in the face of all the attention so many other captains get.  :-D  This humble Sekihoutai fan would love to know more, too.<br/>\nphil (whose mind is now running like it&#39;s on speed!
