And the awardwinning book they talked about<br/>\nin the next paragraph sounds pretty awesome:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Her award-winning work, &quot;Hyosa no Utau,&quot; is a sophisticated historical<br/>\nnovel depicting a pathetic former samurai who induces customers in a<br/>\nred-light district in Tokyo&#39;s downtown Nezu after finding himself unable to<br/>\ncatch up with the tide of the Meiji Restoration.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s not to love about a down on his luck samurai rounding up customers<br/>\nfor the local house of ill repute. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all literary and not what<br/>\nI&#39;d really like to see but the premise is cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Barbara Sheridan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
