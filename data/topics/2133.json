Sherlgirl I will download it and read it.<br/>\nYes, the koban system is very unique but it seems, according to the <br/>\ntexts I have read, to be undergoing major changes in terms of its <br/>\neffectiveness.  And imagine the koban back in the Meiji Era!  The <br/>\nkoban system remains in modern times because of the narrow streets <br/>\nand extremely densely populated areas.  It is more efficient <br/>\nto &quot;spread out&quot; law enforcement rather than have one big police <br/>\nstation and dispatch personel.  Koban cops are often the first <br/>\nresponders in all situations.  Not surprisingly foreign students in <br/>\nJapan are encouraged to find out where their local koban is located <br/>\nshould they need assistance.<br/>\nsome references to Kawaji are in the books/sources here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/NSNR/NOsleepNOrest_Bibliography.htm\">http://1happyturtle.com/NSNR/NOsleepNOrest_Bibliography.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nalot of Kawaji&#39;s writings are quoted *slightly* out of context and <br/>\ncertain things like how Kawaji may have distorted information <br/>\nregarding the French model to push some his own ideas.

Because all rookies have to work a <br/>\nkoban for a while.  Imagine chatty PMK Nagakura sent to a koban (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to double check Fujita Goro&#39;s timeline but since he held the <br/>\nrank of sergeant at one point his job was actually to supervise koban <br/>\nin his jurisdiction.  BAck in that era, criminals were picked up and <br/>\nescorted to the big police stations by sergeants.  They had their <br/>\nhands tied and the officer would hold one end of the rope (there is a <br/>\nquick scene in the film LADY SNOW BLOOD the last episode of the <br/>\nseries).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, sherlgirl &lt;sherlgirl@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Sec - With respect to this topic, did you ever see this paper on <br/>\nthe Japanese Koban?
