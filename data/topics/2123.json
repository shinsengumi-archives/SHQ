Remembering Aizu talkes about <br/>\n&gt; him mostly under the name Okura. Shiba Goro knew him as well, after <br/>\n&gt; he left Shimokita and went to Tokyo. He stayed with Yamakawa a couple <br/>\n&gt; of times when he had no where else to go, despite the fact that the <br/>\n&gt; former domain elder was jobless and broke. Yamakawa and his mother <br/>\n&gt; ended up borrowing 13 yen and 50 sen from Shiba in fact. You reminded <br/>\n&gt; me of his Fujita connection, but not that he was in Remembering Aizu <br/>\n&gt; the other day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And why didn&#39;t you remind me about that little scandal he was <br/>\n&gt; involved in back in Shimokita?

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1952274806\">Forgot until I glanced at the SHQ website that Yamakawa Hiroshi, one <br/>\nof the go-betweens for Fujita Goro&#39;s marriage to Takagi Tokio, and <br/>\nYamakawa Okura were one and the same. Remembering Aizu talkes about <br/>\nhim mostly under the name Okura. Shiba Goro knew him as well, after <br/>\nhe left Shimokita and went to Tokyo. He stayed with Yamakawa a couple <br/>\nof times when he had no where else to go, despite the fact that the <br/>\nformer domain elder was jobless and broke. Yamakawa and his mother <br/>\nended up borrowing 13 yen and 50 sen from Shiba in fact. You reminded <br/>\nme of his Fujita connection, but not that he was in Remembering Aizu <br/>\nthe other day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why didn&#39;t you remind me about that little scandal he was <br/>\ninvolved in back in Shimokita? Where he was buying up all the dregs <br/>\nfrom the tofu dealer and the samurai confronted him about it? HM? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nBook specifically mentions his younger brother Kenjiro and Tokio&#39;s <br/>\ncousin, Takamine Hideo, on pg 133. Didn&#39;t realize that. Was the part <br/>\nabout them being survivors of the Byakkotai.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow how I missed -this- I don&#39;t know...<br/>\nSagawa &quot;Ogre&quot; Kanbei fought in Kyoshu as the head of a plice unit <br/>\nmade up of 150 former Aizu samurai. (Knew that) To the end he refused <br/>\nto use a modern weapon and was shot and killed at Mount Aso. ?!?! How <br/>\ndid I NOT see that before?! I&#39;m guessing this was in 1878 Sec?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd does anyone know if Hirosawa Tomijiro (liaison for Aizu with the <br/>\nShinsengumi) and Hirosawa Yasuto (who had the first western-style <br/>\ndairy farm) were one and the same? I recall seeing information from a <br/>\nwebsite that M translated for us that said Tomijiro was the owner of <br/>\nthis place. But Remembering Aizu mentions his first name is Yasuto? <br/>\nDid he change his name or was the website mistaken?<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissB</div>",
