He also knew Ulysses S. Grant (who visited<br/>\nJapan), John Russell Young, Edmund Clarence Stedman, Okuma Shigenobu<br/>\nand Inoue Kaoru.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was sooo close to Mark Twain that he brought his lady friend Aoki<br/>\nKoto on a visit to the States.  The couple stayed with the Twains in<br/>\nHartford.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I&#39;m so enthusiastic about English language papers,<br/>\npreferably printed in Japan, which covered either Boshin or Seinan War<br/>\nis because we can immediately see what kind of news the foriegners got<br/>\nand their opinions on the situation---and it&#39;s in ENGLISH (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nI should be getting a compilation of the TOKIO TIMES via inter-library<br/>\nloan.  Tokio Times was printed between 1877-1880.  even though it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cover the Boshin War directly...there should be references to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has info on English language papers printed in Japan please<br/>\nlet me know.  I had NO luck finding the paper printed in Yokohoma.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have now read in 3 different places that during the early to late<br/>\nMeiji era people actually COLLECTED newspaper clippings.  Taka,<br/>\nPrincess Chichibu&#39;s nanny collected related articles concerning the<br/>\nwedding but that made perfect sense.  People preferred to collect the<br/>\nnewspapers printed in &quot;color&quot; which illustrates scenes from the Seinan<br/>\nWar (usually exaggerated romantic accounts).  The prints I shared with<br/>\nhere in the form of zip files a while back had colorful paintings<br/>\ndepicting the Seinan War---I presume that those same paintings/prints<br/>\nwere the ones the newspapers printed.</div>",
