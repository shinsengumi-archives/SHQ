            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1979283600\">Funny how just a little new info can make things you didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand before so much clearer. Thanks to Momoiro-usagi, I was <br/>\nFINALLY able to understand the birthdate sheet on www.toshizo.com :<br/>\n<br/>\nFather - Yoshiatsu (Hayato)* - 1792-1835 - 44* (age at time of death)<br/>\nMother - Etsu - 1792-1840 - 49<br/>\n<br/>\nBrother - Tamejirou - 1812-1883 - 72<br/>\nBrother - no name - died prematurely (Oct 11, 1813)<br/>\nBrother - no name - died prematurely (June 12, 1815)<br/>\nBrother - Kiroku - 1819-1860 - 42<br/>\nSister - no name - died prematurely (Aug 4, 1821)<br/>\nSister - no name - died prematurely (May 5, 1822)<br/>\nSister - Shuu - 1823-1838 - 16<br/>\nBrother - Daisaku (later Kasuya Ryojyun) - 1828-1877 - 50<br/>\nSister - Nobu - 1831-1877 - 47<br/>\nHijikata - 1835-1869 - 34<br/>\n<br/>\n*Hayato - Was this his father&#39;s &quot;hidden&quot; name? I just realized that <br/>\nthis was the name Hijikata went by for a short time. <br/>\n<br/>\n*I have also seen his age given as 42 I thought? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBattle of Matsumae Castle (Hakodate War) -<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what I have been able to figure out from a very poor <br/>\nmachine translation of www.tamahito.com is that Enomoto and company <br/>\npretty much considered the feudal clan to be under their power. There <br/>\nwas a letter sent which may have indicated as much and did request <br/>\nthat they have a peaceful and cooperative existence for the good of <br/>\nthe Ezo Republic. The clan did not even bother to answer the letter <br/>\nwhich made Enomoto angry and he sent Hijikata&#39;s army to deal with <br/>\nthem on October 27, 1868. (Recall that this would have been November <br/>\nor December by the modern calender. There was already much snow on <br/>\nthe ground so it would not have been an easy march for them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point the clan realized that Hijikata was on his way and <br/>\naccording to the translation, attempted to &quot;assassinate&quot; him before <br/>\nhis troop could reach the castle. Of course it failed. The article <br/>\ndid not elaborate on what they tried to do, but I did find reference <br/>\non www.toshizo.com to a surprise attack by night on Hijikata&#39;s camp <br/>\nshortly before they reached Matsumae Castle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn November 5 he reached the castle, which has one of its sides <br/>\nfacing the sea. At dawn the two sides began to shell one another. <br/>\nAfter Hijikata&#39;s men had wounded around 30 of their own, the feudal <br/>\nclan was forced to surrender.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two conflicting stories about how Hijikata won the battle. <br/>\nThe first one claims that he saw they opened the castle gate to fire <br/>\nand would then shut it again. He figured out the timing of it and <br/>\nsent men to sneak up on both sides of the gate. When the gate was <br/>\nopened again, they were able to fire into the fort at close range and <br/>\ncause they to have to surrender.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other story is said to come from Shimada Kai&#39;s diary and is <br/>\nprobably more reliable. He said that Hijikata used a ladder to sneak <br/>\npeople into the castle and attack the from within and this is how <br/>\nthey took the castle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the battle many members of the Matsumae clan escaped, setting <br/>\nfire &quot;to the private house and the village&quot;. (Not sure if the bit <br/>\nabout &quot;the private house&quot; means they set their house on fire or if it <br/>\nsimply means they set the whole village on fire.) This action was <br/>\nlater condemned. Enomoto had learned international law and that it <br/>\nsaid citizens should not be harmed who were not directly involved in <br/>\na war. It seems that he expected his own troops to go by this law <br/>\nfrom what this is saying. It further comments that this was a new <br/>\nidea for Japan and not the old feudal idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne final sad note. Apparently the Matsumae clan went to the Tsugaru <br/>\nclan (?) for help. They had to take a ferry to reach them and the <br/>\nweather, as I have mentioned, was bad. They had a princess of the <br/>\nfamily with them who had TB and ended up dying as a result of the <br/>\nconditions at the time. She was 25 at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recall seeing a reference to that trick with the gate in connection <br/>\nwith Utsunomiya Castle as well. I wonder if that could have been <br/>\nwhere it really took place and some survivor of both battles got the <br/>\ntwo fights mixed up? Also, I would tend to think Shimada would have <br/>\nknown for certain since he was Hijikata&#39;s bodyguard at the time <br/>\napparently. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also was reading a bit about the two people who got a letter about <br/>\nHijikata&#39;s death to his family. The man who wrote it was named <br/>\nYasutomi Saisuke and he had taught horsemanship to the Shinsengumi <br/>\nwhen they were still in Kyoto. By the time of the Battle of Hakodate <br/>\nhe was Hijikata&#39;s aide and was supposed to have been with him during <br/>\nhis last moments. He entrusted a letter with the details of this to a <br/>\nman named Tachikawa Chikara.<br/>\n<br/>\nTachikawa seems to have been a later member, but I cannot tell for <br/>\nsure. He also appears to have been trying to help Yasutomi to escape <br/>\njust before the Ezo Republic finally collapsed and was captured. He <br/>\nwas sent to the Akita feudal clan to &quot;behave&quot;. The letter was finally <br/>\ndelivered to the Sato house in Hino in 1872. Tachikawa was 68 when he <br/>\ndied in 1903.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Yasutomi, he was released in Edo in 1870. However it is said <br/>\nthat he was murdered soon after by another original member of the <br/>\nShinsengumi. I could only make out &quot;Abe&quot; for sure. This is probably <br/>\nAbe Juurou of Ito&#39;s group, who would certainly have a motive to kill <br/>\nanyone closely connected to Hijikata. Yasutomi was 31 when he died.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
