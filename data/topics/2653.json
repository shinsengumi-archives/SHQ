He later accompanied former Aizu retainer Yamakawa<br/>\nHiroshi to the Seinan War (Satsuma Rebellion) in 1877.  Morinosuke<br/>\neventually became a Chief Prosecutor and collaborated with other<br/>\nprominent Aizu men in various efforts to develop their home and<br/>\npreserve history.<br/>\nMore info and pic of his grave here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe book NUMASAWA MICHIKO-KUN DEN was printed in **1913** by Numasawa<br/>\nKohachiro (or Shichiro).<br/>\nTokio was 67<br/>\nFujita Goro was 69<br/>\nNumasawa Tatsuo (born Fujita Tatsuo) was 26 (secretly adopted out to<br/>\nNumasawa Shichiro/Kohachiro as an infant).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book was written by Takagi MOrinusuke and SAIGO TANOMO (one of 2<br/>\nretainers who had warned MATSUDAIRA KATAMORI from accepting the post<br/>\nof &quot;Protector of Kyoto&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nSaigo Tanomo died in 1905 thus this book seemed to primarily be the<br/>\neffort of Takagi Morinusuke.<br/>\n<br/>\nNumasawa Michiko was the aunt of TOKIO.  <br/>\nNumasawa Michiko, her mother in law and daughters committed suicide<br/>\nduring the attack by the IMperial Army leaving Numasawa Shichiro to<br/>\nfight at the age of 15.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThus the scans are of a book Tokio would have read...surely these<br/>\nwords took her back to 1868 and brought tears to her eyes.  <br/>\n<br/>\njust sample pages<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/TakagiM.zip\">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/TakagiM.zip</a><br/>\n1.20 MB<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to consider---did TOKIO herself assist in the preparation of<br/>\nthis book?  I know that another major historical book prepared by<br/>\nYamakawa Kenjiro came about through interviews at the Matsudaira<br/>\nestate in Kyoto...did this book undergo a similar process?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo many of us just &quot;adopting out&quot; a son is jarring to our modern<br/>\nsentiments---however our job is to understand WHY.  Numasawa Shichiro<br/>\nand his wife requested Fujita Goro & Tokio&#39;s child (if it was a girl<br/>\nthey would keep her) but the Numasawas needed a BOY to continued their<br/>\nlineage.  Have an heir to the family name was crucial to many 19th<br/>\ncentury Japanese.  Numasawa Tatsuo somehow became suspicious about his<br/>\nparentage and learned the truth in college from an aunt Ibuka Saku. <br/>\nUnderstandably the news devastated him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTakagi Morinusuke and Numasawa Shichiro were close.<br/>\nWe know that Fujita Goro often stayed at Morinusuke&#39;s home when<br/>\nvisiting his family&#39;s grave.  Was that how Fujita Goro and Tokio kept<br/>\ntrack of their third son?  Did Numasawa Tatsuo&#39;s career in the field<br/>\nof law come from his uncle Morinusuke&#39;s mentoring? <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, perhaps this book wasn&#39;t enough...Tokio did write a letter to<br/>\nher last son 1 month before Fujita Goro died in 1915.</div>",
