            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-757821704\">Thank you to k kobayakawa and Seven regarding this detail about Kondo<br/>\nand the Kobusho.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the Shinsengumi legacy was their very mixed demographics as<br/>\nronin/roshi, or non-samurai, and then their elevation in rank once<br/>\nthey were sanctioned in Kyoto.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that there is overwhelming evidence that during that era in<br/>\nJapan, certain areas had a high degree of &quot;social blending&quot;. All the<br/>\nfacts to prove this comes from studies on rural peasant communities in<br/>\nEdo---even more specifically TAma/Hino regions! (this may point to how<br/>\nsome of the top members of the Shinsengumi grew up with the<br/>\n&quot;possibility&quot; that they too could be samurai).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever in the &quot;formal&quot; or administrative world of the bakufu the same<br/>\nstrict protocol on social class was still observed. It was the<br/>\ninflexibility of the bakufu in certain areas of its system which made<br/>\nit weak. Note, the bakufu was making several changes during that era too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really interested in how the Shinsengumi and Kiheitai (Choshu)<br/>\nshared something similar---[[[mixed social classes]]].<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething which has bothered me about resaerch into this era is that<br/>\nseveral books written by western writers say somthing along the lines<br/>\n&quot;the Choshu Kiheitai {Takasugi&#39;s Strange/Surprise, Irregular or<br/>\nextraordinary Corps} demonstrated that they were willing to admit<br/>\ncommoners into the military role of the samurai and their use of<br/>\nwestern technology showed how forward thinking they were&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Meiji Era, westerners who just entered into the now<br/>\nenlightened Japan (according to their measurement of what was modern),<br/>\nsaw the Kiheitai as the exact opposite of the bakufu military force. <br/>\nTo the westerners, the Kiheitai were the essence of the revolution.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSimply, they were defined as being the common man who rose up against<br/>\nthe system.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout looking ***deeper they interpreted the detail as an attempt to<br/>\nstart an egalitarian military movement and the Kiheitai was viewed as<br/>\na precursor to universal conscription (thanks to fellow Choshu samurai<br/>\nYamagata Aritomo during the Meiji). Basically, the west wanted to see<br/>\nin Japan the same values they treasured---universal ideals, however<br/>\nthey disregarded key details.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey overlooked how the bakufu was already incorporating French<br/>\ntraining into their ranks (since they measure progress/modernity with<br/>\nwho has better weapons of mass destruction).  <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Kiheitai commoners<br/>\n1) had to dress differently<br/>\n2) were treated differently (however they had to still act under<br/>\nsamurai rules)<br/>\n3) their leaders were lower ranking samurai<br/>\n4) only at most 40% (or even less than that) of the 292 Kiheitai<br/>\nmembers as of 1864 were were actually peasants &quot;which makes it<br/>\ndifficult to call the Kiheitai a peasant unit&quot; (Hackett 26)<br/>\n5) they were supported financially by the Choshu domain --however-- <br/>\n&quot;merchants and farmers were also permitted to join---and used funds<br/>\nsupplied by merchants for part of its expense&quot; (Hackett 25)---in fact<br/>\nTakasugji mentioned a wealthy merchant, Yamashita Shishinojo of Gofuku<br/>\nvillage &quot;as a possible source of financial support&quot; (Hackett 25).<br/>\n<br/>\n-If- the Kiheitai *did not take money from commoners, would they still<br/>\nfeel obligated to take in those from the lower classes? Remember,<br/>\nKondo and Hijikata had rich elite peasants buddies (one was a sworn<br/>\nbrother of Kondo) who also gave them gifts too.  <br/>\nSee<br/>\nThe Farmers of Edo and the Warriors in Kyoto<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess, I meandered off topic to compare the Shinsengumi mixed<br/>\nsocial classes with that of the Kiheitai.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI ask, if the researchers from the west see the Kiheitai as a sure<br/>\nsign of &quot;social progress&quot; how come they never took the same idea and<br/>\nlooked at the bakufu&#39;s guys...namely the Shinsengumi. So they should<br/>\nanalyze the Shinsengumi the same way too, did they make members from<br/>\nthe low class dress different, act different and so forth?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr have they missed the obvious:  The bottom line---It wasn&#39;t about<br/>\n&quot;equality&quot; it was about getting guys to fight/die for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever possible, higher ups had no problem with exploiting people<br/>\nwho bought into social stratification (remember 99.9% of people were<br/>\nraised in the system) and wanted to climb the ladder to make a better<br/>\nfuture for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSource<br/>\nHackett, Roger F.
