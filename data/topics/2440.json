            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-445592847\">Dr. Willis in Japan, 1862-1877: A British Medical Pioneer<br/>\nby Hugh Cortazzi<br/>\nISBN: 0485112647 <br/>\n<br/>\nAvailable on Amazon for a mere $60.00<br/>\n***highly recommended for those who have access to a public/school <br/>\nlibrary***<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Willis is -always- quoted in texts covering the seige and fall <br/>\nof Aizu however he was also at Toba and Fushimi, where he treated <br/>\nAizu samurai, while accompanying Mitford.  Those texts, <br/>\nunderstandably, had to paraphrase his words and I&#39;ll tell you right <br/>\nnow that nothing tops the detailed original.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Willis was employed by the British Legation.  The British at <br/>\nthis point had already chosen to support Satsuma thus Dr. Willis had <br/>\nmore than just a passing acquaintance with SAIGO TAKAMORI and OYAMA <br/>\nIWAO (Saigo&#39;s cousin and future husband of Aizu&#39;s Yamakawa <br/>\nSutematsu). The biographer stated that he was VERY CLOSE to Saigo <br/>\nhowever no detailed conversations or anecdotal stories have survived <br/>\nin print.<br/>\nWillis, after Boshin, lived in Kagoshima for many years and left in <br/>\n1877 at the beginning of the SAtsuma Rebellion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the Boshin War--He pleaded with Satsuma atleast twice that <br/>\ninjured prisoners of war should be spared execution.  It is not 100% <br/>\nclear whether or not they were able to implement his ideas in a <br/>\nuniform manner---it is implied that they tried.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInitially he *LOOKED* for enemy prisoners and did not find <br/>\nany...alive.  He promised to tell the world that the Japanese <br/>\nconducted warfare &quot;humanely&quot; should they try their best to look <br/>\nafter their prisoners. It was common practice for -both- sides to <br/>\nbehead the injured enemy they came across. This was not just simply <br/>\nbeing cruel but almost out of necessity.  There were no such things <br/>\nas well equipped medic teams ready to treat scores of injured <br/>\nsoldiers.  Dr. Willis himself, working alongside Japanese physicians <br/>\nnoticed that due to the extremely high number of patients, doctors <br/>\nsometimes failed to locate and extract bullets or bone fragments in <br/>\nthe wound and just simply sew up the patient.  Thus the injured not <br/>\nonly died of infection, but also very likely of the bullet(s) doing <br/>\nfurther damage in the body.  Most of the wounds he treated were the <br/>\nresult of bullets, *not* sword or spear wounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also taught Japanese doctors the use of chloroform to knock out <br/>\nthe patient however in one case he extracted a bullet from a boy&#39;s <br/>\nneck without using chloroform.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThus, in a situation where you cannot save the life of your own <br/>\ncomrade/friend---it may have been easier to just put a prisoner out <br/>\nof his misery.  This reflects upon the suicides in Aizu---the people <br/>\nthere not only understood this widespread practice in war they also <br/>\nheard true accounts from the battle front of <br/>\nexecutions/rape/brutality thus rather than die by the sword of the <br/>\ninvaders they chose self destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis description of travelling to beseiged Aizu, with the invading <br/>\nImperial army is graphic complete with looting and plundering on <br/>\nboth sides due to the lack of supplies. Thus, what he heard and saw <br/>\nfirst hand corroborated the information Katura Kogoro (Kido) noted <br/>\nin his diary. One sentence here and there on what he saw firsthand <br/>\nwas very illustrative.  He asked to be recompensated for the money <br/>\nhe had to pay out of pocket to feed Aizu people huddling in the snow <br/>\n(November 1868) with just a blanket for cover. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, he did not explicitly meet nor mention Shinsengumi, that we <br/>\nknow of, however he did see the wretched state of prisoners after <br/>\nthe war, one of whom was Yamaguchi Jiro (Saitou) and recorded <br/>\nMatsudaira Katamori escorted out of his domain. <br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot stress the importance of this text enough it needs to be <br/>\nread along with Shiba Goro&#39;s Remembering Aizu and Akiko Kunos <br/>\nUnexpected Destinations, keep in mind that Dr. Willis was very <br/>\nvery &quot;pro&quot; Satsuma what he wrote did not grow out of a *bias* for <br/>\nAizu in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPics (this file can go offline anytime)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Drwillis.zip\">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Drwillis.zip</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nVisual Supplement to Tokio.htm in the &lt;&lt;FILES&gt;&gt; section of the <br/>\nmailing list (also temporarily hosted)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/JapaneseGirlsandWomen.zip\">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/JapaneseGirlsandWomen.zip</a></div>",
