            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-888556277\">Okay hopefully my post should wrap up the yakuza discussion (I <br/>\nappreciate your patience)<br/>\n*yahoo won&#39;t let me upload the file without &quot;timing out&quot; so I&#39;m <br/>\nhosting these scans<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/yakuzadiary.pdf\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/yakuzadiary.pdf</a><br/>\nI only scanned pages which deal directly with the Aizu-Kotetsu and <br/>\nIsao Kondo and his Shinseigumi (these are the spellings from the book)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do realize that in AIm chats with SHQ members that I misquoted the <br/>\nbook saying that the Aizu-Kotetsu existed as far back as the <br/>\n1830s...but in fact that is the decade in which the founder of the <br/>\ngang was born...if you read the excerpt we are in fact dealing with <br/>\nthe Bakumatsu and our Shinsengumi<br/>\n<br/>\n[side notes]<br/>\nfrom my post about the Genyosha hopefully you can see that the <br/>\ndefinition of yakuza as simple lowly gamblers/peddlers is merely a <br/>\nsuperficial assessment just as &quot;samurai&quot; is filled with minor sub-<br/>\nclasses<br/>\n<br/>\nmodern day examples of yakuza and law enforcement exist and at times <br/>\nit is certainly beneficial to the police and ofcourse at the same <br/>\ntime leads to corruption of the justice system...low level yakuza <br/>\nhave also entered the system.  Yes, background checks are standard <br/>\nprocedure however the force would much rather prefer a &quot;right&quot; <br/>\nleaning person politically over a &quot;left&quot; leaning person.  This <br/>\nattitude is right out of the Meiji era in which the police+yakuza <br/>\nwere used to crack down on liberal activists.  *Note left/liberal <br/>\nlabels do not match 100% our modern American definition but it does <br/>\ncome prettyclose.  Yakuza bosses also find it to be a good idea to <br/>\nlet go of their underlings into law enforcement careers should, in <br/>\nthe future, they have to deal with the police.  Yakuza poetry is <br/>\npopular amongst cops and law enforcement publications are widely read <br/>\nby the yakuza...speaking of media the yakuza not only have ties in <br/>\nthe entertainment business....they PRODUCE many films...the names of <br/>\noyabun appear right in the credits.  Toei has made over 200 yakuza <br/>\nfilms many backed by the underworld...in fact one boss said that no <br/>\nmajor actor during the golden era of Japanese cinema has not <br/>\nsomehow &quot;benefited&quot; from their influence.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe low crime rates in Japan may in fact be partially due to not only <br/>\ncompetant police...but also their tacit agreements with the <br/>\nunderworld...yakuza are part of the eyes and ears of the police as <br/>\nthey do tip off authorities when rogue criminals enter into their <br/>\nturf...the yakuza way of seeing things is that they &quot;absorb&quot; rogue or <br/>\nexcessively violent criminals<br/>\n<br/>\nthe book I mentioned in the previous post by David E. Kaplan and Alec <br/>\nDubro (Yakuza: Japan&#39;s Criminal Underworld) examine the yakuza during <br/>\nfeudal times when there was a 5 year period when oyabun (local <br/>\nbosses/godfathers) were granted the right to wear 2 swords and a <br/>\nsurname.  Oyabun were also deputized by local police (which I&#39;m <br/>\nassuming are like the guys you see in Hatchobori 7).<br/>\n<br/>\nsecretarytocapt3</div>",

Unfortunately Hollywood, Western and Japanese writers and <br/>\nthe media have portrayed Japanese tattoos in a very negative light; <br/>\nnote how many so-called reference books and tattoo experts talk <br/>\nabout &#39;yakuza tattoos.&#39; Just because many yakuza are tattooed does <br/>\nnot mean those who are tattooed are yakuza - in most countries of the <br/>\nworld tattoos are common among the criminal element of society. In <br/>\nAmerica many crack whores and paedophiles have tattoos, however, <br/>\npeople do not call them &#39;crack whore tattoos&#39; or &#39;paedophile <br/>\ntattoos.&#39; I believe the same applies to horimono.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-666528820\">Their relation was not found although I searched some sites about <br/>\nAizu Kotetsu and Shinsengumi. <br/>\nTherefore, although it becomes only my opinion, what I have noticed <br/>\nis written. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it seems that it is written to the book that Shinsengumi <br/>\nlost its job before 1868, they have not lost their job. <br/>\nSurely, when Tokugawa parted with political power, they lost the <br/>\nwork which patrols Kyoto. <br/>\nHowever, they were already formally employed as vassals of Tokugawa <br/>\nat the time. <br/>\nAlthough Tokugawa went out of power, it had still huge territories <br/>\nand many vassals. <br/>\nOf course, the salary was regularly paid to them. <br/>\nMoreover, Shinsengumi did not regard existence of self as unstable. <br/>\nToward the end of 1867, Tokugawa tended to disassemble Mimawarigumi <br/>\nand Shinsengumi and tended to reorganize an army called Shin-<br/>\nYugekitai. <br/>\nHowever, Kondou who was apprehensive about the influence of <br/>\nShinsengumi being lost refused this. <br/>\nMoreover, between Satuma-Chosyu and Tokugawa, it was in the <br/>\nsituation where it is not known when war starts. <br/>\nDoes Kondou who has loyalty in Tokugawa ask for other employment at <br/>\nthe time? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it seems that it is written to &quot;Yakuza Diary&quot; as &quot;A gang <br/>\ncalled Shinseigumi&quot;, I have dissatisfaction in this text. <br/>\n(Please do not have misunderstanding, Bonnie-san. I do not blame <br/>\nyou. Thank you for the interesting information.) <br/>\nWell, Shinsengumi is the private police which was protecting the <br/>\npeace of Kyoto in response to approval for the government of the <br/>\ntime. <br/>\nIt differs from an act which is called gang. <br/>\nThey received a bad reputation different from the fact after the <br/>\nMeiji Restoration. <br/>\nIt is thought that Yakuza of this interview is the Emperor&#39;s <br/>\nsympathizer. <br/>\nThe Emperors and Satsuma-Chosyu-related historians often do such <br/>\nevaluation to Shinsengumi. <br/>\nI respect the Emperor family. <br/>\nMoreover, I do not have a feeling of dislike so much to Satsuma-<br/>\nChosyu. <br/>\nHowever, I have a feeling of dislike in such historians truly. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the incident which arose in the spring of this year. <br/>\nThe Dietman of a Yamagutchi (Chosyu) district denounced Shinsengumi <br/>\nas the terrorist about the program of NHK. <br/>\nSince NHK is a public broadcasting office, it is discussed in <br/>\nParliament about the program.<br/>\nHe says that the program which idealizes the terrorist who wounded <br/>\nour ancestor is not allowed morally. <br/>\nThe minister who replied to it was the posterity of the samurai of <br/>\nSatsuma. <br/>\nShinsengumi was the garrison whom the government of those days <br/>\naccepted, and our ancestor&#39;s side was a terrorist. <br/>\nThe minister answered like this and he said that history changed <br/>\nwith positions. <br/>\nThis minister is the posterity of Okubo Toshimichi.<br/>\nSince I was simple, I thought that a great man&#39;s posterity was <br/>\nsplendid. <br/>\nIncidentally, I do not know whose posterity a Dietman is. lol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAizu Kotetsu is the gambler who was related to the Aizu mansion in <br/>\nKyoto. <br/>\nThe residence of Daimyo was extraterritoriality at the time. <br/>\nSince Bugyousyo (Police) could not be entered, lower samurais&#39; room <br/>\nwas often used for the gambling house. <br/>\nHe was the rowdy who wore the kimono of Aizu&#39;s mark. <br/>\nAlthough his name was Uesaka Senkichi, his name was Tetsugorou when <br/>\nyounger. <br/>\nAnd he was very short. <br/>\nTherefore, people called him Aizu Kotetsu (Aizu&#39;s small Tetsu). <br/>\nTo be sure, he had Nagasone-Kotetsu. <br/>\nHowever, in the name of Nagasone-Kotetsu and him, Kanji is <br/>\ncompletely different. <br/>\n<br/>\nAizu Kotetsu and Kobuns buried the Aizu samurais&#39; body to Komyo-ji <br/>\nafter Toba-Fushimi war. <br/>\nAlthough it was the act forbidden to the Meiji government troops, he <br/>\nburied those bodies with the determination to receive punishment, in <br/>\norder to return Aizu&#39;s obligation. <br/>\nAnd they made the cemetery for the Aizu samurais. <br/>\nThey kept protecting the cemetery, without yielding to persecution. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe government troops forbade burying losers&#39; body at the time of <br/>\nBoshin war. <br/>\nWhat Yakuzas of each area buried those bodies for in opposition to <br/>\nthe government troops is an interesting fact. <br/>\nWhen the ship of Tokugawa sank to the Suruga bay, Oyabun of famous <br/>\nYakuza called &quot;Shimizu no Jirochou&quot; collected and buried the bodies <br/>\nof the samurais who drowned.<br/>\n(He is Oyabun of Yakuza most famous for Japan. Furthermore, although <br/>\nthis is an unrelated talk, Yakuza called &quot;Kurokoma no Katsuzou&quot; <br/>\nwhich appears as a rival in his biography exists. The Yakuza <br/>\nparticipated in Sekihoutai together with 200 persons&#39; Kobuns.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, Yanagawa Kumakichi which buried losers&#39; body after the <br/>\nHakodate war was Oyabun of Hakodate. <br/>\nHe is building Hekketsu-hi for the dead&#39;s repose of souls. <br/>\nTheir acts were the sympathy to a Tokugawa army, and rebounding to <br/>\nthe government troops. <br/>\nAnd the life of people of their territory needed to be protected. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, the body of Hijikata has the opinion of being buried, <br/>\nunder Hekketsu-hi. <br/>\nThis is in the investigation report which Mr. Taira of Hijikata&#39;s <br/>\nrelative requested from the policeman of Hakodate at Meiji Era. <br/>\nThe policeman investigated Yanagawa Kumakichi.<br/>\nYanagawa answered like this to the policeman. <br/>\nAlthough Hijikata was buried by subordinates in a certain village, <br/>\nwhen building Hekketsu-hi, Yanagawa and Kobuns dug him up and buried <br/>\nit in the place of Hekketsu-hi. <br/>\nHijikata&#39;s burial place has many opinions and the truth is not <br/>\nknown. <br/>\nHowever, even if Yanagawa considers burying him under Hekketsu-hi, I <br/>\nthink that it is not strange. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it is about Aizu Kotetsu and Aizu Kotetsu-kai, these two do <br/>\nnot have relation. <br/>\nThe name of Aizu Kotetsu was finished when Uesaka&#39;s son died in <br/>\n1935. <br/>\nYakuza which is completely unrelated to Uesaka began to use the name <br/>\nof Aizu Kotetsu-kai from 1975. <br/>\nAlthough I do not understand whether the relation between <br/>\nShinsengumi and Aizu Kotetsu was, Yakuza of the time and the present <br/>\nYakuza are completely different existences. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",

fashion. <br/>\nLower samurais with bad behavior copied this fashion. <br/>\nWhen the Sengoku age was over and Japan became peaceful, those <br/>\noutlaws lost ambition. <br/>\nAnd the skirmish of a territorial fight started. <br/>\nThey were systematized for every territory and became the existence <br/>\ncalled Machi-yakko. <br/>\nAnd they were opposed to the lower samurais who oppress people. <br/>\nSengoku period was over and many samurais lost the hope of success <br/>\nin life. <br/>\nLower samurais used the pent-up anger to oppress people of a status <br/>\nlower than they. <br/>\nThese samurais are Hatamoto-yakko. <br/>\nMachi-yakko and Hatamoto-yakko were opposed to each other, whenever <br/>\nsomething happened. <br/>\nThis Machi-yakko is the origin of Yakuza. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it is not strange to think that there were people who make <br/>\nNinja the origin in them. <br/>\nYakuza is the group made from various elements. <br/>\nThey are the outlaws generated to the Sengoku period mostly. <br/>\nMoreover, the main duties of Ninjas were espionage. <br/>\nThey disguised themselves as the traveler or the merchant and <br/>\ntraveled in many districts. <br/>\nIf it is taken into consideration, Ninjas may be able to be called <br/>\nwanderers&#39; same kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYakuza was kind to people of their territory.<br/>\nIn the gambling house which they manage, people were important <br/>\ncustomers. <br/>\nIn fact, many of incomes of Yakuza were gamble and a construction <br/>\nworker&#39;s charge of an agency recommendation. <br/>\n(Yakuza and construction work were already deeply related since the <br/>\nEdo period.) <br/>\n<br/>\nFamous Yakuza of the name of Kunisada Chuuji existed. <br/>\nWhen he was young, he was the bad man who committed crimes, such as <br/>\na burglar. <br/>\nHowever, after he became the oyabun of Yakuza of an Akagi district, <br/>\nhe was going to be trusted by people and did much good behavior. <br/>\nFor farmers, he performed irrigation works. <br/>\nAt the time of famine, his family distributed rice to people. <br/>\nHe came to be trusted by people of a territory. <br/>\nHowever, he was not able to cooperate with men of power. <br/>\nHis family had always caused the strife with the government <br/>\nofficials of an Akagi district. <br/>\nThey were cornered at last and hid out in the Akagi mountain. <br/>\nFarmers climbed the mountain and sent food to them so that it might <br/>\nnot be found by government officials. <br/>\nAfter Kunisada Chuuji was executed, a Confucian scholar&#39;s Hakura <br/>\nKandou wrote his biography. <br/>\nThe name of Kunisada was memorized by people as Yakuza hero. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, Yakuza hero is not only him. <br/>\nMany Yakuzas protected people from the violence of men of power or <br/>\noutlaws, and received praise. <br/>\nThey had the rule of not making trouble for people. <br/>\nThe enemies whom they fight were always men of power or other Yakuza <br/>\nfamilies. <br/>\nTo be sure, such Yakuzas existed till around 1960. <br/>\nIn Hiroshima after WW2, Yakuzas protected people from outlaws <br/>\ninstead of the police which stopped functioning. <br/>\nHowever, such Yakuzas disappeared gradually. <br/>\nAlthough I do not understand a detailed reason, I think that it is <br/>\nbecause the outlaws generated after WW2 captured Yakuza society. <br/>\nThey do not have the tradition and the rule of Yakuzas. <br/>\nThey use violence on people and involve people in a crime. <br/>\nThey have also acquired a bad reputation in foreign countries. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, let&#39;s return subject. <br/>\nSince I seldom know about Yakuza, I feel that it is impolite for me <br/>\nto discuss the contents of this article. <br/>\nHowever, I think that the origin of a word of Yakuza and explanation <br/>\nof Tekiya are very exact by the limitation which I can understand. <br/>\nThe opinion of being the custom in which Yubitsume was introduced <br/>\nfrom Bakuto is interesting. <br/>\nIn fact, I think that their finger is very important for gamblers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, why does a Hijikata fans need to be careful about <br/>\nTekiya? <br/>\nI worried for a while and have noticed. <br/>\nPossibly, are you talking about the scene which Hijikata of Taiga <br/>\ndrama peddled? <br/>\nHijikata sold medicine at the sales talk deceitful to be sure at the <br/>\ntime of the beginning of that drama. <br/>\nIt resembled the excessive talk of Tekiya. <br/>\nMoreover, he deceived some Dojyo and sold medicine. <br/>\nHowever, it is a mistake supposing you are talking about those <br/>\nscenes. <br/>\nThat is adaptation for Taiga drama. <br/>\nActual Hijikata had medicine and rounded customers. <br/>\nThis is medicinal peddlers&#39; ordinary style and is not related to <br/>\nTekiya. <br/>\nMoreover, when Dojyo was seen, he entered there and sold medicine. <br/>\nAnd he received instruction of the art of fencing from people of <br/>\nDojyo. <br/>\nIt is after WW2 that people got to know that there was no medicinal <br/>\neffect in Ishida-sanyaku. <br/>\nHijikata believed that medicine was effective, and sold it, and <br/>\ncustomers also believed and bought it. <br/>\nThe superintendent of HijikataToshizou-shiryokan which is the <br/>\nrelative of Hijikata is warning the people who came there &quot;Do not <br/>\nbelieve Taidga drama.&quot; .<br/>\nI sense that a sales method like a Taiga drama is interesting. <br/>\nHowever, it will be provoking for the relatives of Hijikata that the <br/>\nfraudulent practice of a fiction is misunderstood. <br/>\nIncidentally, in many Mangas and dramas, Hijikata goes to sell <br/>\nmedicine alone. <br/>\nHowever, he has having acted with the old man in many cases in <br/>\nrecord. <br/>\nIn the portion, a Taiga drama is exact.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, your article was very interesting. <br/>\nThank you very much. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",

They were <br/>\nextremely<br/>\nloyal to one another, and in time, the Kabuki-mono numbered over <br/>\n500,000,<br/>\nmany of whom wandered throughout Japan looting towns and villages. <br/>\nHowever,<br/>\nto every coin there are two sides. Another group emerged <br/>\nsimultaneously.<br/>\nThese people were called &quot;Machi-yakko,&quot; or &quot;Servants of the town,&quot; <br/>\nand they<br/>\nconsisted of merchants, laborers, fishermen, renegade Ninja and <br/>\nRonin who<br/>\nhad become professional gamblers as a means of earning a living. <br/>\nEveryone in<br/>\nthis group took up arms against the Kabuki-mono, serving as <br/>\nprotectors<br/>\nagainst their tyranny. The Machi-yakko became heroes, praised by <br/>\ntown and<br/>\nvillages across the country for their bravery.<br/>\n<br/>\nELITE NINJA<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1716 Tokugawa Yoshimune was named Shogun. When he assumed the <br/>\ntitle, he<br/>\nbrought in many of his own people to run the government. Among those <br/>\nin his<br/>\nemploy were Kishu-Ryu Ninja who were descendants of the Ninja who <br/>\nfled to<br/>\nthe Kii province after the battle of Iga 135 years earlier. The <br/>\nShogun<br/>\norganized the Kichu Ninja into a group called &quot;Oniwaban,&quot; which was <br/>\nto be a<br/>\nlarge scale intelligence unit that would serve as the countries <br/>\ninternal<br/>\nsecurity network. The agents in this network were called &quot;Metsuke,&quot; <br/>\nwhich<br/>\nliterally meant &quot;Eyes.&quot; This new breed of Ninja was no longer <br/>\nrestricted to<br/>\nthe shadows. Their positions were very high profile and respectable. <br/>\nThe<br/>\nShogun assigned a Metsuke to serve a Daimyo in every province in the <br/>\nland.<br/>\nThese agents were very polite, diplomatic and most importantly, <br/>\nattentive to<br/>\nthe events of the province. This made it very difficult for any <br/>\nDaimyo to<br/>\nplot against the Shogun without the risk of being discovered. In <br/>\nessence,<br/>\nthe Metsuke, because of their elite status, could openly map all the <br/>\ndetails<br/>\nof a castle in full view of everyone, noting its strengths and <br/>\nweaknesses.<br/>\nThey could keep track of the number of Samurai employed by the <br/>\ndaimyo, and<br/>\nthey could investigate any issue that seemed suspicious to them. This<br/>\ninformation would then be sent directly to the Shogun reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nA SECRET UNDERWORLD<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the late 1700&#39;s the Machi-yakko (servants of the town) had <br/>\nevolved into<br/>\na group known as Yakuza. This word, which roughly translated means<br/>\n&quot;worthless&quot; comes from a card game called &quot;Hanafuda,&quot; or &quot;Flower <br/>\ncards&quot;. The<br/>\ngoal of the game is to gather three cards that total 19 or under. <br/>\nAnything<br/>\nover 19 is a losing hand. The word YA meant 8, KU meant 9 and ZA <br/>\nmeant<br/>\nthree. This hand would total 20, which is a worthless hand, thus the <br/>\nname<br/>\nsignifies someone who is an outsider of society. This group was <br/>\nmostly made<br/>\nup of the poor, landless misfits of society, which was perfect for <br/>\nmany<br/>\nrenegade Ninja and Ronin who could use their skills to attain high <br/>\npositions<br/>\nof power within the Yakuza hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Yakuza families were based on a Father (oyabun) Child (kobun)<br/>\nrelationship. The leader of a Yakuza family was considered to be the <br/>\nparent<br/>\nto all those in his group. Initiation into a Yakuza family was a <br/>\nvery ornate<br/>\nritual. Unlike a classical martial tradition which required a blood <br/>\noath<br/>\nwritten on a scroll in the applicants own blood and then burned at <br/>\nan alter,<br/>\nthe Yakuza simply exchanged sake (rice wine) cups, filled to a level<br/>\nconsistent with their rank, to symbolize their Oyabun-Kobun <br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\nThis act was performed before a Shinto alter, which gave it religious<br/>\nsignificance. The Kobun position, although always subservient to the <br/>\nOyabun,<br/>\nconsisted of many levels. These levels included; under-boss, <br/>\nofficers,<br/>\nenlisted and apprentices. Again, this structure was not unlike the <br/>\nhierarchy<br/>\nused by the Ninja families of Iga and Koga.<br/>\n***********<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond article:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Yakuza Introduction <br/>\nItaly has the La Cosa Nostra. America has the Mafia. The Irish and <br/>\nJews have their own crime organizations in America. Southeast Asia <br/>\nhas the Triads. China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have the Tong. Truly <br/>\nwell-known organized crime organizations indeed. <br/>\nHowever, there is one organization that was not mentioned in the <br/>\nabove list, a group that has been around for over 300 years. A group <br/>\nthat has as much honor and principle as the Mafia, and is just as <br/>\nstrong, if not stronger. <br/>\nThe group is yakuza.Â <br/>\n<br/>\nHistory of the Yakuza --- Feudal Japan Kabuki-Mono <br/>\n<br/>\nThe yakuza can trace its origins back to as early as 1612, when <br/>\npeople known as kabuki-mono (&quot;crazy ones&quot;), began to attract the <br/>\nattention of local officials. Their odd clothing and haircuts and <br/>\nbehavior, along with carrying long swords at their sides, made them <br/>\nquite noticeable. Kabuki-mono made a habit of antagonizing and <br/>\nterrorizing anyone at their leisure, even to the point of cutting <br/>\none down just for sheer pleasure. <br/>\nThe kabuki-mono were eccentric samurai, taking outrageous names for <br/>\ntheir bands and speaking heavily in slang. Their loyalty to one <br/>\nanother was remarkable. They would protect each other from any <br/>\nthreat, including against their own families. In fact, the kabuki-<br/>\nmono were servants of the shogun, also taking the name of hatamoto-<br/>\nyakko (&quot;Servants of the shogun&quot;). The groups were comprised of <br/>\nnearly 500,000 samurai that were forced into unemployment during the <br/>\ntime of peace during the Tokugawa era, forcing them to become ronin <br/>\n(&quot;Wave man,&quot; a master less samurai). Many had turned into bandits, <br/>\nlooting towns and villages as they wandered throughout Japan. <br/>\nThe hatamoto-yakko cannot truly be seen as the forebears of that <br/>\nyakuza. Instead, the yakuza see the machi-yokko (&quot;Servants of the <br/>\ntown&quot;) as their ancestors. These people were the ones who took up <br/>\narms and defended the villages and towns from the hatamoto-yokko. <br/>\nThese people consisted of such occupations as clerks, shopkeepers, <br/>\ninnkeepers, laborers, homeless warriors and other ronin. Everyone <br/>\nwho was part of the machi-yakko was an adept gambler, which helped <br/>\nthem develop a closely-knit relationship with each other and their <br/>\nleaders, much like today&#39;s yakuza. <br/>\nThe machi-yakko soon became folk heroes, praised by the townspeople <br/>\nfor their actions against the hatamoto-yakko, though they were, for <br/>\nthe most part, untrained and weaker than the hatamoto-yakko. They <br/>\nwere very similar to England&#39;s Robin Hood. Some of the machi-yakko <br/>\nwere even subjects of stories and plays. <br/>\nThe early yakuza did not surface until the middle to late 1700&#39;s. <br/>\nThese members include the bakuto (traditional gamblers) and the <br/>\ntekiya (street peddlers). These terms are still used today to <br/>\ndescribe yakuza members today, although a third group, gurentai <br/>\n(hoodlums) has been added in the post World War II era. Everyone in <br/>\nthose groups came from the same background: poor, landless, <br/>\ndelinquents and misfits. The groups stuck closely in the same small <br/>\nareas without problems, as the bakuto remained mostly along the <br/>\nhighways and towns, and the tekiya operated in the markets and fairs <br/>\nof Japan. <br/>\nThe yakuza began organizing into families, adopting a relationship <br/>\nknown as oyabun-kobun (father-role/child-role). The oyabun was <br/>\nthe &quot;father,&quot; providing advice, protection and help; the kobun acted <br/>\nas the &quot;child,&quot; swearing unswerving loyalty and service whenever the <br/>\noyabun needed it. The initiation ceremony for the yakuza also <br/>\ndeveloped in this period of time. Instead of the actual bloodletting <br/>\nthat was practiced by the Mafia and the Triads, the yakuza exchanged <br/>\nsake cups to symbolize the entrance into the yakuza and the oyabun-<br/>\nkobun relationship. The amounts of sake poured into each cup <br/>\ndepended upon one&#39;s status, whether the participants were father-<br/>\nson, brother-brother, elder-younger, etc. The ceremony was usually <br/>\nperformed in front if a Shinto altar, giving it religious <br/>\nsignificance.Â Tekiya <br/>\nThe tekiya&#39;s history is still widely debated. The most widely <br/>\naccepted theory was that the tekiya came from yashi, an earlier word <br/>\nmeaning peddler. The yashi were travelling merchants of medicine, <br/>\nmuch similar to the American West&#39;s snake oil merchants. Over time, <br/>\nyashi became a catch-all for all merchants and peddlers. <br/>\nThey tekiya united with each other for protection and mutual <br/>\ninterest from the Tokugawa regime. They began to control the booths <br/>\nat fairs and markets. Their reputation for shoddy merchandise was <br/>\nwell known and well-deserved. Their salesmanship was deceptive. They <br/>\nlied about origins and quality of products. The would act drunk and <br/>\nmake a show of selling their wares cheaply, so it would appear that <br/>\nthey were unaware of what they were doing. They would delude the <br/>\ncustomer. <br/>\nThe tekiya followed the usual yakuza organization: oyabun, <br/>\nunderboss, officers, enlisted and apprentices. The oyabun controlled <br/>\nthe kobun and the allocation of stalls along with the availability <br/>\nof the goods. He also collected rents and protection money, and <br/>\nwould pocket the difference between the two. Everything they did was <br/>\nlegal work. In the middle 1700&#39;s, the feudal authorities recognised <br/>\nand therefore increased the power of the tekiya. Oyabun were given <br/>\nthe authority of supervisor, now being able to have a surname and <br/>\ncarry two swords similar to samurai, in order to reduce the threat <br/>\nof turf wars due to widespread fraud. However, the tekiya still <br/>\nembraced some criminal traits, such as protection rackets, the <br/>\nharboring of fugitives and known criminals, and brawling with other <br/>\ntekiya and gangs. <br/>\n<br/>\nBakuto --- the GamblersÂ <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bakuto were first recognized during the Tokugawa era, when the <br/>\ngovernment hired them to gamble with contraction and irrigation <br/>\nworkers in order to regain a portion of the substantial wages the <br/>\nworkers received. <br/>\nThe bakuto contributed to Japan&#39;s tradition for gambling, as well as <br/>\nthe yakuza&#39;s traditional &quot;finger-cutting,&quot; and the origin of the <br/>\nword &quot;yakuza.&quot; <br/>\nThe word comes from a hand in a card game called hanafuda (flower <br/>\ncards), similar to blackjack. Three cards are dealt per player, and <br/>\nthe last digit of the total counts as the number of the hand. A hand <br/>\nof 20, the worst score, gives the score of zero. One such losing <br/>\ncombination is 8-9-3, or ya-ku-sa, which began to be widely used to <br/>\ndenote something useless. This term began to be used about bakuto, <br/>\nas they were, on the whole, useless to society. <br/>\nYubitsume, the custom of finger-cutting, was introduced by the <br/>\nbakuto. The top joint of the little finger is ceremoniously severed, <br/>\nsignifying a weakening of the hand, which meant that the gambler <br/>\ncould not hold his sword as firmly. Yubitsume was performed was <br/>\nusually performed as an act of apology to the oyabun. Further <br/>\ninfractions would either mean the severing of the next joint or the <br/>\ntop section of another finger. It is also used as a lasting <br/>\npunishment just before expulsion. <br/>\nThe use of tattoos also came from the criminal aspect of the bakuto. <br/>\nCriminals were usually tattooed with a black ring around an arm for <br/>\neach offense he had committed. However, the tattoos soon became a <br/>\ntest of strength, as they were applied by undergoing 100 hours for a <br/>\ncomplete back tattoo. The tattoo also marked a misfit, always <br/>\nunwilling to adapt themselves to society.Â <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Restoration Years <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Meiji Restoration, starting in 1867, gave Japan a rebirth and <br/>\nits first of many transformations into an industrial nation. <br/>\nPolitical parties and a parliament were created, as well as a <br/>\npowerful military. <br/>\nThe yakuza also began to modernize, keeping in pace with a rapidly <br/>\nchanging Japan. They recruited members from construction jobs and <br/>\ndock workings. They even began to control the rickshaw business. <br/>\nGambling, however, had to be even more covert, as police were <br/>\ncracking down on bakuto gangs. The tekiya, unlike the bakuto, <br/>\nthrived and expanded, as their activities were not illegal, at least <br/>\nnot on the surface. <br/>\nThe yakuza began to dabble in politics, taking sides with certain <br/>\npoliticians and officials. They cooperated with the government so <br/>\nthey could get official sanction, or at least some freedom from <br/>\nharassment. <br/>\nThe government did find a use for the yakuza --- as aid to ultra <br/>\nnationalists, who took a militaristic role in Japan&#39;s adaption into <br/>\ndemocracy. Various secret societies were created and trained <br/>\nmilitarily, trained in languages, assassination, blackmail, etc. The <br/>\nultra nationalist reign of terror lasted into the 1930&#39;s, consisting <br/>\nof several coups d&#39;etat, the assassination of two prime ministers <br/>\nand two finance ministers, and repeated attacks on politicians and <br/>\nindustrialists. The yakuza provided muscle and men to the cause and <br/>\nparticipated in &quot;land development&quot; programs in occupied Manchuria or <br/>\nChina. <br/>\nThings changed, however, when Pearl Harbor was bombed. The <br/>\ngovernment no longer needed the ultra nationalists or the yakuza. <br/>\nMembers of these groups either worked with the government, put on a <br/>\nuniform, or were put into jail. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bonnie Johnston&quot; &lt;kallipygia@h...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi, everyone!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m reading &quot;Yakuza Diary,&quot; by Christopher Seymour, and came <br/>\n </span></blockquote>across a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; reference to the Shinsengumi.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1021868018\">Hi, everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading &quot;Yakuza Diary,&quot; by Christopher Seymour, and came across a <br/>\nreference to the Shinsengumi.  Seymour was interviewing a yakuza who serves <br/>\nas the historian for the Aizu Kotetsu, a clan in Kyoto.  Speaking of the <br/>\nfounder of the Aizu Kotetsu, Ubesaki Senkichi, and Senkichi&#39;s boss, Senhachi <br/>\n(who was from another gang; apparently the yakuza gangs would occasionally <br/>\nspawn offshoots, and the sub-gang remained loyal to the leader of the main <br/>\ngang), the yakuza historian says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In the years right before the 1868 Meiji Revolution, there was turbulance <br/>\nin the samurai class.  There was also trouble among the lower ranks of <br/>\nguardsmen.  They were losing their jobs protecting damiyo (sic), feudal <br/>\nlords, residing in Kyoto.  A gang called Shinseigumi, headed by a man named <br/>\nIsao Kondo, found itself unemployed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Isao Kondo asked the gambling boss Senhachi for employment for the <br/>\nredundant Shinseigumi men.  Though Senhachi accepted these men into his <br/>\norganization, he decided to put his favorite understudy (Senkichi) in charge <br/>\nof these newcomers.  Senkichi accepted the position and brought along three <br/>\nfriends from his youth to assist him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This reorganized gang was now called Aizu Kotetsu-kai.  Aizu, for the <br/>\nregion where the gang originated, and Kotetsu, after Senhachi&#39;s favorite <br/>\nbrand of sword.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(p.72)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know how accurate this is, but thought I&#39;d throw it out there for <br/>\ndiscussion or further research, if anyone is interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
