The Development of the Modern Japanese Police <br/>\nSystem: Transition from Tokugawa and Meiji<br/>\n<br/>\n*donft worry about the term torishimari gumi, one of many <br/>\ntransitional labels used for patrolmen when the police system was <br/>\nestablished<br/>\n<br/>\nPaste 95<br/>\ngThe torishimari gumi should be ready to help the people within his <br/>\njurisdiction as well as travelers when he is asked to help.  Even <br/>\nwhen the patrolman is not asked, he should assist individuals in <br/>\ndifficulty when it seems necessary to do so.h Patrolmen were <br/>\nexpected to be gpolite instead of rudeh and to serve without <br/>\ndiscriminating between wealthy and poor citizenscA final note of <br/>\ninterest is that the regulations require the patrolmen to wear their <br/>\ntrousers while on duty.h<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s right officers please keep your trousers on....I think it <br/>\nmeans that guys may have prefered to wear more traditional clothes <br/>\nlike hakama rather than western wear.</div>",
