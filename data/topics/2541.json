Hideo was 15 that<br/>\nyear and as a young man recognized for his intelligence he may have<br/>\nhad more important jobs. As Matsudaira&#39;s page he would have incredible<br/>\ninsight into the army&#39;s retreat and various negotiations, keep in mind<br/>\nthat he may very well have met Hijikata Toshizo & Co at Aizu. So<br/>\nsometimes to get really good info look for possible &quot;informants&quot; and<br/>\ncheck to see if they left memoirs.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(some of the translations on the following pages required the<br/>\nassistance of up to 3 volunteer translators to *confirm* the little<br/>\ndetails which did not appear in earlier translations)  Takamine<br/>\nHideo&#39;s daughter had memories of both Tokio and Goro<br/>\n<br/>\n[Takagi Tokio Info Page]<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm</a><br/>\n*now with a bit more info on her brother Morinusuke and confirmation<br/>\nfrom 2 volunteer translators on Tokio&#39;s mother who had a reputation<br/>\nfor being a beautiful woman<br/>\n[note] the Tokio page does have alot of information but there are also<br/>\nimages as well if you go to the timeline look at the year 1889 and see<br/>\nan image of a graduating class---these were the girls Tokio mentored.<br/>\n<br/>\nand [Saitou Hajime Info Page]<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a></div>",
