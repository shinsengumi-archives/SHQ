I don&#39;t know who chooses them, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what the Japanese Emperor is known as, it&#39;s important to understand <br/>\nsomething else first-- era names bear the Emperor&#39;s reign name, but this <br/>\nonly started with Meiji. Before then, the ruling military government, such <br/>\nas the Minamoto, Ashikaga, or Tokugawa shogunates, chose the era name so <br/>\nthat it would be an auspicious one, and would change it at a whim. However, <br/>\nfor example, if one era ended on June 6th, and the next era began the next <br/>\nday, the next day would not be January 1st-- the next day would be June 7th, <br/>\nbut it would be June 7th of the first year of the new era.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said (phew) as far as emperors from Meiji onwards go, let&#39;s take <br/>\nthe current one (Akihito) as an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, &quot;Akihito&quot; is his personal name. However, the era name is called <br/>\n&quot;Heisei&quot;. The Japanese people, however, do NOT call him &quot;Akihito&quot;-- now, as <br/>\nit will be after his death, tehy call him the &quot;Heisei tenno&quot; (&quot;Heisei <br/>\nEmperor&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple as that.<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>",
