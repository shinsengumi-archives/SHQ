The info was passed along to me from Michael who composed<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi filmography (Michael is usually at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ninjadojo.com\">http://www.ninjadojo.com</a> where he dishes out movie reviews and tidbits<br/>\non cinema).<br/>\n<br/>\n[Publication title:The Daily Yomiuri. Tokyo: Feb 21, 2007.  pg. 1]<br/>\n<br/>\nMusings<br/>\n<br/>\nYomiuri<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is a translation of the Henshu Techo column from The<br/>\nYomiuri Shimbun&#39;s Feb. 20 issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n* * *<br/>\n<br/>\nUnable to have his petition to save impoverished people suffering from<br/>\nfamine accepted, Oshio Heihachiro (1793-1837), a former official of<br/>\nthe Osaka Higashimachi magistrate&#39;s office and a scholar of Wang<br/>\nYangming doctrines, led an armed uprising against the establishment in<br/>\n1837. The rebels set fire to the town and attacked the warehouses of<br/>\nwealthy merchants.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Daimaru is a chivalrous merchant shop. Don&#39;t vandalize its<br/>\nwarehouses&quot;--words uttered by Oshio and quoted in Daimaru Inc.&#39;s<br/>\ncompany history book. The book says that Daimaru avoided being burned<br/>\ndown due to Oshio&#39;s words.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatsuzakaya Holdings Co., Daimaru&#39;s negotiating partner for management<br/>\nintegration, has a company history comparable to Daimaru&#39;s.<br/>\nMatsuzakaya originated from a kimono fabric shop opened in 1611 by Ito<br/>\nRanmaru, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga (1534-82) in present-day Nagoya.<br/>\nHijikata Toshizo (1835-69), an executive member of the Shinsengumi<br/>\n(literally, newly selected group) dedicated to support the Tokugawa<br/>\nshogunate, is said to have worked as an apprentice at its Ueno branch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, the Daimaru-Matsuzakaya merger talks represent those between two<br/>\nshops with long-standing traditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two department store chains, which have their own traditions and<br/>\ncorporate cultures, are reportedly approaching each other to seek<br/>\neconomies of scale through management integration against the<br/>\nbackground of a market that has been shrinking in size due to the<br/>\ndecline in the population--yet another area over which the declining<br/>\nbirthrate has cast a shadow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two merchant shops evolved into leading department store chains<br/>\nafter surviving the turbulent years at the end of the Tokugawa<br/>\nshogunate, depressions, defeat in the war, oil crises and the bursting<br/>\nof the economic bubble. Now each of them finds it difficult to go it<br/>\nalone as a consequence of demographic change.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaiku poet Hiryoshi Tagawa composed a poem that reads:<br/>\n<br/>\nA line of students<br/>\n<br/>\non a school excursion trip<br/>\n<br/>\npassing through Daimaru<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me of a line of students walking through sales floors<br/>\nwhile looking around pleasantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading newspaper stories on the Daimaru-Matsuzakaya merger<br/>\nplan, I think of department stores as places that glitter with<br/>\nchildren as a source of light.<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright 2007 The Daily Yomiuri</div>",
