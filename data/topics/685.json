In the future I hope<br/>\nto babel all of 3-hajime&#39;s pages and store them offline for reference<br/>\nas well.  And I don&#39;t need to warn you about how the fish warp&#39;s the<br/>\nJapanese language---however many of 1to5.net&#39;s pages are easier to<br/>\nunderstand than 3-hajime it depends on how the webmaster writes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy purpose for doing this is <br/>\n1) 1to5.net is currently experiencing server downtime and many pages<br/>\nwill result in messages like &quot;document contains no data or server<br/>\ncannot be found&quot;<br/>\n2) It is very very painful to keep logging onto the net and<br/>\nbabelfishing the same pages for just a tiny bit of info<br/>\n<br/>\nI zipped all 52 pages of 1to5.net <br/>\nthe file size is 775 kb<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3\">http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3</a><br/>\npassword: makoto<br/>\nfilename:1to5<br/>\n<br/>\n[please] retain files for private use only as reference<br/>\nI&#39;m only doing this to save us some time and headaches when using the<br/>\nfish...and yes, I have also tried to contact the owner of 1to5.net to<br/>\ninform her that I have been referencing her site on shinsengumimb.com<br/>\nand here as well.</div>",
