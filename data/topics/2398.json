Katsura/Kido opposed  the suggestion of military action on Kyoto  - and by extension any more extreme measures he would not likely have favored. <br/>\n <br/>\nRegarding the countercoup (From &quot;Choshu in the Meiji Restoration&quot; by Albert M. Craig  )<br/>\n<br/>\n-&quot;Sufu opposed it, but so also did Takasugi; Nakamura Kyuro, an important member of the Sufu clique, favored it, as did Kusaka.&quot;... (page 223)<br/>\n<br/>\n-&quot;Kido and Yamagata, as well as Takasugi, opposed the idea of a countercoup at this time.  Kijima, like Shoin, demanded action because there ought to be action; he gave little thought to its consequences.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAhh and a very oblique reference to Ikedaya-da. (pg 227)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;On 14/6/64 (June 14, 1684) news came of Bakufu police action against loyalist samurai in Kyoto, in which several Choshu samurai had been slain, among them prominent members of the Choshu loyalist group.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\nred-bird.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Katsura thought that burning Kyoto was stupid. Miyabe <br/>\nTeizou, Yoshida Toshimaro, and Matsuda Juusuke-- the leaders of the group at <br/>\nIkedaya-- were the ones in support of burning Kyoto to the ground, <br/>\nimpersonating Aizu troops, killing Matsudaira Katamori, and kidnapping <br/>\nEmperor Komei, taking him to Choshuu and &quot;reinstating&quot; the government.<br/>\n<br/>\nNHK Katsura, in the very first episode, put it best:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you burn Kyoto to the ground, many people will lose their homes, and <br/>\nmany will die.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Ikedaya, to me, is also a very interesting place to see the <br/>\nattitude of Aizu toward Shinsengumi. Shinsengumi expected Aizu <br/>\nreinforcements, but Aizu took their time-- which makes sense in the light of <br/>\nthe &quot;Shinsengumi as spare parts&quot; theory that I&#39;d been thinking of earlier-- <br/>\nthe idea that if Shinsengumi takes the forefront of the assault, Aizu <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have to dirty its hands as much. Those of you who know PMK can see <br/>\nthis in the Ikedaya episode-- when Katsuya Sakon shows up with the Aizu <br/>\nforces, he&#39;s so hesitant he&#39;s even desperate to keep Kondou from dirtying <br/>\nhis uniform.<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.</div>",
