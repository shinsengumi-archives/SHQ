My hunch is <br/>\nSanada would be the bad guy and Kiichi Nakai is the poor family man <br/>\ncaught in this entire mess LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nJSDF is everywhere in the world of anime most noticeably in the <br/>\nPatlabor 2 directed by Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell and Jin-<br/>\nRoh:The Wolf Brigade).  Mamoru Oshii is fascinated with how the <br/>\npolice and military function, advanced technology and ofcourse naked <br/>\nfemale cyborgs.  In Patlabor 2, no naked female cyborgs ^_^ by the <br/>\nway,  the tension between JSDF and the TMPD Mobile Unit (focus of <br/>\nthe film) is addresed and the director makes some pretty straight <br/>\nforward and highly critical AND controversial comments about <br/>\npolitics, an unjust/just peace, the concept of a just/unjust war and <br/>\nso forth.  I find it fascinating that many anime actually address <br/>\nthe competition(?) and quiet conflict between the police and army <br/>\n(all of which can be traced back to the Seinan War).  Mamoru Oshii <br/>\ndoes not show the police and army attacking one another but he does <br/>\nillustrate the rift between the organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; (I snagged it form a Hiroyuki Sanada <br/>\n&gt; fansite----<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twilightforest.net/sanada/)\">http://www.twilightforest.net/sanada/)</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The title is &quot;Bokoku no Aegis&quot; (&quot;Aegis of ruined country&quot;?? hard <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; translate without reading the original story </span></blockquote></div>",
