            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-661961678\">I see that the gals of the SHQ are at it again :)<br/>\nOfcourse if Tokio shows up she&#39;ll collar the wolf and drag him home!<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted a question at 3-hajime.com as to whether the stage play and<br/>\nthe novel are related and the webmaster answered that they are<br/>\nindependent of one another.  So basically we have Fujita Goro in a<br/>\nplay and in a novel.  Furthermore if you nifty<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/bbs_06.cgi\">http://www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/bbs_06.cgi</a> and check out the reply<br/>\nto my post the name NAGAKURA SHINPACHI shows up very clearly in her<br/>\nreply. Although the translation isn&#39;t clear (is it EVER?) it means<br/>\nthat the writer of either the play [or] novel had the 2 meet ^_^<br/>\nawesome fanfiction we can&#39;t read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading some more Seinan War stuff and found that the soldiers<br/>\nhad 2 major complaints.  Keep in mind that much of the hard fighting<br/>\nwill occur after the month of February and southern Japan supposedly<br/>\nhas hot/humid conditions AND often these guys had to climb<br/>\nhills/mountains.<br/>\n1) uniforms were too hot<br/>\n2) leather boots/shoes extremely uncomfortable and finally the<br/>\nofficials allowed their guys to go back and wear good old straw sandals...<br/>\n*if you examine the pic <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.3-hajime.com/syouzou2.html\">http://www.3-hajime.com/syouzou2.html</a><br/>\nthe sitting next to Fujita Goro was wearing straw sandals <br/>\n<br/>\nWar coverage<br/>\nThere was a strong desire by the government to cover the war in<br/>\ndetail, hence the newspaper article we have which mentions F.G. not<br/>\nsurprisingly the articles may not be 100% accurate, because the gov.<br/>\nwanted people in the cities to stay optimistic (people were wondering<br/>\nwhy it was taking soo long to supress the rebellion---reasons will<br/>\nappear in my write up).  While the war was going on in the south,<br/>\nTokyo was experiencing a series of mysterious fires and arson was<br/>\nsuspected.  Basically people in the city had very good reason to fear<br/>\nthat rebel sympathizers were retaliating.  Furthermore, before the<br/>\nSiege of Kumamoto castle/garrison (in February) there was an earlier<br/>\nnight attack on the same garrison where 300 policeman were killed (I<br/>\nbelieve the number includes injuries? 300 is a very high number the<br/>\nnumber of rebels is not clear)...regardless of how many were killed<br/>\nwhat is clear is that many bodies were found still in bed which<br/>\nreveals the true nature of the attack...it was an inside job AND some<br/>\nofficers, it is BELIEVED by  writers, let the rebels inside the<br/>\ngarrison. Kumamoto had policemen who were natives of Satsuma as well.<br/>\n  This news once it entered the major cities started a whirlwind of<br/>\nrumors amongst the population. In the month of March the gov.<br/>\nattempted to implement &quot;western/modern&quot; strategies which were<br/>\nineffective or incompatible to the rough terrain.</div>",
