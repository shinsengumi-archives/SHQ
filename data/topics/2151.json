He says that it <br/>\nwas made by Chie Uratani, a person who worked on : Kiki&#39;s Delivery <br/>\nService, Memories, Princess Arete and Animatrix.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the person mentionned the official website <br/>\nwww.hijikatatoshizou.com saying that you can find a summary and <br/>\ncharacters&#39;s descriptions there. Also, it is said that you can pre-<br/>\norder the DVD via the website. I do not know if they took the <br/>\ndifferent zones into consideration when saying this...<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, the DVD comes with a bonus: &quot;Sore ike Kanesada-kun !&quot; <br/>\n(25 minutes) and 10 minutes of other bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first picture is the DVD cover, but there are no descriptions of <br/>\nthe following images.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, the conversation shifts and &quot;Hijikata Toshizo : Shiru no <br/>\nKiseki&quot; is not mentionned again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary-Ann</div>",
