            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-8395951\">First of all, welcome, Tama-san ^^ Yoroshiku ^^ It&#39;s<br/>\ngreat to see a Japanese on this list, as it will only<br/>\nenrich more the discussion ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thank you for your welcome messages!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In only book I have now with me called &quot;Shinsengumi<br/>\n&gt; Jitsuroku&quot;(Authentic <br/>\n&gt; records of Shinsengumi), author gives an interesting<br/>\n&gt; analys about Nagakura and <br/>\n&gt; Harada&#39;s secession after retreat from Koshu.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is a resume.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *Nagakura and Harada understand that Kondo<br/>\n&gt; transfered them the right to <br/>\n&gt; command  during the retreat. And Nagakura make a<br/>\n&gt; proposal to march toward Aizu with <br/>\n&gt; current troop strength.<br/>\n&gt; *Nagakura who considers Kondo always as his fellow,<br/>\n&gt; is offended to see Kondo, <br/>\n&gt; now became a direct vassal of Shogun of 300 koku.<br/>\n&gt; *Kondo probably thinks it would be better to recrute<br/>\n&gt; more solders and after <br/>\n&gt; training, he&#39; ll go to Aizu with them as the Supreme<br/>\n&gt; Commander.<br/>\n&gt; *So their discordant is due to different strategic<br/>\n&gt; point of view as well as <br/>\n&gt; their sentimental confrict.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty interesting, since in Nagakura&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&quot; he says explicitly that they<br/>\nparted ways because Kondo wanted to accept Nagakura<br/>\nand Harada&#39;s proposal if and only if he (Kondo) would<br/>\nbe the supreme commander and the others would have to<br/>\nbe his vassals (&quot;kerai&quot;), without mentioning anything<br/>\non this strategic point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have the Bunkyu Roshi Shimatsuki (don&#39;t<br/>\nremember if this was the correct name...) to check<br/>\nthis info, though. The Tenmatsuki is just too<br/>\nnovelized for my liking to be considered a trustworthy<br/>\nsource of info. I prefer Shinsengumi Shimatsuki and<br/>\nIbun in this aspect.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have no intenion to idealize Kondo, may be he<br/>\n&gt; became little bit haughty, <br/>\n&gt; but it was a point of view of Nagakura&#39;s side.<br/>\n&gt; As I know similer condition in the history, I guesse<br/>\n&gt; what might be happened <br/>\n&gt; in a defeated army. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps...<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, changing the subject:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Sesshu (Setsutsu) sumi Ikeda Kijinmaru Kunishige:<br/>\nKunishige is the name of the swordsmith. Sesshu is the<br/>\nname of the place. This is a sword forged in the Tenwa<br/>\nEra and, as of 1986, it was worth about 50,000 US<br/>\ndollars. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a Shinto (newer than Koto and older than<br/>\nShin-Shinto), classified as Jo-josaku (2nd highest<br/>\nclass in the aesthetical aspect) and as a Wazamono<br/>\n(4th highest class in the blade sharpness aspect).<br/>\n<br/>\nSource: &quot;Touken Youran&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) For those who like old anime, try finding an old<br/>\nanime (from the 80&#39;s) called Haguregumo, produced by<br/>\nMad House. It features the Shinsengumi. I haven&#39;t<br/>\nwatched it, but I&#39;ve seen some screenshots of it and<br/>\nit&#39;s gorgeous, mixing sumi-e and ukiyo-e to draw<br/>\nscenes and background.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Nagakura Shinpachi has lots of interesting tales...<br/>\nthe Kashiku pleasure woman thing, the murder of Haga<br/>\nGido (Yoshimichi?), the incident where he drank too<br/>\nmuch with Saitou Hajime and Itou Kashitarou and was<br/>\nalmost condemned to death, the Ryubi no Ken incident<br/>\nwhere he got wounded below the eye, the failed attempt<br/>\nof murder of Kiyokawa Hachiro and others that were<br/>\nalready listed and/or discussed here, like the meeting<br/>\nwith Suzuki Mikisaburo. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider<br/>\nSaigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also<br/>\nplenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo<br/>\nTakamori, who could have understood the plea of<br/>\nYamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed in<br/>\nEdo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were<br/>\ngood men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin side,<br/>\nas well as bad men in both, IMHO :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSerizawa Kamo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
