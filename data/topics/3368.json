I&#39;ll see if I can explain it - Directly inside is the<br/>\n genkan, with a low hanging spear-rack.  Once you get inside the entire<br/>\n building is maybe 40 feet long, all tatami, and then at that time<br/>\n there was a partition where Hirayama Goro was (the partitions are now<br/>\n gone, but the low hanging beams that held them are only about 6.5 feet<br/>\n above the floor.  His &quot;room&quot; was about 8 feet long and maybe about<br/>\n that wide, and then another partition, where Serizawa was. Serizawa&#39;s<br/>\n &quot;room&quot; had direct access to the garden - and by &quot;garden&quot; I mean a<br/>\n really small area that looks like a typical &quot;Japanese garden&quot;. <br/>\n Someone here would know better than I how the attack played out, but I<br/>\n  do remember from the guide that Serizawa stumbled onto the wooden<br/>\n walkway before the garden, and took a left into the Yagi&#39;s sleeping<br/>\n quarters where he was killed.  There is a cut in the top of the<br/>\n doorway there, supposedly from a sword slash from that night.  No<br/>\n pictures were allowed inside or in the garden, unfortunately.  But it<br/>\n is all a pretty small area. It was pretty interesting walking through<br/>\n these rooms that I&#39;d read about.<br/>\n <br/>\n If I have time, I&#39;ll add more pictures tomorrow - I still have about<br/>\n 100 more to go.  I got some great pics of Osaka castle and elsewhere.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n     <br/>\n                                       <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
