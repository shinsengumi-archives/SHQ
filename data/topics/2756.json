Very likely researchers in<br/>\ndifferent cultures will have a unique view of this part of Japanese<br/>\nhistory.  Most of what we have is -just- from the American and British<br/>\nperspective. Please share, we want to learn from you (also include the<br/>\nbook title, author, publisher and publication date).  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, we know there were French soldiers, such as Jules Brunet,<br/>\nin Hakodate RIGHT THERE WITH HIJIKATA....so perhaps between 1869 and<br/>\n2006 a French researcher may have written an article about the French<br/>\ninvolvement in 1869 at the Republic of Ezo.  All these teeny tiny<br/>\ndetails add up and help us understand the conditions in which the<br/>\nShinsengumi (former Shinsengumi technically) fought.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good example is Ernest Satow.  He wasn&#39;t everywhere, nor did<br/>\nhe see everything himself but he did mention &quot;&quot;Aidzu had occupied the<br/>\ncastle of Yodo, a few miles south of Kioto on the direct road, with<br/>\n500 of his own troops, and 300 of the Shinsen-gumi, a recenty raised<br/>\nbody of Tokugawa infantry, had also proceeded thither, while all along<br/>\nthe road small detachments were stationed.&quot; (Satow 305)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t a big deal---but don&#39;t you feel ~better~ that -someone-<br/>\nbothered to note the &quot;Shinsen-gumi&quot; (^_^).  Ok so his perfectly round<br/>\nnumber of Shinsengumi may not be accurate...he couldn&#39;t go and count<br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood topics here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://community.livejournal.com/edo_meiji/\">http://community.livejournal.com/edo_meiji/</a><br/>\nand<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/</a><br/>\ncontains downloadable articles discussing *Bushido* and Inazo Nitobe&#39;s<br/>\nBUSHIDO especially........<br/>\n  <br/>\n----------------------------------------------<br/>\nSatow, Ernest Mason, Sir, 1843-1929.

Unfortunately, <br/>\n&gt; i&#39;ve seen conflicting data on if his Ichimonji blade was mounted in <br/>\n&gt; handachi mounts.
