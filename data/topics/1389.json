            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1473307254\">TV Navi magazine, July issue &quot;special-edition &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; men&#39;s DRAMATIC <br/>\nSTORY&quot; <br/>\nOdagiri Jo:Hajime Saito<br/>\n<br/>\n[What makes the charm of this drama for me is Mr. Mitani&#39;s scenario above <br/>\nall]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most impressive episode for me is the first one, in which showing every <br/>\nmembers gathered, then the drama went back to the past in order to show their <br/>\nlife in Edo. When I saw those members fully equipped for the first time, I&#39;ve <br/>\ngot an idea about the group called Shinsengumi.<br/>\nAlthough half a year has passed, I maintain a certain distance from the <br/>\npersonage of Hajime Saitou to portray him as he has somewhat mysterious image.<br/>\n<br/>\nHajime Saitou has few historical record. I picked up as possible as I could, <br/>\nan outline or a fragment of the man from these restricted information to <br/>\ncreate my own image of him.<br/>\nOf course Mr. Mitani has given me many suggestion about the role, though I <br/>\ndare not tell about it as I&#39;d like to respect the imagination of the audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Ikedaya incident, Saitou takes another action within Hijikata&#39;s unit <br/>\nagain, and he is slipping now in and now out of sight. Since he doesn&#39;t go along <br/>\nwith other members most of time(laugh). <br/>\nAfter this incident, Saitou will go to the direction of his espionage <br/>\nactivity from now on. <br/>\nWhich side his real intention is, on Kondo or Kashitaro Itou? I want to play <br/>\nwith an ambiguous touch toward the so called &quot;Aboura no Kouji incident&quot;. <br/>\nHajime Saito&#39;s keyword would be&quot;the ambiguity&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe attraction of Saitou&#39;s swordplay is its fierceness, and I think it&#39;s <br/>\nbetter to don&#39;t mind about any specific sword style he would have. I think I can <br/>\ndo anything if he would be strong. I care about how I interpret the <br/>\nchoreography given by the sub-director of sword fight scenes.<br/>\nAs I know that historical Saitou excels in thrust, I asked the sub-director <br/>\nto give me more sword fight with this technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes the charm of this drama for me is Mr. Mitani&#39;s scenario above all.<br/>\nI read his script each time with pleasure. Since it finally becomes about 50 <br/>\nvolumes. I&#39;m glad only by thinking that 50 scripts of Mr. Mitani can be got.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************************************<br/>\nTama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
