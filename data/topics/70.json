These include:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. A never-before seen photo of Matsudaira Katamori, which shows how truly <br/>\nyoung he was in those days.<br/>\n2. Better-quality pictures of Tokugawa Yoshinobu<br/>\n3. Scans from the official NHK &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; Guidebook<br/>\n4. Pictures of Nijo and Aizu Castles<br/>\n5. My own drawings, including Hiro and Yuki (from my Shinsengumi novel), as <br/>\nwell as my own depictions of Shinsengumi members, such as Kondou, Hijikata, <br/>\nOkita, Saitou, Shimada, and Nakajima Nobori.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this will all be put up bit by bit. But I just wanted to let <br/>\neveryone know that there&#39;s a great deal that&#39;s on its way.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Masayoshi<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nFree up your inbox with MSN Hotmail Extra Storage.
