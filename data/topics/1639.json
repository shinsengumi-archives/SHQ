Therefore, it is not strange even <br/>\nif Aizu has him.Incidentally, from formation of Shinsengumi in 1863 <br/>\nto disappearance of Shinsengumi in 1869, only two persons, Shimada <br/>\nKai and Ozeki Masajirou, were on the register in Shinsengumi, and <br/>\nlived to Meiji Era.) <br/>\nAccording to the photograph of Dvc00610, my answer seemed to be the <br/>\ncorrect answer.^^ <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the again lovely photographs. <br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",
