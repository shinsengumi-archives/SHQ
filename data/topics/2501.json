There are <br/>\nsome humorous moments in the article (^_^)  ::ice skating::<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is basicallly about Nisshinkan a school for boys in <br/>\nAizu.  Nisshinkan was ranked in the top 5 schools of Japan before <br/>\n1868 (I read somewhere it was #3).  It educated boys who later were <br/>\npart of the Byakkotai when the domain was besieged by the Imperial <br/>\nArmy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll domains are unique and this article focuses only on Aizu&#39;s <br/>\nNisshinkan however I assume that some of the disciplinary codes may <br/>\nbe easily found elsewhere in Japan---it is part of samurai culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, when I researched Takagi Tokio by examining her <br/>\nfamous cousin, Takamine Hideo, his biographer emphasized Nisshinkan <br/>\nbecause the dorms for young women in Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School <br/>\nemulated the &quot;format&quot; of Nisshinkan (which is not surprising given <br/>\nHideo&#39;s background as Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s page).  Ironically, <br/>\nduring the early days of the Meiji era dorms for boys lacked <br/>\ndiscipline, it was in the 1890s when they returned to their more <br/>\nSpartan roots.  Hence, the article was significant for me because <br/>\nthe three people from Aizu (Takamine Hideo, Takagi Tokio and <br/>\nYamakawa Futaba) all would&#39;ve been very familiar with <br/>\nthe &quot;traditional&quot; system and made some adaptions in the Meiji Era.<br/>\n<br/>\n[notes for the article]<br/>\nThe idea of the oldest student supervising the younger ones is <br/>\ncalled self-governance---something emphasized in the dorms Takagi <br/>\nTokio supervised. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading out loud still continued into the Meiji Era.  Many <br/>\nwesterners who taught at Tokyo University commented that some of <br/>\ntheir students had to learn how to read silently when they reached <br/>\nthe university level.  They often saw boys moving their lips as they <br/>\nread.  Reading out loud was believed to help in absorbing the <br/>\nmaterial.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strong emphasis on camaraderie/teamwork ofcourse may reflect on <br/>\nthe sad end of one Byakkotai unit.</div>",
