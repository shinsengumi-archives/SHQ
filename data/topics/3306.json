Many books do cite newspaper articles and editorials which<br/>\nwaited for the axe to fall on the Japanese conspirators (directly<br/>\nsponsored by the Meiji Gov&#39;s ARMY) in this horrible event of one<br/>\ncountry assassinating the leader of another Asian country. <br/>\n<br/>\nI ofcourse left out Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese war because there<br/>\nwould hundreds of articles (many duplicate info but published in<br/>\ncountless cities across the USA). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe database searches for words in the scans and often the images are<br/>\nso poor due to the newspaper type quality that it&#39;s hard to find the<br/>\nexact article one needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a secondary problem of name spelling.  Enomoto was (I<br/>\nbelieve) spelled correctly in one article and in another place &quot;Heno<br/>\nmoto&quot; (Or something like that).  Remember all the lingo is<br/>\ncharacteristic of the time like &quot;Tycoon&quot; and &quot;Mikado&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nXD</div>",
