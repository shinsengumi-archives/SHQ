In looking for terms for secretarytocapt3 to use, I went back to two articles, one on Sagara and the one we recently had babelfished on Suzuki --- and found a connection that appears to be prior to the Itou Affair.  The problem is the babelfish translation is impossible for me to decipher WHAT is being talked about.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn Dr. FangLang&#39;s Pavement article on Sagara (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4081/colj102.html\">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4081/colj102.html</a> ):<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;In 1863, he worked as a follower of Mito Clan at Tsukuba-san Mountain Riot.
