In<br/>\nthis clip he depicts Ikedaya Jigen.  One voice actor Kiichi Nakai will<br/>\ngo on to play Yoshimura Kani&#39;chiro in MIBUGISHIDEN.  This film is<br/>\nbased on the famous comic by Hiroshi Kurogane.  Back in 2000 the<br/>\nShinsengumi craze had not really taken root yet (aside from Rurouni<br/>\nKenshin based fandom) thus making this small budget venture &quot;lost&quot; to<br/>\nlater fans.  Many online communities love this depiction and I myself<br/>\nadmire the atmosphere and creativity which went into this film.  It<br/>\nwould have been neat if when a sword cuts through someone you hear the<br/>\nsound of tearing paper...<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope fans everywhere will try making their own Shinsengumi films and<br/>\ntry any genre using whatever means you have.  Last year I made<br/>\n&quot;IkeDIEya&quot; using Easter Eggs...it was fun and the exact opposite of<br/>\nKon Ichikawa&#39;s grim black and white approach...I went with a more<br/>\nbright colorful approach because it was &quot;filmed&quot; in my refrigerator. <br/>\nEven if Shinsengumi media such as manga and film have entered a<br/>\ndormant period fans can continue to have fun by producing their work<br/>\nand sharing with a community.<br/>\n<br/>\nI endeavour to report on the progress of the SHQ site very soon so<br/>\nthat all our supporter and donors can see where their contributions went.</div>",
