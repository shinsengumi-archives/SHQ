You will see a guy named Matsudaira Katamori (he <br/>\ngoes to the sumo event at Mibu in disguise).  Matsudaira Katamori is <br/>\nthe daimyo or lord of Aizu, the guy in charge of security in Kyoto <br/>\nand he basically sanctioned the Shinsengumi.  Without Aizu, the <br/>\nShinsengumi would&#39;ve all had to go home or hangout in Kyoto without <br/>\na paycheck. Remember, that episode where Kondou went to talk to <br/>\nMatsudaira Katamori?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Boshin War, 1868 started, Aizu was on the hit list for <br/>\nsupporting the Shogunate.  Satsuma, Choshu etc also wanted to &quot;pay <br/>\nback&quot; Aizu for prior military and political actions.  Aizu was <br/>\ndefended by lots of samurai included a small number of the <br/>\nSHINSENGUMI and JOUSHITAI (Women&#39;s Brigade).  It was one member of <br/>\nthe Joushitai, Yamamoto Yaeko the gun expert, who gave testimony of <br/>\nTAKAGI TOKIO&#39;s whereabouts during the siege and her role in the <br/>\ncastle.  If you want to visit Shinsengumi graves you go to Kyoto, <br/>\nAizu and Hakodate (battles occured at Sendai but Japanese fans never <br/>\nlisted graves there).  You want to visit Fujita Goro&#39;s grave you <br/>\nvisit Aizu.  Aizu is super important basically to the Shinsengumi <br/>\nand specifically to Saitou Hajime/Fujita Goro as he is widely <br/>\nbelieve to be Aizu&#39;s spy in the Shinsengumi.  In the world of <br/>\nKenshin you DO have a woman from Aizu looking for her <br/>\nfamily...MEGUMI! (^_^).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour humble but wordy servant,<br/>\nsecretarytocapt3<br/>\nsome interesting updates will go online soon at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a></div>",
