(takes off white gloves)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my &#39;subdomain&#39;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/index.html\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/index.html</a><br/>\nbasically I set up a template and stuff...the links should work but no<br/>\ncontent yet...it took me a long time to figure out how to reduce the<br/>\nfile size for the pics and I had to put filters on many because for<br/>\nsome reason the scanner I used just wasn&#39;t doing a great job...so the<br/>\npics on the right hand side look &quot;artsy&quot; even though I intended to use<br/>\nthe images in their original form.<br/>\n<br/>\nokay...I have scans from books I want to put up...now would it be<br/>\n&quot;safer&quot; to keep uploading pics here in SHQ or put them on a public<br/>\nwebsite (but cite the book/author/isbn etc right on the pic)...I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to get sued :)  I purposefully used pics from Nobori<br/>\nNakajima because I figure that there is no copyright on them (at least<br/>\nI hope not)...but I will put a disclaimer thing on the bottom of all<br/>\npages.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  I would be more than happy to combine this site with any other<br/>\nShinsengumi site out there (SHQ site or Shimazuryu&#39;s) mainly because I<br/>\nbelieve in one super Shinsengumi headquarters which can address the<br/>\n&quot;needs&quot; of this community.....once construction is done you change<br/>\nyour password to the account and I no longer have access...I did this<br/>\nbefore for a non-profit org and it was a good arrangement.  I only<br/>\nwork with html/dreamweaver non of that fancy stuff so once I&#39;m done<br/>\nyou can easily change/update content as need be...you have my email.</div>",
