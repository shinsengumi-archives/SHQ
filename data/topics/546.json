Shintoism is big on purification for example the<br/>\nmarking of sacred areas and the significance of water but that is<br/>\nmerely the beginning.

I can imagine<br/>\nthat they were concerned about it leaking to the general public<br/>\nbecause the Ishin Shishi could definately &quot;spin&quot; it to encourage their<br/>\nfollowers that the Shinsengumi were not so invincible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe website you brought up is awesome (I added it to the website<br/>\ndatabase back on Miburo Yahoo Groups).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe text resource it used are well accepted (Ikedaya info)<br/>\nHillsborough, Romulus.

Sounds like an interesting religion from what I do know about it,though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as why the Shinsengumi kept Okita&#39;s condition secret goes, I always thought it had more to do with them being afraid the group would be demoralized if they found out their strongest member had a fatal illness. This just adds a new twist to it. Maybe they were afraid some of their followers would think it was a sign the Shinsengumi were angering the kami or something? Knowing how forward-thinking Hijikata was, I can&#39;t see him giving in to superstitions. He had a very practical reason for hiding Okita&#39;s condition I&#39;m sure, but that doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t recognize what the knowledge might lead others to think.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about the other stuff?

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1682349345\">Ok, I ran across an anime site that had info about the shop the <br/>\nShinsengumi raided just before the Ikedaya incident and the Ueno War. <br/>\nIt also had an odd fact about TB. It&#39;s not much mind you and a lot of <br/>\nfolks might have already run across this. Also, I&#39;m not even sure <br/>\ntheir information is accurate. The Ueno War thing seemed pretty <br/>\ninteresting to me though, because I&#39;ve never run across ANYTHING on <br/>\nit before, other than the name. Probably I&#39;m the only dummy here who <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know this. -_-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site in question is:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.koyagi.com/ACPages/ACmain.html\">http://www.koyagi.com/ACPages/ACmain.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMasuya - That was the name of the store the Shinsengumi raided as we <br/>\nall know. The merchant who ran it called himself &quot;Kiemon&quot;, but he was <br/>\nreally a Choshu samurai named Kotaka Shuntaro. The Shinsengumi found <br/>\nout about him supposedly by following one of Miyabe Teizo&#39;s servants <br/>\nback to the place. (He was staying there at the time.) Of course they <br/>\ncaptured the owner and tortured him and weapons found hidden in the <br/>\nshop. But here&#39;s what confused me. Both from the RK OVA and the <br/>\nPeaceMaker anime, I thought that the incident at the Ikedaya took <br/>\nplace either later that same day or the next day? It says here that <br/>\nit took place &quot;less than a week later&quot;? This implies to me that at <br/>\nleast a couple days passed. Anyone care to clarify or object to this?<br/>\n<br/>\nUeno War - I knew that the group known as the Shogitai (the group <br/>\nthat Harado joined) were defeated in the Ueno War. Until now that&#39;s <br/>\nall I could find out. I couldn&#39;t even come up with a date. (Some of <br/>\nyou scholars have been holding out with the info, haven&#39;t you?) <br/>\nAccording to this site, they formed in March of 1868 and served as an <br/>\ninformal police force in Edo. They were headquartered in the temple <br/>\nof Kanei-ji in Ueno. The city was surrendered, but they refused to <br/>\nstop resisting the Imperialists and were defeated in a battle that <br/>\ntook place on July 4, 1868. Much of the temple was destroyed in the <br/>\nfighting. Some survivors then went on to fight in Hokkaido. Of <br/>\ncourse, Harada is generally thought to have died in that battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nKetsukaku - The name for TB in Japan. The site said that Shinto <br/>\ntradition thought it was a polluting diease. Both the sufferer and <br/>\ntheir family were stigmatized by it and even today people who had <br/>\nsomeone with it in their family history have a harder time getting <br/>\nmarried.
