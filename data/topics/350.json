            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1429235774\">This biography, if it exists, is probably locked in the same vault as the dream diary. -_-  The post where I saw this was talking specifically about books that had written about the Shinsengumi and Saito, and then mentioned that he was supposed to have wrote his own account. I wonder if they could have heard that same rumor about the dream diary and misunderstood? I didn&#39;t think about that possibility before.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the Seiza thing. That reminds me of a story about Rob Roy MacGregor of Scotland. He had his family help him off his death bed so he could meet an old foe who dropped by in a way that wouldn&#39;t seem &quot;weak&quot;. Perhaps that was part of what Saito was trying to accomplish? He wanted to meet death in a way that befitted a samurai? I don&#39;t mean this as a contradiction of what you&#39;re saying. I think it goes hand in hand with it rather. Just a thought.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-947455618\">Miburo site---you mean our old yahoo group right?<br/>\nThis is mentioned on www.3-hajime.com that he wrote a &quot;dream diary&quot;<br/>\naccording to babelfish (located in the puzzles section) and gave it to<br/>\na relative however it has never been found.  It goes in the rumor or<br/>\nfolktale section...but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he did because other<br/>\nformer members of the Shinsengumi wrote their accounts to.  Besides<br/>\nNagakura SHinpachi, Nobori Nakajima also wrote a record. They lived so<br/>\nintensely and I&#39;m sure they needed to think about what they were doing<br/>\netc.  If it did exist he must&#39;ve given it someone who would take care<br/>\nof it...somewhere out there...<br/>\n<br/>\nmy own speculation (so it is worthless:P):<br/>\n1) it wouldn&#39;t just be about the Shinsengumi it would be about<br/>\nswordsmanship and some of his spiritual beliefs as well...this is<br/>\nbased on my overall opinion from reading stuff on the 2 Japanese sites<br/>\nand other messageboards...<br/>\na. from how he died he must&#39;ve practiced meditation throughout his<br/>\nlife...and on 3-hajime.com it kinda details that he sat like this<br/>\nthroughout the night...took some time and lots of will power that<br/>\nisn&#39;t mustered at the last moments of your life but through lifelong<br/>\ncultivation.<br/>\nb. If he did indeed practice Mugai Ryu kenjutsu then he would attempt<br/>\nto study/realize its spiritual dimension based on Buddhism...many<br/>\n&quot;ryus&quot; are heavily mixed with either<br/>\nShintoism/Buddhism/Zen/Confucianism (all or three but the older the<br/>\nschool the more Shinto it is)...the more advanced your martial arts<br/>\nlevel so to speak the more abstract you get (abstract can also mean<br/>\ntrying to realize the most simple basic tenets of your art though).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;warg3791&quot; &lt;Warg3791@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; OK, so I was going through some of the posts over on the Miburo site <br/>\n&gt; and I came across something rather interesting.
