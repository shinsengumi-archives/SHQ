Watson. I recommend this short book for people<br/>\nwho are interested in martial arts bios and getting a crash course in<br/>\nhow &quot;fun&quot; education can be during the Meiji Era...<br/>\n<br/>\nI updated <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a> with a few<br/>\nbrief paragraphs of info regarding these details and a quote of Kano<br/>\nhiring good kendo teachers for Tokyo Normal School (called Teacher<br/>\nTraining College in this book).  Many people knew that Kano&#39;s student,<br/>\nSaigo Shiro was the son of Saigo Tanomo, senior retainer of Matsudaira<br/>\nKatamori.  How would Mr. and Mrs. Fujita miss this? <br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a really really long time to get confirmation on a minor<br/>\ndetail regarding Tokio&#39;s friend.  Please see<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm</a><br/>\nclick on &quot;Memories of Tokio&quot; <br/>\nand read near the end of the paragraph, <br/>\nI also added a pic of Tokio&#39;s much older friend Takamine Kinoko.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMore information including on her can be found here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nKinoko was an interesting older woman (she was not shy at all)<br/>\nwho also recorded what<br/>\nhappened to her and her family after the defeat of the Aizu domain.<br/>\nThus, her narrative is one of the few written by a woman in that<br/>\nsituation (at this time I cannot find any record written by an Aizu<br/>\nwoman which has been published).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally I found it funny that this elderly lady Takamine Kinoko<br/>\ndragged her grand daughters to the Fujita household---because<br/>\naccording to the American scientist Edward Morse, she also was a<br/>\nbabysitter to a herd of boys (maybe? the Fujita boys too?)<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm</a><br/>\nclick on &quot;Normal School This and That&quot;<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to revise the timeline&#39;s format here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm</a> <br/>\n[scroll down to 1919]<br/>\n<br/>\nI used the Watson book to get more solid info on the ultimately severe<br/>\nprotesting by the faculty, and alumni of the Normal School (where both<br/>\nFujita Goro and Tokio were employed).  The most open opposition shown<br/>\nby these educators occurred after Mr. Fujita died...however Tokio was<br/>\nstill very much alive to observe these movements at the school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou will note that I am not saying either Mr. or Mrs. Fujita was in<br/>\nany way involved or if they agreed or disagreed with any of this. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless both kept their eyes and ears closed at work they would be very<br/>\nmuch aware of these incidents. The school was pretty small and run<br/>\nlike a &quot;family&quot; even if Mrs. FUjita was retired it would be hard for<br/>\nnot to take an interest in these situations (covered by national<br/>\nnewspapers).  Tokio would have co-workers/friends and students still<br/>\nthere and she would feel a deep attachment to her workplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other English texts, no specific dates were recorded for<br/>\n***earlier*** &quot;threats&quot; by the faculty/staff of the Normal School<br/>\nwhich should have occurred at the very beginning of the 20th century<br/>\n[during Fujita Goro years] and not just before the 1920s.  These were<br/>\nall well coordinated efforts where teachers would sign petitions draw<br/>\nup lists and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Threats&quot; being mass walk outs to protest the Ministry of education&#39;s<br/>\nstubborness in increasing pay and so forth.  Walk outs and<br/>\nresignations were SIGNATURE tactics for these pesky teachers (^_^).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that mass protests were discouraged by the Meiji gov.<br/>\nwhich had a distaste for such public displays (which occurred shortly<br/>\nafter the Russo-Japanese war in 1905)...these teachers faced possible<br/>\narrest and imprisonment (a small handful of teachers were banished<br/>\nfrom Tokyo earlier in the era for political reasons).</div>",
