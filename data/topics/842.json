            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-54968544\">More from the book on Saigo, The Last Samurai. This time about the <br/>\nShogitai. This is the group Sano Harada joined after parting with the <br/>\nShinsengumi. Most believe he died during this battle, commonly known <br/>\nas the Ueno War. It&#39;s a whole paragraph, so I&#39;ll quote the whole <br/>\npassage for you:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...In both Edo and the northeast there was talk of continued war <br/>\nagainst the &quot;wicked traitors&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaigo faced this looming crisis firsthand in Edo. The city was <br/>\npatrolled by the Shogitai, or &quot;League to Demonstrate Righteousness,&quot; <br/>\na newly formed brigade of former shogunal soldiers. These troops had <br/>\nhelped keep peace and order during the surrender of Edo Castle, but <br/>\nnow they bristled at the thought of abandoning the shogun&#39;s capital <br/>\nto Satsuma forces. From their base at Kan&#39;eiji Temple at the top of <br/>\nUeno Hill they mocked imperial troops, and by 1868/i4 they had begun <br/>\nattacking imperial patrols. Katsu attempted to restrain them, but to <br/>\nno effect. Saigo, although concerned, was reluctant to rush a <br/>\nconfrontation. With so many imperial troops in the northeast and <br/>\nrural Kanto, imperial forces in Edo were actually outnumbered. At a <br/>\ncommand meeting on 5/1 Saigo argued against attacking until <br/>\nreinforcements arrived, but the Choshu commander, Omura Masujiro, <br/>\ndisagreed. The imperial government had plans to make Edo its new <br/>\ncapital, and shogunal forces would therefore have to be eliminated. <br/>\nSaigo still had his reservations, but when the Shogitai escalated its <br/>\nattacks on Satsuma forces, he relented. The final assault was set for <br/>\n5/15. At dawn that day imperial forces attacked the Shogitai. <br/>\nSatsuma&#39;s forces rushed the gates of Kan&#39;eiji head-on and met fierce <br/>\nresistance. After a frustrating delay, Choshu forces launched an <br/>\nattack on the rear of the temple compound, but not before Satsuma had <br/>\nsuffered heavy losses. Despite the poor coordination and the <br/>\nShogitai&#39;s superior numbers, by evening the Shogitai was defeated. <br/>\nThe shogunal capital was now an imperial capital. Two months later <br/>\nthe city was renamed Tokyo, or &quot;Eastern Capital&quot;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo mention of who lead the Shogitai still. Katsu refers to Katsu <br/>\nKaishu, who was at one point in charge of the Tokugawa armed forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
