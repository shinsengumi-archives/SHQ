If you guys have any more questions, feel  free to send me a mail ^^<br/>\n  <br/>\n  ~ * ~ * ~<br/>\n  When the window first opens you get a pop up with some  freaky looking dude.   Just hit the  Continue button.   The next screen has  4 areas to fill out, fill them out and then hit Cancel and NOT OK.<br/>\n              Next you will see only a blank screen.   On the line all the way to the bottom type  in /server aurora.caelestia.net and hit enter.   The screen called mIRC Favorites will  appear.   On the right, click on the  button Add.   Under channel type in  #ShinsengumiHQ and hit the add button all the way in the bottom.   This will take you back to the previous page  and have the channel highlighted.   All  you do from there is either doubleclick on the chatroom name or highlight it  and hit join on the right of the popup.<br/>\n   Hopefully that is helpful.   I know, I know, its a bit confusing at first  (I got extremely confused when I first did this).   Well, hope to see you guys in there ^_^<br/>\n    <br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
