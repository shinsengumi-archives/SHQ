            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-612267643\">1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you<br/>\nwould like us to <br/>\nknow about you)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is simply Yuki. (Real name Yukiko) Screen Name<br/>\nfor everything: KoujiDaisuki76   (Yea yea you all know<br/>\nwhat it means. ^_^x) Or you can call me the name<br/>\nsecretary calls me. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) How did you discover the Shinsengumi?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was watching Good Will Hunting I think. My sister<br/>\nknowing I was obsess with Japanese History and Rurouni<br/>\nKenshin switched the channels and what you know<br/>\nShinsengumi !<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nHai! My Favorite Shinsengumi member is Hijikata<br/>\nToshizou becasue I admire his personality and I can<br/>\nrelate to him in certain ways. He became my favorite<br/>\ncharacter when I found out that he was once a farmer<br/>\nand how he worked hard to be part of history. Kondo<br/>\nIsami did the same I know but Hijikata to me is more<br/>\ninteresting. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor ceratin reasons I don&#39;t like Okita Souji as much<br/>\nas the other members. My other second favorite<br/>\nShinsengumi Member is Yamanami Keisuke or Saitou<br/>\nHajime (Can&#39;t decide) and My third favorite would be<br/>\neither Harada Sanosuke or Todou Heisuke.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>\n<br/>\nUm. Nhk Shinsengumi. One episode of Shinsengumi<br/>\nkepproku(Sry if I spelled it wrong) I would liek to<br/>\nwatch Gohatto. Peace Maker Kurogane, Rurouni Kenshin.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film<br/>\n(or series) do you <br/>\nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and<br/>\nwhy?<br/>\n<br/>\nUh huh, Nhk Shinsengumi best captured Hijikata<br/>\nToshizou and Yamanami. If you compare the pictures, to<br/>\nme Hijikata looks like the orignal one. I can&#39;t really<br/>\nsay Nhk best captured Yamanami though, since I haven;t<br/>\nread much about him. But I do love Hijikata in NHK.<br/>\nKouji Yamamoto did a great job protraying him.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you<br/>\nabout any <br/>\nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Kondo died, what excatly did Hijikata do? I know<br/>\nhe went up North and died by a bullet shot but are<br/>\ntheir any details about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nKoujiDaisuki76<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI Love Kouji<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
