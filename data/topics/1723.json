He was one of 4 <br/>\nassassins working for the ShiShi and was from Higo.  After the war <br/>\nwas over he raised a stink about the direction the government was <br/>\nmoving in and raised a stink about it.  He was thereafter found <br/>\nguilty on some trumped up charges and executed.  Far as I know <br/>\nthough he was only occasionally called Hitokiri Gensai, never <br/>\nBattousai.  Watsuki had even said he used Kawakami as one of the <br/>\nmodels for Kenshin.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiten Mitsurugi Ryu DID NOT exist.  I&#39;m fairly certain I read an <br/>\ninterview when Watsuki Nobuhiro said he invented the style for his <br/>\nKenshin style.  (I&#39;m gonna have to bookmark that interview next time <br/>\nI manage to find it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sakabato also never existed.  It&#39;s a creation for the manga.  A <br/>\nwhile ago a custom smith named Rick Barret made it for a customer.  <br/>\nHowever, it was never used by any samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, what that kid goes off about, is a bunch of things I&#39;ve <br/>\nneither heard about let alone believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Hirotada Tokugawa&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just got this in one of the other groups I&#39;m in.
