The bit below <br/>\nis my combination of pages 96-97, as well as information I&#39;ve previously <br/>\nposted here about Kondou and Nagai Naoyuki.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigns on the 9th of December, 1867. On the <br/>\nevening of the 12th, Yoshinobu, Matsudaira Katamori, and Matsudaira Sadaaki <br/>\nleave for Osaka. The Shinsengumi gets assigned to guard duty at Nijo <br/>\nCastle-- and while there, gets the Mito domain annoyed. Thus, rather <br/>\nconveniently-- Nagai Naoyuki gets ready to leave for Osaka, and takes the <br/>\nShinsengumi with him on the 14th. Shinsengumi sets up temporary headquarters <br/>\nin Osaka at the Tenmangu Shrine, and on the 15th, is ordered to duty at the <br/>\nFushimi-bugyosho (Fushimi Magistrate&#39;s Headquarters), near Kyoto, in <br/>\nFushimi.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO...to make a long story short-- Yoshimura Kanichiro (of &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; <br/>\nfame) and Yamazaki Susumu go on ahead of the main force to set things up in <br/>\nFushimi, and the main body of Shinsengumi arrives on the 16th.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Shinsengumi was there, Kondou continued to make business trips to Nijo <br/>\nCastle. However, on the 18th, on his way back, he was attacked and shot by <br/>\nthe remnants of Ito Kashitaro&#39;s Goryoeji faction, under Abe Juurou. Thus, <br/>\nKondou was sent to Osaka and cared for by the Shogun&#39;s physician, Matsumoto <br/>\nRyojun (who later went to Aizu). As a result, Hijikata was the one who <br/>\ncommanded Shinsengumi at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",

However, I<br/>\nrealize that probably a large portion of the show is made up for tv<br/>\nwatchers but I was hoping that somebody could give me some information<br/>\non them. Most sites I have been to only repeat the same thing over and<br/>\nover. There are a few members im really interested in(no offense to<br/>\nothers):<br/>\n1.Shinpachi Nagakura<br/>\n<br/>\n2.Hajime Saito<br/>\n<br/>\n3.Soji Okita<br/>\n<br/>\n4.Sanosuke Harada<br/>\n<br/>\n5.Isami Kondo<br/>\n<br/>\n6.Toshizo Hijikata<br/>\n<br/>\n7.Their spies<br/>\n        Any info that somebody could email me or post would greatly be<br/>\nappreciated. I&#39;m still ignorant when it comes to alot of this but<br/>\nhopefully with this site I can learn more about the history of the<br/>\nshinsengumi.Thank you</div>",
