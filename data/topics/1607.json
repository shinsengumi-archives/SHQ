Information on the film can be found at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060277/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060277/</a> .  For those new to the list, this film contains little tidbits concerning the formation of the Shinsengumi (look for Kondou & Serizawa at the tournament) and the ending is... wow!  A definite samurai classic, very much worth watching, directed by Okamoto Kihachi (director of two of my favorites, &quot;Kill&quot; and &quot;Red Lion&quot;) and starring Mifune Toshiro and Nakadai Tatsuya.<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (who promises to send a film update later today... maybe go back to listing films in the list homepage calendar)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
