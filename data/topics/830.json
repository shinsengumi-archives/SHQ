This whole idea that members of the Sekihoutai did survive, that perhaps it was only the first patrol (Sagara&#39;s patrol) that was executed, is still too new to me.  Watsuki really gave the strong impression that it was the *entire* Sekihoutai that was wiped out.  Who knows... maybe Suzuki was really the sole survivor (though somehow I doubt it... I&#39;m still amazed so many Shinsengumi survived when earlier readings I did gave the impression they were destroyed almost to a man).<br/>\n <br/>\nIf nothing else, it dislodges the possibility that Saigou might&#39;ve done it for personal reasons as the only motive in my own thinking (which is kind of a relief, actually), that there were extenuating circumstances (still not Sagara&#39;s fault... he was following orders in a war) that might lead others to want his blood.  It was still a wretched thing to do... Sagara remains an absolute scapegoat... I still hate Saigou and believe he was at the heart of it... but at least it muddies the water so he doesn&#39;t have to be such a purely self-motivated person.  I mean, I still think he was a megalomaniac, but I can see how he could want his legend to be associated with the salvation of Japan, that sacrificing Sagara was worth it in his mind to strengthen the whole.  Do I have any hope that that makes *any* sense?<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (who thought Suzuki surviving was angst enough to throw into SaiSa... now I&#39;ve got Sagara as a Satsuma retainer... though I guess Sagara was dead before personal hatred of Satsuma would&#39;ve *really* touched Saitou??? Wasn&#39;t it over the Battle of Aizu that the hatred became intense?)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-30576741\">Just picked up the book The Last Samurai, The Life and Battles of <br/>\nSaigo Takamori by Mark Ravina, published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. <br/>\n(2004) ISBN#0-471-08970-2<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be a while before I have a chance to read it thoroughly, but <br/>\nI thought some folks in the group (YES, I mean Phil) would like to <br/>\nknow what it had to say about Sagara Sozo. It&#39;s really irritating <br/>\nthat there are only TWO references to him in the entire book, esp. <br/>\nsince it fails to mention that he was with the Sekihoutai or that he <br/>\nwas executed by the new government Saigo helped set up. What is <br/>\nreally infuriating however it that an order Saigo gave to Sagara <br/>\nseems like it could have played some role in that latter&#39;s eventual <br/>\nexecution. Here are the two passages in question:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Saigo now realized that peace and order favored Keiki and gave a <br/>\nminor order with major reprecussions. In mid-1867/10 he ordered <br/>\nSagara Sozo, a Satsuma retainer, to gather ronin and to foment <br/>\ngeneral chaos in Edo. Using Satsuma&#39;s villa in the Mita district as <br/>\ntheir headquarters, Sagara and his men ransacked merchant warehouses, <br/>\nset fire to shogunal property, and attacked Edo police officers. If <br/>\nKeiki had the upper hand in the imperial court, Saigo would draw him <br/>\ninto the street.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen later it says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The stalemate was broken on 12/28 when Keiki received news from Edo. <br/>\nFive days earlier, after weeks of rumors that Satsuma agents were <br/>\nplanniing to attack Edo Castle, a suspicious fire had broken out and <br/>\ndestroyed the castle women&#39;s quarters. That same evening someone had <br/>\nshot at the Edo villa of Shonai domain, a close shogunal ally. When <br/>\nmen from Shonai gave chase, the assailants had fled through the city <br/>\nto the Satsuma villa. These events came on the heels of weeks of <br/>\nbrigandage attributed to Satsuma-led ronin. Edo officials were <br/>\noutraged, indignant, and ready to fight. On 12/25 they attacked and <br/>\nburned the Shimazu villa, killing several men. In Edo, if not in <br/>\nKyoto, war had broken out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe crisis in Edo was Saigo&#39;s handiwork, the result of his orders to <br/>\nSagara Sozo, and the plan had finally pushed Keiki into a corner. <br/>\nKeiki was willing, if not eager, to step down as shogun and to <br/>\nsurrender responsibility for the quagmire of foreign affairs. But the <br/>\nattack on Edo Castle and the Shonai villa challenged Keiki&#39;s dignity <br/>\nas a warrior...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, this is what led to the battle of Toba-Fushimi. Why do <br/>\nthey always leave the what the REAL fighters do out of the history <br/>\nbooks?! They don&#39;t even mention the Shinsengumi ONCE!!! How can you <br/>\nNOT mention the Shinsengumi?! There does appear to be a bit more <br/>\nabout the group Sano Harada fought with however, so maybe I&#39;ll learn <br/>\nsomething interesting there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I have to speculate what part the terror Saigo had <br/>\nSagara cause in Edo could have played in the Sekihoutai Captain&#39;s <br/>\neventual execution. Those of you who read Remembering Aizu will <br/>\nrecall that there were rumors of attacks in Edo. It was most likely <br/>\nthese assaults by the Sekihoutai they were hearing about. It seems <br/>\nlikely to me that after all was said and done, someone came to Saigo <br/>\nand said, &quot;Now would you care to explain just what the #### happened <br/>\nin Edo?!&quot; And the lying snake just shrugged and said &quot;Ask Sagara.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from that book, there were three others about samurai that were <br/>\nsupposed to be translated from texts that instructed them on <br/>\ndifferent rules, etiquettes, etc. I&#39;ll try to post some stuff from <br/>\nthem later, along with the titles, ISBN#s, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin (Saigo.
