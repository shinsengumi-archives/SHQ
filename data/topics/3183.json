            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1484673975\">Shinsengumi, during Aizu&#39;s effort to take Shirakawa in 1868, was posted to <br/>\nShirasaka Barrier outside Shirakawa, in an effort to repulse the Imperial <br/>\nJapanese Army&#39;s offensive (see pp. 310-311 of Yamakawa Kenjiro&#39;s book &quot;Aizu <br/>\nBoshin Senshi&quot;). Yamakawa Kenjiro notes that at this point, it was under the <br/>\ncommand of Yamaguchi Jiro-- also known as Saitou Hajime. While this briefly <br/>\nrepelled the Imperial army, the local population betrayed the Allied armies <br/>\nof the north and forced them to retreat. Chief among these traitors was the <br/>\nvillage headman of Shirasaka Village, named Odaira Hachiro, who had guided <br/>\nthe Imperial forces in this battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter Aizu retainer Tanabe Gunji. In 1868, Tanabe Gunji was young-- 18 years <br/>\nof age. He survived the war and went, together with other Aizu samurai, to <br/>\nexile in Tonami, in the far north of the main Japanese island of Honshu. <br/>\nDuring his exile he heard of what this Odaira Hachiro had done. Unable to <br/>\nleave matters at that, he slipped out of Tonami, and after a month on the <br/>\nroad, arrived in Shirakawa.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a scene that must have been quite horrific, Gunji found Hachiro and <br/>\nkilled him. After doing so, he immediately committed suicide. (His grave is <br/>\nto be found in the cemetery for Aizu samurai at Matsunami, in Shirakawa <br/>\nCity) (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://baragaki.fc2web.com/aizukanjinbutsu/jintanabe.htm\">http://baragaki.fc2web.com/aizukanjinbutsu/jintanabe.htm</a> for a <br/>\nbrief biography of Tanabe)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis begs the question......if the village headman in question was the <br/>\nheadman of Shirasaka....could he have heard of the betrayal from Saitou <br/>\nHajime, who had been at Shirasaka and was in Tonami at the same time that <br/>\nGunji was?<br/>\n<br/>\nThough we may never know for sure, it&#39;s certainly worth some consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
