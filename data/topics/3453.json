We know samurai woman Yamamoto <br/>\nYae taught many of the young men how to use guns and it was Yae who <br/>\ntold us Tokio cut her hair.  Other than those details from the Boshin War <br/>\nwe know Morinusuke was close to Fujita Goro who taught kenjutsu to <br/>\nthe former&#39;s sons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in a new details (to us) about Morinusuke you can <br/>\nread this post:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/message/606\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/message/606</a><br/>\nwhich uses textual sources and translations by M<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~BCM27946/niijimayae.html\">http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~BCM27946/niijimayae.html</a><br/>\nit tells of Yamamoto Yae and Takagi Goro providing enough suppressing <br/>\nfire against the invading Imperial army to prevent their advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to keep in mind that Takagi was fifteen years old.</div>",
