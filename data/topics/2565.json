And<br/>\nalso, may I ask for the members on this mailing list<br/>\nto help me find another fanfic that I can&#39;t find<br/>\nanymore.   The fic is a RK one, saddly I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember the name of the piece or the author.   The<br/>\nfew chapters that I read started pretty much a few<br/>\ndays before the Ikedaya, it dealed mostly of what the<br/>\nShinsengumi were doing.   One chapter in particular<br/>\ncentered completely around Hijikata discoving a few<br/>\ntradors amoung the ranks (4 men I think) and ordering<br/>\ntheir deaths (when each man was by himself).   After<br/>\nbeing confronted by Hijikata himself, one of the men<br/>\nis willing to commit seppuku and asks for Hijikata to<br/>\nbe his kaishaku.   After the man split his belly open,<br/>\nHijikata picks up the short sword used by the man and<br/>\nwalks away, warning everyone that if they help the<br/>\nman, they will suffer the same faith.   He really was<br/>\ndepicted as a deamon in this part of the fic ...and<br/>\nthats pretty much all I remember about the fic.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Bunneh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

The Palace is safe, the <br/>\nnobles are unharmed. Peace and order have returned to the world.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n(Commentary)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, though I&#39;ve only read part of &quot;Samurai Sketches,&quot; I have <br/>\nnever trusted Romulus Hillsborough-- a man who, despite having never been <br/>\ntrained in critical historical analysis, has the pretense to write &quot;history&quot; <br/>\nbooks which, like your review said, are essentially in support of his own <br/>\nheroes. I have less of a problem with him than with Stephen Turnbull, <br/>\nthough-- a man who, though trained as an historian, writes books (including <br/>\na whole chapter in one of them about Aizu) with GAPING inaccuracies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I am currently working on a full-length (50 or so pages) paper about the <br/>\nAizu domain in teh Bakumatsu period (including Shinsengumi), I feel the need <br/>\nto point out some things that I have noticed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHillsborough is essentially of the Marius Jansen school-- the school of <br/>\nthought which says &quot;Aizu=Tokugawa partisans to the end, end of story.&quot; The <br/>\nfact of the matter is that Aizu was the only domain bound in writing to obey <br/>\nthe Shogunate to the last, but that even so, the internal dissent against <br/>\ngoing to Kyoto was so extreme that Saigo Tanomo and Tanaka Tosa, two of the <br/>\nsenior councilors, went all the way to Edo to beg Katamori to reject it. But <br/>\nmen like Matsudaira Shungaku (this is mentioned in Conrad Totman&#39;s book <br/>\n&quot;Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;) basically gave Katamori a guilt trip, <br/>\nsaying that the Aizu founder Hoshina Masayuki would have taken the job in a <br/>\nheartbeat. Katamori, being adopted, must have felt guilty, so knowing full <br/>\nwell the impact it would have on his domain&#39;s peasants, but also knowing <br/>\nfull well that he had his hands tied in every way imaginable, went to Kyoto. <br/>\nIn the Boshin War, Katamori had long since given up on Yoshinobu, and he and <br/>\nEnomoto Takeaki, far from wanting to reinstate the Shogun, kept begging for <br/>\nmercy and making proposals for peaceful settlements (this is mentioned in <br/>\nthe book &quot;Young Japan&quot;). Katsu Kaishu was also working hard for a peaceful, <br/>\ngenerous settlement for the Tokugawa-- but as in Kyoto with the &#39;extreme&#39; <br/>\nChoshu faction that was attacked by Shinsengumi at Ikedaya-- in Edo, the <br/>\nShogitai-- the REAL &quot;Tokugawa Partisans&quot;-- who I would go so far as to <br/>\ndescribe as &quot;rabid&quot; partisans-- attacked the forces of the new government <br/>\nand thus dashed any hopes for peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Northern Alliance (Oetsu Reppan Domei) is also seen by the Jansen school <br/>\nas being &quot;pro-Tokugawa,&quot; when in fact most of its members were &quot;outer&quot; <br/>\n(tozama) lords, with only a handful of Tokugawa vassal (fudai) domains and a <br/>\ncouple of Tokugawa-branch domains, probably only Aizu and Moriyama or Miharu <br/>\n(not sure which one). Their intentions? As stated in their statement to the <br/>\nforeign powers, &quot;We will destroy the offenders (Satsuma/Choshu). Those who <br/>\nfly before us we shall not pursue; but we will reconquer Japan, that the <br/>\nEmperor may indeed reign over it.&quot; (from &quot;Young Japan&quot;) Thus, it wasn&#39;t a <br/>\nmatter of Shogun vs. Emperor, it was a matter of a grudge that Choshu had <br/>\nagainst Aizu for sponsoring the anti-Choshu expeditions and fighting against <br/>\nthe Choshu &quot;activists&quot; in Kyoto. Hence the reason why Katamori begged for <br/>\nmercy but was not heard-- he was operating under the assumption that what <br/>\nwas going on concerned the Emperor, when in fact it was simply between him <br/>\nand Choshu, and with Choshu surrounding the Emperor (as Aizu had done <br/>\nbefore),�@there would be no answer to his pleas.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither was Rinnoji no Miya, the Imperial prince who led the Northern <br/>\nAlliance, a &quot;second Emperor&quot; like the Northern and Southern Courts <br/>\n(Nanbokucho) era. Though the Northern Alliance adopted a new reign name <br/>\n(Taisei instead of Meiji), Rinnoji no Miya was never referred to as <br/>\n&quot;tenno&quot;-- &quot;Emperor,&quot; though he did take the name of Tobu.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there was extortion and forcible appropriation on both sides. This too <br/>\ndeserves to be studied more closely in order for both sides to be studied <br/>\nproperly. The actions of the Shogitai are particularly unfortunate, in my <br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, what amazes me is that even when Enomoto was in Hokkaido he still <br/>\npractically begged for mercy and a peaceful settlement, saying &quot;We pray that <br/>\nthis portion of the Empire (Hokkaido) may be conferred upon our former <br/>\nmaster, Tokugawa Kamenosuke (Yoshinobu&#39;s adopted son and successor), and in <br/>\nthat case, we shall repay your benificence by our faithful guardianship of <br/>\nthe northern gate.&quot; (&quot;Young Japan,&quot; page 241) Naturally, however, having <br/>\nendured the campaigns in Echigo, Aizu, and Mutsu/Dewa, and the unfortunate <br/>\nepisode of the Shogitai, the new government was in no disposition to listen <br/>\nto such a request, and moved to attack Hokkaido.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is, in the words of General William Tecumseh Sherman, that <br/>\n&quot;war is Hell.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",

He or she strives to provide this valuable service<br/>\nwithout letting personal bias interfere with the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nRomulus Hillsborough, lived in Japan for 15 years and is fluent in<br/>\nJapanese.  So I&#39;m in no position to criticize him as I can&#39;t compare<br/>\nhis sources with his interpretations.  He took on the difficult task<br/>\nof writing the first book on the Shinsengumi in English.  However he<br/>\nmakes no attempt at adopting a dispassionate tone needed in dealing<br/>\nwith this &quot;legal terrorist organization&quot; (121).<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides the constant sarcasm he uses the term &quot;propensity to kill&quot;<br/>\n***atleast over 30 times in the narrative (I stopped counting). <br/>\nHillsborough makes no attempt to add variation to his stock phrase<br/>\n&quot;Okita the genius swordsman&quot;.  He even attempts poetry or add flare to<br/>\nhis prose with the mentioned phrase &quot;propensity to kill&quot;.  You see,<br/>\nthis is why the original title contained the words &quot;bloody legacy&quot;.  I<br/>\nthink most of us will agree that because we are STUDYING A CIVIL<br/>\n[WAR], no one was using rubber bullets nor bamboo swords.  I&#39;ve never<br/>\nheard of a bloodless war.  Atleast he mentions in passing the<br/>\nloyalists who also had a &quot;propensity to kill&quot;.  Almost forgot to<br/>\nmention Kondou and Hijkata&#39;s irrepressible &quot;will to power&quot; (read that<br/>\nphrase 20 times). I did not think his constant use of the &quot;sun<br/>\ngoddess&quot; in her intervention of state affairs was a good idea.  He<br/>\nwanted the goddess to represent &quot;fate&quot; and she had her darlings on the<br/>\nloyalist side.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter completing the book I began to wonder if this Shinsengumi book<br/>\nwas simply written to bolster his previous works on his personal heroes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo this author the people of Kyoto loved the loyalists with all their<br/>\nheart.  I am kicking myself for not recording the book which mentions<br/>\nthat a folk song was written and sung in praise (not by professionals<br/>\nbut peasants) of the Protector of Kyoto.  It may be common sense to us<br/>\nthat many people in the city just wanted to live in peace and could<br/>\ncare less for the politics (either for the bakufu or the Imperialists).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis bibliography is very limited.  He used one of Akama&#39;s books and<br/>\nentirely ignores perhaps her most famous work on Saitou Hajime, which<br/>\nis one of most often cited books on Japanese sites.  Hence, in the few<br/>\nsentences on Saitou Hajime&#39;s life in the Meiji he is said to have<br/>\nwandered southwest to the Takada Han for a while and then moved to<br/>\nTokyo and married a daughter of a retainer from Aizu.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn many stories there is ofcourse more than one version.  Many<br/>\nJapanese sites are able to discuss and post information.  For example<br/>\nthe death of Takeda may have been attributed to a stroke or by<br/>\nSaitou&#39;s hand.  Hillsborough has a few footnotes but he should&#39;ve used<br/>\nthem to more effectively to give a different take on stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe should be credited for introducing the story of Kondou&#39;s daughter<br/>\nOyu (born to his mistres Otaka sister of Miyuki) to the western world.<br/>\n Prior to reading this book I did read a ***fanfic*** translated via<br/>\nnifty which portrays Fujita Goro as helping the daughter of Kondou. <br/>\nAccording to Hillsborough a policeman formerly affiliated with the<br/>\nShinsengumi attempted to save Kondou&#39;s daughter from life in the<br/>\nred-light district. <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise the book provides an ok introduction to the era and details<br/>\nwe never had before.  The limited bibliography may help a serious<br/>\nscholar in the future start his or her work.  If anyone has the money<br/>\nplease consider donating a hard cover copy to your local library.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book proves again that such a subject needs to be studied as a<br/>\ngroup in teams from different perspectives.<br/>\nMr. Hillsborough would&#39;ve also benefited GREATLY from the<br/>\nknowledgeable and open minded Japanese fans.  Amongst those cosplayers<br/>\nand great collectors of Shinsengumi doujinshi are critical thinkers. <br/>\nHe should&#39;ve atleast interviewed the authors of some of the recent books.</div>",

(Finally we have a location for Mibu village with other key patrol areas marked.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of references are provided in two different ways. First a straight list and then organized by book chapters (so you can see where particular statements are taken from).     There seems to be a heavy dependence on a few works in his narratives.    (He also cites himself I believe at least twice, which I have some issues with:)  )   I think there also isn&#39;t really an attempt on his part to evaluate the sources he cites from.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPhotos: Really there are only four.  The images of Kondo and Hijikata have all appeared frequently on the web.   Kondo&#39;s jacket/haori with the skull is also included.  There is one banner from the Hijikata museum that graces the back cover.   As for the woodblock cover, still can&#39;t figure out where it comes from, although it appears to have been provided by Kojima Masataka of the Kojima Museum (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/)\">http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/)</a> .  <br/>\n (It appears to be Satsuma clan based on their headdresses vs. Bakufu.)<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for the role of the Shinisengumi in the deaths of Ito, Takeda and Yamanami, I am not sure that fans of the taiga or anime depictions  will like what is presented here.  It certainly isn&#39;t the noble version of history that the taiga tries to portray.   <br/>\n<br/>\nS</div>",
