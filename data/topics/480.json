            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-644386958\">Hi!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the fourth par of Watsuki&#39;s interview. I didn&#39;t translate the <br/>\nfirst half of it, as the focus was more on Watsuki&#39;s work as an <br/>\nassistant during his teenage years. The second half is what really <br/>\nmatters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true that it&#39;s sad, for Shinsengumi fans, that some ideas <br/>\nexpressed here never were concretise, but reading some of Watsuki&#39;s <br/>\nanswers, I wonder if finally, it&#39;s not a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I let you be judge. The notes at the bottom are the ones of the <br/>\nFrench version, so &quot;he is now about to do it&quot; refers to last summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary-Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I want to draw a hero who evolves along with the series&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- To sum up, Rurouni Kenshin was your first manga, and at first, you <br/>\noften said that you preferred Shojo, but during the Kyoto Arc, you <br/>\ndiscovered how interesting drawing Shonen was. Which kind of manga <br/>\nwill you choose to draw next?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- I will repeat myself, but since I discovered the joys of drawing <br/>\nShonen, I just want to draw more. As Kenshin was the kind of <br/>\ncharacter who is strong from the start, in my next manga, I want to <br/>\npicture a hero who will become stronger and wiser as the time goes <br/>\nby. For that, he will have, of course, to win battles, but it will be <br/>\nclose calls.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And now that Rurouni Kenshin is over?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Does that mean that the hero of your next manga will be a young <br/>\nboy?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Everything is not decided yet, but yes it will be a young boy of <br/>\nabout thirteen or fourteen years old. I will also create another type <br/>\nof character, which I couldn&#39;t picture in Rurouni Kenshin: the strong <br/>\nand powerful heroine.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Doesn&#39;t Kaoru and Misao belong in that category?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- More or less. I would want to picture someone even stronger, at an <br/>\nequal stand with the hero I would also like to create dumb <br/>\ncharacters, as Banjin or Cho, who are pleasures to draw. This time, I <br/>\nwould want to have them as main characters. (laughs) In Rurouni <br/>\nKenshin, the characters were a little too deep, they had internal <br/>\nconflicts, a side of their personality they were hiding and that they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to show to others, etc. This time, I would prefer <br/>\ncharacters who are easy to understand and who, without all of those <br/>\ncomplex character traits, would be better. (laughs).<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- In which era would this story take place? In modern days?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Yes, I&#39;ll stop drawing historical mangas for now. If one day, I <br/>\nwant to draw historical mangas again, I will do it, but until then, I <br/>\nonly wish to draw stories that happen in today&#39;s world.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- You already draw one, &quot;Meteor Strike&quot;, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Yes. There&#39;s that one. (laughs). When I drew it, I was taking two <br/>\nweeks off Rurouni Kenshin and the planning was really tight. There <br/>\nare many things in that manga that I would have like to change, and <br/>\nwhen I read it back, I can see that it was a very moronic story, but <br/>\nit&#39;s not that bad. (laughs). At least, they didn&#39;t let me write a <br/>\nstory where Kenshin was hit by a meteor. (laughs).<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- The episode shown at the end of the Kenshin Kaden vol. 2, is <br/>\nofficially ending the series, but do you have any regrets, or <br/>\nsomething you would have want to draw, but couldn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- In fact, whoever reads the end of the Kyoto Arc understands that <br/>\nSoujiro leaves for Hokkaido. At the time, I wanted to draw another <br/>\narc later on, located in that area, and where Soujiro would have been <br/>\non the Kenshingumi&#39;s side.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Are you talking about the Hokkaido Arc that so many people wanted <br/>\nto read? [1]<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Yes. I also wanted to introduce a new character during that arc: <br/>\nShinpachi Nagakura, the Shinsengumi second division&#39;s captain, in <br/>\naccordance with the possibilities. But I thought about it a lot, and <br/>\nI preferred ending the series with the Revenge Arc, so the Hokkaido <br/>\nArc never saw the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Was the Hokkaido Arc a darker or a more hopeful arc?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- It was a happier arc. I had envisioned it as a kind of Western. <br/>\nThe government&#39;s army would have been the cavalry, Hokkaido&#39;s new <br/>\ninhabitants and the samourai-peasents [2] would have been the <br/>\nsettlers, people without a precise goal and who would have wander <br/>\nuntil then would have been the outlaws and, finally, the natives <br/>\nwould have been the Indians And the Kenshingumi would arrive in the <br/>\nmiddle of all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- It seems to be very different from what we saw so far in the rest <br/>\nof the manga, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Well we can&#39;t always draw the same kind of things. (laughs). <br/>\nAlso, with the end of the Revenge Arc, the main theme of Rurouni <br/>\nKenshin had come to an end: what marked Kenshin&#39;s character the most, <br/>\nhis culpability, his search for an answer, for a way of explaining <br/>\nthe crimes he committed. That&#39;s why the following arc should have <br/>\nbeen completely different, if not, it wouldn&#39;t have made sense. <br/>\nThat&#39;s why I had imagined a sort of western. (laughs). It would be <br/>\nvery funny to surprise the readers with a wagon full of American&#39;s <br/>\nsettlers appearing right in the middle of all of that. (laughs).<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Aside from Soujiro, which other characters did you wanted to re-<br/>\nuse for this Arc?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- I would have like to re-use Fuji. It could have been interesting <br/>\nto make him intervene precisely when Kenshin was in danger. I thought <br/>\nthat Fuji looked very cool when he was digging the fields in <br/>\nHokkaido. Anji is also imprisoned in Hokkaido, so I would have made <br/>\nhim reappear. As he is the only character who haven&#39;t been <br/>\nspiritually &quot;salved&quot;, it bothered me, and I finally wanted to offer <br/>\nhim a second chance in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- You already had a clear idea of the plot, don&#39;t you think that <br/>\nmany readers would want to read that arc now that you&#39;re telling us <br/>\nmore about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Hum Yes, but no. I prefer using the ideas I got for that arc in <br/>\nmy next manga.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Really. (laughs). Then, let me ask you when are you going to start <br/>\nworking on that new manga? [3]<br/>\n<br/>\nW- I&#39;m only working on the main lines of the plot right now, so I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t know. I wish to start really working on it by the middle <br/>\nof next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Will it be very different, in style and spirit, from Rurouni <br/>\nKenshin?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Yes, I would like to create an as interesting story, but from a <br/>\ndifferent perspective. That said, I&#39;m still the same author, hence I <br/>\nthink that the basis of both stories will be very similar. Of course, <br/>\nI will use what I learned from Rurouni Kenshin.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Rurouni Kenshin being your first series, you must have learn a lot?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Enormously. There were some passages where I lost focus and there <br/>\nare a lot of hiccups, but aside of that, it&#39;s true that I learned a <br/>\nlot while working on that manga. It brought me a lot, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Which was the most important thing to you during those five years?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- My readers&#39; support. Drawing manga is my job, yes, but being able <br/>\nto draw what I really want, and to realise that the public loves it, <br/>\nis very satisfying. Every time a reader told me that he liked this or <br/>\nthat in my manga, it gave me a boost of energy. The readers are <br/>\neverything to an author.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- Do you have something to say to the readers who have follow your <br/>\nwork until now?<br/>\n<br/>\nW- Thanks, thanks to all, thanks a lot. That&#39;s mostly what I want to <br/>\nsay. If they also want to read my next manga, I will be very happy. I <br/>\nwill do my best, so see you!<br/>\n<br/>\nQ- I would like to thank you for the time you took for this very long <br/>\ninterview.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] : There had been a short report in Shonen Jump about the Hokkaido <br/>\nArc, which finally never saw the day, as the series ended with the <br/>\nRevenge Arc. Many Shinengumi fans were disappointed by this decision, <br/>\nalong with Soujiro fans.<br/>\n<br/>\n[2] : Due to financial problems, those samurai were peasants, but in <br/>\ntimes of conflicts, they were ready to take up arms in case the <br/>\nborder had to be defended against Russia.<br/>\n<br/>\n[3] : The Kenshin Kaden vol. 2 has been published at the end of 1999 <br/>\nin Japan, so this interview also took place by the end of that year. <br/>\nThe manga which they are talking about hence is &quot;Gun Blaze West&quot;, <br/>\nwhich has been published in Shonen Jump but suddenly stopped after <br/>\nonly three volumes. Since then, Watsuki hasn&#39;t draw anything, but he <br/>\nis now about to do it.</div>",
