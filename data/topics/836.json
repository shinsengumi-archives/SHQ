            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-388870039\">Found three books that are translated texts which were designed to <br/>\ninstruct samurai in various matters. They were in the &quot;Sports&quot; <br/>\nsection of the bookstore, of all places! LOL! I didn&#39;t know being a <br/>\nsamurai could be considered a &quot;sport&quot;! While you certainly wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to follow ALL of they&#39;re suggestions, I suppose some of this <br/>\nwould be helpful to modern martial artists if for no other reason <br/>\nthan to help them better understand the history of their sport. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll list a brief description of each book, along with the info <br/>\nneeded to track down a copy for yourself:<br/>\n<br/>\nHagakure: The Book of the Samurai by Yamamoto Tsunetomo. Translated <br/>\nby William Scott Wilson. Kodansha America, Inc. (First paperback <br/>\nedition, 1983. New hard-cover edition, 2002) ISBN# 4-7700-2916-0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one is more or less a collection of thoughts and very short <br/>\nstories that were meant to be used as guidance in making decisions <br/>\nthat reflected the true spirit of Bushido. Offers good insight into <br/>\nthe way they viewed the world. Here is a typical example of the sort <br/>\nof entries you&#39;ll find: &quot;Shame and repentance are like upsetting a <br/>\npot of water. When a certain friend of mine listened to the way that <br/>\na man who had stolen his sword ornament confessed, he felt <br/>\ncompassion. If one will rectify his mistakes, their traces will soon <br/>\ndisappear.&quot; Then there are others like: &quot;The master took a book from <br/>\nits box. When he opened it there was the smell of drying clovebuds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Life-Giving Sword: Secret Teachings from the House of the Shogun <br/>\n(The classic text on Zen and the No-Sword by Musashi&#39;s great rival) <br/>\nby Yagyu Munenori. Translated by William Scott Wilson. Kodansha <br/>\nAmerica, Inc. (First edition, 2003) ISBN# 4-7700-2955-1<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one is a MUST HAVE!!! Gives Great detail on actual sword <br/>\ntechniques! Plus there are some fantastic isllustrations in the back <br/>\nto illustrate a few of them. Some of these drawings show a man <br/>\n(persumably Yagyu Munenori) facing off with a tengu! Explains such <br/>\nthings as No-Mind. (Remember that from The Last Samurai?) Definitely <br/>\nworth owning!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCode of the Samurai: A Modern Translation of the Bushido Shoshinshu <br/>\nof Taira Shigesuke. Translated by Thomas Cleary. Tuttle Publishing <br/>\n(1999). ISBN# 0-8048-3190-4<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit more straight-forward guide to samurai behavior than the first <br/>\nbook. Gives advice on such things as Familial Duty, Horsemanship, <br/>\nFacing Death, Vassalage, and Escort. Then there are instructions <br/>\nregarding things such as Big Talk and Criticism, Warning Against <br/>\nBackbiting (guess Katsura, Okubo, and Saigo missed this one somehow), <br/>\nand Lazines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was one other both on Iai sword-drawing techniques I wish I had <br/>\ngotten now. I can&#39;t recall the name, but it was from Tuttle and had a <br/>\nwhole section on seppuku. -sigh- I&#39;ll try to find it later. Hopefully <br/>\nit will still be there! In the meantime, I&#39;ll repost the names of <br/>\nthese books to the messageboard later.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
