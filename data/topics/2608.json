PERSONALITY STRESS AND TUBERCULOSIS<br/>\nNew York: International Universities Press, Inc 1956.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo add some balance to the information below I&#39;d like to mention right<br/>\naway that:<br/>\nDr. Lawrason Brown, a pioneer in TB treatment stated that &quot;The<br/>\ntuberculosis patient is described as anything between an insane<br/>\ncriminal and a saint too ethereal for this mundane sphere.&quot; (Calden,<br/>\nLews, Thurston 275)<br/>\n--------------------------------<br/>\nCalden PhD, Lewis M.D., Thurston PhD &quot;The Patient Looks at<br/>\nTuberculosis&quot; (275-299)<br/>\n&quot;The belief that there is a specific `tuberculous personality&#39;<br/>\ncharacterized by undue cheerfulness (spes Phthisica)and marked<br/>\nintellectual productivity has gained wide support.&quot; (Calden 275)<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the patient&#39;s dependence on others during their illness, the<br/>\nresearchers chose representative quotes from the 570 subjects they used.<br/>\nOne said &quot;I feel like a baby again&quot; (Calden 288)<br/>\n--------------------------------<br/>\nWittkower M.D., Eric D. &quot;Psychological Aspects&quot; pages 153-174<br/>\nWittkower Associate Prof of Psychiatry McGill University, Montreal CA<br/>\n<br/>\nToxemia due to the Tubercle bacillus is also believed to cause<br/>\ndramatic changes in emotions, however at the time of this publication<br/>\nthe results of those studies are inconclusive and possibly exaggerated.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Reaction to Illness]<br/>\n&quot;Let us assume that the patients have passed beyond the unavoidable<br/>\nbreaking-in period and have settled down to being ill and to being ill<br/>\nwith tuberculosis.  Afterwards a variety of mental changes may take<br/>\nplace which time and again have puzzled observers.  It has been said<br/>\nthat tuberculous patients are predominantly sensitive, neurotic,<br/>\ndepressed, optimistic, elated, euphoric, easily suggestible,<br/>\nwhimsical, CHILDISH, selfish, self-centered, capriciousMost patients<br/>\nwith tuberculosis are in a mood of mild overt or concealed depression<br/>\nand anxiety, which are normal and adequate reaction to indisious<br/>\ndieaseOffsprings of these reactions and defenses against them are<br/>\ndefiance, ULTRA-CHEERFULNESS.&quot; (Wittkower 164)<br/>\n<br/>\n[the following applies to people who live in TB sanatoriums or have<br/>\nother illnesses which require isolationlike cholera]<br/>\n&quot;infant-like egocentricism&quot; is caused by<br/>\nremoval of stimuli from their environment<br/>\nabsence of responsibility<br/>\nunrealistic long-term perspective (such as setting far off goals in life)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Tuberculosis and Genius]<br/>\n&quot;Much has been written on the subject of tuberculosis and genius[list<br/>\nof geniuses].  The truth of the matter seems to be that tuberculosis<br/>\nis a common disease, and therefore also occurs in men and women of<br/>\ngeniustuberculosis for a variety of reasons favors fantasy<br/>\nproductionand the dreaded limitation of their span of life stimulates<br/>\ntheir productivity.&quot; (Wittkower 155-6)<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\nDunbar M.D. Med.Sc.D., Ph.D, Flanders. &quot;Anxiety, Stress and<br/>\nRespiratory Diseases Especially Tuberculosis&quot; (208-232)<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of a discussion how TB patients manipulate the people around them <br/>\n&quot;Tuberculous patients behave like deprived children.&quot; (Dunbar 226)</div>",

I mentioned<br/>\nin my post at the SHQ SPY DIVISION of scientists, husband and wife who<br/>\nhad TB, still caring for their own children (not out of necessity as<br/>\nthey had friends and relatives)<br/>\n<br/>\nin 1882 Dr. Robert Koch discovered tubercle bacillus the aerobic<br/>\nbacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)---doctors around the world did<br/>\nnot believe him and there was a &quot;delay&quot; in adjusting their<br/>\nmethodologies and treatments---because it still made sense to many<br/>\nthat it was inherited (as of 1901 medical journals still printed<br/>\narticles proving how it ran in the family).  Koch&#39;s failed attempt of<br/>\ndeveloping a cure, tuberculin, also didn&#39;t help his cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I skimmed<br/>\nThe Modern Epidemic: A history of tuberculosis in Japan<br/>\nBy William Johnston. 432 pp. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University<br/>\nPress, 1995. $45.

It was a disfiguring disease associated with<br/>\nbad karma--hence the secrecy of OKita&#39;s health was not simply for<br/>\nreasons concerning group morale.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot recall the exact Japanese website but there is talk that<br/>\nOkita was a &quot;clean child&quot; or celibate or even a virgin (all of this is<br/>\nJUST a rumor).  During his lifetime it was believed that excessive<br/>\nsexual activity will lead to TB---thus if he was rumored to be a clean<br/>\nchild it makes sense that it was part of the medical advice to abstain<br/>\nfrom sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita&#39;s constant smiling.  During his lifetime melancholia was<br/>\nassociated with TB---hence keep your spirits up and you will not catch it!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita as &quot;feminine&quot; --- the book does a stellar job of examining TB in<br/>\nMeiji era literature (there was an entire GENRE devoted to it). <br/>\nUsually the illness is associated with young frail, beautiful women. <br/>\nInterestingly, many girls after their first menses WERE likely to get<br/>\nTB, especially if they had a lower intake of protein (note many<br/>\nJapanese had a vegetarian and fish diet that time).    We know that<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi were the subject of folktales and even the novel<br/>\nNakazato Kaizan&#39;s DAIBOSATSU-TOGE [the film SWORD OF DOOM] (although<br/>\nOkita was not feminine or childlike in this work) it is easy to see<br/>\nhow a doomed swordsman with TB all of sudden takes on female qualities<br/>\nwhich would solidify him as a perpetually tragic figure in fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe book will mention some familiar names:<br/>\n[Matsumoto Ryojun] physician who accompanied shogunate troops as far<br/>\nas Hakodate and later along with Nagakura and SAitou built a memorial<br/>\n<br/>\n[Dr. Willis] (at Toba & Fushimi and Aizu during Boshin War,<br/>\nKumamoto/Kyushu until Seinan War, later laid the foundation of Siriraj<br/>\nMedical School and Hospital in Bangkok)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Dr. Baelz] German who was the personal physician to royality and<br/>\ngovernmental VIPS --- his sticking to cellular *rather* than<br/>\nbacteriology pathology in Tokyo University School of Medicine<br/>\ninhibited alternate modes of approaching the illness (we now know<br/>\nbacteriology was the right way to go)<br/>\n<br/>\n***and for the one person out there who loves Dutch studies*** yes<br/>\nDutch medicine is discussed<br/>\n<br/>\nTo learn more about the romanticism connected to TB please read<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~mfukuda/english.html\">http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~mfukuda/english.html</a><br/>\nnovelist/doctor/bureaucrat MORI OGAI is mentioned on this page.  <br/>\nMori Ogai, Higuchi Ichiyo and several of the most famoust writers of<br/>\nthe Meiji Era suffered from and died of TB.  Note how Mori Ogai kept<br/>\nhis condition a secret.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book also provides euphemisms doctors will use in diagnosing a<br/>\npatient.  Doctors who diagnose patients with TB were themselves<br/>\nsubject to negative public reaction!<br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Footnotes]<br/>\nThe biggest obstacle to medical education was the abhorrance of<br/>\ndissection and association with uncleanliness see:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/message/107\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/message/107</a><br/>\nin the late 1890s-early 20th century the only women&#39;s medical academy<br/>\n(born from the founder&#39;s desire to have women treat women infected<br/>\nwith sexually transmitted diseases) was ridiculed for unladylike<br/>\nmanners in dissecting cadavers...<br/>\n<br/>\nTakamine Hideo spent alot of time studying protozoa under a<br/>\nmicrocope---the discovery of tubercle bacillus would have been of<br/>\ngreat interest to him as well since his own brother died of TB in 1883<br/>\n<br/>\nThe novel mentioned throughout the book HOTOTOGISU (bestseller later<br/>\ntranslated into English as NAMIKO: A REALISTIC NOVEL)<br/>\nwas about Yamakawa Oyama Sutematsu<br/>\nmentioned <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm</a><br/>\nand<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm</a></div>",
