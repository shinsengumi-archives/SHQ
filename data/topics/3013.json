            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-345708255\">When one considers the price of war, it is often all too easy to get caught <br/>\nup in the details. &quot;Heroes&quot; loom large, facts get distorted, and in the <br/>\nearnest quest for &quot;truth,&quot; one can easily get sidetracked. I&#39;d like to bring <br/>\nup another fact that is important for all of us who have an interest in <br/>\nShinsengumi or the period at large.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing the fall of Aizu, Saitou Hajime, who had tried to get into Aizu <br/>\nCastle, was with Aizu senior retainer Sagawa Kanbei, fighting on in <br/>\nMinami-Aizu, south of the domain capital of Wakamatsu. Aizu military affairs <br/>\nmagistrate Asabane Tadanosuke was sent to Sagawa&#39;s men, and informed them <br/>\nthat the battle was over. Saitou and the men who had fought outside Aizu <br/>\nCastle during the siege were rounded up and taken to an internment camp in <br/>\nShiokawa. They remained there until the beginning of the following year, <br/>\nwhen it was decided they were to be sent to Takada, in Echigo Province, for <br/>\nincarceration. The group stopped by Amida-ji in Aizu to pray for safety <br/>\nbefore embarking. Saitou had fought in that area, in the time leading up to <br/>\nand during the siege, and this must have affected him. On the 5th, the group <br/>\nwas separated into six units, and after some time they arrived in Takada.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were to remain in Takada until the 9th month, and it was in reference <br/>\nto the 2nd day of the 9th month that scholar Ito Tetsuya notes something <br/>\ncurious: &quot;[On this day], the Meiji Government permits the prisoners to use <br/>\nsurnames and wear swords.&quot; (from-- Itou Tetsuya, &quot;Saitou Hajime Nenfu&quot;, <br/>\nappearing pp. 223-243 of &quot;Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot;. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu <br/>\nOraisha, 2003, p. 237)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new government granting permission to have surnames and wear swords <br/>\nimplies that these men, who were samurai and *born* with that right, had <br/>\nbeen deprived of it after the surrender, since they were viewed as <br/>\ncriminals. (A pardon was issued hard on the heels of this announcement, on <br/>\nthe 28th of the 9th month)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur beloved Saitou Hajime obviously had a name-- Ichinohe Denpachi. The Aizu <br/>\nmen interacting with each other, men who in many cases knew each other since <br/>\nchildhood, obviously still had to have called each other by their names. But <br/>\nlegally, and in the eyes of the country, Saitou Hajime, and his Aizu <br/>\nfriends, were nameless, faceless, and without any clearly defined position <br/>\nin society. The best way that it can be described is if a group of people <br/>\nwere treated like burned-out lightbulbs and thrown into a box for nine <br/>\nmonths.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder...can any of us in this modern world of rights and privileges <br/>\nimagine what it must have been like, to have no name and no place in <br/>\nsociety? Can we imagine how heart-wrenching it might have been?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, something to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-938174071\">There are many out there, such as self-proclaimed authority Romulus <br/>\nHillsborough, to whom the story of Shinsengumi after Kondou Isami&#39;s death is <br/>\nmeaningless. However, the fact of the matter, as we know, is that <br/>\nShinsengumi, as an organization, survived until mid-1869, when its last <br/>\nsurvivors, under the nominal command of Soma Kazue, surrendered together <br/>\nwith Nagai Genba-no-Kami Naoyuki&#39;s forces at Benten Daiba, in Hakodate.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the &quot;forgotten&quot; elements of this ignored history is Saitou Hajime&#39;s <br/>\nperiod in command of the Shinsengumi, during the Aizu Theater of the Boshin <br/>\nWar.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the latter part of the 8th month of Meiji 1, Aizu was surrounded, and the <br/>\nmonth-long siege had begun. At this time, the former Shogunate army under <br/>\nOtori Keisuke abandoned Aizu, heading for Sendai. This force could have been <br/>\nput to good use in defending Aizu, however, its commander considered <br/>\nwithdrawal the better course of action. Despite this, the fact remains that <br/>\nby doing so he probably did as much to hasten Aizu&#39;s fall as Itagaki <br/>\nTaisuke&#39;s lightning-strike through Bonari Pass did.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Saitou Hajime heard of Otori&#39;s army having left Aizu, he spoke, and <br/>\nspoke harshly. For a man of little words, the following ones, as recorded in <br/>\nthe diary of Taniguchi Shirobei, a Kuwana-han retainer turned Shinsengumi <br/>\nsamurai (picture is here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin3/sirobei.jpg)\">http://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin3/sirobei.jpg)</a>, are <br/>\npowerful. Remember, Saitou and the Shinsengumi had just fought a long and <br/>\nbrutal battle at Bonari Pass in order to defend the people of Aizu, and had <br/>\nbarely managed to escape with their lives. Listen to what the taciturn <br/>\nwarrior has to say about Otori&#39;s army:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If they are really our allies, then they should come back to Aizu and <br/>\nhelp-- and then we wouldn&#39;t have to see the castle about to fall like this. <br/>\nFor our so-called comrades to run like this is unjust!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(cited from: Ito Tetsuya, &quot;Saitou Hajime Nenfu&quot;. pp. 223-243 of &quot;Saitou <br/>\nHajime no Subete&quot;. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 2003, p. 236)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fall of the castle was still a month away, but in many people&#39;s eyes the <br/>\nfate of Aizu was already sealed...<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely words to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
