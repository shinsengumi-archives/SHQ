Many<br/>\npeople initially and understandably believed that the Shinsengumi<br/>\nkilled Ryoma Sakamoto because they did attempt to arrest him earlier<br/>\nbut failed.  I have read on 2 Japanese sites that Saitou Hajime was<br/>\nrelated to someone in the Mimawarigumi [this may be speculation ok it<br/>\nmay not be true at all--you&#39;ve been warned :)]<br/>\n<br/>\n*Romulus Hillsborough will address the above mentioned controversy in<br/>\nhis book on the Shinsengumi (in ENGLISH) which will be released this fall!<br/>\n<br/>\n3)Tokubetsu Koto (Tokko) Keisatsu (?) I&#39;m not sure if this is another<br/>\ngroup...whenever the Shinsengumi are mentioned this name follows so<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming they had a similar role.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I&#39;m sure there were more groups out there...Kyoto is a huge city I<br/>\nalways wondered how they managed to patrol it by foot and if these<br/>\ngroups had &quot;turf wars&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***WATCH Jin Roh: the Wolf Brigade***<br/>\nIt is very much like the story of Yamanami&Spy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edojidai@yahoogroups.com\">edojidai@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tokugawa Hirotada&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Everyone (metaphorically speaking)knows about the Shinsengumi-- but<br/>\n&gt; what about the other patrol group in Kyoto-- the Mimawarigumi? If<br/>\n&gt; anyone out there has any information on them, it&#39;d be great to learn<br/>\n&gt; more. So far, all I have is the following: as with the Shinsengumi,<br/>\n&gt; they operated under the auspices of the Kyoto Military Commission, and<br/>\n&gt; the commander was a man named Sasaki Tadasaburou, a master of the<br/>\n&gt; kodachi (short sword). That&#39;s about it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Hirotada </span></blockquote></div>",
