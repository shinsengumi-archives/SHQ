Fortunatly, they <br/>\nhappen<br/>\n&gt; to know about the Shinsengumi (one lady definately knew about S.H.<br/>\n&gt; based on the film Mibugishiden because I heard her say Sato <br/>\n&gt; Hiroshi---the name of the actor who played S.H. in the film---I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; pretty sure) and so they were flipping through the book and <br/>\nchattering<br/>\n&gt; amongst themselves for a while and I was just standing there like <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; idiot that I am...I didn&#39;t want to impose and say &quot;translate this<br/>\n&gt; now!&quot; (Like we do to Serizawa Kamo and Shimazuryu)...of all the pics<br/>\n&gt; they picked out ones of where Saitou lived before finding work in <br/>\nTokyo...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.147 +148 (Shimazuryu if you are interested) pic shows a forest and<br/>\n&gt; the 2nd shows an empty field (used to have houses)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern building<br/>\n&gt; used as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a prison/jail but a &quot;place where people could not leave until<br/>\n&gt; they know they did wrong&quot;...so I was trying to ask her if he <br/>\ncommitted<br/>\n&gt; a crime or did something &#39;bad&#39; (robbery, murder etc) of some sort <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; she said &#39;no&#39; and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he <br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; a police officer?  And I was like &quot;yes&quot; (so the pages must deal w/<br/>\n&gt; Fujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word &quot;discipline&quot; and <br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; she was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,<br/>\n&gt; disciplinary issue and this detention center that he &quot;stayed&quot; at.  I<br/>\n&gt; kept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like <br/>\nyes<br/>\n&gt; he stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he <br/>\nWORKED<br/>\n&gt; there...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because if <br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; think about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a<br/>\n&gt; prison with criminal scum.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1911497656\">uh oh you think...Tiffany is using babelfish again...<br/>\n-NOPE-<br/>\nMy university had a special event with artists/delegates from the<br/>\nChiba Perfecture Japan (sister city to my city)(dance/kendo<br/>\ndemo/puppet skit/blurb on the hakkenden etc) and so I attended the event.<br/>\nI just ~happen~ to be carrying around the book Saitou Hajime No Subete<br/>\nwith me and I tried to communicate with them.  Fortunatly, they happen<br/>\nto know about the Shinsengumi (one lady definately knew about S.H.<br/>\nbased on the film Mibugishiden because I heard her say Sato <br/>\nHiroshi---the name of the actor who played S.H. in the film---I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure) and so they were flipping through the book and chattering<br/>\namongst themselves for a while and I was just standing there like the<br/>\nidiot that I am...I didn&#39;t want to impose and say &quot;translate this<br/>\nnow!&quot; (Like we do to Serizawa Kamo and Shimazuryu)...of all the pics<br/>\nthey picked out ones of where Saitou lived before finding work in Tokyo...<br/>\n<br/>\np.147 +148 (Shimazuryu if you are interested) pic shows a forest and<br/>\nthe 2nd shows an empty field (used to have houses)<br/>\n<br/>\np.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern building<br/>\nused as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a prison/jail but a &quot;place where people could not leave until<br/>\nthey know they did wrong&quot;...so I was trying to ask her if he committed<br/>\na crime or did something &#39;bad&#39; (robbery, murder etc) of some sort and<br/>\nshe said &#39;no&#39; and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he was<br/>\na police officer?  And I was like &quot;yes&quot; (so the pages must deal w/<br/>\nFujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word &quot;discipline&quot; and so<br/>\nshe was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,<br/>\ndisciplinary issue and this detention center that he &quot;stayed&quot; at.  I<br/>\nkept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like yes<br/>\nhe stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he WORKED<br/>\nthere...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because if you<br/>\nthink about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a<br/>\nprison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he was<br/>\nformerly &quot;disciplined&quot; for something...because I trying really hard to<br/>\nbe sure that he wasn&#39;t just a prison guard but she was trying to<br/>\ncommunicate that he did something &#39;bad&#39; but not &#39;criminal&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez...maybe there is something to S.H. being a &quot;psycho-cop&quot; as Misao<br/>\nsaid -_-<br/>\n<br/>\nWill scan pics when I can get to a scanner.</div>",
