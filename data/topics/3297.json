(pp. 238-241)&quot;<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional translation (AUGUST 2007) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;However, Harada Sanosuke (Shinsengumi personnel) was not the man who <br/>\nmurdered [Ryoma]&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I [Yamakawa] was still young at the time, but I&#39;ve asked older <br/>\npeople, and they all say it was the work of former Aizu retainer <br/>\nSasaki Tadasaburo, who worked for the shogunate and was the leader of <br/>\nMimawarigumi.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSource:<br/>\nNagakura Shinpachi, Shinsengumi Tenmatsu-ki. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu <br/>\nOraisha,<br/>\n2003.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically Yamakawa (Yamagawa) Kenjiro, Aizu retainer and good friend <br/>\nof Fujita Goro (Saitou Hajime) was also in contact with Nagakura&#39;s <br/>\nson as well.  So aside from being deeply involved in post 1868 Aizu <br/>\naffairs, Yamakawa obviously concerned himself with Shinsengumi issues.<br/>\nYamakawa is the most famous Aizu samurai in the Meiji era (although <br/>\nhis sister was also very well known too)...his influence extends well <br/>\nbeyond academia because he was also an advisor to RIKEN Labs and was <br/>\neven involved the negotiation between the Brits and Japanese Naval <br/>\nagreement in the 20th century.  <br/>\nI wrote an article about his other interests here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/unmaskmeijipsychology.html\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/unmaskmeijipsychology.html</a><br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nM found some correspondences between Yamakawa and an American at the <br/>\nNew York Public Library and scanned his sig for us<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UBZ297WI\">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UBZ297WI</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe New York Public Library does not allow for reproduction of their <br/>\nmaterial, therefore we had to put it on Megaupload so the link/image <br/>\nexpires in 7 days.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have alot of info on people like Yamakawa and soon <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> will be back up functioning at full <br/>\ncapacity<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may preview the new site complete with search features and <br/>\nsitemap at the site.</div>",
