Although Maeda group did not go to <br/>\nSekigahara, they fought with the Niwa group who is an enemy.) <br/>\nHe was set to karou (The maximum important vassal) of a Kaga domain <br/>\nafter Maeda Toshinaga died. <br/>\nHe died in 1620. <br/>\nHis posterity became the important vassal of Kaga domain. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nBy the way, I ask why the questioner knows this person. <br/>\nAbout this man, probably, even if it is a Japanese, almost all <br/>\npeople do not know. <br/>\n(I also got to know this person for the first time.) <br/>\nI think that he probably will not be known if it is not the <br/>\ninvestigator of Sengoku period, and the investigator of Maeda <br/>\nfamily. <br/>\nBut since Sengoku period is the time which is popular more than <br/>\nBakumatsu, many researchers exist^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",
