            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-414457987\">I&#39;d like to wish everyone a very belated Happy New<br/>\nYear too!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd wish I could draw like momoiro-san as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently in Kurashiki (Okayama), accessing the Net<br/>\nafter a 9-day hiatus.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust noticed that these days I have been visiting most<br/>\nof the important spots on the Ishin Shishi side ^^;;<br/>\nWent to Satsuma (Kagoshima), Choushuu (Yamaguchi) and<br/>\nnow after spending a night here in Bizen (Okayama), I<br/>\nwill be off to Tosa (Kochi). Amazing :D<br/>\n<br/>\nWent to Shiroyama in Satsuma and was VERY impressed at<br/>\nthe caves used by Saigo Takamori, Kirino Toshiaki and<br/>\nothers to hide. They are very small.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent to Shoukason-juku in Hagi and was VERY impressed<br/>\nat Yoshida Shoin&#39;s teachings o.o (sugoi koto wo<br/>\noshiete imashita) <br/>\n<br/>\nWent to Katsura Kogoro&#39;s house also in Hagi and was<br/>\nVERY impressed at how beautiful Ikumatsu (Matsuko) was<br/>\no.o (didn&#39;t know there was a picture of her) Also, it<br/>\nwas good to see another picture of Takasugi Shinsaku<br/>\nother than that most famous one (ano Takasugi wa<br/>\nchotto kakko yoku nai desu ^^;;;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWent to Okayama Art Museum in Okayama (duh :P) and was<br/>\nVERY impressed at how beautiful Kikuichimonji Norimune<br/>\nis o.o (no wonder he was the January of the Emperor&#39;s<br/>\nswordsmiths...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Shinsengumi, read that Shinsengumi manga by<br/>\nGolgo 13, I mean, Saito Takao. It is reasonable. Also,<br/>\nread that &quot;Shinsengumi Ibun&quot; (I guess the name was<br/>\nlike that) and enjoyed one of the most absurd mangas<br/>\n(historically speaking) on the Shinsengumi. It demands<br/>\nsome guts to come up with such a nonsense story about<br/>\nthe group!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last, but not least, read &quot;Dandara&quot;, by Akana Shu.<br/>\nLiked very much the drawing. Quite cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Subject: Re: A happy new year!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A Happy New Year to you and all !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like your fan arts very much, momoiro-san.<br/>\n&gt; I wish I could draw as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tama<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; momomanjyuu2004 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Shin-nen akemashite omedetougozaimasu.^_^<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; (In Japanese, it is the meaning of &quot;A happy new<br/>\n&gt; year&quot;.If it<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; translates literally, it will become &quot;the new<br/>\n&gt; year, dawn,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; furthermore congratulations&quot;.)<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; In fact, Japan is still the daytime on December<br/>\n&gt; 31 now.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; However, I separate from a network for about five<br/>\n&gt; days after this.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Therefore, I greet you previously.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Japanese people send the postcard called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nengajyou&quot; (New Year&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; card) to friends.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; It arrives on January 1.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I send Nengajyou to everybody of SHQ<br/>\n&gt; similarly.^_^<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omedetou1.html\">http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omedetou1.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omedetou2.html\">http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omedetou2.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; If you like these, bring these home freely.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; The page which is downward is the fan art which I<br/>\n&gt; drew two years<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ago.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Since I did not understand how to use software,<br/>\n&gt; the colors are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; crude.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omake.html\">http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omake.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; These pages are eliminated at 11:00 p.m. JST on<br/>\n&gt; January 5.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Many thanks for your kindness last year.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I desire for you in 2005 to be fortunate.^_^<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; momoiro-usagi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nSerizawa Kamo<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.<br/>\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.<br/>\n  I have created over a thousand blades.<br/>\n       Unknown to Death.<br/>\n   Nor known to Life.<br/>\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.<br/>\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.<br/>\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a></div>",
