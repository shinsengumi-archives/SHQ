Seems that every daimyo had three residences in Edo-- upper, middle, <br/>\nand lower. Good way to keep them poor, I suppose, and thus leave them with <br/>\nno money to spend on revolt, unless you have domains with trade surpluses <br/>\nlike Choshuu and Satsuma...<br/>\n<br/>\n--Shinpachi&#39;s father, Nagakura Kanji, was a retainer of the Matsumae clan, <br/>\nwith a 150 koku stipend. He was a true product of the Edo era-- part of the <br/>\nsub-culture of samurai who lived their entire lives in Edo, but were <br/>\nretainers of a domain they&#39;d never seen and probably never would.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nagakura&#39;s father spelled the family name with the &quot;naga&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot;, <br/>\nbut Shinpachi spelled it with the &quot;naga&quot; from the word for &quot;eternity&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nagakura got his start in kenjutsu earlier than Okita. Okita started at <br/>\nage 9 in Tennen Rishin Ryuu-- BUT Nagakura entered Okada Juusuke Toshisada&#39;s <br/>\nShintou Munen Ryuu dojo at age 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nagakura&#39;s birthday is the 11th day of the fourth month of Tenpo 10. By <br/>\nour calendar, that&#39;s May 11, 1839 (so we JUST missed it! lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>",
