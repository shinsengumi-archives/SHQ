What&#39;s clear to me from just the number of visitors <br/>\nto SHQ is that we have people who want to read and learn about the <br/>\ngroup from ALL OVER THE WORLD and it would neat to hear from some <br/>\nfriends we&#39;ve never met before.  So your message can be in any <br/>\nlanguage (as long as you submit a translation, that way I can put up <br/>\na slide in English and we can read it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that anywhere from one sentence to a 5 minute comment is fair <br/>\nbecause the goal is to capture the variety of reasons people have for <br/>\nhaving an interest in the Shinsengumi.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I hope to get a couple of responses (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you all are out there...and we well eternally need your help <br/>\nin making the site better and better.  So by contributing your voice <br/>\nyou are encouraging some of our researchers to keep up their work and <br/>\nkeep sharing it with the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nhistory.fiction.makoto<br/>\nShinsengumihq motto</div>",
