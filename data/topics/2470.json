They first had it listed in their  computer <br/>\nthat it would arrive by April 30, but the last time I went back  there (around <br/>\ntwo weeks ago), they said it would be available on July 30.  Apparently <br/>\nHillsborough is in frequent contact with the store, but since he&#39;s  not publishing <br/>\nit himself, its release is delayed. Hopefully they will have it  by the end of <br/>\nthis month.<br/>\n <br/>\n- Anastasia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
