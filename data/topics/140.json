I hope that you guys can put<br/>\nit to good use.

Also, the type of<br/>\nspoken bungo depended on what social class the person was from. So, a<br/>\nfarmer would talk differently than a samurai, the shogun would talk<br/>\ndifferently than a ronin, and the Emperor&#39;s bungo was so archaic that<br/>\neven when Showa Tenno (Emperor Hirohito) delivered his surrender<br/>\nspeech over the radio in 1945, most of the people had no idea what he<br/>\nwas talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, the word &quot;Bungo&quot; in this case is not to be confused with<br/>\nthe former province of Bungo (now Oita Prefecture) in Kyushu...<br/>\n<br/>\n--M. </span></blockquote></div>",
