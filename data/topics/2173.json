            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-942047652\">Just realized I should&#39;ve sent this to here, too... silly me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl\">http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who&#39;s in the habit of trawling Japanese pages for info, but doesn&#39;t know Japanese should look into this. From what I understand it&#39;s an &quot;enter page URL&quot; translation service like several others I&#39;ve run into... except this one still *loads* the page in Japanese, and you can then mouse-over the words to get kanji readings. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to be meant as a learner&#39;s tool, but I thought it could be useful for this community too. Seeing as The Dreaded Fish and its ilk seems usually to spit up *one* translation and that&#39;s not always the best one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne drawback I can see is, while the readings are in English, there&#39;s no romaji - which pretty much means you need to know hiragana. That&#39;s not hard though, tables are available online in many places, and I learned 90% of them by heart in a couple of weeks when I started Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are the Shinsengumi!
