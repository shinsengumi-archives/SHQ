It would&#39;ve made a great film for Halloween <br/>\nviewing because the quality was truly scary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shinsengumihq.com/shq/?p=141\">http://shinsengumihq.com/shq/?p=141</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI pondered whether or not the screencaps I made were worth the server <br/>\nspace but I figured that any Shinsengumi film which used *slime* needs <br/>\nto be preserved on the internet somewhere...</div>",
