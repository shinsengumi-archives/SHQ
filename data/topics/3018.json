My biggest aggrivation with English<br/>\nhistories of events in Japanese history is one mentioned in your<br/>\nreview - not enough footnotes or discussions in text of other<br/>\npossibilities or conflicting reports/documents - almost like the<br/>\nhistorian writing the book either 1. doesn&#39;t want to take away from<br/>\ntheir own POV, 2.Doesn&#39;t want to bother, 3.Doesn&#39;t realize there are<br/>\nconflicting documents, or 4.Is just lazy.  The Evil Turnbull is the<br/>\nworst offender in this sort of thing (I won&#39;t get into the countless<br/>\nother issues I have with that guy&#39;s &quot;work&quot;, although I&#39;ll give him the<br/>\nonly credit I can, that he has probably done more to get people<br/>\ninterested in the subject that the academic rice-counters).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have the same problem a lot of people have in general - the<br/>\nscholars of Japanese history in the West are forced to publish books<br/>\non the kokudaka output of XYZ province or the &quot;intellectual history&quot;<br/>\n(which is a fancy word for writing long run on sentences with words<br/>\nonly found in the dusty pages of long out of print Olde English<br/>\ndictionaries with an aversion to common adjectives) otherwise they<br/>\njust won&#39;t get published.  I&#39;m still waiting for a Carl Sagan of<br/>\nJapanese history to make things interesting.  Usually I gather a few<br/>\nrare useful articles from the Journal of Japanese Studies or the<br/>\nMonumenta Niponica (I did see the journal list SHINSENGUMI IN ACADEMIC<br/>\nJOURNALS, so I&#39;ll be getting those articles soon), but then since<br/>\nnothing of much interest has been published since Sansom, so I pretty<br/>\nmuch stick to reading Japanese history books. It&#39;s a shame, too, since<br/>\nthe things I read in Japanese are far more colorful and interesting<br/>\nthan anything found in English.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd Rant :-P<br/>\n<br/>\nI just picked up the Gakken Shinsengumi book put out in 2003, and the<br/>\nGakken books to this point have always had good information and lots<br/>\nof interesting &quot;extras&quot; - this one has about 100 shinsengumi<br/>\nbiographies, maps of various battles, a map of areas where important<br/>\nmembers were assasinated, and all sorts of other goodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked Hillsborough&#39;s book on Amazon.com - shouldn&#39;t someone here<br/>\nwrite a more unbiased review? Only one review out of 4 there seems to<br/>\nbe at all critical.</div>",

Rather than providing <br/>\n&gt; a straight up text which is both neutral in tone and helpful in <br/>\n&gt; establishing a foundation for future serious research he comes across <br/>\n&gt; as a bitter man annoyed by the popularity of the Shinsengumi.
