As you stipulated in your previous essay, and I<br/>\ndo agree with you, when Goro married Tokio, Tokio had<br/>\nlost practically everything, what had he to gain? What<br/>\nmany people don&#39;t like about old-fashioned Japanese<br/>\nlove stories (they are thinking from a modern<br/>\nperspective on such things) is that Japanese love<br/>\nstories were often of illicit relationships. A man and<br/>\nhis geisha mistress. A lady separated from her true<br/>\nlove to be married to a lord. But infidelity in any<br/>\nform, I suppose, is not our &#39;modern&#39; ideal concept of<br/>\ntrue love. Japanese people, as in many other countries<br/>\nback then, did not marry for love, but for<br/>\npracticality, especially among the samurai classes.<br/>\nThat&#39;s not saying that married couples didn&#39;t love<br/>\neach other, but I know, even from my own grandparents&#39;<br/>\nexperiences, that love had little to do with the<br/>\nactual concept of marriage back then. Even now,<br/>\nmatchmaking (o-miai in Japanese) is common. When I<br/>\ndescribed my story as old-fashioned Japanese<br/>\nromanticism, I was taking these factors into account.<br/>\n*Then again, I may be biased because I have my own<br/>\nfictional* interpretation of why Tokio was adopted by<br/>\nthe Kurasawa family, and how the eventual marriage of<br/>\nGoro and Tokio came about and how Yaso fit into the<br/>\npicture.(Though whether anyone here is actually<br/>\nfollowing the story, I just don&#39;t know.) <br/>\n<br/>\n*lurks back into the shadows, but with the very best<br/>\nwishes for all* <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------<br/>\nHow to speculate like a professional fangirl<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion: &quot;What are the details of Fujita Goro and<br/>\nShinoda Yaso&#39;s<br/>\ndivorce?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\na) Yaso divorced Goro<br/>\nb) Goro divorced Yaso<br/>\nc) they divorced *each *other (like millions of people<br/>\nall over the<br/>\nworld) because they couldn&#39;t get along<br/>\nd) there was a vast Aizu conspiracy to destroy the<br/>\ncouple and match<br/>\nGoro with Tokio, even though the domain had nothing to<br/>\ngain from such<br/>\na marriage <br/>\ne) we don&#39;t really know<br/>\n<br/>\ne) is correct <br/>\n<br/>\nbut you can LEARN MORE YOURSELF by looking at the<br/>\nSAITOU HAJIME<br/>\nTRANSLATIONS right here at our mailing list &quot;FILES&quot;<br/>\ndownload all the<br/>\ndocs and read it carefully.
