We <br/>\n&gt; require assistance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In this inovating game, we control a group of the<br/>\n&gt; famous samurais working <br/>\n&gt; for Shogun. As you know, the story is held about<br/>\n&gt; 1865 before the end of the <br/>\n&gt; Tokugawa era. Gameplay, scenario, combat, realism,<br/>\n&gt; graphics are awesome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the following link, you can see our official<br/>\n&gt; website. There are two <br/>\n&gt; trailers and some banners that can be used in news,<br/>\n&gt; for example.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; http://membres.lycos.fr/shinsen/<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A news, an advertizing, an article in your site to<br/>\n&gt; make known our movement <br/>\n&gt; will be greatly appreciated by us, if you accept to<br/>\n&gt; post one, of course. <br/>\n&gt; Here is a link to the free and legal petition; do<br/>\n&gt; you want to speak about it <br/>\n&gt; in latters posts so as to invit people to sign it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; http://www.PetitionOnline[...]amoto/petition.html<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This game isn&#39;t the only reason that we started up<br/>\n&gt; this petition, we also <br/>\n&gt; try to promote the japanese culture and masterpieces<br/>\n&gt; in Europe that wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; be released here if we don&#39;t act.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our action is not hopeless, Genki Corporation is<br/>\n&gt; surprised by our will (We <br/>\n&gt; remain in negotiation with them), and we gathered<br/>\n&gt; more than 1000 signatures. <br/>\n&gt; But currently, it remains doubtful as for the future<br/>\n&gt; of the European release <br/>\n&gt; of &quot;Fu-un Shinsengumi&quot;, thus, your assistance will<br/>\n&gt; be welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We hope a positive reply from you and wish you an<br/>\n&gt; excellent continuation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good bye !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The French Community for the release of &quot;Fu-un<br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi&quot; in Europe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nouveau MSN Hotmail : 250 Mo d&#39;espace de stokage<br/>\n&gt; gratuit ! <br/>\n&gt; http://www.msn.fr/newmsnhotmail<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
