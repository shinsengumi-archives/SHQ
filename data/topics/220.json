            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1173257613\">Ah, the wonderful Japanese literature class, with the professor who<br/>\ndislikes samurai...<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, I read one of my favorite poems from Matsuo Basho: Summer<br/>\nGrass/All that remains/of warriors&#39; dreams. I told the teacher that<br/>\nthis was the first Basho poem I&#39;d read, and knowing my pro-samurai<br/>\nstance, he laughed and said, &quot;Ah, so this is what got you started!&quot;<br/>\nAnd I was like, &quot;What, with Basho or samurai?&quot; and then, a guy I<br/>\nhardly know, said &quot;Freak&quot; from the other side of the classroom. We<br/>\nstared each other down for so long that the teacher had to step in...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is up with these people? Why do they hate samurai so much? I<br/>\nrealize they weren&#39;t _all_ wonderful-- I mean, people like Kato<br/>\nKiyomasa were good generals, but brutal and utterly heartless-- but<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean that ALL samurai were bad, right? It&#39;s like Victor<br/>\nHarris said in the conclusion of his biography of Miyamoto Musashi--<br/>\n&quot;The aim of this cruel, headstrong man was evidently most humble and<br/>\nhonest.&quot; These people were warriors-- it was their business to fight.<br/>\nBut ultimately, all most of them really wanted was to acheive true<br/>\nstrength, to bring stability (and consequently, peace) to the realm,<br/>\nand also to better themselves in the knolwedge of both literary and<br/>\nmartial arts-- after all, like Lord Hojo Soun said:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hold literary skills in your left hand, martial skills in your right.<br/>\nThis is the law from ancient times. Never neglect it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.</div>",
