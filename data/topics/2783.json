Edited <br/>\nby Elinor Barnes and James A. Barnes. Introd. by Allan Nevins. <br/>\nPublisher: Bloomington, Indiana University Press [1963] <br/>\n<br/>\nand the description of the naval fighting (added by the editor) <br/>\nwhich involved Enomoto&#39;s doomed fleet was very intense and exciting<br/>\n<br/>\nthrough the study of the Bakumatsu Battleships one will see that the <br/>\nforeigners such as the *British were influential in the the fighting <br/>\nand money loaned to the kangun Imperial Army for weapons<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSHQ UPDATES<br/>\nCOSPLAY!!!!  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.htm</a><br/>\nI&#39;m soooo jealous of Laura...she&#39;s right next to my RK Saitou (^_^)<br/>\n[added: interview with the owners of the Saitou and Tokio tattoos]<br/>\nThanks wolverinesg7 and Sarah for contributing!!!!<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nupdated with more details &quot;&quot;The Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis <br/>\nand Okita Soujiro&quot; see [edits] on the page <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm</a><br/>\nso basically the argument being made is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Dr. Matsumoto Ryojun knew Kondou Isami (clearly mentioned in the <br/>\nHillsborough book and also Japanese sites however we had to cite <br/>\nHillsborough on the timeline)<br/>\n2) Dr. Matsumoto was a top notch physician of his day<br/>\n3) Dr. Matsumoto has used opium in the treatment of people such as <br/>\nTokugawa Yoshinobu (thank you to Hirotada Tokugawa for find this <br/>\ndetail and translating it)<br/>\n4) opium was used to treat tuberculosis (this method is totally <br/>\ncommon)<br/>\n<br/>\n[conclusion: If in a fanfic you use the detail that Okita drank <br/>\nopium tea to treat the *symptoms of TB then you would 99.9% <br/>\nhistorically accurate.  Does this mean that Okita was addicted to <br/>\nopium.  NOPE.  I never said that.<br/>\n  <br/>\nOpium was used as medicine in many many ways since ancient times and <br/>\nit was such a COMMON practice.  The method of extracting opium or <br/>\njust creating poppy tea was widespread in the EAst and West.  Think <br/>\nof it this way...people were giving small opium pellets <br/>\nto &quot;difficult&quot; babies who wouldn&#39;t stop crying.  It was like this <br/>\nweird &quot;cure all&quot;]<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please be sure to read the page carefully because I don&#39;t want <br/>\npeople to go around saying &quot;oh no SHQ is saying that Okita is an <br/>\nopium adduct&quot;... LOL!!!!!!!!!</div>",
