Falling forward/backwards...the right and wrong<br/>\nway to do anything is a recurring theme in Japanese martial culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read that in the scenario that a woman actually kills herself (no<br/>\nsecond to assist)...she will plunge the dagger into her heart...I got<br/>\n2 examples to help us understand<br/>\n1) The Shambhala Guide to Kendo by Minoru Kiyota isbn1570629277 page 110<br/>\n&quot;General Nogi Maresuke...dressed himself in ceremonial garb and<br/>\ndisemboweled himself while his wife, Shizuko, pierced her heart beside<br/>\nhim&quot;<br/>\n2) The following scenario involves a couple of samurai which took a<br/>\ncastle...they searched each room and found the body of a<br/>\nnoblewoman...she had killed herself ...the samurai I guess removed the<br/>\nknife and commented that maybe the dagger was not made by Mr. X<br/>\nbecause all weapons knives made by Mr. X would not have been easily<br/>\ndamaged by bone.  The gist is they thought the knife was a fake. Thus,<br/>\nthe point is the woman stabbed herself in such a way that it scraped<br/>\nbone (sternum?rib?) in the chest area.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting. In addition to the beliefs, I wonder when excactly these practices became more ritualized with the wearing of all white, the use of a second, the wooden pedestal, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, interesting, I thought that the heart would be the hardest to pierce because of all the bone in that area. Now that my interest has been peaked i&#39;ll have to look more into the woman&#39;s side of this hehe. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I remembered, was there are a few ways to disembowel oneself that i&#39;ve heard about. There&#39;st the regular stab and cut across, but thers&#39;s others that involve manipulating the knife up or down in addition to cutting across.

Have you read or heard anything similar? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor women, i&#39;ve read that seppuku is a bit different and involves severing the arteries in the neck. <br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, the pointing to the stomach with a fan, an example of that is shown in Lone Wolf and Cub when the child had to commit seppuku but had to use the fan because he was too young to use a knife to cut himself open. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: secretary <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 20, 2004 9:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [SHQ] Topic from Wounds~Beheading Decapitation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  {{{{WARNING}}}}<br/>\n  VERY VERY VERY <br/>\n  Grisly stuff ahead...leave now if you don&#39;t like this stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n  The original post from our member &quot;Wounds&quot;<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm2.showMessage?topicID=48.topic\">http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm2.showMessage?topicID=48.topic</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  in regards to Kondou&#39;s execution<br/>\n<br/>\n  I read ~years~ ago that there is more than one way to do this<br/>\n<br/>\n  like in cutting all things with the sword you kind of concentrate on<br/>\n  using the first 1/3 of the blade (don&#39;t count the hilt), starting from<br/>\n  the tip. This has to do with the physics of the swing etc etc...the<br/>\n  part of the blade you want to use is really easy to see on a kendo<br/>\n  shinai as there is rope/leather which &quot;bind&quot; the bamboo and basically<br/>\n  divide the the blade into &quot;parts&quot; so to speak.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Unlike an execution, in seppuku the &quot;second&quot; who beheads the person<br/>\n  does not cut all the way through...he will cut in far enough to read<br/>\n  the skin at the front of the neck and pull the blade out which will<br/>\n  prevent the head from simply &quot;falling&quot; on the ground (this happens in<br/>\n  a split second)...over time ritual suicide etiquette/procedures will<br/>\n  change to the point the person who commits suicide can mere point to<br/>\n  his stomach with a fan and the second will do his job...without the<br/>\n  person disemboweling himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There was a detailed account I read on how in an execution the person<br/>\n  doing the beheading is going for a certain point on the vertebra (this<br/>\n  is common sense since he is cutting through...) but ~how~ one can<br/>\n  accomplish this is beyond me...the point is they wanted the center<br/>\n  between the base of the neck and shoulder...note that the best swords<br/>\n  can cut through 2-3 corpses (according to accounts of testing swords).<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the film Shinsengumi!
