The last 3 are really the most common.  But I know <br/>\nthat sometimes filling out the order page on Amazon.co.jp can be <br/>\nreally hard.  Is there an online Japanese bookstore in your country?  <br/>\nThey can order these books for you.  In regards to Kan Shimosawa you <br/>\nhave to take his info at &quot;face value&quot;...some details are hard to trace <br/>\nto a source and you have to make a judgment call on some of his <br/>\nresearch.  He represents a truly early attempt at gathering <br/>\ninformation in this field (so his job was really difficult).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Akimiya&quot; &lt;melianeth@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know where I can buy online the following books in <br/>\njapanese:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yamamura, &quot;Shinsengumi Shougenroku&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Michio Hirao, &quot;Shinsengumi shiroku&quot; (and others)<br/>\n&gt; Kan, Shimosawa, &quot; Shinsengumi Shimatsu&quot; (and others)<br/>\n&gt; nakagura, &quot; shinsengumi tenmatsuki&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Shimada Kai records<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess perhapst in some spezialised shops!!
