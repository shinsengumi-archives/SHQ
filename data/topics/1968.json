            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1446516823\">Found a site that will be of interest to those who want to know what <br/>\nsort of guns were being used in the battle of the Bakumatsu and the <br/>\nBoshin War and where they came from. Apparently Choshu, through <br/>\nSatsuma, dealt with a British arms dealer named Thomas Blake Glover. <br/>\n<br/>\nChoshu bought 4300 Minies and 3000 Gewehrs in October of 1865. Each <br/>\nMinie cost 18 ryo and each Gewehr was about 5 ryo. The total bill <br/>\ncame to 92,000 ryo!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also gives the original name of the gunboat Otchu-maru that Ryoma <br/>\ncommanded during the battle near Oshima-gun. It used to be the USS <br/>\nUnion of the (what else?) Union army. I did a search on the boat and <br/>\nall I&#39;ve been able to learn about her so far is that she was used to <br/>\nstop Confederate blockade runners and therefore unlikely to have seen <br/>\nany major action during our Civil War. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boat cost the Choshu 37,000 ryo. The conservatives tried to get <br/>\nKatsura to settle for a 60 horsepower vessel, but he stubbornly held <br/>\nout for a 120 horsepower ship. (This would have been a steam engine <br/>\nof course.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot more here about Nagasaki at the time and Ishin leaders <br/>\nand is in English. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwvsh.edu/home_pages/faculty_staff/earns/meiji.html\">http://www.uwvsh.edu/home_pages/faculty_staff/earns/meiji.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI did some checking but could not find any gun called a &quot;Gewehr&quot; from <br/>\nthat time period. They do appear on searches from a slightly later <br/>\ndate. I assume that these could have been some sort of proto-type for <br/>\nthe later guns. Mauser, a German gunmaker, made the ones that I could <br/>\nfind info on:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mauserguns.com/mauserHistory.asp\">http://www.mauserguns.com/mauserHistory.asp</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the Minie rifles are concerned my guess is since they were <br/>\ndealing with a British arms merchant they would have most likely <br/>\nbought the Enfield Rifle Musket, which  was not only the most popular <br/>\nweapon of the time with British soilders but saw a great deal of <br/>\naction during the American Civil War.
