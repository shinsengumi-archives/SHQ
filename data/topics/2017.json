<br/>\nIs it the relation of Shinsengumi? <br/>\nOr is it the other famous festival? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe festival which should be introduced to you depending on your <br/>\nanswer changes. <br/>\nIt is assumed that it is in May that you come to Japan.<br/>\nSince there will be Hijikata&#39;s deathday May, a festival is performed <br/>\nin the Hino city.<br/>\n<br/>\n(All pages are the bans on unapproved reproduction.) <br/>\n<br/>\nHino Shinsengumi matsuri (Hino Shinsengumi festival)<br/>\nEvery year, this is held on the 2nd Saturday and Sunday. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.suzutoo.co.jp/hino_gyouji_sinnsenngumi_fb.html\">http://www.suzutoo.co.jp/hino_gyouji_sinnsenngumi_fb.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.suzutoo.co.jp/hino_gyouji_sinnsenngumi_fb.html\">http://www.suzutoo.co.jp/hino_gyouji_sinnsenngumi_fb.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince it is also in May that the Hakodate war ended, a festival is <br/>\nperformed in Hakodate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHakodate Goryoukaku sai (Hakodate Goryoukaku festival)<br/>\nEvery year, this is held on the 3rd Saturday and Sunday. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.at-town.com/~snap/event/tour/summit2.html\">http://www.at-town.com/~snap/event/tour/summit2.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my reply is different if you are wanted to see not these <br/>\nbut the festival which has history more. <br/>\nProbably, in Kyoto, the festival with 1000 years of history is held <br/>\nat the almost same time as those festivals. <br/>\n<br/>\nAoi matsuri (Aoi festival)<br/>\nEvery year, this is held on May 15. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/index11.htm\">http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/index11.htm</a><br/>\n(Since music sounds, be careful.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe festival which exists from the Edo period is held in the <br/>\ndowntown area in Tokyo on the same day. <br/>\n<br/>\nKanda matsuri (Kanda festival)<br/>\nThis will be held on May 14 and the 15th this year. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/kan1.htm\">http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/kan1.htm</a> <br/>\n(Since music sounds, be careful.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, the festival which has the origin of the Edo period in <br/>\nSendai is held. <br/>\n<br/>\naoba matsuri (aoba festival)<br/>\nThis will be held on May 14 and the 15th this year. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sakura.mond.jp/aoba16/16aoba1.htm\">http://sakura.mond.jp/aoba16/16aoba1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably, the oldest temple in Tokyo is holding the big festival. <br/>\n<br/>\nsanjya-matsuri (sanjya festival)<br/>\nThis is unknown for details.<br/>\nThis holds after May 15. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/san1.htm\">http://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/san1.htm</a><br/>\n(Since music sounds, be careful.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably, Kyoto is carrying out the graceful festival. <br/>\n<br/>\nMifune matsuri (Mifune festival)<br/>\nEvery year, this is held on the 3rd Saturday and Sunday. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/ben-yama/2-mifune.htm\">http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/ben-yama/2-mifune.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA shrine famous as God of learning also holds a festival. <br/>\n<br/>\nYushimatenmangu taisai (Yushimatenmangu big festival)<br/>\nEvery year, this is held on May 25. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junko55.web.infoseek.co.jp/02maturi/0405yusima1.htm\">http://junko55.web.infoseek.co.jp/02maturi/0405yusima1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn others, the famous festival called Hakata Dontaku to beginning in <br/>\nMay is held in Kyushu. <br/>\nEvery year, this will be held on May 2 and the 3rd. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kasane.jp/tamasudare/dontaku2004/parade1/index.html\">http://www.kasane.jp/tamasudare/dontaku2004/parade1/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need it, I will do the festival of other seasons, and <br/>\nintroduction of a tourist resort.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe charge of a hotel is really various.<br/>\nAbout it, I do not have a good opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaundromat is in the city section. <br/>\nHowever, a district without it also exists. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",
