Based on this, people have reasoned that<br/>\n&gt; had it not been for Kinmon-no-Hen (for which Ikeda-ya<br/>\n&gt; has been credited as one of the direct causes), Choshu<br/>\n&gt; would have risen up earlier. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is also the notion that Ikeda-ya (or<br/>\n&gt; Kinmon-no-Hen rather) actually speeded up the<br/>\n&gt; Bakumatsu: had it not been such a catalyst for Choshu<br/>\n&gt; to take action, then their rebellious politics might<br/>\n&gt; have festered for much longer before coming to the<br/>\n&gt; boil. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Either way, it was a matter of a few years earlier or<br/>\n&gt; a few years later.

Like many scholars he got distracted and had to pursue other<br/>\nstuff and so forth so it never happened (T_T)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this mean? And why is it important that &quot;scholars&quot; get<br/>\ninterested?  Because they write, publish and preserve.  They do the<br/>\nnerd work which needs to be done.  And their writing is the source for<br/>\nfandom products (pop-culture etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words---it is up to us fans to make the Shinsengumi so<br/>\nsignificant that they finally will look into studying them. It is up<br/>\nto us (*_*).  The cycle between academia and culture must be nurtured<br/>\notherwise in a few decades the Shinsengumi will simply slip back into<br/>\n&quot;cliche&quot; when as we know they were very fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope anyone here who is in college will consider speaking to<br/>\ngraduate students or professors who specialize in this field and ask<br/>\nthem about their interests.
