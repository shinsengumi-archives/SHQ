If you have seen Kurosawa&#39;s film then<br/>\nyou&#39;ll know that it means shadow warrior or body double (stand in) for<br/>\nthe important person.  Okita&#39;s friend knows Saitou (that is the<br/>\nmystery part) and I thought yaoi mangas did not have good stories!  In<br/>\nany case Soshite Saitou is very well designed (okay I&#39;ll say it he&#39;s<br/>\n*adorable*) and perhaps the few characters in the series -not-<br/>\ninvolved in the yaoi activities ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\n*if you are blessed with dsl then download the scanlations</div>",
