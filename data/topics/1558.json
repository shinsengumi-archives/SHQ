This is currently being considered by the<br/>\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation legal staff.  The photos were not<br/>\ntaken by the newspaper.    However, I can send to you information on<br/>\nthe Wakamatsu site that is included in the state registry program.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nthings to keep in mind are...California is suffering a state deficit<br/>\nand -maybe- that is why these items have taken so long to go through<br/>\nthe preservation and recording process.  The California State Park<br/>\nreceived these items in 2001[!] and the museum which will in the<br/>\nfuture house the items is a very very small museum in the middle of a<br/>\nnature preserve complete with park rangers (this is based on a<br/>\nassumption that there are hiking trails etc).  Sadly, the individuals<br/>\nI contacted were not able to divulge even if the sword&#39;s tang bears<br/>\nany identifying feature such as the maker&#39;s name.  I also asked what<br/>\n-kind- of bowl is in possession of the park.  My other question was<br/>\nthe dimension of the white silk banner. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I would get the photos by now (basically I was expecting<br/>\nlike a brochure/pamphlet thing which museums print---wasn&#39;t looking<br/>\nfor anything fancy)...as the person even requested my mailing address.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in conclusion...as of this moment we have nothing (-_-)<br/>\nHopefully, in the future, such educational facilities such as museums<br/>\nwill be able to address the enthusiasm the public may have for items<br/>\nin their possession.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; This based on a post at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumimb.com\">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>\n&gt; MissB found some intriguing info for us regarding Aizu settlers in <br/>\n&gt; California in 1869.
