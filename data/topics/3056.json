His included footnote only describes<br/>\n&gt;hatamoto, but doesn&#39;t give any sort of source for the above.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Also, I am hardly surprised that he makes a blanket statement like &quot;Although <br/>\nthe entire corps, from Kondo and Hijikata on down, undoubtably and <br/>\nindisputably coveted the official ranking within the Tokugawa Hierarchy, <br/>\nKondo refused the offer.&quot; Note the key words there: &quot;...undoubtably and <br/>\nindisputably coveted the official ranking...&quot; How can he back this up? Am I <br/>\nsupposed to take the word of a man who openly considers Shinsengumi no <br/>\nbetter than ravenous dogs? Does he have a journal or record where Kondou <br/>\nsays &quot;I want this post really really bad&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A generous monthly stipend was attached.&quot; makes it sound like the Shogunate <br/>\nwas throwing a side of beef to hungry wolves. If you worked for the Shogun, <br/>\ncompared to being a poor dojo master, a medicine peddler, or what have you, <br/>\nto have a stable stipend (at least on paper) in and of itself was generous. <br/>\nYes, there were retainers of the shogun who were low-ranking and low-paid, <br/>\nbut Shinsengumi wasn&#39;t just any group of people-- if the Shogunate was going <br/>\nto take the trouble of retaining them and giving them rank as *hatamoto*, <br/>\nwhich I take as being roughly equivalent in some cases to a cavalry officer <br/>\n(I base this conclusion on the hatamoto data in &quot;Edo Machi Bugyo-jiten,&quot; by <br/>\nSasama Yoshihiko, ISBN: 978-4760124947), then the stipend *would* be <br/>\n&quot;generous&quot;. Also, since he doesn&#39;t cite his sources I suppose it&#39;s pointless <br/>\nto ask if he knows what the stipend level was.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He goes on to say that this is because he felt that the Shinsengumi had not <br/>\nfulfilled all of its objectives because it still had not me the goal of <br/>\nremoving the foreigners...&quot; He gives no sources or footnotes for this one, <br/>\nright? The Shinsengumi believed in &quot;sonno-joi,&quot; but then again, so did <br/>\n(ultimately) people in the Bakufu, as well as Choshu &quot;radicals,&quot; and so on. <br/>\nHowever, I would like to see Mr. Hillsborough produce *one* solid piece of <br/>\nincontrovertible evidence that Shinsengumi had &quot;removal of foreigners&quot; as an <br/>\nobjective. Shinsengumi was not formed to drive out foreigners; it did not do <br/>\nanything to drive out foreigners in its entire existence, it did not engage <br/>\nin slaying foreigners as the assassins serving the &quot;enlightened&quot; Meiji <br/>\nrulers of later years did. It even received training from foreigners in <br/>\nlater years, and following the return to Edo, its uniform, as attested to by <br/>\nIkeda Shichisaburo and quoted in Kikuchi Akira&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi Hyakuichi no <br/>\nNazo&quot; (ISBN 978-4404019981) and &quot;Shinsengumi Jitsuroku&quot; (ISBN <br/>\n978-4480056788), was Western-style. Is Mr. Hillsborough weaving fact with <br/>\nhis own fiction?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe full roster of men-- in fact, a copy of the very same bakushin-toritate <br/>\norder-- who accepted Bakushin-toritate (it&#39;s been awhile since I looked at <br/>\nit, but I believe that 105 is the number of the Shinsengumi who accepted, <br/>\nwhile a handful rejected it, captured, and were made to commit suicide in <br/>\nthe Aizu offices) appears in &quot;Shinsengumi Seishi,&quot; by Tsuri Yoichi <br/>\n(Published by Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1998, ISBN 978-4404025708). Kondou is <br/>\non it, Hijikata is on it, and others....now I just have to be sure to make <br/>\nscans next time I go to the nearest library that has it, so you can all see.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

His name was<br/>\nSakurada Matsumaro, and he was alive till some 20<br/>\nyears ago (he was a friend of my grandfather, who was<br/>\nfrom Aizu). Before WWII, he was one of the kendo<br/>\ninstructors in Brazil.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the records,<br/>\n<br/>\n1) His grandfather was Sakurada Sakuramaro and he was<br/>\none of the kenjutsu instructors of Sendai. This<br/>\nimplies that Yamanami Keisuke most probably wasn&#39;t<br/>\nSakurada Sakuramaro himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Their kenjutsu style was Hokushin Itto ryu. This<br/>\nimplies that either Chuka Itto ryu was abandoned (at<br/>\nleast its name) or it was something that was passed<br/>\nonly to the head of the family, which I think it&#39;s<br/>\nmore likely. So, the head (first son) would inherit<br/>\nChuka Itto ryu and all the others would learn Hokushin<br/>\nItto. According to this hypothesis, Yamanami Keisuke<br/>\nwould have been proficient in Hokushin Itto, not<br/>\nChuka, which  explains why the name Chuka Itto ryu<br/>\nisn&#39;t associated with Keisuke.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSerizawa Kamo<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.<br/>\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.<br/>\n  I have created over a thousand blades.<br/>\n       Unknown to Death.<br/>\n   Nor known to Life.<br/>\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.<br/>\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.<br/>\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Although on one hand it seemed to be a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mark of distinction to obtain the samurai status, economically speaking <br/>\n&gt; &gt; many people, including the samurai themselves, knew that the money can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; be found in the purportedly &quot;lower&quot; classes.  For example during the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Meiji era a survey of families who sent their daughters to a public <br/>\n&gt; &gt; school---across the board claimed samurai descent, but many *before <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1868 had engaged in clearly merchant class businesses (this flies <br/>\n&gt; &gt; against the widespread abhorrance of samurai to engage in such work).  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; By far the most econommically dynamic classes were the upper peasant <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and merchant classes.  What killed the samurai class was their obsolete <br/>\n&gt; &gt; role and drain on the economy---samurai no longer and never did <br/>\n&gt; &gt; produced &quot;anything&quot; unlike the lower classes, although as we now they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fulfilled critical administrative roles.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t finished this page yet but when I&#39;m done I&#39;ll upload it to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shinsengumihq.com:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Before Boshin 1868: A Survey of the Feudal System<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/BakumatsuBackground.htm\">http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/BakumatsuBackground.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s really important to note this article<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Farmers of Edo and the Warriors in Kyoto <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Because the Shinsengumi, for the first time are mentioned in a non-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior context, were right smack in the middle of the social pyramid <br/>\n&gt; &gt; blur---they were close friends/associates/adopted siblings to ELITE <br/>\n&gt; &gt; PEASANTS, WELL EDUCATED PEASANTS.  Thus people like Kondou and Hijikata <br/>\n&gt; &gt; had a deep understanding of what was going on because they valued these <br/>\n&gt; &gt; social relationships and clearly, in no way abandoned their associates <br/>\n&gt; &gt; after attaining that feudal &quot;dream&quot; of samuraihood so to speak.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I did pose the question to Mr. Hillsborough of whether or not he would <br/>\n&gt; &gt; address what was going in Tama at the time and if he would discuss in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; depth the social background of these figures.  Specifically, rural Edo <br/>\n&gt; &gt; where many members from the Shinsengumi call home has been studied by <br/>\n&gt; &gt; scholars specifically for all that social blurring.  During the Meiji <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Era that region produced incredibly politically active farmers who <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pushed for *real democratic change and surprisingly opposed some of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; victors of 1868.

Because they did see things differently, after <br/>\n&gt; &gt; all, travelling from rural Edo to Kyoto was an eye opening <br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience...trying to navigate the capital&#39;s bureaucracy must&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather difficult for a bunch of &quot;nobodies&quot;.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1367528506\">The origins of Yamanami Keisuke are unclear. Several sources record him as <br/>\nbeing the son of &quot;Yamanami, a sword instructor of the Sendai domain&quot;. It <br/>\njust so happens that I have copies of sections from &quot;Sendai Boshin-shi&quot; <br/>\n(written by Fujiwara Ainosuke, published (or more correctly, REpublished) in <br/>\n1980) that may have the answer to who his father was.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to p. 717, which lists all the hereditary sword instructor <br/>\nfamilies of the Sendai domain, there is *no* Yamanami. However, at the end <br/>\nof the list of instructor families, there is a name that is given-- family <br/>\n*and* given name, as though compared to the rest, he was a newcomer.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sakurada Keisuke, instructor in Hokushin-ittoryu&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, according to the Japanese Wikipedia article on Yamanami, he was <br/>\ncertified in Ono-ha Ittoryu, and later studied Hokushin-ittoryu under Chiba <br/>\nShusaku. I have no further confirmation of this; however, it is notable that <br/>\n&quot;Keisuke&quot; is spelled the same way, and that Yamanami did have training in <br/>\nthe same style. This is my theory (connected to the comments on his <br/>\nname-reading in the Japanese Wikipedia article)-- the family name &quot;Yamanami&quot; <br/>\ncan also be read &quot;Sannan&quot;-- which, this site elaborates, could be spelled <br/>\none of several ways, one of which reads &quot;Third son&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, &quot;Keisuke&quot; is a &quot;common name,&quot; (I believe the Japanese is <br/>\n&quot;tsuumyou&quot;) which in some families can be inherited. Case in point-- the <br/>\nsenior Aizu retainer Saigo Tanomo. There were many men in his ancestry who <br/>\ncarried the &quot;common name&quot; Tanomo-- his formal name sets him apart from them <br/>\n(Chikanori). For those who didn&#39;t know, Yamanami&#39;s formal name was Tomonobu.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else that any potential researchers should be on the lookout for, <br/>\nif possible, is if Sakurada Keisuke also claimed descent from the Fujiwara, <br/>\nas Yamanami did.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven this preliminary evidence, it is my belief, and my tentative theory <br/>\nabout Yamanami-- that it would not be ridiculous at all, if Yamanami was the <br/>\n&quot;Sannan&quot;-- third son-- of Sakurada Keisuke, that he inherited the &quot;common <br/>\nname&quot; of Keisuke, and that when he left Sendai-- something that was <br/>\ntantamount to treason and often necessitated name-changing for the sake of <br/>\nsafety-- he made a pun on &quot;Sannan&quot;, changing the characters that spell that <br/>\nsound-- which gives us the &quot;Yamanami&quot; that we know today.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a theory, but I believe it to be a not entirely meaningless one.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

You can&#39;t really talk about &quot;samurai status&quot; as <br/>\na hard and fast rule. In many domains, you had to buy the right of bearing <br/>\nswords, but by the 1860s, just the fact that you could have people from ANY <br/>\nstatus join a group like Shinsengumi and carry swords, without (barring <br/>\nknowledge to the contrary) needing to buy &quot;samurai&quot; status, shows that just <br/>\nby joining Shinsengumi and carrying swords, one could have de facto samurai <br/>\n&quot;status&quot;. The issue of sword-carrying and name-bearing is a problematic one, <br/>\nand yes, even despite the image of four airtight classes, there is no <br/>\nironclad rule, and there are a lot of exceptions. But I&#39;m getting off-topic <br/>\nhere, so I&#39;ll continue with a definition of &quot;bakushin-toritate&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBakushin-toritate roughly rendered, means &quot;Conferring of the status of <br/>\nShogunal retainers&quot;. Shogunal *sanction* they already had-- why else would <br/>\nthey be included in the myriad of samurai who guarded the rivers that the <br/>\nShogun traversed to get to Kyoto in the early period? (1863-ish-- this is in <br/>\na map Hijikata drew, and included in a letter) Bakushin-toritate means that <br/>\nthey were now shogunal retainers, just like anyone else who was born into <br/>\nthat status (e.g. hatamoto like Takenaka Shigekata, and any of the myriad <br/>\ngokenin).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was that status of Tokugawa retainer that allowed, for instance, Kondou <br/>\nIsami to meet face-to-face with someone like Nagai Naoyuki, who was a <br/>\nhigh-ranking hatamoto (senior Tokugawa retainer). Nagai started out as <br/>\nKondou&#39;s senior in terms of rank, back in early &#39;63, but by late 1867, <br/>\nfollowing the aforementioned bakushin-toritate, he could meet with Nagai <br/>\nface to face. Nagai, a man  born into a daimyo family and adopted by a <br/>\nhigh-ranking hatamoto, who had been involved with supervising naval training <br/>\nin Nagasaki, commanding one of the Shogunate&#39;s first Western-style warships, <br/>\nand was a wakadoshiyori (junior councilor) and at one time (during <br/>\nMatsudaira Katamori&#39;s, and later Kondou&#39;s, arrival in Kyoto) city magistrate <br/>\nof Kyoto, was most definitely WAY above Kondou in terms of birth status. <br/>\nHowever, thanks to this promotion, they were essentially equals in rank.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\">http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/</a></div>",
