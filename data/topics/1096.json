Were these ever done on <br/>\npurpose?  I posted a link to a site which contains short videos to <br/>\ntours of Shinsengumi related sites and in one segment the guide was <br/>\npointing out a damaged door/window (removed from the main structure) <br/>\nbut he seemed kind of enthusiastic not at all serious so it made me <br/>\nwonder if guys just slashed at stuff for fun(?). The book from which <br/>\nI scanned the full body chainmail also contains MORE sword scars <br/>\nthan those seen on websites...did our guys get a little too rowdy at <br/>\ntimes?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor people who haven&#39;t seen my sig at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumimb.com\">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/sig10.jpg\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/sig10.jpg</a></div>",
