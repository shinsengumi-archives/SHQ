            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-953409027\">I just popped over to shinsengumimb and what should be there but a new message in the Sekihoutai forum!  A message from momoiro with a story of how later in life Suzuki prayed for not only his brother and others, but also Kondou and Hijikata.  There was also apparently something written about him by his son-in-law and I *think* the links momoiro provided either are or are derived from an interview with Suzuki&#39;s grandson.  I got so excited I forgot to copy links and such...  :-D  Just go on over to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumimb.com\">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> and it&#39;s under the Suzuki website topic in the Sekihoutai forum.<br/>\n <br/>\nReally cool comment (from the grandson, I think, when Suzuki was teaching him kendo) about how Suzuki&#39;s eyes shone, too!  Suppose it was a requirement for entry into the Shinsengumi?  :-D<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (who feels way too tipsy to be rational right now)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
