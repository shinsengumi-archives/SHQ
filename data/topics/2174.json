            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2045835003\">Anyone who has surfed the Japanese sites will always find Shizuko <br/>\nAkama&#39;s work mentioned here and there.  Like many Shinsengumi <br/>\nresearchers she obviously went through a HIjikata &quot;phase&quot; and wrote a <br/>\nbook on him in the 1970s.  She is most well known ofcourse for her <br/>\nbooks on Saitou Hajime.  Most recently she mentioned that she would <br/>\nlike to continue writing on Fujita Goro and...TAKEDA.  She seems to <br/>\nbe pretty cool and if anyone out there, besides the usual <br/>\ntranslators, would like to try to translate this piece please do <br/>\nhelp.  She even interacts with fans, owns Fujita Goro&#39;s haori and <br/>\nfrankly without her dedication many mysteries surrounding Saitou and <br/>\nhis later career would have never been explored.  Personally, I wish <br/>\nI knew Japanese so that I could interview her and have her explain <br/>\nher own personal interpretations on things. But the most important <br/>\nquestion is...&quot;of all the fascinating members of the <br/>\nShinsengumi...why Saitou?&quot;  Because Okita and Hijikata and Nagakura <br/>\n(due to his memoirs) have always been the more popular figures, so I <br/>\nwonder why she picked Saitou.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to burden our usual volunteers so someone please please <br/>\nhelp (^_^).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is an elderly lady...this is a very old picture<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shizukoakamabio.jpg\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shizukoakamabio.jpg</a></div>",
