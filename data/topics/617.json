Please take note I have NOT read the manga <br/>\nnor have finished the Anime... <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for sure I know that there are two manga releases by Nanae-san... <br/>\nOne is the &quot;Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker&quot; and the other <br/>\nis &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;. Tying the anime to the manga, I would <br/>\nthink the anime started with Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker? Since I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever seen the ending, did it just end with the first manga series <br/>\nor the second? OR did the anime start with the second manga series, <br/>\nPeacemaker Kurogane?<br/>\n<br/>\n*Possible Spoiler*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scanlations most of us have... The three volume one, is that <br/>\nPeacemaker Kurogane or Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker? I was talking to <br/>\nan acquaintance back in Singapore and she kept going on and on, on <br/>\nhow unhappy she was that Okita is slowly but surely getting sick. To <br/>\nthose who have read both manga series, does the second one mention <br/>\nthis at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a fan of manga (have not even read past volume 3 of RK) so <br/>\nplease can someone tell me since, I haven&#39;t read this at all. Thank <br/>\nyou!</div>",
