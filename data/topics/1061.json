From now on,<br/>\nevery acquaintance. To tell the truth my wife with Kitakata city<br/>\ngraduate something, the lineage of the grandmother is the Aizu feudal<br/>\nclan loyal retainer. You think that there is a memorial stone monument<br/>\nof the person, &quot;Nakane United States seven&quot;, in Kumakura, but that<br/>\nperson becomes the grandfather of the grandmother of the wife. It<br/>\nseems that as for this person at the time of æ è¾° war being in blue<br/>\ndragon party, it survives, causes &quot;thought bridge incident&quot; incident,<br/>\ngoes to Seinan war. It is drawn Saigo prosperously and together with<br/>\nthe brocade picture of Seinan war. After that, returning to Kumakura,<br/>\nbeing to commit hara-kiri, it does, but that time, Saito one where had<br/>\nbecome the policeman helped the United States seven from the spy, so<br/>\nis. Naturally, as for the blood of that United States seven it is not<br/>\nflowing to me, but when you think, that that blood is succeeded in the<br/>\nchildren, you think very in pride. When this time, going home in<br/>\nKitakata, you think that I would like to go to visiting a grave.<br/>\n<br/>\nbasically his wife is related to an Aizu retainer who served in the<br/>\nblue dragon party (for those of you who are new the defense of Aizu<br/>\nwas split into age groups, genbu/turtle (oldest), seiryu? dragon,<br/>\nphoenix (Saitou was part of phoenix) and white tiger (youngest<br/>\nguys)...the rest I&#39;m not clear...the man is happy that his kids have<br/>\nAizu blood in their veins it seems</div>",
