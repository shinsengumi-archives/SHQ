(^_^) I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\nWhat I meant is---in an ideal situation, studying this era in teams<br/>\nwould be the best way to learn.  A book written by authors, each a<br/>\nspecialist in his or her field would be the ultimate book.  It is<br/>\nsimply too much for one academic to handle this ENTIRE CONFLICT alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that was just an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will happen in such a learning setting is...<br/>\nLoyalists &quot;you, Aizu, don&#39;t you get it? The Shogun abdicated already<br/>\nyou lost now go bye bye.&quot;<br/>\nAizu &quot;yes we know that but how come you are gathering forces to march<br/>\nagainst us?  We are negotiating with you and also writing letters--can<br/>\nyou hold your troops back?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut such a dialogue can even be backed up with actual documents:<br/>\nMatsudaira Katamori<br/>\n&quot;The recent...turn of events is ultimately due to my incompetence...I<br/>\nhave disgraced myself completely...while in Edo, I had hoped to take<br/>\nimmediate action that would redress the situation.  But the shogun was<br/>\noccupied with his own affairs , and so I decided to return to Aizu for<br/>\nthe time being.  We have now been told that the government has ordered<br/>\nseveral domains to punish Aizu with military force.  If their troops<br/>\nadvance to our borders, we have no choice but to make full<br/>\npreparations for war.&quot; (p.40 Shiba Goro&#39;s REMEMBERING AIZU)<br/>\n<br/>\nAizu here there and everywhere.  Hillsborough uses Nagakura&#39;s work<br/>\nalot, so you will read of Nagakura and Harada wanting to head to<br/>\nAizu---however Kondou and Hijikata infected with the &quot;germ of<br/>\nself-importance&quot; would not allow that unless the two submitted<br/>\nthemselves as vassals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat participants will realize and experience in a controlled<br/>\nhistorical RPG are the passions and political reasonings behind each<br/>\nside of the conflict. You will then understand why people gambled<br/>\ntheir lives for their cause. However, RPGs are often taken<br/>\n&quot;personally&quot; and learning may not occur.  RPGs also take a huge amount<br/>\nof time.  A transcript of such a group effort may be a valuable source<br/>\nfor people who are not inclined to read the standard 2-5 pound texts<br/>\non the collapse of the Shogunate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe no longer have a messageboard.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumiMB.com\">http://www.shinsengumiMB.com</a> points<br/>\nto this mailing list.

It certainly isn&#39;t the noble version<br/>\nof history that the taiga tries to portray.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Taiga drama is definately just an inspirational drama. I know what<br/>\nS is talking about, &quot;noble version of history&quot; is really just a dream.<br/>\nPerhaps that is the value of fiction, to allow people to define on<br/>\ntheir own what is &quot;good&quot; which may be difficult if nearly impossible<br/>\nto find in reality. So in the end perhaps we just internalize what is<br/>\nheroism and look to ourselves for that ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst the prize:  Brand new copy of Romulus Hillsborough&#39;s book<br/>\nshipped right to your door from Amazon. Or, one brand new Shinsengumi<br/>\nrelated dvd. ***see bottom for other possible prize<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to win: write the most awesome, compelling essay to justify the<br/>\npragmatics of attacking Aizu you have to be a 110% hardcore advocate<br/>\nfor the Imperialists. Nobody is going to shred your argument---however<br/>\nthey must be sound/logical/organized and backed up with atleast 5<br/>\ntextual sources (no websites/online encyclopedias).  Your essay will<br/>\nbe donated to shinsengumihq.com but will remain your property under<br/>\nyour name.  file will be posted as a adobe pdf.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it stands, the northern alliance was actually the last stronghold<br/>\nfor the bakufu.  Enomoto had other plans.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReason:  The most ideal way of studying this era is to examine it in<br/>\n&quot;teams&quot;.  EAch team handles a domain such as Tosa, Satsuma, Choshu,<br/>\nAizu, Imperial FAmily, Shogunate and freeby foreign powers. EAch team<br/>\nshould be an advocate for his or her domain and use only the reasons<br/>\nor &quot;evidence&quot; available to people at that time. Get in a room and<br/>\nargue it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunatley, we&#39;re just a bunch of fans---we don&#39;t have all day to<br/>\nstudy all sides of the issue.  But we know that more than one side<br/>\nneeds to be studied.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence, this contest is a &quot;shortcut&quot; for just compiling facts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLength of paper---as long or short as you want.  We just want the<br/>\nfacts.  If your paper ends up being 50% the philosophical motivations<br/>\nof the Imperialists then you need to look more carefully at the<br/>\nhistorical details.  Short sentences are good.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: you must be careful in citing your sources, use footnotes and a<br/>\nbibliography using MLA format----paraphrasing someone else&#39;s words too<br/>\nclosely also constitutes plagiarism.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeadline NOvember 18<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the essay is SO truly jaw-droppingly awesome to convert a<br/>\nShinsengumi fan to the side of the imperialists then you may win a<br/>\nShinsengumi haori made in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an exercise in going to the &quot;other side&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nsecretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com</div>",
