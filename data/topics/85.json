            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1352278631\">Thanks to MissBehavin&#39; setting me straight on how files can be saved in the Files section, the LJ is no longer a closed archive.  It&#39;s completely open.  You don&#39;t even have to register with LJ --- at least, I don&#39;t think you do.  Anyone can read the posts and I think anyone can comment to them.  Still not quite sure how that works.  You can give it try.<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office\">http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office</a> .<br/>\n <br/>\nThe SHQ Spy Division yahoo site should work just fine to archive stories.  Saving stories as html gives writers the freedom to present stories as they want them to look, including fonts, colors, etc., so have fun (but remember the poor eyes of your readers).  You can still post stories to the list as usual, but you lose your formatting.  Since the stupid thing insists on notifying the membership that a file has been uploaded (I am *really* sorry about all those messages), we should all know it&#39;s available and can link directly to it.  I think you can...  (btw, does anyone know, does it send notification for everything I upload simply because I&#39;m a moderator or does it do that for everyone who uploads something?)<br/>\n <br/>\nThe only thing I would ask is that you keep the basics of the header at the front of the story so people can contact you, we know it&#39;s okay to archive it on the website, readers can be warned of specific kinds of content they may want to avoid, and you can get some protection for yourself and your work with the disclaimer.  Give the file the title of the story when you save it since Yahoo *will* use that as the file name when it&#39;s uploaded into the Files section.  (I&#39;ve since found out that it doesn&#39;t do that with image files... why it kept insisting on doing that on me a few weeks back, I&#39;ll never know.)  When you upload, in the description field just be sure to include the rating and universe your story involves, and hopefully some idea of which wolf or wolves are involved.  Who you are, as author, should be identified by who uploaded the file AND in the header.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs MissBehavin&#39; offered over on SHQ, if you can&#39;t get a file saved in html (web page) format, let me know (or her, if she&#39;s willing) and it&#39;ll get it done.  If one of us uploads it, you&#39;d be identified in the description as the author.<br/>\n <br/>\nMajor redrafting and freeing up of guidelines.  Bear with me while I change it ONE MORE TIME.  Then I promise to just go away.<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n <br/>\nP.S.  Great things underway over at the website.  Check it out.  Barb and her cohorts are doing a wonderful job.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/</a>   Uh... I just thought of something... maybe I&#39;m not supposed to give out the address of the fiction page yet???<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online.
