I gave it 3 stars and<br/>\neverything ::shrugs::<br/>\n<br/>\naha!  I figured out why the title was changed to include &quot;Last<br/>\nSamurai&quot; the book turns up in searches related to the Tom Cruise movie* <br/>\n<br/>\nXD<br/>\n<br/>\nlove it, hate it, or completely neutral the book will be the only<br/>\nsource of info on the Shinsengumi for years to come<br/>\n<br/>\nhence my dismay at Hillsborough&#39;s unprofessional approach to the<br/>\ncontroversial group.  Let&#39;s say a serious student or researcher<br/>\nsearches for anything with the word &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; all they&#39;ll get is<br/>\nthis book and the occasional 1 sentence mentioned in some academic<br/>\njournal article.  Thus, writers must try to be as responsible as<br/>\npossible and think beyond their own personal agenda before publishing<br/>\nanything remotely related to non-fiction.  Hillsborough ofcourse noted<br/>\nthat his work is not entirely non-fiction (I mentioned this in my<br/>\nreview) but that doesn&#39;t mean he shouldn&#39;t give this project his best<br/>\neffort.  We all know the Shinsengumi have long since entered the world<br/>\nof folk tales.<br/>\n<br/>\nHillsborough was missing many many good sources to use for his book.<br/>\n<br/>\nas I was working on some stuff for <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> I<br/>\nturned to arguably the best book on why the shogunate system<br/>\nfell...after using it for a doorstop for many months<br/>\n<br/>\nTotman, Conrad. The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu 1862-1868 Hawaii:<br/>\nThe University of Hawaii Press, 1980. ISBN: 082480614X<br/>\n<br/>\nboth the Shinsengumi, Kondou Isami and Mimwari (Not indexed) are<br/>\nmentioned...more importantly Totman included the end note on Kondou&#39;s<br/>\nreport given to Kyoto officials on Oct 9 1867.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis report is was reproduced in Kitahara Masanaga&#39;s book SHICHINENSHI<br/>\nprinted in 1904.<br/>\n<br/>\nsee <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a> <br/>\ndo an &#39;edit&#39; and &#39;find&#39; for &quot;Oct 9&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shichinenshi (SNS) was used by Totman alongside the Dai Nihon<br/>\nIshin Shiryo kohon (Manuscript of historical materials on the<br/>\nrestoration) DNISK &quot;by far the greatest collection of historical<br/>\nmaterials relating to the Meiji restoration but has been almost unused<br/>\nby western scholars&quot; (Totman 549).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shichinenshi was the first attempt to understand the politics of<br/>\n1868 from the shogunate&#39;s point of view, but more specifically the<br/>\nside of Aizu.  Totman used SNS alongside KYOTO SHUGOSHOKU SHIMATSU<br/>\n(the story of the Kyoto Protector) written by Yamakawa Hiroshi printed<br/>\nby Numazawa/Numasawa Shichirou adopted father of Tokio+Goro&#39;s third son.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I can only hope that both these works (used by many<br/>\nresearchers) discussed Aizu&#39;s most famous security group, the<br/>\nShinsengumi.  Yamakawa Hiroshi, an Aizu samurai, was a personal friend<br/>\nof Fujita Goro (we know Hiroshi best as the guy who put Goro and Tokio<br/>\ntogether).  Hiroshi&#39;s younger brother, Kenjiro, wrote Aizu boshin<br/>\nsenshi (several hundred pages, perhaps in collaboration with others).<br/>\n  The &quot;status&quot; of the Shinsengumi in these 2 works by the Yamakawa<br/>\nbrothers should reveal some interesting details.  AFterall both<br/>\nbrothers knew a former captain of the Shinsengumi, not to mention<br/>\nnumerous other survivors from Aizu.<br/>\n<br/>\nAizu Beyond 1868<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm</a><br/>\nis a study of the domain&#39;s Tokyo network, note the publication dates<br/>\nand who was still alive to read many of the works...</div>",
