Shinsengumi fans are definitely the best when it comes to tracking things down and sharing!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.jp/hayasenagaru/sekihou/nenpyo.html\">http://www.geocities.jp/hayasenagaru/sekihou/nenpyo.html</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a timetable comparing Sekihoutai&#39;s actions to<br/>\nthe Imperial Army&#39;s (&quot;Soutokufu&quot;) actions.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nCan anyone tell me why this site is coming up in gibberish instead of kanji?  Because of that, babelfish can&#39;t translate it (apparently).  Anything I can do from my end to get it to load correctly?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www1.ocn.ne.jp/~oomi/tokusyu14.htm\">http://www1.ocn.ne.jp/~oomi/tokusyu14.htm</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>And this is about the incident where Sagara Souzou<br/>\ntried to put fire in the Satsuma fief house and caused<br/>\nseveral disturbances in the city of Edo.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nTried to put &quot;out&quot; the fire, right?  He was a Satsuma retainer by then and this would be the incident MissB included where the bakufu set fire to the Satsuma villa in retaliation? <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m curious about a couple of things... the fish is too vague for me to figure out.  Are they saying that Sagara&#39;s body is actually buried where the monument in Shimosuwa is?  And what&#39;s this &quot;Mitsuru&quot;?  Kojima four must be Koshima Shirou (are &quot;j&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; used interchangeably like &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;oh&quot; as in Saitou&#39;s name?) and they&#39;re saying he changed it to Sagara Souzou (&quot;entire three&quot;?), but I&#39;m not understanding &quot;military officer Mitsuru,&quot; which shows up several times in the article.<br/>\n <br/>\n(babelfish): &quot;Entire watch Kojima four �Y military officer Mitsuru (changed name Sagara entire three)&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Unfortunately, both links are in Japanese :-/&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;d say that&#39;s unfortunate for morons like me... :-D  Still, as with the Shinsengumi and Saitou sites secretarytocapt3&#39;s been digging up, it is a little more than we had previously, even if we often end up speculating on the babelfish translation and then *begging* you and Masayoshi for a real translation.  And it does give me hope that struggling with babelfish may be worth it for Sagara.  I&#39;m really grateful, SK.<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (who really isn&#39;t ready to set up a Sagara site, but thinking maybe it&#39;s time to get this stuff organized for Japanese-language-challenged interested parties... )<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
