which are being written that <br/>\n  Shinsengumi was criminal. <br/>\n  However, these two works are not exact as data. <br/>\n  The author of &quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; had prejudice in Shinsengumi <br/>\n  very much.<br/>\n  The journalist of an Otaru newspaper wrote &quot;Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki&quot; <br/>\n  based on Nagakura&#39;s discourse. <br/>\n  As for them, both have inconsistency in the contents of description.<br/>\n  (Incidentally, this episode does not appear <br/>\n  in &quot;Roushibunkyuhoukokukiji&quot; with more high data value with <br/>\n  Nagakura&#39;s work.) <br/>\n  There are researchers who acknowledge a Shinsengumi criminal theory. <br/>\n  And there are researchers who deny it. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Since this book released recently is written in detail about this <br/>\n  incident, it explains referring to this. <br/>\n<br/>\n  http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4087747131/qid%<br/>\n  3D1094474771/249-9385455-7181936<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Shinsengumi no enkei&quot;  Noguchi Takehiko work<br/>\n  Incidentally this book has denied the Shinsengumi criminal theory. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It is &quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; in Meiji 22 (A.D.1889) that the <br/>\n  Shinsengumi criminal theory was announced at the very beginning. <br/>\n  &quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; is writing that Uchiyama blamed Kondou with <br/>\n  the overbearing attitude, when Kondou reported sumo wrestling <br/>\n  wrestler&#39;s incident. <br/>\n  (Uchiyama disliked Shinsengumi which borrows money from the <br/>\n  merchants of Osaka forcibly.) <br/>\n  Kondou who received the very severe insult got angry, and made <br/>\n  subordinates investigate Uchiyama&#39;s thing. <br/>\n  When it turned out that he is a bad government official, Kondo <br/>\n  planned his assassination.<br/>\n  Four persons, Okita, Nagakura, Harada, and Inoue, are criminals who <br/>\n  performed it. <br/>\n  This book serves as the only basis of a Shinsengumi criminal theory. <br/>\n  However, it is very dangerous to trust this. <br/>\n  Although I had written to the board before, Nishimura Kanefumi, the <br/>\n  author of this book, was working for Nishi-Honoganji. <br/>\n  Although Nishi-Honoganji provided Shinsengumi with the place, it was <br/>\n  the ally of Chosyu in fact. <br/>\n  Nishimura had a severe prejudice to Shinsengumi. <br/>\n  After Okita killed Uchiyama, Uchiyama&#39;s head was cut and it was <br/>\n  thrust into the bamboo....&quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; is written such. <br/>\n  However, there is no such fact. <br/>\n  Nishimura wrote that Kondou and Hijikata were illiterate barbarians. <br/>\n  It is dangerous to trust it, although not all of the contents of <br/>\n  this book are a lie. <br/>\n  Incidentally, it has become clear that the place where Kondou <br/>\n  reported sumo wrestling wrestlers&#39; incident was Higashimachi-<br/>\n  Bugyousyo (East town-Bugyousyo).<br/>\n  Uchiyama was the government official of Nishimachi-Bugyousyo (West <br/>\n  town-Bugyousyo).<br/>\n  Kondou and Uchiyama cannot confront in this incident. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Although &quot;Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki&quot; is called Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s <br/>\n  work, the fact is the book edited based on the report serialized by <br/>\n  the Otaru newspaper. <br/>\n  Many portions considered to be the Otaru newspaper reporter&#39;s <br/>\n  fiction exist. <br/>\n  This book is writing that Uchiyama operated the market price of rice <br/>\n  in cooperation with Chosyu.<br/>\n  Uchiyama is the government official of the pure government. <br/>\n  He does not need to conspire with Chosyu.  <br/>\n  This book makes criminals Kondo, Hijikata, Okita, Nagakura, Harada, <br/>\n  Inoue, and Shimada. <br/>\n  This book is writing that Kondo cut Uchiyama first. <br/>\n  However, this book has the too careless facts. <br/>\n  It was that Uchiyama was assassinated on May 20 Genji 1 (A.D.1864). <br/>\n  However, this book is writing that incident, after Ito Kashitarou <br/>\n  was assassinated (A.D.1867).<br/>\n<br/>\n  About this mistake, Kikuchi Akira of a researcher is writing the <br/>\n  interesting opinion. <br/>\n  As for his opinion, although Nagakura talked about another incident <br/>\n  which arose around 1867, the newspaper reporter has mistaken with <br/>\n  Uchiyama&#39;s assassination talk.<br/>\n  Although the fact is not known, this book (Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki) <br/>\n  cannot be used as data of the Uchiyama assassination. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Or it is written in the diary of Shimada Kai that the injustice of <br/>\n  the government official of Osaka was investigated. <br/>\n  The researchers of Shinsengumi criminal theory say that this is <br/>\n  about Uchiyama. <br/>\n  (Mr. Noguchi is writing that 60 government officials were in Osaka <br/>\n  Bugyousyo at the time.<br/>\n  I think that it is difficult to affirm that it is Uchiyama&#39;s thing. <br/>\n  And isn&#39;t it weak as a reason for assassinating Uchiyama?) <br/>\n<br/>\n  As for Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s work&quot;Roushibunkyuhoukokukiji&quot;, the talk <br/>\n  of the Uchiyama assassination is not written. <br/>\n  Nagakura wrote this book in early stages of Meiji Era. <br/>\n  Naturally, data value is high. <br/>\n  However, this book was written in order to restore the honor of <br/>\n  Shinsengumi. <br/>\n  Therefore, the inconvenient fact of Shinsengumi may not be written. <br/>\n  (The researchers of Shinsengumi criminal theory emphasize it. <br/>\n  In fact, this book is not written at all about the death of <br/>\n  Yamanami.) <br/>\n<br/>\n  Uchiyama&#39;s assassination was on May 20, A.D. 1864. <br/>\n  There is a letter which Kondou addressed to the acquaintance on the <br/>\n  same day.<br/>\n  In the letter, he is sad about the situation of Shinsengumi. <br/>\n  At the time, Shinsengumi could not play an active part and Kondou <br/>\n  considered even the dismissal.<br/>\n  The morale of Shinsengumi was falling very much.<br/>\n  Mr. Noguchi has regarded the possibility of an upper government <br/>\n  official&#39;s assassination plan as questionable in such a situation. <br/>\n  It is not a best policy that they go to Osaka and cause trouble at <br/>\n  the time of such a critical situation. <br/>\n<br/>\n  (Incidentally, this letter has reported that homosexuality is in <br/>\n  prevalence within Shinsengumi.)^^;;; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPOILER?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for the episode of the Uchiyama assassination, being adopted in a <br/>\n  drama is very uncommon.<br/>\n  Although some reasons are considered, I think that it is the big <br/>\n  cause that is not suitable in the tale which made Shinsengumi the <br/>\n  hero. <br/>\n  Although Uchiyama is a bad man, the story that the powerless old man <br/>\n  was killed by young men is unjustifiable. <br/>\n  The fiction differs from the historical fact.<br/>\n  There is much episode which is not adopted as a drama or a novel <br/>\n  with the fact of being written to the research document.<br/>\n  Many those episode is used for a Taiga drama. <br/>\n<br/>\n  In the drama, I looked at Tonouchi Yoshio for the first time. <br/>\n  (He is the member of Roushigumi at the time of the beginning which <br/>\n  remained in Kyoto together with Kondou and others.<br/>\n  In the Taiga drama, he was considered to be a betrayer and was <br/>\n  assassinated by Serizawa.) <br/>\n  Although his name is often seen with a research document, it is <br/>\n  seldom seen in the fiction world. <br/>\n  In fact, almost all fictions write that only Serizawa group and <br/>\n  Kondou group remained to Kyoto. <br/>\n  Tonouchi group does not exist from the beginning in many cases. <br/>\n  They destroyed completely by conspiracy of Serizawa group and Kondou <br/>\n  group. <br/>\n  Tonouchi may have been assassinated by Kondou in fact.<br/>\n  There is a letter by which Kondou boasted of Tonouchi assassination.<br/>\n  Tonouchi is not a bad man and this incident arose in the result of a <br/>\n  struggle for power. <br/>\n  Do you think that you will adopt such episode supposing you write <br/>\n  the novel which made Shinsengumi the hero? <br/>\n  (I think that it is the fun of this Taiga drama to have adopted it <br/>\n  well.) <br/>\n<br/>\n  momoiro-usagi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPOILER?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the episode of the Uchiyama assassination, being adopted in a <br/>\ndrama is very uncommon.<br/>\nAlthough some reasons are considered, I think that it is the big <br/>\ncause that is not suitable in the tale which made Shinsengumi the <br/>\nhero. <br/>\nAlthough Uchiyama is a bad man, the story that the powerless old man <br/>\nwas killed by young men is unjustifiable. <br/>\nThe fiction differs from the historical fact.<br/>\nThere is much episode which is not adopted as a drama or a novel <br/>\nwith the fact of being written to the research document.<br/>\nMany those episode is used for a Taiga drama. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the drama, I looked at Tonouchi Yoshio for the first time. <br/>\n(He is the member of Roushigumi at the time of the beginning which <br/>\nremained in Kyoto together with Kondou and others.<br/>\nIn the Taiga drama, he was considered to be a betrayer and was <br/>\nassassinated by Serizawa.) <br/>\nAlthough his name is often seen with a research document, it is <br/>\nseldom seen in the fiction world. <br/>\nIn fact, almost all fictions write that only Serizawa group and <br/>\nKondou group remained to Kyoto. <br/>\nTonouchi group does not exist from the beginning in many cases. <br/>\nThey destroyed completely by conspiracy of Serizawa group and Kondou <br/>\ngroup. <br/>\nTonouchi may have been assassinated by Kondou in fact.<br/>\nThere is a letter by which Kondou boasted of Tonouchi assassination.<br/>\nTonouchi is not a bad man and this incident arose in the result of a <br/>\nstruggle for power. <br/>\nDo you think that you will adopt such episode supposing you write <br/>\nthe novel which made Shinsengumi the hero? <br/>\n(I think that it is the fun of this Taiga drama to have adopted it <br/>\nwell.) <br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",
