Shunretsu Mibu Roushi no Chuu to Zan&quot; Rekishi Gunzou Shiri-zu 31.(2003) Publised by Gakken, page 126-128 in artikel wrote by one Shinsengumi kenkyuuka, Itou Seirou, about Yamanami Keisuke ?<br/>\n  Something about when Yamanami joined Shieikan-Tennen Rishin Ryuu in 1860 based from data file Shinsengumi &#39;Ryouyuushiden&#39; (1907).....<br/>\n  ( cause I cant read the whole kanji.. -_- ;; )<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks in advanced !!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Regards,<br/>\n  Rei<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\nSerizawa Kamo &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:serizawakamo@...\">serizawakamo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Some more tidbits of random unconfirmed information...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. Why bakufu allowed a peasant to become their<br/>\n&gt; troop ?

Yamanami Keisuke no jutsuryuu wa Hokushin<br/>\n&gt; Ittouryuu or Tennen Rishin Ryuu<br/>\n&gt; ?<br/>\n&gt; ( cause both is exist in different book )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yamanami Keisuke-san no ryuuha wa Hokushin Ittouryuu<br/>\n&gt; darou? (Isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; Yamanami&#39;s sword tradition Hokushin-ittoryu?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read somewhere (can&#39;t recall exactly where) that he<br/>\njoined Tennen Rishin after losing to Kondo Isami and<br/>\neventually he became even a shihandai.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Yamanami&#39;s original style was Hokushin Itto. If we<br/>\nsuppose that Yamanami and Todo have indeed convinced<br/>\nIto Kashitaro to join the troop, then the Hokushin<br/>\nItto link must have played a crucial role in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rei also asks if it could be true that he trained in<br/>\n&gt; 2 styles. My answer is<br/>\n&gt; this-- cross-training was common in those days among<br/>\n&gt; serious martial<br/>\n&gt; artists. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s remember also that we have two kinds of<br/>\ncross-training: one involving practicing more than one<br/>\nstyle, and other involving matches against other<br/>\nstyles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latter was much more frequent. Although the styles<br/>\ndid have some &quot;diplomatic connections&quot;, so to speak,<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t that polite to practice more than one style<br/>\nat a time, unless you had authorization for that<br/>\nand/or had achieved mastery in one style before<br/>\nlearning another.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, kenjutsu dojos were more than simply a place for<br/>\nmartial arts practice. They were a kind of political<br/>\nparty, so to speak, and some were very influential.<br/>\nTherefore, the students who achieved a high status in<br/>\na dojo had to have not only a good proficiency with<br/>\nswords, but also a fine education.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Finally, Rei asks about the feelings/belief of<br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi toward martial<br/>\n&gt; training. As we all know, Shinsengumi was a group of<br/>\n&gt; people who were trained<br/>\n&gt; and hired for the sake of doing &quot;dirty work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not to mention that the core members of the<br/>\nShinsengumi were originally martial arts<br/>\npractitioners. Even Ito Kashitaro, who tends to be<br/>\nmore known for his erudition, was the headmaster of<br/>\nthe Hokushin Itto-ryu, a style created by his adoptive<br/>\nfather, Ito Seiichi, and derived from Hokushin<br/>\nItto-ryu. Yeah, the pronunciation is the same, but the<br/>\nkanji (ideograms) are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were recruited by Aizu because of their purposes<br/>\nand more importantly, of their martial arts skills.<br/>\nHence lots of emphasis were given in the training. Not<br/>\nto mention stuff like &quot;shiniban&quot; and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking about Aizu, found recently a magazine, owned<br/>\nby my grandfather, issued in 1928 by Aizu-kai, an<br/>\norganization of Aizu-related people, having as members<br/>\npeople like Yamakawa Kenjiro. Although there is no<br/>\nmention to Shinsengumi, there are some tidbits of<br/>\ninformation about Boshin War and the Aizu fief, from<br/>\nthe Aizu point of view.

One of the associates of Aizu-kai is a<br/>\ncertain Fujita Tsutomu, which sounds suspiciously like<br/>\nFujita Goro(Saito Hajime)&#39;s son. If one finds out that<br/>\nSaito Hajime&#39;s son was in the Army (Lt.

Oh we put you on the <br/>\nthank you list on the new site as well (^_^).  For new members here, <br/>\njust so you know Serizawa has been very generous to us over these <br/>\nmany years and we are happy to hear form him when he has the time to <br/>\nwrite to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n1928 it is really a critical year and I think alot of surviving 1st <br/>\nor second generation Aizu folks became very ACTIVE.  Because of the <br/>\nmarriage between Matsudaira Setsuko (granddaughter of Matsudaira <br/>\nKatamori and Prince Chichibu---brother of Emperor Hirohito).  The <br/>\ninformation we posted on the SHQ site for a long time now is about <br/>\nhow in 1928, Fujita Goro&#39;s sword (one of perhaps no doubt many he <br/>\nowned) was made a gift during this important wedding.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamakawa was a key figure in this wedding and discussed the matter <br/>\nwith Matsudaira TSuneo (son of Matsudaira Katamori).  SO we can see <br/>\nhow one generation of retainers...carries his duties over regardless <br/>\nof era.<br/>\n<br/>\n1928 is also year of the EArth Dragon.  Interestingly...similar to <br/>\nThe Boshin War of 1868.  It is just a coincedence...maybe.  The <br/>\nImperial wedding was meant to also symbolize a reincorporation of <br/>\nAizu back into the mainstream (politically).<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we know Fujita Tsutomu and Matsudaira Tsuneo were actually <br/>\nfriends I sort of would like to think that the possibility is very <br/>\nvery high that indeed &quot;Fujita Tsutomu&quot; is GOro and Tokio&#39;s oldest son.<br/>\n(^_^) but by 1928 he would be long retired from the army...maybe they <br/>\nincluded his last rank or something?<br/>\n<br/>\nAizukai kaiho?? (Report of the Aizu Society)---this could be the same <br/>\nmagazine likely...it is so valuable to us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example although it is not connected to the Shinsengumi, this <br/>\nmagazine contains narratives you WILL NOT FIND IN ENGLISH AT ALL.  We <br/>\ncan read the best books in English and it can tell us the politics, <br/>\nthe international diplomacy, the statistics but rarely a human <br/>\nnarrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example a narrative by a woman on what happened in the war <br/>\n(specifically at Aizu).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was close to obtaining Kinoko Takamine, &quot;Takamine Kinokojiden,&quot; <br/>\nAizukai kaiho (April 1970). But ultimately I failed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to read about how a mother (widowed) was trying to survive <br/>\nthrough these hard times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTakamine Kinoko&#39;s relation to Takagi Tokio (Fujita Tokio) was that of <br/>\nan aunt and no doubt was a maternal figure to Tokio, this is a story <br/>\nTakamine Kinoko would relate to female survivors of Aizu (such as <br/>\nTokio).</div>",

Not<br/>\neveryone stopped obeying the shogunate all at once...for instance, when<br/>\nSatsuma had their ronin terrorizing Edo in early 1868, the shogunate ordered<br/>\nShonai, Kaminoyama, and other domains to surround the Satsuma yashiki, and<br/>\nShonai (and the others) obeyed.<br/>\n(See: Totman, Conrad.

I don&#39;t know how long Ms. Hearn has studied Japanese but I <br/>\nthink she is lucky to have you to help with some research. So if she <br/>\ndoes give the Shinsengumi a cameo role it would be an interesting <br/>\nepisode (^_^).  Fans here are pretty familiar with &quot;Robot Shinsengumi <br/>\nwhose job was to Kill. Kill. and Kill some more&quot; and we know better.  <br/>\nI know she writes fiction/fantasy which frees her from all the <br/>\nhistorical details but still based on the popularity of her work I <br/>\nthink people like her complex characterizations, and even the bad <br/>\nboys in blue can offer alot of that. <br/>\n<br/>\nKitsuno:<br/>\n&quot;Also, Haverford College has a huge collection of Anna Hartshorne&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; letters - I got about 10 of them copied and sent to me, hoping to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get information on her life, but they were mostly letters written to <br/>\nher -one appeared to be a love letter, and another one mentioned <br/>\nTsuda Ume, and also Inazo Nitobe. &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you and your co-editor have not already finished the book...and I <br/>\nthink you have....you will like THE ATTIC LETTERS compiled by <br/>\nstudents at TSUDA COLLEGE...those letters Ume wrote to her American <br/>\nmother could give a good parallel account to any info you had on <br/>\nHartshorne and would fill in the blanks or atleast lay a foundation <br/>\nfor the world in which ACH worked.  But if you read it already, just <br/>\nignore my rant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I have with the Attic Letters was that it was not indexed <br/>\n(really that detailed without an index is sad) and CENSORED by <br/>\nstudents desperate to preserve an &quot;image&quot; of Ume (really Ume was a <br/>\ngood/normal human being, it is totally unnecessary for them to do <br/>\nthis).  This is the same problem we have with some Shinsengumi <br/>\nresearch...the need to white wash -or- the other extreme can be seen <br/>\nwith Hillsborough, the obsession with painting them to be nothing but <br/>\nvillains.  Nothing like good ole&#39; bias to stand in the way of a fair <br/>\ninquiry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you visit Japan...just go to the TSUDA COLLEGE collections and <br/>\ndon&#39;t tell them you research Hartshorne...otherwise that would tip <br/>\nthem off.  Just &quot;mix&quot; your research and request access to alot of <br/>\nstuff. Even if the book comes out next year, maybe you can still <br/>\ncontinue ACH research because you have insight into her! (^__^)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Love Letter&quot; then you are lucky Haverford didn&#39;t put a restriction <br/>\non the collection...it was probably a cute letter yeah?  (*^_^*).  <br/>\nThe historical society where I work and other places must honor <br/>\nfamily restrictions and time extensions on privacy (30, 50 years <br/>\netc). So it was very kind of the Hartshornes not to have done that.  <br/>\nSince Tsuda was essentially Hartshorne&#39;s &quot;boss&quot;, I assume that more <br/>\nACH material will discuss not only Tsuda but also Yamakawa Sutematsu <br/>\na key figure of the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitsuno:<br/>\n&quot;You can find the collection with a google search on anna <br/>\nhartshorne ...it was $10 plus 25 cents per page. One problem is that <br/>\nsince they are hand written, they are hard to read, at least for <br/>\nme.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nyes, as I mentioned in my previous reply, one can spend easily <br/>\nhundreds of dollars on acquiring primary material and many places <br/>\nwill not let you take in a digital camera to photograph letters etc.  <br/>\nActually I&#39;m pretty sure Hirotada and I have spent easily hundreds of <br/>\ndollars, and I spent...well weeks scanning books in Japanese. I&#39;ve <br/>\ndone alot of research using Eng. handwritten material...you would <br/>\nthink that back in the day when they took penmanship classes they <br/>\nwould try to make their cursive look more than lines across a page....<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you ever come across Hartshorne and DOSHISHA UNIV. in Kyoto <br/>\nsend me an email too cuz, we have a major AIzu family who <br/>\nestablished/ran that Christian school.  I wager that Hartshorne dealt <br/>\ndirectly with Ibuka Kajinosuke (Aizu samurai) of Meiji Gakuin too. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a small small world of education and especially western style <br/>\neducation. Everyone knew each other too well.<br/>\n<br/>\nsorry about the rant...I&#39;m obsessed with the post 1868 Aizu <br/>\nnetwork....where there is Aizu...there is the FUJITA family and <br/>\nSaitou ofcourse :P</div>",

Tsuda Ume<br/>\nis a confirmed gal pal of Yamakawa Futaba (WHO WAS A FRIEND OF TOKIO,<br/>\nactually Tokio&#39;s superior at the school).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gameplan was, study TWNS and sooner or later Mr. and Mrs. Fujita<br/>\nWILL appear (the issue for me friends is money...intuition tells me<br/>\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Fujita are sitting at the WOmen&#39;s STudies Library in<br/>\nOchanomizu---which has one of the largest collections on the topic<br/>\nfrom that era...lots of stuff still there!

ACH, is a major figure in Christian<br/>\neducation in that era, I was always curious to read her works because<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see if she mentions Takamine Hideo who played a key role<br/>\nin establishing Jyoshi Eigakujyuku&#39;s Scholarship committee for Tsuda<br/>\nUme (and sent her packing to Oswego NY).  Sometimes Takamine comes off<br/>\nas shady and a bit cunning (perfectly understandable given the<br/>\npolitics).  If you come across something on T-sensei or TWNS send me<br/>\nan email---I have some pieces of the puzzle still.  The Min. of<br/>\nEducation was really functioning like a gigantic gang most of the time<br/>\nand detractors set up their own &quot;gangs&quot; if you will and one posse was<br/>\nthe pro-women&#39;s education group (which ofcourse ACH was part of).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you were so lucky to work on ACH&#39;s book!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s my understanding that this book was already pubished (however I<br/>\ncannot acquire it through my library) as noted here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ilab.org/db/book804_HB8225.html\">http://www.ilab.org/db/book804_HB8225.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nso this a republication of her 1902 book correct? But refined by you.<br/>\nDoes she discuss women&#39;s educ. much?  You know scholars like LIncicome<br/>\nwould want it (if it does cover education).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlot of people here on SHQ ML may like LIan Hearn&#39;s fiction and it&#39;s<br/>\nvery awesome she wrote the intro to your book.  She&#39;s like the JK<br/>\nROWLING of Japan/fantasy.  Please tell us of all your future projects<br/>\nso if some of us have the money we can snap up the books.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear Lian Hearn is planning possibly a BAKUMATSU BOOK----likely set<br/>\nin KYOTO?  Will the Shinsengumi make a cameo appearance?

Also, the above are restricted by<br/>\nwhat is in vogue in academia, so we are able to sidestep that and<br/>\nhopefully be able to publish what people want to read, rather than<br/>\nwhat academia wants to publish. No academic is going to attempt to put<br/>\ntime and effort into something that interests them if they didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink that an academic journal would publish it. And, like I said,<br/>\nJapanese military history, narrative history, and biography is<br/>\napparently frowned upon currently. If you don&#39;t believe me, check out<br/>\nthe PMJS mailing list :P - it&#39;s all about heian books, art history,<br/>\nintellectual history, and other things that I have no interest in ever<br/>\nactually reading :D</div>",

However, let&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; say if I were to submit an article on the Meiji Educational system as <br/>\n&gt; it relates to the perversion of bushido and rise of fascism (yes as <br/>\n&gt; early as 1890s...predating good ole Italian model but it&#39;s evident in <br/>\n&gt; the many works dealing w/ the topic)...your staff may not be able to <br/>\n&gt; provide a peer evaluation.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would you seek qualified guest editors to assist in oversight of the <br/>\n&gt; scholarship (even if it is from someone not traditionally part of the <br/>\n&gt; field?).  Have you approached maybe the young up and coming open minded <br/>\n&gt; professors to assist in this effort?  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Peer Review&quot; is a tough one.  I&#39;m trying to cover the bases with the<br/>\nofficial staff, but like you said, there are some holes. The major<br/>\nadvantage of having people who know the history read it is that they<br/>\ncan notice inconsistencies and questionable sources, etc. I hadn&#39;t put<br/>\na large amount of thought into it, but I do know enough people who<br/>\nknow other people to hopefully cover all the bases. It will be on a<br/>\ncase by case basis - I don&#39;t forsee a big problem, but I hope to get<br/>\napplicable papers to at least one relative expert before okaying<br/>\nanything for publication. I haven&#39;t approached any upcoming professors<br/>\nper se (yet), but I do have a fair pool of Graduate level historians<br/>\nwho are qualified to either help directly with the process, or point<br/>\nme in the right direction. I don&#39;t expect to be ready to publish the<br/>\nfirst issue until february or march of next year, so that should give<br/>\nme enough time to get everything squared away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) how will SA-JJH sustain itself?  I am worried because I feel that <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s tough if you guys have to pay out of pocket.  Have you acquired a <br/>\n&gt; grant?  If so then perhaps a grant to back you on this project will <br/>\n&gt; also help this magazine be distributed to research libraries in the <br/>\n&gt; USA.  My concern is, from my own experience many magazines after a <br/>\n&gt; certain number of issues do have to close down and in the process the <br/>\n&gt; meticulously written work ends up becoming a rarity for students to <br/>\n&gt; find/read. Aside from the online format which everyone can read and I <br/>\n&gt; assume the print formatting, will you consider CD formats for libraries <br/>\n&gt; too?  Will you try to get this publication onto library databases <br/>\n&gt; (which can subscribe to you or link to articles?).  Ofcourse the online <br/>\n&gt; format will be most accessible however students in school would feel <br/>\n&gt; more comfortable if perhaps their library&#39;s East Asian bibliographer <br/>\n&gt; has approved of the journal as a source of info as well---and with the <br/>\n&gt; qualifcations of your staff I&#39;m sure they would be able to devise a <br/>\n&gt; good strategy for penetrating academia and make this a valuable <br/>\n&gt; resource.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a long story short, I&#39;m in the process of creating my own<br/>\npublishing company (so I&#39;ll be doing more than just this journal) - I<br/>\nhave a &quot;print on demand&quot; distributor with rates that are extremely<br/>\naffordable, and the journal would be made available immediately on<br/>\namazon.com (and the canada and UK version) and barnesandnoble.com). I<br/>\nwill also have the option of e-books. Basically, since there are no<br/>\n&quot;bells and whistles&quot; (no editors, no designers, no getting them on the<br/>\nshelves in bookstores, pretty much nothing- they publish what I give<br/>\nthem), all they do is publish and distribute, so it is extremely<br/>\naffordable, and there are no limits to how many issues they publish. I<br/>\ncan also buy them very cheaply to distribute myself. Which means that<br/>\nI would have to go to bookstores personally (or my other staff<br/>\nmembers) to get them on the shelves or in libraries.  Another friend<br/>\nof mine has already done this, and I was extremely impressed with the<br/>\nservice and the finished products, so I am more than confident in the<br/>\ndistributor. But like I said, aside from online sources, the rest is<br/>\nup to myself and the staff.  So, on the one hand, it is very<br/>\naffordable, but on the other hand, it is up to us to market.  Having<br/>\nit on the various amazon.com and B&N sites is a huge help though. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have looked at grants from the government, nothing really is<br/>\napplicable. Frankly, I don&#39;t *need* a grant, but it would be very<br/>\nnice. I&#39;m not entirely sure where to look.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; what are the long term goals of this magazine?  will it exist years <br/>\n&gt; from now?  part of why JAS/MN are held in high esteem is that they are <br/>\n&gt; very stable and authors feel that their work will be preserved for <br/>\n&gt; decades...do you have a back up plan for your magazine if someone <br/>\n&gt; should need to take a break from it?  For the SHQ we are just <br/>\n&gt; volunteers so we don&#39;t have to worry about it really.  But your journal <br/>\n&gt; is a very ambitious effort and I was concerned with its stability.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically (and this could be a problem), we can only keep it going for<br/>\nas long as we get quality submissions.  That aside, the book will be<br/>\navailable online for as long as I&#39;m willing to pay $12 per year per<br/>\nissue. The goal, of course, is to build a base of both readers and<br/>\ncontributors, and hopefully it will become self sustaining. I plan to<br/>\nwait until I have enough papers for a year of issues (4 issues) - they<br/>\nwill be in book form, rather than &quot;magazine&quot; form, and I also have the<br/>\noption of hardcover or softcover, whichever I prefer, although I&#39;m<br/>\nplanning on paperback.  I also intend to republish 19th century books<br/>\non Japan, written by sailors and academics and diplomats to help<br/>\nsustain the business.  I actually have a book coming out within a<br/>\ncouple months - &quot;Japan and Her People&quot; by Anna Hartshorne, edited by<br/>\nmyself and my publisher friend, so that should give me some indication<br/>\nof the market for that type of book. Here is the link to that:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.typeandculture.com/?page_id=36\">http://www.typeandculture.com/?page_id=36</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLian Hearn (Author of the Tales of the Otori series) was kind enough<br/>\nto write the introduction to this edition.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, right now I just have an ambitious plan. Hopefully by the end of<br/>\nthis year it will come together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input, I appreciate it! </span></blockquote></div>",

I also have a friend at the<br/>\nUniversity of London who is doing the same.  I have a few more<br/>\ncontacts at Harvard and some west coast universities, but I can&#39;t<br/>\nhonestly expect much from harvard (a harvard student would probably<br/>\nhave to stoop pretty low to submit a paper for publication in a<br/>\nnon-academic journal :D), but that is the extent of my connections,<br/>\nalthough I do know &quot;a few people who know people&quot;, so it probably<br/>\nwould be a good idea to look to them for input.  I am encouraging<br/>\nanyone in a history program to inform the staff of their respective<br/>\nuniversities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have indicated on the website that the authors retain their own<br/>\ncopyright, but like you said, I should probably really highlight that.<br/>\n Also, I like the word &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; - that was the intent of<br/>\n&quot;free to approach from whichever discipline you wish&quot;, but<br/>\n&quot;interdisciplinary&quot; is a great word to use, I&#39;ll fix it up with my<br/>\nnext update. I am really interested in the interdisciplinary concept,<br/>\nand also to really go after the topics that &quot;regular&quot; academics and<br/>\njournals avoid, i.e. biography, military history, and narrative<br/>\nhistory. I find dry meta-analysis boring, but narrative histories that<br/>\nbring the history to life has always been my favorite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe initial ideas for articles that I&#39;ve heard so far have been<br/>\ninteresting and encouraging (including a person who is using medical<br/>\ndatabases and research to examine the cause of death of some Sengoku<br/>\nera Daimyo based on the various symptoms listed in primary sources).<br/>\nIt should be all around interesting. I&#39;ve been translating the early<br/>\n17 century text &quot;Shinchokoki&quot; (record of Oda Nobunaga), so my first<br/>\npart will go into the first issue.  I&#39;m also really fascinated with<br/>\nNagakura Shinpachi&#39;s journal, so I hope to translate some of that for<br/>\nthe future.  The main thing at the moment is to really get the word<br/>\nout about the journal and get the submissions. I have a good group of<br/>\neditors, as well as some &quot;informal&quot; editors in the UH Japanese history<br/>\nPhD program, so I&#39;m hoping for a pretty high quality product.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention, I have to admit I like the concept of the copyright<br/>\nlaws that protect published material far better than the spotty laws<br/>\non &quot;publishing&quot; on the internet - I think this is the logical next<br/>\nstep. I can publish my translations and make them available, and<br/>\nfrankly not have to worry about them being copied and pasted into<br/>\nwikipedia or other random web pages.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-153669662\">Dear Kitsuno, thank you for posting to the list to announce this <br/>\nventure, I had some questions...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n *I wanted to let everyone here know that I am working<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with a group of people to publish a new history journal - simply<br/>\n&gt; titled &quot;The Samurai Archives Journal of Japanese History&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1) has this journal consulted with other publications such as Monumenta <br/>\nNipponica or Journal of Asian Studies, in other words what will your <br/>\njournal provide which these older publications cannot---I think that <br/>\nyour journal will allow for opportunities to encourage and refine <br/>\nindependent scholarship (especially for undergrads).  So I&#39;m glad to <br/>\nsee you enter this field and hopefully inform JAS or MN (by providing a <br/>\nnew venue). JAS and MN have very strict rules on what they accept and <br/>\nwhat they publish.  I&#39;m not saying your publication was intended to <br/>\ncompete with JAS/MN but perhaps offer something different (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Our focus will be on pre-20th century Japan, although we&#39;ll make <br/>\nallowances for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Meiji era histories as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>2) I noticed the strength of your staff are the prestigious <br/>\nqualifications of some individuals and the wide ranging interests of <br/>\nothers which will serve as a key to your future success. However, let&#39;s <br/>\nsay if I were to submit an article on the Meiji Educational system as <br/>\nit relates to the perversion of bushido and rise of fascism (yes as <br/>\nearly as 1890s...predating good ole Italian model but it&#39;s evident in <br/>\nthe many works dealing w/ the topic)...your staff may not be able to <br/>\nprovide a peer evaluation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWould you seek qualified guest editors to assist in oversight of the <br/>\nscholarship (even if it is from someone not traditionally part of the <br/>\nfield?).  Have you approached maybe the young up and coming open minded <br/>\nprofessors to assist in this effort?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ready to go, including publishing and distribution; we&#39;re in the<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>3) how will SA-JJH sustain itself?  I am worried because I feel that <br/>\nit&#39;s tough if you guys have to pay out of pocket.  Have you acquired a <br/>\ngrant?  If so then perhaps a grant to back you on this project will <br/>\nalso help this magazine be distributed to research libraries in the <br/>\nUSA.  My concern is, from my own experience many magazines after a <br/>\ncertain number of issues do have to close down and in the process the <br/>\nmeticulously written work ends up becoming a rarity for students to <br/>\nfind/read. Aside from the online format which everyone can read and I <br/>\nassume the print formatting, will you consider CD formats for libraries <br/>\ntoo?  Will you try to get this publication onto library databases <br/>\n(which can subscribe to you or link to articles?).  Ofcourse the online <br/>\nformat will be most accessible however students in school would feel <br/>\nmore comfortable if perhaps their library&#39;s East Asian bibliographer <br/>\nhas approved of the journal as a source of info as well---and with the <br/>\nqualifcations of your staff I&#39;m sure they would be able to devise a <br/>\ngood strategy for penetrating academia and make this a valuable <br/>\nresource.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat are the long term goals of this magazine?  will it exist years <br/>\nfrom now?  part of why JAS/MN are held in high esteem is that they are <br/>\nvery stable and authors feel that their work will be preserved for <br/>\ndecades...do you have a back up plan for your magazine if someone <br/>\nshould need to take a break from it?  For the SHQ we are just <br/>\nvolunteers so we don&#39;t have to worry about it really.  But your journal <br/>\nis a very ambitious effort and I was concerned with its stability.</div>",
