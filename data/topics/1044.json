Why I&#39;m sure the ladies would refrain from writing their real<br/>\nnames on the envelope and so the guy would have to do the &quot;smell&quot;<br/>\ntest...perfumed letters for Vice Chief Hijikata...unperfumed letters<br/>\ngo in the &quot;business&quot; bin and as usual Saitou gets -no- mail (only the<br/>\noccasional death threat signed in blood) :P<br/>\nIn Hatchobori 7 remember the other officers were discussing how cruel<br/>\nit is to not even reply to the letters?...I wonder if he replied to<br/>\nany of his letters.<br/>\nI posted in the merchandise section of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumimb.com\">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> a<br/>\ncollage of actual Shinsengumi stuff being sold (scanned from a book I<br/>\nborrowed from one of our members) and there was stationary...there<br/>\nshould be romantic stationary with Hijikata&#39;s poetry pre-printed on it.<br/>\nLastly, the whole business with pretending to be Aoyama is funny...I<br/>\nwonder if anyone in the Shinsengumi pulled this stunt...you know going<br/>\naround saying &quot;I&#39;m Hijikata&quot; (to attract the ladies)...what is the<br/>\npenalty for identity theft?
