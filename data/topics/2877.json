            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1749064205\">thank you very much to k kobayakawa and Hirotada Tokugawa for <br/>\ntranslating that page about a possible other Fujita Family photo at <br/>\nAizu.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to go off-topic just to explain to new members who haven&#39;t <br/>\nhad a chance to read some info. <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n[The Influence of 1868 on Toyohisa Matsue]<br/>\n<br/>\nCOL. Toyohisa Matsue was the son of an Aizu samurai who was exiled <br/>\nto Tonami after 1868.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Aizu was defeated in the Boshin war of 1868 many samurai <br/>\nfamilies were sent up north to survive on their own, amongst them <br/>\nwould be Yamaguchi Jiro (Ichinohe Denpachi or Shinsengumi Saitou <br/>\nHajime). (footnote) Some young samurai were sent to Edo/Tokyo and <br/>\nremained in kinshin generally until 1871---so not all Aizu people <br/>\nended up in the icy wasteland.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatsue grew up listening to his father recount the extreme hardship <br/>\nthey suffered in Tonami. Therefore he was sympathetic to the German <br/>\nofficers (during WWI) under his charge. Matsue later became the <br/>\nmayor of Wakamatsu (Fukushima Prefecture--which as basically <br/>\nformerly Aizu-han)<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n[Germans + Aizu Connection]<br/>\nNow going back to 1868, Aizu *did have a German connection too!  The <br/>\nSchnell brothers sold weapons to Aizu (Thomas Glover was the arms <br/>\ndealer to Satsuma). We have a friend on this list who is reading an <br/>\narticle in German on the Schnell brothers and their activities <br/>\nduring the Boshin War.<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n[Matsue&#39;s Organization Style]<br/>\nMatsue ran the prison camp in a somewhat similar way to pre-1868 <br/>\nhangakko (samurai schools for domains) which influenced Meiji era <br/>\ndorms for men and women.  That style is translated roughly as &quot;self-<br/>\ngovernance&quot; where the students (in this case prisoners) disciplined <br/>\nthemselves.  Self-governance was used in dorms connected to the <br/>\nWomen&#39;s Normal School (different variations on the name depending on <br/>\nyear) where Takagi/FUJITA Tokio worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, from this fascinating connection you can see how war <br/>\nexperiences affect more than one generation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;k kobayakawa&quot; &lt;kobaya635@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe some people never heard this movie.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Bart no gakuen&quot; is based on historical fact.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Plot Outline: German soldiers are transported to a prisoner-of-<br/>\nwar camp in<br/>\n&gt; Japan after the First World War&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484095/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484095/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The prison treated prisoners with humanity because the prison <br/>\ndirector<br/>\n&gt; Col.Matsue was son of Aizu samurai.<br/>\n&gt; So now we know why.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This page has pictures of filming the movie in Aizu.<br/>\n&gt; There scenes that Aizu people were heading to Tonami.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.city.aizuwakamatsu.fukushima.jp/j/kanko/baruto/04aizuroke.\">http://www.city.aizuwakamatsu.fukushima.jp/j/kanko/baruto/04aizuroke.</a><br/>\nhtm<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2006/6/24, k kobayakawa &lt;kobaya635@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It says the old man with white mustache is Saito Hajime.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The picture was taken at a wedding party in early Taisho period.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The blog owner is the 14th head of Aizawa family, descendant of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aizu-han-shi since Takato-han.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The last post says he/she gave the picture to him and able to <br/>\nidentify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each persons.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He/She has other Fujita related pictures and references that <br/>\nconnected to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the movie &quot;Bart no Gakuen&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bart-movie.jp/\">http://www.bart-movie.jp/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s really interesting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2006/6/24, secretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aizu.com/shinsengumi/archives/2005/05/post_16.html#comment\">http://www.aizu.com/shinsengumi/archives/2005/05/post_16.html#comment</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the information really really really needs to be translated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can someone please hellllppp????<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) something about *another photo of Fujita Goro (and his <br/>\nfamily) at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aizu?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) NEW information on YAMAGUCHI JIRO?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) someone posted saying that he/she was able to identify <br/>\nhis/her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ancestor in the photo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah alot of Shinsengumi info is more hard to find becuase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything is being blogged and replies don&#39;t get &quot;bumped up&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had a very very long week, including my laptop which has some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; notes to use for the timeline DYING (my laptop is named Toshi <br/>\nby the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way---Toshiba Satellite)...but I managed to retrieve some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff...whew!...there is some data loss but nothing to angst <br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (too much)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
