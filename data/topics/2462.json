Through this list <br/>\nI have met several people who have a very realistic view of the <br/>\nShinsengumi and they also enjoy their fictional spin-offs.  What I <br/>\nfound to be very interesting about the site is the mixture of some <br/>\nsound facts and plenty of opinions.  I could not find the author&#39;s <br/>\nlist of textual sources (maybe there is a list---I just can&#39;t find <br/>\nit).  Since most of us can&#39;t time travel or do not know Japanese it <br/>\nis necessary to look for books/articles written by those who know <br/>\nmore than we do.  This is why I have tried to be thorough and <br/>\ncareful in citing my sources so if you wish you can double check my <br/>\nown work, you CAN---establish a paper trail and giving credit where <br/>\nit is due.  For example the webmaster at one point said Nakajima <br/>\nNobori was enthusiastic about photography---as a Nakajima Nobori fan <br/>\nI&#39;d like to know where he got this detail. So these sites are useful <br/>\nin gauging people&#39;s changing views but they may not be as helpful in <br/>\nthe long run if you want to dig deeper into the history.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis/her discussion in Shinsengumi opinions on foreigners is also <br/>\ninteresting.<br/>\n<br/>\n[side note:  Fujita Goro was assigned, at one point,  to work the <br/>\nAzabu area in Tokyo.  Azabu was where many foreign missionaries <br/>\nlived.  The area during the Meiji Era was described in extreme terms <br/>\nas very &quot;good&quot; due to the foreigners and also very &quot;bad&quot; due to the <br/>\nhigh number of poor people (the missionaries proselytized and setup <br/>\norphanages and schools for the poor).  Basically, later in life <br/>\nFujita Goro *had* to encounter foreigners through his work in Azabu, <br/>\nat the Education Museum and later Tokyo Womens Normal School.  It <br/>\nwould be interesting to learn how former Shinsengumi may have felt <br/>\nabout foreigners as time past.<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened to ShinsengumiMB.com?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Spiritus Saitou mentioned, the board was severely damaged due to <br/>\nsomeone hacking into ezboard.com.  They were only able to restore <br/>\nthe earliest posts which consisted of the QUESTIONS.

Recall the TV series Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s Saitou in the <br/>\nother title sequence<br/>\n<br/>\n.....Not exactly.....  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer lies in the development of the Japanese police.  From the <br/>\n1870s to 1879 (Toshiyoshi Kawaji dies) the French model was <br/>\nadopted.  In the 1880s onward led by Yamagata Aritomo the German <br/>\npolice model was implemented.  The gloves come from France&#39;s Eugène <br/>\nFrançois Vidocq   who was a career criminal who later became a super <br/>\nspy for the police (his criminal ways later led to his downfall).  <br/>\nVidocq had a team of former criminals who worked with him.  The <br/>\npublic saw the police as criminals in uniform.  The police in turn <br/>\nwore white gloves because gloves prevented them from picking <br/>\npockets.  Bare hands are needed to determine if the victim is <br/>\ncarrying valuables.  Bare hands (skin) provides the traction needed <br/>\nto remove those valuables.</div>",

Secretary may have more up to date information about what they were doing to restore boards, but I think they&#39;ve done all they could with back-ups that weren&#39;t damaged.  In trying to better safeguard the system and repair it, I think they did some additional damage, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nCool idea with the reviews.  Best place to send them is to this list, SHQ.  The Spy Division is more for member and other fan fiction and art.  ^_^<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n<br/>\nniwashi_1 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:labaker@...\">labaker@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI found the Shinsengumi Headquarters message board<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p076.ezboard.com/bshinsengumiheadquarters\">http://p076.ezboard.com/bshinsengumiheadquarters</a><br/>\nnot too long ago - just long enough to see that it had a bunch of <br/>\ninteresting stuff posted there.
