So the biography illustrates how dangerous it is to make<br/>\ncultural generalizations.  I did my best to arrange his bio in my<br/>\n&quot;SILVERDRUM&quot; notes in the FILES section but be warned I may have left<br/>\nout some of his jobs (he held many posts).

Taka, is very very<br/>\nstrong willed and if you check out my notes she was a major figure in<br/>\nthe family and played a critical role during the wedding.  I love her.<br/>\n Oh, before I forget---Taka was connected to Yamakawa Sutematsu (who<br/>\nwas also Princess Chichibu&#39;s heroine).
