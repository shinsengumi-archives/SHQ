            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1847844532\">Since I fried my brain watching movies this weekend (due to a 2 for 1<br/>\nrental rate at the store) I watched 2 movies by the Chinese director<br/>\nKing Hu, &quot;A Touch of Zen&quot; and &quot;Legend of the Mountain&quot; both films have<br/>\na character who is both a scholar and an artist (portrayed by the same<br/>\nactor too).  King Hu is one of those directors who can direct very<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; looking action scenes, capture turtles basking and somehow<br/>\nmanage to get sparrows to fly a certain way too it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did some screencaps of scenes which have close ups of paintings,<br/>\npainting equipment used in the East Asian art.  In one of the screen<br/>\ncaps you will lots of different size brushes.  If you recall<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NNNakajimaxl.jpg\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NNNakajimaxl.jpg</a><br/>\nNakajima Nobori us shown drawing with only one brush.  However, I took<br/>\na closer look at the paintings of Saitou and Hijikata and noticed that<br/>\nto draw their hair he must have had a fine or small brush.  In the<br/>\nscreen caps you will also note that an artist likes to have his/her<br/>\nteapot and teacup nearby because when you use waterbased paints you<br/>\nwill in general have to work fast and you don&#39;t want to have to get up<br/>\nand run to the kitchen for tea.  I also wonder if he used stick<br/>\ncharcoal to sketch first too.  Lastly, I happen to have 2 screencaps<br/>\nof a woman, the demoness in &quot;Legend of the Mountain&quot; painting and<br/>\npreparing paints during the daytime and at night.  Now, I figure while<br/>\nNakajima Nobori was on his &quot;best behaviour&quot; I figure they government<br/>\nmust have had the prisoners do some simple manual labor and not just<br/>\nhave them sit there the whole day then perhaps he painted at night by<br/>\ncandle light which may explain why he loves to use the color black<br/>\neven though in his self-portrait he had primary colors on the table<br/>\n---easier to see the color black in low light situations (alternate<br/>\ntheory is that every artist at the time liked to use black). Keep in<br/>\nmind that NN is not a professional he drew the portraits for himself.<br/>\nI&#39;m impressed how he drew Hara Gorou&#39;s sister&#39;s feet...  <br/>\n<br/>\nScreencaps are a great learning tool ^_^<br/>\nURL: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/\">http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/</a><br/>\nFolder: NakajimaN<br/>\nFilename: &quot;paint&quot; zipped jpegs<br/>\npassword: makoto<br/>\n<br/>\nActor to play NN in the ultimate Shinsengumi movie<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/NNcast.jpg\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/NNcast.jpg</a><br/>\nnow, who has 500 million they can spare ^_^</div>",
