It understood.<br/>\nSince the article was very serious, I have not noticed it^^;;; <br/>\nTalking in the language which is not a native language suffers <br/>\ntroubles mutually. <br/>\nAnd I am writing this text using translation software. <br/>\nI am worried that an impolite thing may be written to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nTaiga drama is often introducing in others the small episode which <br/>\nis not made to appear. <br/>\nHowever, it also has many episode which is not facts. <br/>\nTaiga drama is not a thing for studying a historical fact. <br/>\nIt is a thing for merely enjoying oneself as a drama. <br/>\nYou know the right way of enjoying oneself of Taiga drama^^<br/>\nThere are people who believe that the episode in Manga, a novel, or <br/>\na drama is a fact among Shinsengumi fans. <br/>\nThe fans of a certain Shinsengumi manga are introducing information <br/>\non a network only in the knowledge from the work. <br/>\nThey are people who are young mostly and have not read other <br/>\nShinsengumi works. <br/>\n(I cannot understand why they become the feeling which got to know <br/>\nShinsengumi only in the knowledge of that work.) <br/>\nI am not going to deny fictions&#39; worth. <br/>\nThey become a wonderful entrance to a historical fact. <br/>\nMoreover, people of a time far from us are made a nearer existence. <br/>\nHowever, it is dangerous to believe it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I feel that only good portions were written too much about <br/>\nYakuza. <br/>\nMany Yakuzas which were popular allies actually existed. <br/>\nHowever, probably, many Yakuzas which were hard on the weak with <br/>\nregards to the man of power also existed. <br/>\nAnd probably Yakuza which did not perform a bad thing at all does <br/>\nnot exist. <br/>\nThe same may be said of the situation after Meiji Era. <br/>\nAbout the time after Meiji Era, there was certainly a situation <br/>\nwhere you wrote. <br/>\nYakuzas with political ideas was related to the politician or the <br/>\narmy. <br/>\nHowever, Yakuzas which valued the territory like ancient times also <br/>\nexisted. <br/>\nAlthough I wanted to write in detail about this, for performing it, <br/>\nI am too ignorant.<br/>\nAlthough I think that the contents which Firuze-san wrote are the <br/>\npeople rather called &quot;Uyoku&quot; (the right wing), I cannot say it with <br/>\na corroboration. <br/>\nI have neither existence of Uyoku nor the knowledge about thought. <br/>\nThey have a close relation to Yakuza. <br/>\nThey instigated the politician and the army and often caused <br/>\ntrouble. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Although I am a Japanese, I am very ignorant about Japan and sense <br/>\nthat it is shameful. I come to SHQ and am very conscious of it. <br/>\nAfter coming to SHQ, I came to think of Japan seriously. In that, I <br/>\nam thankful to everybody of SHQ.) <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease introduce, if there are some interesting articles ^^<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",
