Even if it is which, as for Tetsu, <br/>\nposterity does not exist.) <br/>\nThe posterity of Tatsunosuke preserved data detailed about the <br/>\norigin of the Ichimura family. <br/>\nIt was guessed from there why the Ichimura brothers joined <br/>\nShinsengumi. <br/>\nFurthermore, one of posterity was Okita Souji&#39;s passionate fan. <br/>\nShe gave Souji and a name to the own son. <br/>\nHowever, they did not know that their ancestor was a Shinsengumi <br/>\nmember. <br/>\nResearchers visited and they got to know it for the first time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Shinsengumi attracted attention in the Taiga drama this year, <br/>\na quite special research document came to be published. <br/>\nI think that there continues to be good discovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",
