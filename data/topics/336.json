            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-883694302\">There was a movie I saw ages and ages ago that kept me laughing through the whole thing, but I could never remember the name of it --- &quot;Tampopo&quot; (aka &quot;Dandelion&quot;), from 1985.  In searching for the title, I came upon Roger Ebert&#39;s review of it and laughed all over again ---<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The hero is Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a lone rider with a quizzical smile, who rides a semi instead of a horse. Along with some friends, he stages a search for the perfect noodle restaurant but cannot find it.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nIn addition to the title, I&#39;d forgotten the main character was named &quot;Goro&quot;!!  :-D   Maybe there was something to this idea of Saitou/Fujita being a soba aficionado?  Sounds like the perfect plot for an RK parody.  (I can even imagine it as a PMK parody... the search being somewhat more mystical...)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a hilarious film... check it out if you get the chance.<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
