And it dried with a<br/>\nsolar light.<br/>\nIt was beautiful as it ironned.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis talk is the episode which shows that Saitou was very clean.<br/>\nSamurai does not leave shame, after he dies. For them, the greatest<br/>\nshame has an unsightly body.<br/>\nSaitou is a really splendid samurai. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou is popular also in Japan.<br/>\nI like him to the 2nd in the member of Shinsengumi.<br/>\nBy the way, did you see the &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; movie?<br/>\nThe actor who was playing Saitou on that movie is playing Serizawa<br/>\nKamo in this drama.<br/>\nSimilarly, the actor who was playing Okita on that movie is performing<br/>\nYamanami in this drama.<br/>\nIt is very interesting if the 4th story is seen in consideration of it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIncidentally, the picture of Saitou of the top of the site is not him.<br/>\nThe picture makes Saitou&#39;s son (Fujita Tsutomu)&#39;s photograph the model.<br/>\nThe picture is in Aizu&#39;s Byakkotai memorial hall.<br/>\nThe memorial hall wanted to decorate with Saitou&#39;s photograph there.<br/>\nHowever, the photograph was not able to be got.<br/>\n(It was not in the Fujita family which is Saitou&#39;s posterity, either. )<br/>\nThen, Saitou&#39;s son&#39;s photograph was offered.<br/>\n<br/>\n****(secretarytocapt3)  momoiro-usagi is referring the pic seen<br/>\n&quot;everywhere&quot; on the internet...this is NOT the group photo.  I read on<br/>\nother Japanese sites that the photo/charcoal drawing was based on his<br/>\nGRANDson...but momoiro-usagi knows his/her stuff</div>",
