For example samurai &quot;A&quot;<br/>\nmany not say &quot;I am totally going to fight and die because of the<br/>\nridiculous treaty with the USA! Ha!&quot; and so forth<br/>\nSamurai &quot;A&quot; generally fought for his domain and what he felt was<br/>\nhappening to it (for example Aizu and other allied northern<br/>\ndomains)---or if he felt his domain would now rise to national power<br/>\n(for example Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, Hizen etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n***some of their leaders did not explain the details to them just that<br/>\nthe bakufu was incompetent in handling the foreigners<br/>\n<br/>\n***so many normal citizens at the time had no access to what was<br/>\ngoing, much of the info they heard was incorrect, while there were<br/>\nnewspapers and so forth they were not at the level of media we have<br/>\ntoday ofcourse<br/>\n<br/>\nso while in looking back, the trade treaties played a key role in the<br/>\ncollapse of the shogunate they did not matter much to the common<br/>\npeople who were not aware of the situation their country was facing<br/>\n<br/>\nfor me personally economics destroyed the bakufu<br/>\nI think many of us here wandered in the Meiji era and are very<br/>\nfamiliar with zaibatsu (monopolized family based industries---e.g.<br/>\nmany banks, mines etc) which played a role in the rise of fascist<br/>\nJapan and WW2<br/>\n<br/>\nbut did you know that major families such as the MITSUI, by witholding<br/>\nmoney they were to give to the bakufu...literally bankrupted the<br/>\nshogunate?  Zaibatsu have been incorrectly studied as a Meiji<br/>\nphenomena when it began way back in the edo era---and they were the<br/>\nreal heavy weights of the Bakumatsu <br/>\n<br/>\nno money = no guns<br/>\n<br/>\nso many of us have read that the bakufu was backwards and unwilling to<br/>\nchange militarily (this was a reason proposed by the Ishin Shishi for<br/>\ninstance)---however few of those writers can explain the economics of<br/>\n...WHY...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mio Yamada &lt;purplealienmio@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Maybe I&#39;m just way, way behind on my resources and<br/>\n&gt; this book has already been discussed.
