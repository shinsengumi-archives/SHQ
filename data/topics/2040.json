            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-248947853\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/v2.zip\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/v2.zip</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/v3.zip\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/v3.zip</a><br/>\n<br/>\nbasically the zip files above are the table of contents to a series <br/>\nof books which give translations of major documents from 1844-1894<br/>\nvery often the books we encounter will offer excerpts or <br/>\n*interpretations* of these documents...<br/>\nmany scholars make the critical mistake of relying on the <br/>\ninterpretations of OTHER scholars, what you end up with is a <br/>\nhorrible domino effect so there is a need to take a look at the <br/>\noriginal government papers<br/>\n<br/>\nif you skim the table of contents you will note economic concerns <br/>\nand various issues which led to the Seinan War, and the push for <br/>\nmore liberal reforms...if anyone would like certain documents to be <br/>\nscanned please email me at <br/>\nsecretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com and specify the volume number<br/>\n<br/>\nfor example Nakahara Hisao (Hisao has other spellings) &quot;confession&quot; <br/>\na simple document, was published and spread all over the Satsuma <br/>\ndomain and the result was a full scale war....his confession is <br/>\noften summarized in books about Saigo Takamori...the conditions of <br/>\nthis confession (torture and Nakahara just put his stamp on the pre-<br/>\nwritten document) are usually left out...the fine print is pretty <br/>\ninteresting<br/>\n<br/>\n{{Off-topic}}<br/>\nbut I&#39;m going to raise the issue anyways<br/>\nfrom many chats and emails I gather that our demographics actually <br/>\nranges from elementary, junior high, high school, university to <br/>\nspecial &quot;senior&quot; status....so many have expressed an intense <br/>\nfanatical love for the Shinsengumi and the era...keep in mind that <br/>\nmany colleges/universities/scholarships DO require writing samples <br/>\nand such requirements pre-undergraduate, or in progress <br/>\nundergraduate DO NOT CARE about the topic at all...what they are <br/>\nlooking for is whether or not you can write...so do consider <br/>\nresearching the Bakumatsu/Meiji Era and find a topic you like (and <br/>\n*share*with*us)...interested in the liberal movement?  Well the <br/>\nMeiji Era has TONS of these groups complete with speeches, riots, <br/>\nand sudden police raids.  Women&#39;s rights, and economic issues are <br/>\nwell documented in ENGLISH...so don&#39;t miss out on your chance to <br/>\nwrite about something you actually *love*...you should write NOW <br/>\nwhen you have the time (^_^)<br/>\nstart in your local public library, community college library and <br/>\nuniversity library (you can actually obtain day passes to major <br/>\nresearch universities---you DO NOT have to be a student).<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nsecretarytocapt3<br/>\n&quot;When I take the sword, be it only the foil, there&#39;s no parent, no <br/>\npupil nor master in my eye.  Even the best of all best friends I <br/>\nregard him as the worst enemy whom I must kill.  That is how I <br/>\nschool myself to the art of swordsmanship.&quot;<br/>\nRyunosuke from &quot;Dai-bosatsu Toge&quot;<br/>\naka the Psycho Guy or better yet THE TERMINATOR WITH A SWORD from <br/>\nthe movie &quot;SWORD OF DOOM&quot;</div>",
