(^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of historical text -explicitly- stating a &quot;family&quot; bond--that<br/>\nwould be tough to find because the era and style of writing of the<br/>\ntime would probably not specify those exact words.  However, all<br/>\nmembers of the Shinsengumi were humans and therefore fans and<br/>\nresearchers alike are welcome to draw their own personal conclusions<br/>\nabout what personal relationships may have arose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are things I think:<br/>\n1) age---most of the guys were very young, away from home and in a big<br/>\ncity---it&#39;s normal for them to become buddies<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The Shinsengumi were one of a handful of law enforcement units in<br/>\nKyoto (Mimawarigumi, Shinchogumi and doshingumi forgot the exact<br/>\nspelling).  These other groups often had men derived from the &quot;upper&quot;<br/>\nclass (especially the Mimawari) in other words real &quot;hereditary&quot;<br/>\nsamurai while in contrast the Shinsengumi had men from a varied<br/>\nbackground.  There was no doubt the Shinsengumi operated with a chip<br/>\non their shoulders and grasped that they were the new kids on the<br/>\nblock.  It&#39;s not a stretch for the Tama group in the Shinsengumi to<br/>\nstick amongst themselves because of their common background and to a<br/>\ngreater extent all the guys from the Edo region to form a group.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3) modern day military and police units such as the riot polie in<br/>\nJapan who do live together (sort of like firemen here in the US) do<br/>\nform strong bonds.  One can imagine that the Shinsengumi which shared<br/>\nbarracks also had these strong bonds.  Furthermore the length of time<br/>\nduring which the Shinsengumi were active since the early Bakumatsu era<br/>\nto the end in 1868 (Aizu) and 69 (Hokkaido) suggest many were comrades<br/>\nfor YEARS---longer or as long than many modern day wars (or low<br/>\nburning political conflicts).</div>",
