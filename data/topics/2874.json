What would Rintaro&#39;s son have to do with anything <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now?  Because Rintaro was holding that position, did that make <br/>\n&gt; Souji <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obligated to him?

It was the <br/>\n&gt; samurai&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; custom! Many samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed their name twice, but Okita had only changed <br/>\n&gt; his name<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once. Yes, a samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle <br/>\n&gt; name when he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed his (full)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. <br/>\n&gt; Why? I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not sure...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From Wikipedia:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugoro <br/>\n&gt; in 1849,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, <br/>\n&gt; Kondo Isami.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have? I <br/>\n&gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been <br/>\n&gt; given) a name<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to honor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his <br/>\n&gt; name from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like <br/>\n&gt; Katsujirou. And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part <br/>\n&gt; of his name,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating <br/>\n&gt; himself from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki <br/>\n&gt; first? Could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ****<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; generally believed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Okita Rintarou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status <br/>\n&gt; (by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family and therefore would have to change his name to <br/>\n&gt; Okita.) He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; served as a retainer for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; young Souji.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Okita family could have needed the additional <br/>\n&gt; financial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Rintarou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death.

In Souji shortening his <br/>\nname from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like <br/>\nKatsujirou. And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part <br/>\nof his name,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating <br/>\nhimself from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki <br/>\nfirst? Could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ****<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s <br/>\ngenerally believed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Okita Rintarou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status <br/>\n(by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family and therefore would have to change his name to <br/>\nOkita.)

I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; not sure...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From Wikipedia:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugoro in 1849, who <br/>\n&gt; first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have?  I thought <br/>\n&gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been given) a name <br/>\n&gt; to honor someone in his family.  In Souji shortening his name from <br/>\n&gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou.  And <br/>\n&gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name, <br/>\n&gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating himself from <br/>\n&gt; the Miyakawa family?  Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first?  Could <br/>\n&gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ****<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed <br/>\n&gt; that Okita Rintarou <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by <br/>\n&gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita <br/>\n&gt; &gt; family and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.)  He <br/>\n&gt; served as a retainer for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; young Souji. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Okita family could have needed the additional financial support <br/>\n&gt; from Rintarou <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as <br/>\n&gt; the head of the Okita <br/>\n&gt; &gt; family for a short time (not sure how short...) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First, if Katsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be head of the <br/>\n&gt; Okita family because Souji was too young...what happened when Souji&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; mother married Rintarou Mototsune?  RM displaced RK as head of the <br/>\n&gt; family?  Then after RM&#39;s death RK was reinstated?  And what would <br/>\n&gt; have happened if Souji had lived longer?  Would he have replaced RK?<br/>\n&gt; Finally, if one could change their status through purchase or <br/>\n&gt; adoption then it&#39;s all just a formality?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks everyone for being patient with my questions!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Wanda<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

I&#39;m not sure...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, Okita didn&#39;t change his name from Soujirou to Souji  to match the young master. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a theory that he changed his name to Souji because some people around him <br/>\ncalled him &quot;Sou-Ji&quot; (short for Soujirou.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have the Okitas&#39; family register from around 1845, but it&#39;s generally believed that <br/>\nKondou Shusuke adopted Mitsu so she wouldn&#39;t be Rintaro&#39;s sister.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKondou Shusuke probably didn&#39;t get anything in return for doing this. It was common for a <br/>\nfemale (like a merchant&#39;s daughter) to be adopted by someone in order to wed a man (like <br/>\nthe second son of a samurai family) she couldn&#39;t marry otherwise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were two separate Okita Rintaro&#39;s. Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Kanwmasa was Mitsu&#39;s <br/>\nhusband.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThough this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed that Okita Rintarou <br/>\nMototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita <br/>\nfamily and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.)  He served as a retainer for <br/>\nyoung Souji. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Okita family could have needed the additional financial support from Rintarou <br/>\nMototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death.

And - <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;one was Inoue Rintaro Mototsune, whom bought his samurai status <br/>\n(from the Okita family) after Okita Katsujiro&#39;s death on (lunar <br/>\ncalendar) October 20, 1845...&quot;&gt;&gt;  Seven<br/>\n<br/>\nHe paid the Okita family?  As sort of a replacement for Katsujirou?  <br/>\nAfter he married Souji&#39;s mother, why did he take the name Okita?  Not <br/>\nto be head of the family as Katsujirou had already adopted the man <br/>\nthat was to marry Mitsu?  Am I completely confused?<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;...but really you don&#39;t have to be a specialist you can be a fan <br/>\nwho joins the group and asks questions, this will help the main <br/>\nwriters understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of the hundreds of thousands of Okita <br/>\nfans out there&gt;&gt;  secretary<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got many Okita related questions and would be happy to ask them <br/>\nif Seven or anyone else is interested in what us Souji fans want to <br/>\nknow.  I&#39;m more an expert in the area of things that are presented as <br/>\nfact in fiction - be it film, anime, or manga.  Drop me a note if <br/>\nyou&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep my questions to that for now.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\n--Wanda</div>",
