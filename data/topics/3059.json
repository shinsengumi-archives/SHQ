            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-829122809\">This might be old news, but I just found it as I was going through old<br/>\nemail in my inbox, and thought people here might find it interesting.<br/>\nIt comes from Hillsborough&#39;s Fall 2005 issue of his email<br/>\nmagazine/newsletter:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA so-called Shinsengumi Investigation Journal has recently been found.<br/>\nThe document, written between May and October 1865, is more aptly<br/>\ncalled a memorandum than a journal. It is believed to have been<br/>\nrecorded by Shinsengumi officer Yamazaki Susumu, whose name appears on<br/>\nthe front and back covers. Although it cannot be confirmed that the<br/>\ndocument was actually written by Yamazaki, the Hino City Furusato<br/>\nMuseum, in Hino City, Tokyo, has issued a statement that &quot;it was<br/>\ndefinitely written by someone who knew much about the inner-affairs of<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe document measures 7.6 cm x 16.5 cm and consists of 42 pages, some<br/>\nof which have been torn out. The contents include a copy of infantry<br/>\ntraining records and a list of 148 Shinsengumi corpsmen ­ beginning<br/>\nwith the slightly elevated names of Kondo Isami and Hijikata Toshizo.<br/>\n(Okita Soji, Nagakura Shinpachi, Inoue Genzaburo and Todo Heisuke<br/>\nfollow in that order. Harada Sanosuke and Saito Hajime appear as<br/>\nnumbers 7 and 8. Yamazaki Susumu¹s name is 12th on the list.) Above<br/>\neach name is a number between 1 and 8, indicating the number of the<br/>\nsquad that the man belonged to. Near some of the names are written the<br/>\nwords &quot;seppuku&quot; and &quot;deserted&quot; ­ and even the date (June 21) that two<br/>\nof the men disemboweled themselves ­ adding to the value of the<br/>\ndocument as an on-the-scene report. Although there exist several<br/>\nvaluable written and oral memoirs of former Shinsengumi corpsmen,<br/>\nincluding Nagakura Shinpachi, Shimada Kai and Shinohara Yasunoshin,<br/>\nthe &quot;Yamazaki Journal&quot; is one of few remaining documents written<br/>\nduring the actual time period. It is also important as an indication<br/>\nof the rank of the corpsmen and the Shinsengumi organization in<br/>\nmid-1865, although it differs slightly from another list of the same<br/>\nperiod recorded by Shimada.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYamazaki Susumu, believed to have been an expert with a wooden staff,<br/>\nserved as a spy for the Shinsengumi. He was involved in the arrest of<br/>\nanti-Tokugawa activist Furudaka Shuntaro in June 1864, leading to the<br/>\nnotorious Ikeda¹ya Incident, a turning point in the revolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current owner of the document claims to be a descendent of an<br/>\nOsaka merchant family with ties to Kondo Isami. The document was<br/>\nexhibited at the Hino City Furusato Museum (Hinoshi Furusato<br/>\nHakubutuskan) in November and December of 2004.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Sources: Asahi Shimbun, November 13, 2004; Hinoshi Furusato<br/>\nHakubutuskan Web site]</div>",
