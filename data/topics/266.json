Currently the filesizes are 400megs average for an episode with the current video compression (DIVX5) and audio (MP3). With the way the files are, i&#39;ll only be able to distro these via DVDs instead of CDs, and I know some of you may not have DVD drives to read the files. Or distro them on many many cds. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically it all comes down to, do you want smaller files at the expense of quality?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, if anyone knows how to get these files loaded on a bittorrent server, i&#39;ll do that to make them easily available to those who do have a high speed connection.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
