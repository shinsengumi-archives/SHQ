We have set up a tumblr blog in order to showcase our work, and we would be extremely grateful for any help we can get in promoting it. If you could possibly check it out, and if you like it, give us a shout-out on your website, we&#39;d be thrilled. We really hope you enjoy it and can spread the love - it was a lot of work, if I may say so myself. Eeni spent weeks working on the first two chapters. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fic itself is &quot;The Courtship of Lady Tokio&quot;. The links are here: <br/>\n<br/>\nTumblr: http://meijikeikanromantan.tumblr.com <br/>\nDoujinshi: http://meijikeikanromantan.tumblr.com/tagged/CLT-doujinshi <br/>\nNew fanfic: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8593839/1/Meiji-Keikan-Romantan <br/>\nhttp://meijikeikanromantan.tumblr.com/tagged/Meiji-Keikan-Romantan <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let us know what you think - your candid opinion would be very much appreciated! <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much in advance, <br/>\n<br/>\nM & Eeni <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
