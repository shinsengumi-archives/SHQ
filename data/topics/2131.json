Just 2 days ago, I was doing some research involving Arthurian legends and Soseki&#39;s name came up in association with translating themes across culture.  He reset 5 stories into Japanese context in &quot;Kairo-ko: A Dirge,&quot; first published in 1905.  How ironic if he *was* a friend of Saitou&#39;s and a totally unrelated study of mine should still lead back to him.  :-D<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n<br/>\nsecretary &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:secretarytocapt3@...\">secretarytocapt3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was trying to clean my desk and went through layers of notes (the <br/>\nprocess is almost like an archaeological dig) and found a note <br/>\nsaying &quot;Natsume Soseki??? knew Fujita Goro&quot;....this is based on a <br/>\nVERY old post from a Japanese messageboard and was confirmed by one <br/>\nmember here at the SHQ (confirmed in terms of the name of the writer <br/>\nNOT whether it was true or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Natsume Soseki from &quot;I AM A CAT&quot; I only saw the movie...never <br/>\nread the translation.<br/>\n<br/>\nInfo on Natsume Soseki...notice his dates and where he became a <br/>\nprofessor<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fact-index.com/n/na/natsume_soseki.html\">http://www.fact-index.com/n/na/natsume_soseki.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eldritchpress.org/ns/soseki.html\">http://www.eldritchpress.org/ns/soseki.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_Soseki\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_Soseki</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wuacc.edu/reference/bridge24/Soseki.html\">http://www.wuacc.edu/reference/bridge24/Soseki.html</a><br/>\n***one of the pages mentions that a major theme of his work is <br/>\nindividualism versus group psychology (which is by the way the heart <br/>\nof many AIM discussions we have had over several months in regards to <br/>\nthe Shinsengumi)***<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my &quot;side research&quot; on the Meiji era has started from these <br/>\nrandom posts on Japanese messageboards (for example Higuchi Ichiyo, <br/>\nher father worked for the TMPD too by the way,  living very close to <br/>\nthe Fujita Family, the Yamakawa family and overall Aizu connection <br/>\nwhich we have known for quiet some time and on and on)....<br/>\n<br/>\nNatsume Soseki is always mentioned in connection to Mori Ogai...Mori <br/>\nOgai is connected to HIguchi Ichiyo (she had ALOT of guy friends).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a very OBSCURE connection but I did in fact get this <br/>\noff a messageboard and sadly so many of the old sites have crashed or <br/>\ntheir boards have been closed down so I would not be able to find the <br/>\nlink<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
