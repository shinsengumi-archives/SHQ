In fact, he might even decide to put in a bad word for her! You could have her mention Yamanami maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how far back it&#39;s supposed to be set, but in the movie Seven Samurai one of the men was not a true samurai. He had stolen papers from someone else to try to convice others that he was though. The problem he encountered was that the papers in question belonged to a ten year old boy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose she could do the same thing Barb. Just make sure she swipes the papers of someone her own age! Wait! Better yet, have her swipe some papers, get caught by Okita and taken to Hijikata, and he examines them and informs her they&#39;re recipes! That would be my luck! <br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
