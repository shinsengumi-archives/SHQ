Most interestingly, historical Kondou compared himself to one of the characters in the film.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe film ultimately is the highest level of &quot;fanfiction&quot; of Romance of the Three Kingdoms by a master director.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t miss this film!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Follow up to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/3412\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/3412</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I saw the first half of RED CLIFF and it&#39;s SPECTACULAR.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; John Woo&#39;s vision of RED CLIFF, the most well known chapter of China&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; epic THREE KINGDOMS is everything it promises to be to people who know <br/>\n&gt; the story.  I&#39;m concerned that when the movie is released in the west it <br/>\n&gt; will simply not have the same impact and the first 20 minutes are so are a <br/>\n&gt; bit rocky.  Most people who know the story can tell which character is <br/>\n&gt; which such as &quot;guy on white horse&quot; has a name we all know already.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Understandably trailers of RED CLIFF make it seem like another empty, <br/>\n&gt; soul-less CG extravaganza but if you acquire the film you&#39;ll be in for a BIG <br/>\n&gt; SURPRISE and part two will be even better.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Warning: there is another &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; film by Sammo Hung---it <br/>\n&gt; looks really &quot;iffy&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But back to Three Kingdoms and why Kondou and men of his generation <br/>\n&gt; loved this work---to the point that Kondou somewhat identified himself <br/>\n&gt; with the character of Guan Yu.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are many versions of THree Kingdoms but the &quot;basic&quot; Guan Yu we <br/>\n&gt; know from history was simply a self-made man.

More <br/>\n&gt; importantly Guan Yu was very loyal/sincere and had a warrior&#39;s sense of <br/>\n&gt; pride well before his sworn brother was able to establish a kingdom/feud <br/>\n&gt; which in the process raised his rank.  His pathetic capture and death is <br/>\n&gt; often dramatized in fiction and over the centuries he became a &quot;stock <br/>\n&gt; character&quot; for loyalty, warrior prowess and masculine power however the <br/>\n&gt; historical Guan Yu was supposedly much more cunning and seemed to put <br/>\n&gt; up a better fight than his fictional self. Kondou would have had access to <br/>\n&gt; the fictional Guan Yu via traditional story tellers and then he could have <br/>\n&gt; come across poetry and the full-length &quot;novel&quot; as he matured.

For example texts which are <br/>\ncharacter bios of the major figures in ROTK---then people get so <br/>\ninterested they are willing to wade through the original text.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways as stated here on the list in before, it is eery Kondou Isami <br/>\nrelated himself to the character of Guan Yu who had a very tragic end in <br/>\nROTK.  More well known themes from ROTK is simply the &quot;PEACH <br/>\nGARDEN PACK&quot; during which 3 warriors swore to be brothers---this is a <br/>\nstock phrase used all over the place in China/Korea/Japan in the context <br/>\nofcourse of a warrior&#39;s bond.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately though it would have occurred to MANY MANY guys during the <br/>\nBakumatsu that on a national scale, politics had entered the &quot;state&quot; of <br/>\nthree kingdoms (3 political units/parties etc) in which to survive you <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be the unit that gets ganged up on by 2 other units (this is <br/>\nwhat happened to Aizu vs Sat-Cho, and a few smaller domains w/ Sat-<br/>\nCho).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways people who study warfare, warriors or the &quot;mentality&quot; of <br/>\nmilitary strategists and confine themselves to THE ART OF WAR, Book of <br/>\n5 rings etc---are missing like a good 90% of detail, nuance, diplomacy, <br/>\nnon-military tactics and personel management unless they seriously <br/>\nmake an effort to get a taste of one of Asia&#39;s most best-selling works of <br/>\nliterature.<br/>\n<br/>\nFootnote:  Sichuan which experienced the devastating earthquake this <br/>\nyear is one of the 3 kingdoms in ROTK.  I really appreciated how John <br/>\nWoo used the occasion of this movie&#39;s release to honor people who tried <br/>\nto alleviate the suffering there.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven in the ROTK text, earthquakes are mentioned and the very rugged <br/>\nterrain around the area used as a natural defense in pre-modern times <br/>\nwas what hindered rescue efforts during this recent disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kikue.mugen&quot; &lt;kikue.mugen@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The link leads me to a dead page :(<br/>\n&gt; How come that? :P </span></blockquote></div>",

ROTK is one of those works of historical <br/>\nfiction (although there is a historical version of the story too) that is <br/>\n*constantly* mentioned, referenced and compared to.<br/>\n<br/>\nROTK is a peek into the past, and often used as a peek into the future as <br/>\nit is believed to be prophesize the outcome of political crisis once certain <br/>\nfactors come into play.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Secretarytocapt3<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. RED CLIFF is not a flying/strings kung fu type movie</div>",

You can read online classic<br/>\ntranslations of ROTK, read summaries in Chinese literature books or<br/>\njust play any one of the famous DYNASTY WARRIOR vid games.<br/>\n<br/>\nROTK was/is not only beloved in China but also Korea, Japan and even<br/>\nentered Southeast Asia a couple hundred years ago (in the form of<br/>\nstage plays/operas/puppet shows).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m posting about RED CLIFF<br/>\nhere is the trailer <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbx9oPfFNFs\">http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbx9oPfFNFs</a> (Takeshi<br/>\nKaneshiro as Zhuge Liang and Andy Lau as Zhou Yu)<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s the easiest and least time consuming way for Shinsengumi<br/>\nfans to be acquainted with what Kondou Isami loved, ROTK, and<br/>\nespecially the character of Guan Yu, known for his loyalty.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nmentioned in the past that Kondou&#39;s love of Guan Yu is interesting<br/>\nbecause of the way Guan Yu is captured and eventually executed<br/>\n(classic case of a great hero&#39;s fall) and it&#39;s almost foreshadowing<br/>\nKondou&#39;s own fate. In the trailer you can see Guan Yu at 0:48.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I like about the trailer is that it doesn&#39;t seem fancy and artsy<br/>\nlike HERO or THE BANQUET or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS.  ROTK is none of<br/>\nthose things and the story would not have any staying power of the<br/>\ncenturies if it was &quot;boring&quot;.  I hope RED CLIFF will do its part to<br/>\nintroduce one of the greatest works of historical fiction to the west.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from the eery parallels between Guan Yu and Kondou Isami....ROTK<br/>\nis THE TEMPLATE or prophetic narrative of how empires and governments,<br/>\nmodern and ancient,  fall.  Think about it...Three Kingdoms and the<br/>\ndivision of China into major factions and the parallel between the end<br/>\nof the Tokugawa shogunate.  The Three Kingdoms of China also had<br/>\nshifting alliances to neutralize the third party and all negotiations<br/>\nfluctuated over time.  It&#39;s just like the major feuds of Japan vying<br/>\nfor power in Kyoto.</div>",
