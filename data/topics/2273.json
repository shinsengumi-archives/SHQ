            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2015466675\">This post is an orientation to our lovely headquarters, please adhere<br/>\nby  our rules and don&#39;t even ***think about stealing other people&#39;s<br/>\nfundoshi just because you were too lazy to wash yours (this is<br/>\nactually the Shinsengumi&#39;s secret unmentionable rule).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are an open community so I am not writing to you NOT as the owner<br/>\nof the list. EVERYONE is welcome (see no duels for admission) thus no<br/>\none exercises authority in rejecting posts or deem any questions to be<br/>\nunimportant.  I just wanted to give an overview of our increasingly<br/>\nVAST data warehouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE:  if you do no receive a reply to your question it is because<br/>\n1) some of us are at work/school or both<br/>\n2) we just don&#39;t know how to answer<br/>\n3) we don&#39;t have access to the net...so never assume that because we<br/>\ndon&#39;t post right away we don&#39;t care --- that is not the case at all<br/>\nDO however type in keywords to search the Messages<br/>\n<br/>\nThis mailing list is specifically devoted to the Shinsengumi but many<br/>\nother related topics can be discussed at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumimb.com\">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a><br/>\nExamples of topics at the Messageboard (MB) are:  Aizu, the Meiji Era<br/>\nand Movies.  We also encourage people who are knowledgeable about the<br/>\nShishi (Ishin shishi) to join us and share their knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n*those topics are all in one way or another related to the<br/>\nShinsengumi.  The Seinan War for instance was fought by the political<br/>\nforces during the Boshin War and there was even a unit of soldiers<br/>\ncomprised of former members of the Shinsengumi (Fujita Goro was not in<br/>\nthis group).  The Aizu domain as a political entity was the direct<br/>\nemployer of the Shinsengumi and can become a basis for your own<br/>\nunderstanding in appreciating how feudal domains *work.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe MB is very flexible in terms of editing/deleting posts and<br/>\nreplies, more importantly you can quickly find posts by marking the<br/>\nforum read or unread.  A makoto symbol will appear next to the forum<br/>\nwhich has a new post since your last visit.  You must be a member to<br/>\npost but you may browse the information as a guest.  You must also<br/>\nLOGIN to use the mark forum read feature<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time many members have branched off into relate and relevant<br/>\nfields such as the Sekihoutai (which comprised of former members of<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi)  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/\">http://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why we each gravitate to different topics is ofcourse due<br/>\nto personal taste and the simple lack of English resources on the<br/>\nShinsengumi.  I myself have a university library at my disposal<br/>\nhowever I have to work *AROUND* the topic to find info...and the info<br/>\nis pretty interesting.  I don&#39;t know Japanese hence my strategy of<br/>\nworking with *side topics.  Many western scholars have neglected the<br/>\nBakumatsu and have preferred instead to focus on the Meiji Era.  Only<br/>\nrecently have researchers begun to study the Meiji Era critically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose interested in the era leading up to the Bakumatsu should join<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal art or fanfic can be posted at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand a compilation of Shinsengumi in works of fiction or historical<br/>\nstudies are located at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumidb.com\">http://www.shinsengumidb.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nour main site which will provide a more polished presentation of our<br/>\nwork is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a><br/>\n(we are always looking for contributions) simply *contact the email at<br/>\nthe site<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain if someone has more to add to my super long post please do!
