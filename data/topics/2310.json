            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-307972779\">First of all, thank you all for the information regarding Yamanami-<br/>\nsan and his death. =3 It&#39;s very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond . . . secreatarytocapt3, even if I don&#39;t know you that well, <br/>\nI&#39;ll miss you. I&#39;m sure we all will. Good luck on all your continuing <br/>\nresearch and any future projects!<br/>\n<br/>\nThird (Sorry to cram everything in one post . . . ): Re-intro.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you would like us <br/>\nto <br/>\nknow about you)<br/>\nName: Wu Jia-xin (Mandarin; yes, it&#39;s real. No, it&#39;s not really what <br/>\nmost people call me, but I like it.)<br/>\nNickname/Screen name: if I&#39;m not using my Mandarin name, you will <br/>\nfind me registered under &quot;Kitsunehime&quot;<br/>\nCurrently trying to learn Japanese . . . give or take a few months <br/>\n(*cough*years*cough*) I may be of help in the field of translation. <br/>\n^^;<br/>\n<br/>\n2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi?<br/>\nWell . . . I first came across them from watching RK . . . but I <br/>\nnever really developed an interest in them until I watched PMK. From <br/>\nthere . . . it pretty much amounts to an obsession. ^^;<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>\n . . . Okita Souji-san. X3 Because of his (supposedly?) wonderful <br/>\npersoality and humor. *ahem*not to mention good looks*ahem* One <br/>\ncannot overlook his renowned swordsmanship and somewhat tragic demise <br/>\neither.<br/>\nHijikata-san may come in second . . . his resolve regarding the <br/>\nShinsengumi is just amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>\nJust PMK, RK tv, part of Kaze Hikaru, Soshite Haru no Tsuki, and one <br/>\nother manga I can&#39;t quite remember . . . In short, I&#39;m pretty much <br/>\nlimited to what I can get online. ^^; I tried to rent Mibu Gishi Den <br/>\nand Gohatto, but the store didn&#39;t have it . . . TT_TT<br/>\n<br/>\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do <br/>\nyou <br/>\nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I can really answer this well . . . I haven&#39;t seen any <br/>\nof the live-action versions.<br/>\nBut I have to say, I love all the PMK portrayals. X3 For example, <br/>\nOkita-san . . . is just too cute. I also love how he is portrayed as <br/>\na demon of the sword. Hijikata-san . . . Good looks. X3 Charisma. <br/>\nWhat seems to be a nice person under the gruff exterior he must <br/>\npresent for the world. The joker trio . . . need I say more? Saitou-<br/>\nsan . . . can&#39;t even begin to explain with this one. X3<br/>\nBut the KH incarnations are fun too . . . Okita-san has that same <br/>\ncute, almost whimsical personality. Hijikata-san, again, seems to <br/>\nhave something besides what he wants others to see. Saitou-san . . . <br/>\neven if he might not be quite as aesthetically pleasing as other <br/>\nversion, still kicks a$$.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>\nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>\nTetsu and Tatsu were (possible) real people?<br/>\n . . . *mind goes blank* . . . I can&#39;t recall the other one. O.o</div>",
