            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1939002738\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.city.hino.tokyo.jp/shinsenr/\">http://www.city.hino.tokyo.jp/shinsenr/</a><br/>\nthere is an animation at this website which shows Shinsengumi<br/>\nrelics---really neat!<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\n[Tokio update]<br/>\nWe still don&#39;t have her start or end dates for the school but we have<br/>\na very solid chronology and details from foreigners who worked there<br/>\nor were close friends to staff members. Again, I can only read English<br/>\nso this research was difficult but rewarding...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nplease do an &quot;edit find&quot; in the body of the page (not the top<br/>\nnavigation bar) for all references to &quot;Emma&quot; and the new information<br/>\nwill appear in the chronology for the years 1887-9 {look for the info<br/>\non a green background}.  Her letters contain a description of her<br/>\nworkplace---which was Tokio&#39;s world.  So if Tokio worked at the school<br/>\nduring those years or even AFTERWARDS--she had in fact several foreign<br/>\nco-workers.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid this American interact with other Japanese? Yes, the handful of<br/>\nJapanese women who could speak English and missionaries such as Tsuda<br/>\nUme.  Often her Japanese friends would visit her at her home which was<br/>\nright on campus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can we learn from Emma&#39;s words or other description available<br/>\nthrought out the page (yes I know about the typos and how huge the<br/>\npage has become--I didn&#39;t expect all this info ^_^)...you can learn<br/>\nalot like:<br/>\n<br/>\nthe work schedule---Emma was up and writing letters at 6:30 am<br/>\nI know that Tokio&#39;s cousin, the director Takamine Hideo, worked from<br/>\n6am-8pm where does that leave our dorm mother?  Well she had to be<br/>\nsure her young students were out of bed and off to class---so Tokio<br/>\nwas BUSY!  (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can truly imagine the atmosphere of the school--note the beautiful<br/>\nsurroundings, you can see Mt. Fuji from the campus, the trees near the<br/>\nConfucian temple grounds.  The school however did move in the late<br/>\n1890s under the director&#39;s last term to even more spacious<br/>\nsurroundings to accomodate the increase in students.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do we want?  We want Emma to tell us about the dorm mothers<br/>\nofcourse.  I spent some time going over the microfilm (which focused<br/>\non her son&#39;s bio) and illegible handwriting (some brave researcher did<br/>\ntype a few of her letters) and could not find this detail.  What we do<br/>\nhave reveals a woman who loves detail and LOVED to talk about her job.<br/>\n<br/>\n[However] more biographical can be found in papers not microfilmed and<br/>\ntherefore not available --- you have to go to Cornell&#39;s special<br/>\ncollections and look for a box of notes by Mr. Herbert Croly who did<br/>\nresearch Emma&#39;s time in Japan!  Croly must have interviewed Emma&#39;s<br/>\nfriends as well because he had details not mentioned in the letters I<br/>\nread.  Emma&#39;s friends were teachers so she listed textbooks she used<br/>\nat Tokio&#39;s school, and refers to the director by his first name<br/>\n&quot;Hideyoshi&quot; (with a &#39;y&#39;) throughout.  Who know maybe Takamine Hideo<br/>\nintroduced his cousin Tokio to this American woman.  Ofcourse from<br/>\nreading the Meiji era novel about a fictional teacher Botchan by<br/>\nNatsume Soseki formal introductions were unavoidable....</div>",
