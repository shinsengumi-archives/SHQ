            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-697568641\">So far the replies mentioned its religious significance<br/>\nand the historical figure Yamaoka Tesshu (born Ono Tetsutaro) 1836 - <br/>\n1888, founder of Muto-ryu sword school (book on him titled:The Sword <br/>\nof No Sword).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal {interpretation} is historical S.H. wanted composure, <br/>\npresence of mind and wanted to witness his own death.  A majority of <br/>\nJapanese people at the time practiced a synthesis of Shintoism and <br/>\nBuddhism (many many sects/interepretations)...S.H. was buried at the <br/>\ntemple of Amitabha Buddha so (I&#39;m guessing that he was a Pure Land <br/>\nBuddhist).  As mentioned by Serizawa Kamo he may have practiced <br/>\nMugai ryu kenjutsu (NOT iaijutsu/iaido(?)) which survives today and <br/>\nhas websites.  Mugai ryu is heavily influenced by Buddhism---but <br/>\nofcourse we don&#39;t know the extent of S.H.&#39;s devotion/piousness.  <br/>\nMugai ryu emphasizes swordsmanship hand in hand with Buddhist <br/>\nbeliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Buddhist meditation you want to cultivate awareness by observing <br/>\nthe breath and mental fluctuations...so maybe this is what <br/>\nhistorical S.H. was aiming for.  Hindu-Buddhist beliefs in <br/>\nreincarnation aside, all we know for sure is that no one can <br/>\nremember their birth but they -can- experience their death (if they <br/>\ndie naturally).  Back then I don&#39;t think people had/used painkillers <br/>\nso someone in S.H.&#39;s situation had to suffer a really long time <br/>\n(gastric ulcers -symptoms- can take years before it becomes fatal). <br/>\nMany people today who pass on in hospitals lose consciousness long <br/>\nbefore their last breathe. So maybe S.H. was thinking along these <br/>\nlines...he was a policeman and soldier, he had a life filled with <br/>\nviolence (I don&#39;t think he forgot the people he killed even in cases <br/>\nof self defense) and I&#39;m sure his own mortality was on his mind alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last and lamest interpretation was that he may not have died like <br/>\nthis for -himself- but as a gift to his family who would ofcourse <br/>\nfind him in this way.  Like a testament to them about all of his <br/>\nprior actions, all of his intentions.  A way for them to never <br/>\nforget him and how he lived.  His last demonstration of strength and <br/>\nwill after a prolonged illness and turbulent life.  Recall in RK OVA <br/>\nRemembrance when Kaoru&#39;s mother or father&#39;s (I can&#39;t recall) body is <br/>\non the futon and the person&#39;s face is covered with a small white <br/>\nclothe...the impact of a loved one&#39;s passing is devastating enough <br/>\nnow how is this different from find that person sitting in the seiza <br/>\nposition after he had been confined to a sick bed for so long?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is raining where I am so such gloomy thoughts emerge easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Ofcourse, I have not found an explanation for the significane of <br/>\ndying <br/>\n&gt; while sitting in the seiza position which was mentioned on either <br/>\n&gt; http://1to5.net or http://www.3-hajime.com...so I posted this <br/>\nquestion at the <br/>\n&gt; www.e-budo.com forum under the username Fujita Makoto :P<br/>\n&gt; E-Budo.com &gt; Koryu Bujutsu &gt; Koryu: History and Tradition &gt; <br/>\n&gt; hopefully I will get some replies!<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.e-budo.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?<br/>\ns=0821e662fbae3bd9598e80507c742c62&threadid=25441 </span></blockquote></div>",
