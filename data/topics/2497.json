            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1488237314\">After a long absense due to (ongoing) internet problems, I am sorry <br/>\nto say that I do not have much new information (regarding actual <br/>\nhistorical facts). Some of you may already know this, but . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a manga series published by Shonen Jump called Gintama; it <br/>\nis an extremely strange mix of aliens and the bakufu. O.o The <br/>\nShinsengumi do have a part, but some have slightly different names (I <br/>\nknow for a fact that Okita Souji has become Okita Sogo). They first <br/>\nappear in chapter 5 (Hijikata, Okita, and a mention of Yamazaki). <br/>\nMore of an appearance in chapter 6 (Okita, Hijikata, and a few random <br/>\nmembers). Beyond that, I have no clue. ^^; From what I can tell, <br/>\nthere are even some wackified Ishin Shishi. <br/>\nScanlations are at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stoptazmo.com/gintama\">http://stoptazmo.com/gintama</a><br/>\nThere is also an online read of chapter one only at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.readmanga.com\">http://www.readmanga.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn either volume 5 or 6 of Negima (another manga), there is a mention <br/>\nof the Shinsengumi, plus one of the characters dresses in a variation <br/>\nof their uniform. The translation notes in the back made a mistake <br/>\nthough; they seem to have mixed the Shinsengumi up with the Ishin <br/>\nShishi.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who rather &quot;decode&quot; kanji bit-by-bit rather than try to <br/>\nunderstand an online translator, there is a site that translates one <br/>\n(or sometimes a few) kanji at a time, also giving multiple meanings. <br/>\nI don&#39;t have the link for the translating page, but it should be easy <br/>\nto find. A warning though; sometimes the translator interpretes it <br/>\ndifferently that you&#39;d expect (&quot;Tennen Rishin Ryuu/Style&quot; <br/>\nbecomes &quot;Nature Riku Style&quot;). But, given the names of certain people, <br/>\nit will also spit out their birth and death dates. =3<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdic.html\">http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdic.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, for those who have an interest in older history, there <br/>\nis a book called Taiko, mainly about Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It shows the <br/>\nrelationships between lord and retainer, between lords of different <br/>\nprovinces, etc; basically the feel of the time period. In relation to <br/>\nthe Shinsengumi (sort-of . . . ), the book details the downfalls of <br/>\nthe Imagawa and the Takeda clans, both of which the Inoue family <br/>\nserved at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Jia-xin</div>",
