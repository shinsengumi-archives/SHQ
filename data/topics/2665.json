Yes the title is &quot;Byakkotai&quot; but the entire <br/>\nfirst half is Shinsengumi (this is a 2 part series).  This film <br/>\nexplains the interdependence between our boys and the Aizu domain<br/>\nsee caps here <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMichael has been incredibly helpful to us in terms of history <br/>\nresearch and compiling lists of films, recommendations and updating <br/>\nus with alot of info for pop culture.  Please help us provide an <br/>\nanswer to this small request. Basically, would you BUY BYAKKOTAI? Is <br/>\nthe question (^_^) just say &#39;yes&#39; &#39;no&#39; that&#39;s all we <br/>\nwant  ::secretarytocapt3 begging::  -or- tell us what other <br/>\nShinsengumi film you&#39;d like to see subtitled<br/>\n<br/>\nWE NEED YOUR INPUT...<br/>\nIf a Shinsengumi haori (either blue or black) FROM JAPAN was the <br/>\nprize...would you consider entering in a video/multimedia contest?  <br/>\nIt can be a music vid, short live-action movie, your own animation, <br/>\npuppetry, audio drama, anything...the contest would occur early to <br/>\nlate summer.  The project would be judged on creativity and <br/>\noriginality.  It can come from any &quot;universe&quot; however, if possible <br/>\nsome of the project should incorporate your own work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould anyone be interested?  I can host your project and it will be <br/>\nposted here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm</a><br/>\nIt can be as large as 20-40 MB...or more<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to write up the rules etc, design a promo page and then <br/>\nhave no entries (^_^).  In previous contests we had only a few <br/>\nentries I was able to give prizes to ALL contestants however this <br/>\ntime I wanted to give a haori.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the competition is fierce I will also include a hakama with the <br/>\ncoat so all your cosplay dreams can come true. No I will not buy you <br/>\na sword....<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\nTRIVIA<br/>\nDid you know that the Ikedaya fight scene in the RK OVA was based on <br/>\nthe scene in the film Byakkotai?  This can be seen easily because <br/>\nthe animators copied the live action movie frame by frame in the <br/>\npart where the Choshu samurai pour out onto the balcony/rooftop.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not talking about the part where everyone is in the dark and the <br/>\nfireflies illuminate the swords but a bit later on in that sequence. <br/>\nIt&#39;s so cool I will post screencaps later.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\nWhen I get a block of free time there will be even more updates on <br/>\nSHQ however lately I had to work on scanning some rare books such as:<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthor: Kusunose, Yasuma. <br/>\nTitle: Kondo&#772; Isami to Tosa Kinno&#772;to&#772; / Kusunose, Yasuma cho. <br/>\nPublisher: Ko&#772;chiken : Inobe Sho&#772;saku, Sho&#772;wa 4 [1929] <br/>\nDescription: 2, 206 p. ; 19 cm. <br/>\n<br/>\n[status = OUT OF PRINT]<br/>\n<br/>\ncurrently on Worldcat which incorporates libraries in Japan too, <br/>\nlists that there is only *** ONE *** copy available out there for <br/>\nlending purposes...we have it (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book is all in Japanese and it is about Kondo Isami and the <br/>\nTosa group.

And Tetsu in this drama( a very young <br/>\nactor who had played also Yoshitsune child last year) was simply adorable!<br/>\n<br/>\nTama<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Both are currently seeded by Torrent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to phil&#39;s list, Shingo Katori (Kondo)will play Sun Wu Kong or <br/>\nMonkey King in the remake of &quot;Monkey Magic&quot;( I don&#39;t know how many people would <br/>\nremember this series ) based on the &quot;Journey to West&quot;.<br/>\nAnd Sakai Masato (Yamanami) will be in the new NHK short historical series <br/>\n&quot;Izumo no Okuni&quot;, telling the life of an actress who became the founder of <br/>\nactual Kabuki theater.<br/>\nBoth series will be aired from someday in January.

A<br/>\nnumber of other shows they&#39;ve put up without subtitles, fans from<br/>\nthere have made srt files available (which are not hardcoded subs, but<br/>\nbetter than nothing).  These usually appear within a few weeks of the<br/>\noriginal file going up there. (I watched Densha Otoko and a number of<br/>\nrandom J-dramas from there that way.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways == thanks for the heads up.  It&#39;ll be nice to watch some<br/>\nShinsengumi(!) again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nS</div>",

It&#39;s now available over on d-addicts.  The URL for the torrent is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?info_hash=e98207f407be423b5fbf693cf9078e8f4328578f\">http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?info_hash=e98207f407be423b5fbf693cf9078e8f4328578f</a>  (hopefully that copied complete... if not, check the torrent page ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php)\">http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php)</a>  and type in Shinsengumi in the search torrent field... it&#39;ll be the first on the list that comes up).  Size of the file is 624.50 MB.  Official title of the torrent is Shinsengumi!Hijikata Toshizou Saigo no Ichinichi(2006.01.01 704x396 DivX61)SP.avi  .  As new as it is, it&#39;s staying very well seeded.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It currently does not have subtitles.  It&#39;s been said that neither TV-Japan nor KIKU-TV (out of Hawaii) are going to provide subtitling, nor do fansubbers tend to attempt taiga dramas because of the difficulty of the historical/more formal language used.  We&#39;ll just have to see what happens.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  If anyone who wants to see it isn&#39;t familiar with d-addicts or downloading torrents (or how to watch them), they have a lot of information to help you... <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16155\">http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16155</a> .  My knowledge is limited, but I can also help as much as I can and I know there are some pros on the list who would probably also be willing to help get someone started.  Don&#39;t be afraid to ask!  (And be forewarned that Jdorama of any kind is addictive, especially considering many of our beloved actors in &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; have very long, healthy drama careers!  ^_^)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  phil<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
