At first glance you might think he was Mifune;<br/>\nboth had pretty long and distinguished acting careers.<br/>\nKinnosuke Nakamura is Okita as that website pointed<br/>\nout, this movie is one of his earliest roles. Both<br/>\nKataoka and Nakamura had a bunch of roles where they<br/>\nplayed the leading actors in the same movie in the<br/>\n1950�s.  Not too long after this movie they played in<br/>\na trilogy based on the story you know as �Sword of<br/>\nDoom� with Kataoka playing the mad swordsman and<br/>\nNakamura playing the young avenging brother.<br/>\n <br/>\n This Shinsengumi movie is one that definitely<br/>\ndeserves to be subtitled. I can�t give you too many<br/>\ndetails, but based on memory the story starts out with<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi storming the Ikedeya Inn right away<br/>\nwith some really fast swordplay as I remember.<br/>\nEventually they deal with the Ito Kashitaro group<br/>\ndefection and the movie ends near the battle of Toba<br/>\nand Fushimi. There are some love interests in the<br/>\nstory for both the main characters and I remember that<br/>\nnear the end the group burns the Makoto flag as a<br/>\nsymbolic ceremony of their group ending.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n--- spiritus_saitou &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spiritus_saitou@...\">spiritus_saitou@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is that Toshiro Mifune in the foreground?
