            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1758344711\">The custom of hiding one&#39;s name for fear it could be used against them in magic was also known in Europe during the Medieval period. It was thought to be dangerous to give strangers your real name. (One has to keep in mind how isolated rural villages were and the fact that actually meeting a stranger would have been a very rare event. Most people never left their villages once during their entire lifetime, even to go to the next town.) You find the examples of this most often in the Faery lore. Strange that such a fear was so common all over. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for clearing that up! I&#39;ve heard the name &quot;Yoshitoyo&quot; before and was told it was a formal name, but I had no understanding of exactly what that meant. Hm, it seems that someone learning his &quot;Imina&quot; would have been disasterous. Would he have trusted that a person claiming to have an urgent message from his family more if they used this name or would it have made him even more suspicious than he might have been? An interesting idea to pursue in a fic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I was actually still referring to Matsudaira. It would have actually surprised me to hear of Yoshinobu taking an active part. I&#39;ve never seen any indication that the Shinsengumi were all that close to him in any way. But they seemed very loyal to Matsudaira. So I was just thinking of all that he did for them later and was glad to know he thought so much of their efforts on his behalf.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-386130220\">The old Japanese often had changing his name. <br/>\n(To be sure, Saitou had much it.) <br/>\nIt seems that they seldom sensed sense of incongruity to it.<br/>\nWhen he wanted to hide true character from others, when his social <br/>\nstatus changed, old Japanese changed the name.<br/>\n(By the false name and the name which changed formally, since a <br/>\nmeaning is different, you have to distinguish. <br/>\nHowever, I am ignorant in order to explain the method of the <br/>\ndistinction to you. I&#39;m sorry.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I do not know why it can be performed easily. <br/>\nHowever, although this was only my guess, they had a name of &quot;Imina&quot; <br/>\napart from the name used usually.<br/>\n&quot;Imina&quot; is &quot;the taboo name&quot; or &quot;the hidden real name&quot;. <br/>\nThe custom to which this existed in ancient China is origin. <br/>\nIn ancient China, it was a taboo to call the real name of the man of <br/>\na high status. <br/>\nNobody was able to say an emperor&#39;s real name. <br/>\nTherefore, noble people needed the usual name apart from the real <br/>\nname. <br/>\nPeople of a lower status called the noble person by the name. <br/>\nAnd a noble person&#39;s real name became the hidden name which only <br/>\npeople of a near relation get to know. <br/>\n(Furthermore, although this was also Chinese thought, when the real <br/>\nname was known by the enemy, it was believed that it was used for <br/>\nmagic.) <br/>\nThis custom was imported by the old time to Japan. <br/>\nAlthough it was required at first for the Emperors and aristocrats, <br/>\nwhen the time passed, people of a lower status also imitated. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe people of the Edo period had at least two name. <br/>\nOne is &quot;Tsusyou&quot; and this is the name which anyone knows. <br/>\nAnd another is &quot;Imina&quot;.<br/>\nThis is the name which only his relative and very intimate friend, <br/>\nand the sovereign of it and him can call. <br/>\nFor example, we know the name of Hijikata Toshizou. <br/>\nHe was called for the lifetime by this name and is this name still <br/>\nnow. <br/>\nHowever, &quot;Toshizou&quot; is not a real name. His &quot;Imina&quot; is &quot;Yoshitoyo&quot;. <br/>\nThat is, his real name is Hijikata Yoshitoyo. <br/>\n(Although I do not know details, I think that the family name also <br/>\nhad a thing like &quot;Imina&quot; surely.) <br/>\nAlthough an uncertain thing should not be said, since the real name <br/>\nsuited independently, I think that they would not have sense of <br/>\nincongruity in changing a usual name.<br/>\n(However, in order to escape an enemy, using the name different from <br/>\na real name is the case which often exists. In practice, it may be a <br/>\nsimpler reason.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, the custom of &quot;Imina&quot; was abolished when the Meiji <br/>\ngovernment created a family register in Meiji 5(1872). <br/>\nTherefore, I do not have &quot;Imina&quot;. And as long as there is no serious <br/>\nreason, we are forbidden from changing a name. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, efforts of researchers show many Shinsengumi members&#39; &quot;Imina&quot;. <br/>\nHowever, a member with unknown &quot;Imina&quot; exists one person. <br/>\nThe man is the most mysterious member among Shinsengumi. <br/>\nBut to him, everything but the name of Fujita Goro got from <br/>\nMatsudaira Katamori may be unnecessary.<br/>\n(Saitou said that &quot;kaimyo&quot; is unnecessary.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, Warg3791@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;So it was Matsudaira who gave it to him?

Saitou is a man who owns nothing, not even his name, and come to think of it when you are the loser in a war and have to be moved around to this temple to that camp as a prisoner you have nothing but the clothes on your back.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I first began learning about the real man, it was one of my very first thoughts... here is a man who had everything taken from him, including not just name, but his identity, too (how do you deal with being told there&#39;s no more samurai when your very spirit is samurai?) and he *still* prevailed.  It makes up a large part of my tremendous admiration for him and a wish that I had the kind of inner strength he had to have had.  When things get to be really hard for me, I take a deep breath and think about what he endured.  It doesn&#39;t solve the problem causing the discord, but it helps me calm down and be more realistic about my reaction.<br/>\n <br/>\nWith all the recent talk of some of his fetishes and formality, I have to think the fact that he did lose everything played into his desire to have things socially upscale, orderly, and samurai.  Nothing makes you more protective of something than when you&#39;ve lost it once before.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s also behind everything I write of RK Saitou in my fanfic. Learning about Saitou&#39;s history before he shows up in RK has really colored how I&#39;ve come to view the character.  And, yaoi or not, there was no way I could ignore how valuable he could be to Sanosuke, who was my favorite until Saitou appeared.  Unlike Kenshin, Saitou has moved beyond the past.  He&#39;s realistic because he&#39;s had to be in order to survive. And despite all of the adaptation he&#39;s had to go through, he&#39;s retained his basic morals and ethics.  That makes him the far better teacher for Sanosuke... and one I think Sanosuke would respect more.  The lesson he learned from the idealistic RK Sagara&#39;s fate was just too painful, I think, for him to be satisfied with more idealism.<br/>\n <br/>\nWish he could be *my* teacher...<br/>\nphil<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

I&#39;ve read about how that name is decided, but I began to wonder about Meiji and the usage of Meiji to number the years as they were passing.
