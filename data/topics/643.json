            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-558911710\">Once again the evil babelfish is hiding information that I really <br/>\nneed. I&#39;ve been trying to learn more about the town where Saito moved <br/>\nto and it seems to be located between two rivers. Unfortunately I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure if I&#39;m reading the names of these rivers correctly. It looks <br/>\nlike one is called the Shingo river and the other says Izumisawa five <br/>\nTogawa. Would that be Izumisawa Goro Togawa? Or could they be named <br/>\nsomething else entirely? That sounds really odd for a river name. The <br/>\nsite is www.gonohe.net/ <br/>\n<br/>\nIncidently, Gonohe is located near the city of Hachinohe, way below <br/>\nthe area actually known as the Shimokita peninsula. This region is <br/>\nstill fairly barren though. In fact, even today it seems farmers and <br/>\nothers who live in the area move to Tokyo during the winter season.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
