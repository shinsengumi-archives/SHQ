In this case, we<br/>\nsee Shinsengumi as 47 ronin fanboys. After all, by Nagakura&#39;s<br/>\nrecollection they started out with just 13, so they needed something<br/>\nto inspire them.

If that were true then many of us would completely ignore this site and group as just another random place.

I.E.

It is important to know it and share it amoungst ourselves.   If we didn&#39;t correct one another and put in our own two cents of what we know, many of us would still believe things like Okita passing out during the Ikedaya raid and other stuff you find on the internet that isn&#39;t correctly translated/interperted.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-566829298\">This is not too surprising to hear that the questioned outfit is a kabuki <br/>\none. Popular imagination (in this case based on the traditional kabuki <br/>\nportrayals) often proves to be a far greater motivator than historical fact. A great <br/>\ndeal of &quot;true historical knowledge&quot; owes it&#39;s existence to the fact that less <br/>\naccurate but popular tales of an event or person were circulated and kept <br/>\ninterest in the subject alive long enough for it motivate someone into &quot;discovering&quot; <br/>\nthe real story. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the Shinsengumi would tend to prove that these popular if false beliefs <br/>\noften have greater impact on later historical events than the real historical <br/>\nfacts of a case do. Kondo, Hijikata, Serizawa and others formed their original <br/>\nideas on their perceptions of the 47 ronin rather than the &quot;historical truth&quot;. <br/>\nThese perceptions were later the catalyst for rules, etc. within the group. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it boils down to is &quot;historical fact&quot; and &quot;popular imagination&quot; are <br/>\ndependant on one another. Sure, you can study &quot;just the facts&quot; and that will tell <br/>\nyou exactly -what- happened, but it&#39;s a very dry understanding of history. <br/>\nOften it is only by taking a look at the &quot;popular opinion&quot; of events can you <br/>\nbegin to understand -why- they happened the way they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps another way to term &quot;popular imagination&quot; is &quot;fandom&quot;. It was the <br/>\n&quot;fandom&quot; generated by a popular book called &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; that is responsible for <br/>\nmuch of the &quot;academic&quot; study of the Shinsengumi today. There are people who <br/>\nhave dedicated their entire -lives- to the study of the Miburo simply because <br/>\nthey were &quot;fans&quot; of this story. If not for the book, it is entirely possible that <br/>\nthe group would have been completely forgotten by history. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a great many of us here were motivated to learn more about the <br/>\n&quot;historical truth&quot; behind the Shinsengumi because we were &quot;fans&quot; first. If not for the <br/>\npopular but often false images of the Shinsengumi shown in anime and movies, <br/>\nhow many of us would care so much about the group today? How many of us would <br/>\nhave ever heard of them if the only place they were ever mentioned were in the <br/>\ndusty books of scholars and professors?<br/>\n<br/>\nThough it may be &quot;inaccurate&quot;, I feel that the imagined image of Saito in a <br/>\nplain black outfit saying &quot;Surrender now Battousai&quot; is far less appealing than <br/>\nthe shown RK image of him in blue and white saying &quot;Aku Soku Zan&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissB<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
