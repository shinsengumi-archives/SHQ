Nobori says in <br/>\nthe picture &quot;Nagashima Gorosaku, killed at age 18. Originally from Awa, he <br/>\nfollowed Hijikata from the Kyoto days on, going to Ezo. Meiji 2, from the <br/>\n4th to the 5th month, he fought the enemy countless times at Futamata. 5th <br/>\nmonth, 11th day, he was killed in battle.&quot; The site that the picture is <br/>\nposted on adds: &quot;Born Ka&#39;ei 5, in Awa. In the 6th month of Keio 3, he joined <br/>\nShinsengumi. Fought at Toba-Fushimi, and escaped to Edo, then went to Aizu, <br/>\nand escaped to Ezo via Sendai. Fought at the battle of Futamataguchi, but <br/>\nbecause he was attached to Hijikata and not Shinsengumi at the time, this <br/>\ncannot be credited to Shinsengumi. Killed in action in the defense of <br/>\nHakodate on 5/11/Meiji 2&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he was probably an older brother figure to Ichimura Tetsunosuke, <br/>\nparticularly in the last days. Unlike Tetsu, however, he stayed with <br/>\nHijikata, and paid the price.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch is war.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1601967266\">Many of us have had the chance to see black and white films or anime<br/>\nshowing ronin shouting &quot;Sonno Joi&quot; or &quot;Tenchu&quot; before 1) assassinating<br/>\nsome important person 2) fighting bakufu forces 3) killing a foreigner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe belief in Sonno Joi (revere the emperor and expel the barbarians)<br/>\n{there are some slight variations on the translation} can be found in<br/>\nthe Imperialist and Shogunate side, however each side had political or<br/>\npersonal obligations which were factors which forced them to choose a<br/>\nside.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, alot of guys, including some Shinsengumi, believed sonno<br/>\njoi was the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpen any book on the history of Japan and the writer goes for the easy<br/>\nreason and state &quot;Japanese were xenophobic and this is expressed in<br/>\nsonno joi&quot; or something along those lines.  Usually there is a follow<br/>\nup with how the Japanese are naturally paranoid about outsiders<br/>\nbecause of the fact that they live on a series of islands.  Not only<br/>\nis that the most &quot;easy&quot; explanation, it is incomplete.<br/>\n<br/>\nOfourse, people regardless of era or race, were capable of rational<br/>\nthought.  So did they all of sudden wake up one day and say &quot;I hate<br/>\nforeigners---kill them all!&quot;  There was a cause for all things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonno joi was deeply influenced by China&#39;s (first) Opium War.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first half of these notes will explain it using the most reliable<br/>\ntexts I&#39;ve found:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/unmaskmeijigovopium.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/unmaskmeijigovopium.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the page will deal with opium in the Meiji Era, and<br/>\nJapan&#39;s use of opium in her imperialist ventures.<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n[you can stop reading if you want the rest is just extra stuff]<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt that the right thing to do was omit one paragraph which was the<br/>\nmost intriguing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe paragraph is basically this:  The weapons which funded the Ishin<br/>\nShishi (often on credit) were directly linked to the opium trade. <br/>\nAlso we know that the bakufu side had their arms dealer too, Schnell,<br/>\nand perhaps he had a network of merchants (the truth is you will find<br/>\nopium trade everywhere---it was the *NORM*).  Often merchants will<br/>\nimport in fancy western stuff but really the big money was in opium. <br/>\nOpium was such a guaranteed high profit commodity that something<br/>\nmerchants &quot;pawned&quot; it to each other for money or weapons. You can say<br/>\n&quot;hey buddy give me a whole bunch of those guns, and I&#39;ll pay you later<br/>\ncuz I got another buddy coming in with opium&quot; and the person would<br/>\nlikely give the arms because opium was sure to yield the money to<br/>\ncover the expense.  Opium didn&#39;t take up too much cargo space, it<br/>\npulled in the most profit, and it was one of those commodities which<br/>\ncould cover weapons trade (if the merchant was clever in the smuggling<br/>\nmethod).<br/>\n <br/>\nI first found shreds of this info because not only did merchants who<br/>\ndealt with the Ishin Shishi but also diplomats ofcourse had another<br/>\n&quot;base&quot; and that was British INdia.  There were financial transactions<br/>\nbetween Japan and colony as well as your standard mundane paperwork.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the big deal with British India?  India was a corner of the<br/>\nopium triangle.  British India&#39;s colonial administration was funded by<br/>\nthe opium trade.  More importantly the financial institutions which<br/>\nstored the money for the British bureaucracy and her merchants (they<br/>\nneed not be British) was basically a storage for drug profits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I didn&#39;t post this was because I did some extensive<br/>\nreading here and there and it was something which can be extrapolated<br/>\nfrom texts---but did I find some smoking gun by an author saying &quot;this<br/>\nis how the Boshin War was funded by drug money&quot;...not exactly (but<br/>\npretty darn close).<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, this is a study on a sordid trade (so authors were<br/>\ncautious), there is a surprisingly amount of data, even ship logs<br/>\nnoting how much opium was entering which port and under which<br/>\nmerchant---but for the most part authors like to present the<br/>\ninformation and draw the safest conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to state this...Thomas Glover is mostly associated with<br/>\nNagasaki (as were ***many merchants ofcourse).  Opium had few entries<br/>\ninto Japan, and Nagasaki was one of those trade hubs for this<br/>\ncontraband. The big trade firms were opium smugglers.  Keep in mind<br/>\nthat there was a great deal of denial over the opium problem in Japan<br/>\nbefore and after 1868.  So if an author bought into the &quot;Japanese<br/>\ndon&#39;t smoke opium&quot; then he/she wouldn&#39;t look deeper.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I followed them and did not interpret beyond the very basic<br/>\npossible conclusion. I didn&#39;t want to threaten the integrity of the<br/>\nrest of the good information with my own &quot;speculation&quot;.  but I wanted<br/>\nto share this scenario with  you all anyways---just because I like to<br/>\nblab.<br/>\n<br/>\n(^__^)</div>",
