Yamanami was his equal, so if both Hijikata and Kondo were out that&#39;s the person you would have went to. Of course he was eventually forced to commit seppuku. Also, if you&#39;re doing a story about the very beginning of the Shinsengumi then there were two other Commanders besides Kondo. You&#39;ll probably want to have a look at Serizawa Kamo&#39;s Biography.
