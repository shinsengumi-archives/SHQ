I have a book on weapons put out by &quot;The Diagram Group&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Minie&quot; they refer to is not an actual rifle, but a generic term for muzzle-loaders which fired an improved type of bullet, designed in the 1850s by a French army officer named Claude-Etienne Minie. They were used a lot during the Crimean and American Civil Wars. The advantage was that the bullet could be easily shot from a barrel &quot;dirty from much firing&quot;. The guns which used them were far more accurate and had a greater range than earlier muzzle-loaders and many older guns were altered to use the new bullets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Spencer&quot; is of course the the creation of an American named Christopher M. Spencer. It was a successful repeater that was first patented in 1860. There was a Spencer Carbine made in 1865 which held seven shots, caliber .56&quot;-50 rimfire, and was used during the Civil War. I&#39;m no gun expert, but I doubt it changed much in design during the time period in question. <br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
