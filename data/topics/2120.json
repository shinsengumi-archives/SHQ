I have also seen <br/>\ndozens of pics of girls in schools, with long hair, and factory <br/>\nworkers all with long hair in a bun too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTokio may have harbored a mild interest [or] simply adopted the <br/>\nfashion of progressive women.  As soon as I can find a really really <br/>\ngood quote on women and bank accounts (the amount in the bank accout <br/>\nis *insignificant)...the opening of bank accounts in their name was <br/>\nalso considered to be RADICAL. Keep in mind that Aizu women in <br/>\ngeneral were pretty active in various societies e.g. mentored by <br/>\nYamakawa Sutematsu (who was very much restrained by her marriage to <br/>\nIwao Oyama). Literate women wrote poems and discussed literature <br/>\n(specifically in the Bunkyo area, residential areas near Tokyo <br/>\nUniversity from my readings on Higuchi Ichiyo).  Keep in mind that <br/>\nTokio, from a samurai family, shared the harsh experience of many <br/>\nAizu people in the north...she worked until her hands became rough <br/>\nand callous so she may have agreed with the progressive movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nsee pic of mentioned *radical* hair cut  (^_^)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/Meijihaircut.jpg\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/Meijihaircut.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSievers, Sharon L. Flowers in Salt <br/>\nStanford:Stanford University Press, 1983. ISBN 0804711658<br/>\n<br/>\n***read this book if you want to learn about the female anarchist <br/>\nKanno Suga who planned to assasinate the Meiji Emperor...she was <br/>\nhanged<br/>\n<br/>\npage 14-15<br/>\n&quot;But as more and more Japanese men adopted short hairstyles, <br/>\nindicating their desire to join the country&#39;s march to progress, <br/>\nsome women decided to join them, by bobbing their hair.  An <br/>\nassociation advocating shorter and more practical hairstyles for <br/>\nwomen was organized in 1871, in support of the kinds of changes in <br/>\nthe government was advocating for the male population.  The <br/>\ngovernment&#39;s response to this uninvited and spontaneous development <br/>\nwas immediate.  At first it merely called for an end to the new <br/>\ncustom of bobbed hair among women, but in 1872 it made short hair <br/>\nfor women illegal.  Even older women who for health reasons had to <br/>\nwear a shorter hairstyle were required under the 1872 order to <br/>\nobtain a license from the Meiji government before they could have <br/>\ntheir hair cut.  Informally, the government explained that it <br/>\nfavored an end to the blackened teeth and shaved eyebrows married <br/>\nwomen had adopted from an earlier age, but that hairstyles should <br/>\nnot be changed.  The Meiji Empress made a public appearance in 1873, <br/>\ndeomonstrating the correct &quot;look&quot;: long hair, with natural-looking <br/>\neyebrows and teeth.  Still, the government&#39;s effort to keep Meiji <br/>\nwomen from abandoning the elaborate hairstyles symbolic of the <br/>\ngeisha could not be enforced.  Women could always cut their hair at <br/>\nhome, and a number of women active in the struggle for women&#39;s <br/>\nrights did just that....women cutting their hair can be viewed as a <br/>\nreal, if spontaneous, attempt to join the progressive forces trying <br/>\nto create a new Japan, the government&#39;s denial of their right to do <br/>\nso was also a denial of their right to participate and contribute <br/>\nactively to that change.&quot;<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n*imagining* + with some exaggeration<br/>\n<br/>\nFujita Goro and Tokio (head covered by a wrap/hood) stop by the <br/>\nBunkyo Ward police station.
