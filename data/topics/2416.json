            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1946911969\">Part of my ongoing joint Aizu-Shinsengumi research...so far, I&#39;ve been able <br/>\nto find the following in terms of relations, both blood and marital, of <br/>\nSaitou Hajime/Tokio and Aizu retainers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou, through Tokio, was inlaw to the following families:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Saigou (Saigou Tanomo, chief retainer).<br/>\n2. Numazawa (heirless family that Tatsuo was adopted into) Page 68 of Shiba <br/>\nGoro&#39;s book references a &quot;Numasawa Einosuke&quot;...<br/>\n3. Sagawa (Sagawa Kanbei, domain elder who died at Mt. Aso in the Seinan <br/>\nWar)<br/>\n4. Kimoto/Kinomoto, presumably another Aizu retainer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy way of Saigou, he is also connected to the Iinuma, the family of the lone <br/>\nsurvivor of the fragment of the Byakkotai that committed suicide on <br/>\nIimori-yama (Iinuma Sadakichi). Iinuma Tokei fought alongside Saigou Tanomo <br/>\nat the Battle of Shirakawa (as in the movie &quot;Byakkotai&quot;), and if the film is <br/>\ncorrect, kept Saigou from committing seppuku.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER, not all Byakkotai died on Iimori-yama. There was a larger group of <br/>\nthem, and they were either killed in the battle or survived, like Yamakawa <br/>\nKenjiro and Shiba Shiro, the brother of Shiba Goro.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to my next point. The commander of the Byakkotai was Hinata <br/>\nNaiki...and Shiba Goro&#39;s mother comes from the Hinata family. Shiba is also <br/>\nrelated to the Arakawa by way of his uncle Shiba Seisuke-- and Arakawa was <br/>\nthe family of Arakawa Katsushige, who wrote a book about Aizu in the Boshin <br/>\nthat Sec looked at some time ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther familial connections, this time amongst the Edo-based retainers:<br/>\n<br/>\nNakano (family of Takeko) and Hirata (other Joshitai member) were connected <br/>\nto Akaoka (naginata teacher) because they&#39;d both each given a daughter to <br/>\nhim in adoption. Nakano Heinai was the leader of the Shujakutai, the group <br/>\nof men aged 18-35 who &quot;engaged in actual combat&quot; (Shiba, p. 45), and his <br/>\nson, Nakano Toyonori, at age 19, was a member.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow back to reading!<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.</div>",
