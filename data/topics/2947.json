LOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI really enjoyed how this document is evidence of Shinsengumi using guns.<br/>\n<br/>\n[1864] The Shinsengumi March showing rifles and cannons<br/>\n<br/>\n[1865] (reference point) The Choshu Kiheitai and their modern weapons<br/>\narticle will mention Kido Takayoshi, Tosa and Thomas Glover<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/earns/meiji.html\">http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/earns/meiji.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[1867]  &quot;...several  Shinsengumi absconded from Kyoto because of their<br/>\nresentment at <br/>\norders to adopt firearms. Three days later a serious confrontation<br/>\noccurred in the city <br/>\nbetween about two hundred pike-carrying city patrols (Mimawari) and<br/>\nperhaps a battalion <br/>\nof infantry (hohei) armed with rifles. After several hours of tension<br/>\nthe deployed forces were <br/>\nquieted and no serious damage was done...The Shinsengumi was one of<br/>\nthe most vigorously <br/>\nloyal patrol groups in Kyoto, and its men were fiercely proud of their<br/>\nfunction and capacity.&quot; <br/>\n(Totman 359)<br/>\n<br/>\n[1868.2] Hijikata obtains &quot;state-of-the-art breech-loading rifles&quot; for the<br/>\nShinsengumi. (Hillsborough Shinsengumi 143)<br/>\n<br/>\n[1868] E. Schnell (think of him as the Thomas Glover of the bakufu forces)<br/>\nhad sold weapons to Aizu and allies of that domain.  Aizu samurai were<br/>\nalready trained<br/>\nto use guns and canons earlier.  The Yamamoto family history clearly<br/>\nshows that pro-bakufu<br/>\nforces were interested in this technology.  I think Hirotada Tokugawa<br/>\nhad mentioned the Nagaoka rifle unit.<br/>\n<br/>\n[1868 end of summer early fall]  Saitou Hajime (now Yamaguchi Hajime)<br/>\nsaved Oshima Torao, <br/>\nduring his retreating, using small arms fire.<br/>\n<br/>\n[1868] ofcourse at Hakodate, under Hijikata Toshizo, the Shinsengumi<br/>\nalso used guns/cannons etc<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you read a text that says that samurai abhorred the use of guns,<br/>\nthink of these<br/>\nexamples.  Every side which could afford guns used them.  Going much<br/>\nfarther back in time,<br/>\nfeudal warfare in Japan, China and Southeast Asia has always<br/>\nincorporated these tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nshinsengumihq.com was recently hacked.
