            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1890848748\">Sec I went back and looked at that link again. I think the problem <br/>\nwas I typed something wrong. The correct url is:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.directcon.net/pharmer/Wakamatsu/Wakamatsu.html\">http://www.directcon.net/pharmer/Wakamatsu/Wakamatsu.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe name of the site is Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony at Gold <br/>\nHill, California. If the url still won&#39;t work, then type the name <br/>\ninto Yahoo. It will definitely come up that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you who are a bit confused, during the Boshin War a man <br/>\nnamed J. H. Schnell smuggled refugees out of Aizu and brought them to <br/>\nAmerica. One was a young woman named Okei. They founded the Wakamatsu <br/>\nTea and Silk Company at Gold Hill in 1869 (near modern day <br/>\nPlacerville, CA), but it folded after only two years. Everyone went <br/>\ntheir seperate ways. Okei remained in the area as an employee of a <br/>\nlocal family. She seems to have died very young of tuberculosis and <br/>\nher grave is on a hill near where the community once existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile searching for the site again I came across two more pdf files:<br/>\nco.el-dorado.ca.us/bos/pdf/ang8-27.pdf<br/>\nco.el-dorado.ca.us/bos/pdf/cang08-27-2002.pdf<br/>\n<br/>\n(The first url might end /cang8-27.pdf. I have no idea if these two <br/>\nfiles are the same or not. Still need to download that reader...)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut wait! I found something even more exciting! A man named Jonathan <br/>\nPearce has actually writen a book about the colony! It&#39;s called The <br/>\nFar Side of the Moon. ISBN# 1-59411-011-5  (Note I saw more than one <br/>\nISBN# for this book. The one I listed appears to be more recent.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe explains the reason he wrote the book at the below url:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.balona.com/moonwhy.html\">http://www.balona.com/moonwhy.html</a><br/>\nThere is mention of another book called Samurai at Gold Hill by <br/>\nYoshiko Uchida. I guess that means this book should be available here <br/>\nin the U.S.? Worth checking into anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a brief letter to the author from a decendant of the <br/>\nfamily that Okei worked for:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.balona.com/moontestimonial.html\">http://www.balona.com/moontestimonial.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI MUST find The Far Side of the Moon!<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
