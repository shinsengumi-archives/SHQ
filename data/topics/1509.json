But that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all ^^;;;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I&#39;ll be there till February, I want to visit some<br/>\n&gt; famous spots there ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have traveled Aizu only once. <br/>\nI went to Wakamatsu castle, Kondou&#39;s grave, Saitou&#39;s grave, Iimori <br/>\nmountain, the remains of Shimizuya-inn, and Nyoraidou. <br/>\n(Incidentally, I stayed at the Higashiyama hot-spring village.)^^ <br/>\n<br/>\nWakamatsu castle was destroyed in Boshin war. <br/>\n(Now, it is restored.) <br/>\nThe source materials of the time are in the museum of the castle. <br/>\n<br/>\nKondou&#39;s grave is in Tennei-ji (Tennei temple) near the Higashiyama <br/>\nhot-spring village.<br/>\nHijikata who got injured in the Utsunomiya war went to the <br/>\nHigashiyama hot-spring village for three months. <br/>\nHe received the bullet in the leg. <br/>\nAnd he built Kondou&#39;s grave, doing a hot-spring cure at this hot <br/>\nspring. <br/>\nKondou&#39;s grave is in the inner part of a mountain. <br/>\nThere is a very steep slope there on the way. <br/>\nDid Hijikata go up that slope on inconvenient one leg? <br/>\nI considered such a thing and went up the slope. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, will Kamo-san attend Aizu in February? <br/>\nThe time, Japan is midwinter. <br/>\nIf there is much snow, you may be unable to go there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn passing, Aizu-bukeyashiki (Aizu Samurai house) is between the <br/>\nHigashiyama hot-spring village and Tennei-ji. <br/>\nThis is the house in Saigou Tanomo which was Aizu&#39;s minister. <br/>\nSasaki Tadasaburou&#39;s grave is in a site. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou&#39;s grave is in Amida-ji (Amida temple) beside the Nanukamachi <br/>\nstation in Aizu Line. <br/>\nSince it is in the very conspicuous place of the temples, you can <br/>\nfind it immediately. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn Iimori mountain is the place where the boys of Byakko-tai <br/>\ncommitted suicide. <br/>\nTheir grave is located in the mountain side of a mountain, and you <br/>\ncan sense their despair for a view from this place. <br/>\n<br/>\nA Byakko-tai memorial hall is located in the bottom of it. <br/>\nHere, the personal effects of Hijikata or Saitou is exhibited. <br/>\nAnd Takizawa-honjin is near this. <br/>\n(I forgot to go there.)^^;;; <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is Shimizuya-inn, if you walk along the road in front of Amida-<br/>\nji. <br/>\nHijikata stayed here. <br/>\n(The signboard only stands now.) Regrettable! <br/>\n<br/>\nNyoraidou has separated a few from Aizu Wakamatsu. <br/>\nIf you believe a map and walk, you will repent. <br/>\nNyoraidou is in a paddy field. <br/>\nAnd a building is the old hut which is completely valueless. <br/>\nHowever, about 20 Shinsengumi members who made Saitou the captain <br/>\nhere fought with the enemy. <br/>\nThe enemy&#39;s number changes with data. <br/>\nSince an enemy&#39;s number was written to be about 300 persons, I was <br/>\nvery much surprised at the book which I read first.^^;;; <br/>\nSaitou is truly lucky. <br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, Bonari Pass is located in the direction of the <br/>\nInawashiro lake. <br/>\nIt is far from Aizu Wakamatsu. <br/>\nIf you can drive a car, you can go there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Tama-san and Momoiro Usagi-san: anata tachi wa Aizu<br/>\n&gt; chihou ni osumai deshouka? ^^;; Moshi sou deshitara<br/>\n&gt; aeru koto ga dekiru deshouka? ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I live in Tokyo. <br/>\nHowever, I can attend Aizu in about 5 hours from Tokyo. <br/>\nIf the day when you come to Aizu is known, I can go there. <br/>\n<br/>\nTokorode watashi ha Nihongo sika hanasemasen.<br/>\nSoredemo daijyoubu desuka?<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",

It even has a <br/>\nhandy little map so you can locate the sites easy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aiaiaizu.com/shinsengumi/\">http://www.aiaiaizu.com/shinsengumi/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThe site fails to mention this but Takizawa Go-honjin was also the HQ <br/>\nfor Matsudaira Katamori during the fighting. You&#39;re supposed to still <br/>\nbe able to see the bullet holes. It was originally a rest station. <br/>\n(The temple where he officially surrendered is right across from it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s called Myokoku-ji.) <br/>\n<br/>\nNyoraidou (Buddha Hall) - I think we determined this is where that <br/>\nSept. 4/5 battle took place?<br/>\nBonari Pass isn&#39;t mentioned on the site for some reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess there is nothing left of them now, but the prison camps for <br/>\nthe Aizu samurai were at Inawashiro and Shiokawa. I think Saito was <br/>\nat least originally at Shiokawa.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot mentioned on this site:<br/>\nNihonmatsu Monument - Dedicated to yet another boys troop who were <br/>\nkilled in action.<br/>\nTonoguchihara Old Battle Site - Lots of heavy fighting here.<br/>\nTakeko Nakano (the leader of the women&#39;s troop) is buried at <br/>\nAizubange Town. Supposedly Horibe Yasubei&#39;s parents are also buried <br/>\nthere at Kitoku-ji Temple. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good site to look at would be:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pref.fukushima.jp/index_e.html\">http://www.pref.fukushima.jp/index_e.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, the landscape around Aizu has changed a bit since the time of the <br/>\nBoshin War. I forget what year it was, but Mt. Bandai blew its top <br/>\nand ended up creating a bunch of lakes and marshes. I don&#39;t know if <br/>\nit changed any of the Shinsengumi related sites or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy your trip!<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
