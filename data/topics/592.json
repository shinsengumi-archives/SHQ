I end up with more questions than I started out with, which isn&#39;t actually a bad thing except I have no way of answering those questions, many of the answers of which are staring me straight in the face and I simply can&#39;t decipher.  There is something very interesting going on with Suzuki&#39;s early life that I can&#39;t make head nor tail of in the babelfish translation... it&#39;s actually more frustrating than knowing nothing at all.  Worse than Tantalus and the grapes and water.  :-D<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;he was a lit/hist. teacher...brainy guy who was also Toudou Heisuke&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>teacher...is it me or Itou&#39;s role seems to be blurred as &quot;book&quot;<br/>\nteacher -and- martial arts because &quot;somewhere&quot; out there it is<br/>\nmentioned that Itou had his own dojo&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n*Something* like this is mentioned on the site you gave us today, but I&#39;m not sure (again) exactly what they&#39;re getting at:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Kaei February of 5, death of the father. As for older brother Okura the younger brother, the multi gates succeeded the private school because that time already you had become the disciple of the Ito school in Edo.<br/>\nBut, still as for the multi gates of the child as for study being able to finish ahead of time, &quot;as for the man for martial arts should strive&quot;, that the &quot;camphor tree multi gate circles&quot; and so on with the flag which is written <br/>\nYou say that everyday the children and it had gone to war the your �� densely and so on.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;there are no English sites that go into detail about Itou&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sigh... why am I not surprised...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;[fictional] explanations<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Mibugishiden...Itou wanted to join the imperialists because he<br/>\nassumed that he and his group would not only be paid more but they would get high ranks in the new government<br/>\n<br/>\n*Shinsengumi!:Band of Assasins....Itou (who was invited by Kondou to join the group) had &quot;new&quot; ideas and he says &quot;you have to think why you are cutting/killing the Ishin Shishi&quot; (members of the Shinsengumi gasp in astonishment)...Itou in the movie writes to Kondou and tells him to dissolve the Shinsengumi...when he leaves he tells Kondou that he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean to start a faction but he will help monitor the enemy and report info back ---but that didn&#39;t happen&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither is very satisfying.  I think from somewhere I picked up the notion it was more along the lines of what was presented in &quot;Band of Assassins,&quot; but not with the &quot;friendly&quot; overtones of retaining any contact, that it was more antagonistic.  Don&#39;t have a clue where I got that idea, though...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really aggravated with myself because I&#39;ve never once stopped to think about why Suzuki would&#39;ve join the Sekihoutai or that Itou&#39;s departure didn&#39;t have to mean he believed in the Ishin Shishi cause, that he could&#39;ve still held bakufu loyalties, although wasn&#39;t Satsuma allied with Choshu by this time (1867) and it sounds like Itou was connected to the Satsuma feudal clan (or maybe that was just to whom Suzuki turned after the assassination)?  It&#39;s beginning to become entangled with questions I have about Sagara before the war and his association with the Mito clan and why he had to stop fighting for them... these changes in loyalties mixed with the subtle philosophical differences/factions that arose on both sides... it gets so delightfully confusing.  Geez... I think I need to start creating some tables before I&#39;m impossibly lost.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nphil (feeling very much like Sano right now when he was punching down trees in the forest... aggravated and lost)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
