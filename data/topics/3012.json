            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-594013695\">In the months following the action at Ikedaya, Shinsengumi had intentions <br/>\nfor development and expansion. To this day, they languish under the common <br/>\nmisconception people have about them-- that they supposedly hated firearms <br/>\nand had a near-myth-worthy ideal of chivalry. Romulus Hillsborough&#39;s recent <br/>\nwork is a prime example of such a belief. However, the reality was <br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn or around (by the Gregorian calendar) October 4, 1864, Kondou Isami, <br/>\nNagakura Shinpachi, Takeda Kanryuusai, and Ogata Shuntarou departed Kyoto by <br/>\nfast palanquins for Edo. They took the palanquins until Kuwana, then crossed <br/>\nthe Bay of Ise by boat, and landed at Atsuta in the Tokaido region, and <br/>\ncontinued eastward by fast palanquins once more until they reached Edo on <br/>\nthe 8th of October. On the following day, Kondou and his ensemble went to <br/>\nthe Aizu offices in Edo and reported in, then they proceeded to the Matsumae <br/>\nclan mansion to see then-roju (shogunate senior councilor) Matsumae <br/>\nTakahiro, and submit a formal petition asking for the shogun to be sent to <br/>\nKyoto once more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Kondou was still in Edo, recruiting new men for the Shinsengumi, <br/>\nHijikata sent him and Sato Hikogoro-- Shinsengumi&#39;s &quot;corporate&quot; sponsor from <br/>\nTama-- a letter regarding gunnery. In this letter, dated November 7th, 1864, <br/>\nHijikata says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The entire corps trains in Western-style gunnery every day. Training is <br/>\nimproving every day, and we are preparing to serve in the upcoming attack on <br/>\nNagato Province.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNagato Province was the place where the Choshu domain and its branch domains <br/>\nwere located.<br/>\n<br/>\n[For those interested, I have drawn this information from pages 138 to 139 <br/>\nof the text &quot;Shinsengumi,&quot; by Oishi Manabu (Tokyo: Chuko-shinsho, 2004. ISBN <br/>\n4-12-101773-0)]<br/>\n<br/>\nBy considering this information, we can see that the myth of Shinsengumi as <br/>\nmen who entirely, exclusively &quot;lived by the sword&quot; is false. The Shinsengumi <br/>\nwere men who, at best, lived by the ways of war. As time went by, they <br/>\nacquired new technology and put it to good use-- namely, that of the new <br/>\nfirearms imported from the West. It is indeed true that some members of the <br/>\nShinsengumi may not have liked firearms or found them dishonorable; however, <br/>\nas Hijikata, in his role as acting commander in Kondou&#39;s absence, was <br/>\nwriting about &quot;daily training&quot; and preparation for the Choshu expedition, we <br/>\ncan see that the *unit&#39;s* policy was one of Western-style weapons training, <br/>\nalongside more traditional sword, spear, and horsemanship (et cetera) <br/>\ntraining. The weapons training in gunnery also suggests that Shinsengumi may <br/>\nhave been called upon to perhaps be a spearhead for the Choshu expedition-- <br/>\nwhich confirms the assertion of historian Harold Bolitho that Matsudaira <br/>\nKatamori, the lord of Aizu, had more than an incidental role in the <br/>\nexpeditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line: Shinsengumi was not impervious to change. Just as the <br/>\nIshin-shishi adapted their philosophy of &quot;sonno-joi&quot; in order to accomodate <br/>\ntheir desire to acquire foreign support; so too the Shinsengumi made use of <br/>\nforeign weapons and tactics to improve their effectiveness. It&#39;s a rule of <br/>\nwarfare: those who don&#39;t adapt lose quicker. Yes, Shinsengumi lost in the <br/>\nend, but that was in 1869-- after a good five years of training in <br/>\nWestern-style tactics and gunnery, and that history most definitely counts <br/>\nfor something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTalk now to your Hotmail contacts with Windows Live Messenger. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0020000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://get.live.com/messenger/overview\">http://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0020000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://get.live.com/messenger/overview</a></div>",
