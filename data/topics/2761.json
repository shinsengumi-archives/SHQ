Well, there are hundreds of Shinsengumi books and many<br/>\nfictional works have inspired research into the history. Some books<br/>\nfocus on one figure for instance.  Just go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiNames.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiNames.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nhighlight, copy and paste the name you want into google.co.jp and add<br/>\n&quot;ISBN&quot; and you will find books about the specific Shinsengumi figure.<br/>\n Then take that number and plug it into amazon.co.jp to find the book,<br/>\nread reviews.  You may also search Japanese blogs and read fan reviews<br/>\ntoo once you get the book title.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also commentary that Akama Shizuko (a very old well respected<br/>\nShinsengumi researcher best known for her research into Saitou Hajime)<br/>\nwrites HISTORICAL FICTION.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is partly true. <br/>\nHowever, making sweeping generalizations does ***damage*** her<br/>\nreputation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInformation on her books has been recorded here for over a year(s).  I<br/>\njust bolded &quot;fiction&quot; vs &quot;non-fiction&quot; for clarification today<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSince I don&#39;t know Japanese, how do I know which book is fiction or<br/>\nnon-fiction?<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple, I used Worldcat which has a database of Japanese books to note<br/>\nits category and also read several blogs which reviewed her work (to<br/>\nconfirm Worldcat&#39;s category).  If you visit major Shinsengumi sites<br/>\nwhich focus on history you will note how highly regarded her work is<br/>\n(her facts are carefully quoted)...she by the way interviewed people<br/>\nnot just used texts, her research was dynamic and very detail<br/>\noriented, from newspapers to public records, you name it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, Akama, DID DO SERIOUS history research and put her OWN<br/>\nSPECULATION into novel form---in a totally [separate] work---not mixed<br/>\nin with her serious work. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease take care in posting information on websites, especially in<br/>\nthis case.  Akama did stick to the golden rule and went through alot<br/>\nto bring details on Saitou to light (many of those details can be<br/>\ninterpreted in a negative way).  Even though Akama is also a fan, she<br/>\ndid her job as a historian as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which book is the best?  We don&#39;t know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSHQ is using alot of English language texts and we have no problem in<br/>\nputting conflicting information side by side.  Examples can be found<br/>\nhere on the still in progress timeline.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNotice how we are going to try to get every single account we can<br/>\nfind.  We can&#39;t rely on one book because each historical figure was in<br/>\na different place and interacted with different people. So there are<br/>\n&quot;piecs&quot; of information everywhere.<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\nEven *more* Shinsengumi cosplay photos<br/>\ncontributed by wolverinesg7<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(all we need now is a Shinsengumi themed piercing my friends) (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nKondou Isami &quot;whoa, that tattoo is as badass as the skull on the back<br/>\nof my black training gi&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata ::nods in agreement::<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou &quot;it&#39;s a good tattoo, but not as good as MINE&quot; ::Saitou whips<br/>\noff shirt to reveal his back::<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata &quot;nice chrysanthemum flowers there&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou &quot;no they are cherry blossoms---can&#39;t you tell?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata &quot;clearly -chrysanthemums- Saitou&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKondou &quot;cool carp there too&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou &quot;Carp?
