Since it was a Shinsengumi boom last year, Burai <br/>\nannounced some short stories with the magazine different from it. <br/>\nBurai is the good work with which the story is built well. <br/>\nTherefore, judgment of this chief editor is very regrettable.<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi mangas are unpopular and there are many works which are <br/>\nstopped.

And <br/>\nthey sense the complicated social situation of Bakumatsu <br/>\ntroublesome, and do not read those mangas.<br/>\n<br/>\nPMK was very popular rare Shinsengumi manga. I think that about <br/>\n400,000 people are disappointed in Japan because this work was <br/>\nstopped. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to see Shinsengumi manga which Watsuki-sensei draws^_^<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I did mention this, but there isn&#39;t much to discuss at the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>moment.
