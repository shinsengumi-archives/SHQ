When it&#39;s done,<br/>\nI&#39;ll summarize the whole thing, but based on prior discussion groups,<br/>\nwe could be looking at a dozen pages of text, so I&#39;ll probably put it<br/>\ntogether into a PDF or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time around, the focus is just the Shinsengumi, as few people<br/>\nseem to know much about them, and I try to keep the groups focused on<br/>\nsomething specific (prior discussions have been on Kofun (burial<br/>\ntombs) and the 47 Ronin).  The bakumatsu in general would be too big,<br/>\nbut since it is the backdrop, the events are important.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for stating that posted information from sources doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily reflect the position of the person posting it, I agree -<br/>\nsometimes, for whatever reason, these things can get personal (much to<br/>\nmy chagrin) but most people tend to accept that a lot of history is<br/>\nperception.</div>",

In doing so we hope to have people<br/>\nwalk away with some evidence (ofcourse we do know texts can be faulty<br/>\nbut atleast we know where details come from).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it has been my past experience that it is good to state up front<br/>\nin a discussion that an answer posted by a person (let&#39;s take for<br/>\ninstance a quote from a book) may not always reflect the personal<br/>\nopinion of the poster.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the bigger picture of the Bakumatsu will be discussed, then that<br/>\nwould be awesome.  I know that some people on this list may have<br/>\ninformation which has never been mentioned in western texts before. <br/>\nThe posting of those details may be a bit jarring to many people who<br/>\nhave been exposed to just the Imperial narrative etc so I don&#39;t want<br/>\npeople to take things personally or take offense.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill you also summarize the discussion after it is over as well?  That<br/>\nwould be a good reference for people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can link to the discussion thread and announce it on our blog and<br/>\non our updates page if you&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dear SHQ members, recently I became acquainted with a programmer<br/>\nwho is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; willing to assist in the installation of a database to the website to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increase its functionality.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Speaking from first-hand experience, installing a database in the<br/>\n&gt; website that allows for multiple contributors is a great idea, and<br/>\n&gt; makes everything far easier to manage and update.

That <br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; why the cost is kept low.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SHQ&#39;s mission is fan based but we clearly also have a deep interest <br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; this history. As we&#39;ve slowly gained a better understanding of the<br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi&#39;s world we realize how rare this information is in <br/>\nEnglish.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So you may ask &#39;how can I help?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can help by contributing any fanwork (fiction, art, parody,<br/>\n&gt; multimedia) you wish.<br/>\n&gt; Volunteer to help list keywords for some page.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OR<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; contribute to the flat rate of this project.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The cost of the installation of the database is $40. However, I hope<br/>\n&gt; to continue to have a professional relationship with her so that she<br/>\n&gt; can help solve other technical issues which may arise in the future<br/>\n&gt; and so forth. So I feel that the amount is justifiable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will be paying an additional cost on my own to her because I have<br/>\n&gt; sat down<br/>\n&gt; with her gone through the site with her already. Basically she has <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; will be putting in alot of time.<br/>\n&gt; I would pay the $40 on my own however I was unemployed at the end of<br/>\n&gt; December (but now I am only underemployed) and I cannot handle the<br/>\n&gt; financial burden on my own. So if people would like to contribute <br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; amount please paypal [shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com]. For the sake of<br/>\n&gt; complete transparency, I can also<br/>\n&gt; provide a receipt from this programmer who can verify that she has<br/>\n&gt; received payment from me as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-420783826\">Dear SHQ members, recently I became acquainted with a programmer who is<br/>\nwilling to assist in the installation of a database to the website to<br/>\nincrease its functionality.<br/>\nThe new look of the site, designed by <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ai-dax.com\">http://www.ai-dax.com</a> will not<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of many ongoing projects at the SHQ which include:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) addressing the backlog of history related updates contributed by<br/>\nHirotada Tokugawa<br/>\n2) updating the site with more info (contributions by secretarytocapt3<br/>\nand also Michael, again there is a backlog of info I have to update)<br/>\n3) ofcourse any new contributions from the public and members of this<br/>\ncommunity<br/>\n4) continue to install the new ai-dax layout to each and every page on<br/>\nthe site (this is a labor intensive process which I have still not yet<br/>\ncompleted)<br/>\nand now we have this new technical based matter which presented itself<br/>\n<br/>\nthe programmer is not charging a huge amount for labor costs (she is<br/>\nnot charging a per hour rate or anything) and I have explained the<br/>\ncircumstance<br/>\nof SHQ...we are all just fans, completely not for profit and run by<br/>\nvolunteers and we have NO BUDGET (other than what we force Barb to pay for<br/>\nus ^_^).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever she is going to use some and software and perhaps acquire new<br/>\nsoftware to make the process easier (again we aren&#39;t paying for that<br/>\neither<br/>\nand she uses a university computer lab to do her work).<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself will be assisting in the construction of a database which<br/>\nwill power the search engine and therefore have to devote my free time<br/>\nin summarizing, through keywords, each and every single page. That is<br/>\nwhy the cost is kept low.<br/>\n<br/>\nSHQ&#39;s mission is fan based but we clearly also have a deep interest in<br/>\nthis history. As we&#39;ve slowly gained a better understanding of the<br/>\nShinsengumi&#39;s world we realize how rare this information is in English.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you may ask &#39;how can I help?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can help by contributing any fanwork (fiction, art, parody,<br/>\nmultimedia) you wish.<br/>\nVolunteer to help list keywords for some page.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\ncontribute to the flat rate of this project.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cost of the installation of the database is $40. However, I hope<br/>\nto continue to have a professional relationship with her so that she<br/>\ncan help solve other technical issues which may arise in the future<br/>\nand so forth. So I feel that the amount is justifiable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be paying an additional cost on my own to her because I have<br/>\nsat down<br/>\nwith her gone through the site with her already. Basically she has and<br/>\nwill be putting in alot of time.<br/>\nI would pay the $40 on my own however I was unemployed at the end of<br/>\nDecember (but now I am only underemployed) and I cannot handle the<br/>\nfinancial burden on my own. So if people would like to contribute any<br/>\namount please paypal [shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com]. For the sake of<br/>\ncomplete transparency, I can also<br/>\nprovide a receipt from this programmer who can verify that she has<br/>\nreceived payment from me as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nshinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com</div>",
