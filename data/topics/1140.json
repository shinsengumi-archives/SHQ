            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-518899126\">In a message dated 6/17/2004 6:20:22 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:secretarytocapt3@...\">secretarytocapt3@...</a> writes:<br/>\nIn another pic you its kind of like &quot;its a bird, its a plane, its <br/>\nSaigo in the meteor!&quot;...2 versions of this Saigo sighting similar to <br/>\nthe one M pointed out in the newspaper archive.<br/>\nThe book I&#39;m reading on Saigo has one of those pics in it. I don&#39;t know if <br/>\nyou&#39;ve read this or not Sec. I know I told phil and Barb, but let me fill <br/>\neveryone else in. The reason Saigo is being shown in the meteor is that on August 2, <br/>\n1877 (while Saigo was still fighting in Satsuma) a meteor appeared in the <br/>\nskies over Osaka. A newspaper called the Osaka nippo reported the next day that <br/>\nif the &quot;bright star&quot; was viewed through a telescope one could see a portrait of <br/>\nSaigo in full Imperial army uniform. Popular opinion being with Saigo at the <br/>\ntime, people took this at evidence he was already ascending to the stars and <br/>\n&quot;night after night people stood on their  laundry-drying platforms to get a <br/>\nbetter look at the celestial hero&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time the comet appeared over Tokyo it had become an object of <br/>\nveneration. The term at the time for a comet was &quot;hoki boshi&quot;, but this could also be <br/>\nread as &quot;rebellious star&quot; in reference to the insurrection. People by this <br/>\ntime were climbing onto their roofs to get a better view and many wound up <br/>\ngetting hurt because the roof boards would collapse under all the weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are supposed to be some prints of this star by a guy named Haneda that <br/>\nshow people unhappy with his leaving trying to drag the star back down with <br/>\nropes. Another print by Tsukioka Yonejiro shows the government trying to shoot <br/>\nthe star down with a millitary balloon!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some other prints Sec that are called &quot;Saigo nehanzo&quot; or nirvana <br/>\nprints. Saigo is presented as an enlightened being (still in his uniform) who is <br/>\nabout to transcend this world. More &quot;common&quot; people from all walks of life <br/>\nsurround him, praying for him to remain. Even animals are shown grieving! <br/>\n(Perhaps the most telling of these is the snake?) <br/>\n<br/>\nYet another type of Saigo print is the ones made after his defeat. They are <br/>\ncommonly called &quot;kubi Jikken&quot; or &quot;inspection of heads&quot; and show Yamagata and <br/>\nCo. sitting around while the heads of the traitors are lined up before them. NO <br/>\nsuch inspection ever took place however.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat these are all about is the fact that for a short time after his defeat, <br/>\nSaigo&#39;s head went missing. The new government had begun a policy of not <br/>\ndisplaying heads publicly because it was &quot;an example of the cruelty of the old <br/>\nregime&quot;. (So was anyone else unaware that it was the &quot;evil old regime&quot; that <br/>\ndisplayed Kondo and Sagara&#39;s heads rather than the &quot;good&quot; new one?) The fact is that <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t really need the head. However they were frantic to find it because <br/>\nof all the myth that had already sprung up around Saigo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had the body. They could prove that it was truly him. He was an <br/>\nunusually tall man of nearly six feet and had a very distinctive scar on his right arm <br/>\nfrom a youthful quarrel, so he was easy to identify. However they wanted the <br/>\nhead to lay the rumors and legends to rest along with him. Not only had he <br/>\nalready become something of a demigod while he was still alive, but there were <br/>\nmany who did not accept the reality of his death even WITH the head.<br/>\n<br/>\nRumors began to circulate that he was in either China or India preparing an <br/>\narmy to come back and seize control of Japan. These stories continued to pop up <br/>\nevery now and again. As late as 1891 people were claiming that Saigo was in <br/>\nRussia (who was coming for a visit)  and would return to Japan in the company <br/>\nof Crown Prince Nikolai to start the new rebellion. When Saigo failed to appear <br/>\na constable named Tsuda Sanzo decided this was evidence of foul play and <br/>\nattacked the crown prince!<br/>\n<br/>\nLegend tells of Saigo&#39;s fall and the finding of his head in this way:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they rushed down the hill Saigo was struck in the hip by a bullet and <br/>\nfell. He supposedly composed himself and prepared to die. He asked his friend <br/>\nBeppu to be his second (the actual conversation gets VERY long according to the <br/>\nsource), then faced east and the Imperial Palace. In prints he&#39;s shown <br/>\nthrusting a sword into his abdomen just before Beppu cuts his head off. The head is <br/>\ngiven to Saigo&#39;s manservant Kichizaemon, who flees with it and tries to hide it <br/>\nfrom the Imperial army by burying at the gate of a private home. (The <br/>\nmanservants name changes from tale to tale, as does the home where he did this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next part of the myth is the presentation of the head to Yamagata. I&#39;ve <br/>\nalready mentioned that no such scene as the one depicted in the prints ever <br/>\noccured. The &quot;historical&quot; version that is usually given is that a man named Maeda <br/>\nTsunemitsu (again, there is a question of WHO actually found the head, but <br/>\nthis name is the most likely) brought the head to Yamagata. The general of the <br/>\nImperial army treats it with great respect, washing it and praising his <br/>\n&quot;glorious death&quot;. He recollects how they fought together during the Revolution and <br/>\nweeps for his fallen comrade. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reality is this: According to the autopsy done on Saigo&#39;s body, he could <br/>\nnot have sat there calmly or make a big speech. He was most likely in shock at <br/>\nthe time and a shattered hip would have made it impossible to do what he does <br/>\nin the story. Furthermore, there were no sword wounds of any sort on his <br/>\nabdomen. His head was indeed severed with a clean cut, but  that&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second part of the story comes from an American observer named Captain <br/>\nHubbard. He reports that the bodies of the rebels had been striped naked and <br/>\nlined up in two rows on a hill by the Imperial army&#39;s barricades. Hubbard <br/>\nimmediately spots Saigo&#39;s body and realizes the head is missing. It is the only one <br/>\nthat the head is completely gone from. Others were &quot;dreadfully cut up&quot; and he <br/>\nfelt certain they had killed each other. While he was watching Saigo&#39;s head was <br/>\nbrought in and unceremoniously placed beside his body. And that&#39;s all there <br/>\nwas to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is of course all from Mark Ravina&#39;s book, The Last Samurai. <br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

I purposely put in the babelfish translation even though it was worse than usual just so you&#39;d bite on &quot;demon circular.&quot;  I wondered the same thing, but I couldn&#39;t remember if there was more to the name of Saitou&#39;s sword and I&#39;m just not up to searching in past messages.  I figured you&#39;d know (or at least find it noteworthy).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;?...imagine Shinsengumi captains Saitou &quot;my sword is xxxx&quot;, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Miki &quot;so&#39;s mine&quot;...then they just go on and on about the history of their swords&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they both down plenty of sake, I&#39;m sure.  That could&#39;ve been a riot (perhaps literally).  ;-)  Something else the site (and momoiro) mentioned was that Suzuki had a lifelong drinking problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;now with all these tales of Shinsengumi grandpas I imagine their grandsons and granddaughters...at school saying things like &quot;my grandpa can kick your grandpa&#39;s *ss&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And maybe that was good enough reason to stay away from each other.  :-D  Kids say the darnedest things, like giving away your hiding place.  With what appears to be *seven* grandkids from Tsutomu alone (looking at the family tree M provided), maybe Saitou had good reason to be always on alert.  :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nWe should start a grandpa file to keep all these stories...  they&#39;re such a treat!<br/>\n<br/>\nphil<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
