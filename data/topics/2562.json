The film by the way<br/>\nclobbered an action movie called 7 SAMURAI in the box office. <br/>\nTwenty-Four Eyes is an antiwar film expressed through the biography of<br/>\nthe teacher and her students.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the film the heroine rides a bicycle out of necessity and wear&#39;s a<br/>\n&quot;man&#39;s suit&quot;.<br/>\nThe principal at the school is worried because she is &quot;from the normal<br/>\nschool&quot;** &quot;serious about teaching&quot; and &quot;very smart&quot;<br/>\n**(likely prefectural normal school)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heroine had to deal with people judging her based on exterior<br/>\nsymbols of &quot;modernity&quot; (just as during the Meiji E. students would<br/>\nwear western clothing, interact with men and study English).  The<br/>\nheroine in fact made her suit from a kimono and rides a bicycle to<br/>\nwork to avoid taking a boat.  The film is often deceptively simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe teaches folksongs (as opposed to JUST state songs) folk songs were<br/>\npreserved and taught at Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School (this has more to<br/>\ndo with Yamaguchi Yukiko--Goro&#39;s niece) during the 1880s.  Folk tunes<br/>\nwere &quot;converted&quot; into western notes at the TWNS.<br/>\n<br/>\nFuthermore the film captures the partnership between the only 2<br/>\ncareers available to women: nursing and teaching.  One of the students<br/>\nin the film has a sister who is nurse--she promises to support the<br/>\nsibling if she can manage to test into the normal school.  During<br/>\nTokio&#39;s time many graduates of the normal school also pursued nursing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe incredibly hard life of female teachers.<br/>\nI believe it was in Hani Motoko&#39;s narrative that she went to Aomori<br/>\nand met a graduate of the Women&#39;s Normal School teaching in this<br/>\ndesolate area.  Again, Tokio would&#39;ve mentored young women who had to<br/>\nmove away very far away from home based on their appointments (this is<br/>\nwhy choosing this career was viewed as an act of rebellion).  This<br/>\nTOTALLY WAS AGAINST cultural norms of the time where women moved in<br/>\nwith the family of their husbands---and moved wherever he went. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to smile when I realized how Tokio was involved with this<br/>\nmonumental progress.  As a dorm mother her job was to mentor, educate<br/>\nand restrain some young women from going &quot;overboard&quot; with all these<br/>\nnew ideas---but to even be part of this progress implied an<br/>\nunderstanding and approval of the changes going on.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-244368394\">Recently, there was a Shinsengumi event at Aizu&#39;s fall festival. <br/>\nPlenty of cosplay and a meeting to discuss history. Some usual<br/>\nactivities such as club members visiting the hot spring (now a modern<br/>\nhotel) where Hijikata spent time healing his wounds and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease watch this site for an archived video of the events which<br/>\noccurred this past weekend (give them a few days):<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ntt-east.co.jp/fukushima/mado/archives/index.html#matsuri\">http://www.ntt-east.co.jp/fukushima/mado/archives/index.html#matsuri</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn the same page you will see a vid with the title &quot;Akaeda Higanjishi&quot;<br/>\n(warning: this is a 10 minute video!  you may just want to watch 3<br/>\nminutes)<br/>\nthis is connected to an episode which occurred during the seige of the<br/>\ncastle.  <br/>\nAccording to Akiko Kuno&#39;s UNEXPECTED DESTINATIONS (ISBN: 4770016387),<br/>\nYamakawa Hiroshi (then called Taizo) had soldiers dress as farmers,<br/>\ndance and play music to enter the castle safely.  Understandably, the<br/>\ninvaders were very confused about the festive atmosphere--and the Aizu<br/>\nsamurai passed through enemy lines and entered the castle safely. <br/>\nThis event was also shown in the film BYAKKOTAI (which also depicted<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi!).  This film was reviewed by Tama<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm</a><br/>\n*there is nothing to suggest that Shinsengumi or SAitou were involved<br/>\nin this dress-up strategy--however it would be interesting to explore<br/>\nin the world of fiction. It would be interesting to write about RK<br/>\nSAitou wearing *feathers*.<br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\nThere are many outstanding blogs in Japanese which cover Shinsengumi<br/>\nhistory, fiction and independent research.

Both Yamakawa Kenjiro<br/>\nand Yamakawa Hiroshi&#39;s connection to the Fujita family are discussed<br/>\nbriefly at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm</a>  She mentions<br/>\nhow Kenjiro is a &quot;genius&quot;.  He was, and he had some competition too,<br/>\nTakamine Hideo (relative, friend, and employer to Mr.and Mrs.<br/>\nFujita)---both Kenjiro and Takamine were skipping grades at<br/>\nNisshinkan---they must&#39;ve fought over the title of the<br/>\n&quot;strongest&quot;--err I mean the &quot;brightest&quot;.<br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\nMust See Doggy-Shinsengumi Wear<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kyoto-mibu-shinsengumi.jp/goods/index.htm\">http://www.kyoto-mibu-shinsengumi.jp/goods/index.htm</a><br/>\n**maybe when I get the time---I&#39;ll have my turtle cosplay, just to<br/>\ncompete with the Japanese fans!<br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hajimenokizu.com\">http://www.hajimenokizu.com</a> <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumifics.com\">http://www.shinsengumifics.com</a></div>",
