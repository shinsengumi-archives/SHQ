In terms of what I study -- I&#39;d probably say I generally focus in on meta-issues like culture and politics.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy interest in the more political and historical side of Japan probably was fueled by a lot of Sec&#39;s posts here. :)  Since Sec and others on this list have focused on the Shinsengumi and due to the availability of materials in English in various libraries, I elected to pursue materials on the Choshu han who was influential in shaping the Meiji era.  I see this as a complementary approach to better understanding the environment that shaped much of the Bakumatsu.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of research style, I tend to work from book to book and abstract things that I find randomly interesting or that I remember that others have a passion for.   At the moment, I am still working on dealing with materials on Katsura Kogoro/Kido Koin-Takayoshi, although I became sidetracked by a biography on Yoshida Shoin, who was both a mentor to Katsura, as well as a personal headache to him.   :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I&#39;m much slower than the others on this list in finding stuff and then in redistributing it. I have still yet to finish reading the diaries, but am posting various snippets of things I dig up at my website (http://red-bird.org).  Sec recently added a link from the SHQ webpage for the curious.  At the moment, I only have the beginnings of Katsura and Shoin stuff.  (Hopefully *cough* I can goad someone into putting up the Takasugi materials in short order.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of your original interests - remind me to scan the covers and special images from the Pichi manga line featuring Hijikata and Souji .  Aside from the history stuff, I have a not-so-secret weakness for manga and fanart. -_-;<br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1900432360\">I&#39;d like to comment on Katsura Kogoro&#39;s blog---I mean multi volume <br/>\ndiary, it contains valuable references to the destitute Aizu men in <br/>\nToko after Boshin. Yes, it&#39;s Katsura, yes he is on the &quot;other side&quot; <br/>\nas Sherl put it (^_^) but the man is just fascinating and <br/>\ncompassionate and boy he can write.  So when  you guys do research <br/>\nfor fun -do not- expect to walk into the library and <br/>\nfind &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; instead look at the other sources.  He also dealt <br/>\nwith Toshiyoshi Kawaji during Seinan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m with M, I really enjoy studying Aizu (Byakkotai, Joushitai and <br/>\nAizu women in the Meiji in general like the awesome YAMAMOTO YAEKO + <br/>\nJo Neesima).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t know a whole lot about the Fujita family, except what is <br/>\nwritten in Japanese however I&#39;m very happy with what I have found in <br/>\ntheir relationship to Aizu&#39;s Yamakawa family...so I research the <br/>\nYamakawa family (plenty of shreds of info in ENGLISH).<br/>\nDon&#39;t know about Fujita Goro the man, but I have learned alot by <br/>\nstudying his -job- the history of the TMPD, Toshiyoshi Kawaji etc.  <br/>\nSame with Tokio, her job at Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School aka (Women&#39;s <br/>\nNormal School, Teacher&#39;s College for Women and sometimes footnoted <br/>\nat Ochanomizu) is just amazing...she had to keep with the changing <br/>\ntimes I use keynames like Takamine Hideo (her cousin),  Tsuda Umeko<br/>\n(her own school can be a -template- for how women&#39;s schools were <br/>\nrun), women&#39;s dorm life, alumni of Tokyo Women&#39;s normal school YASUI <br/>\nTETSU (same generation as Fujita MIdori) who taught in Siam and <br/>\nutitilized TWNS&#39; model there too!  So basically I&#39;m happy to learn <br/>\nabout the &quot;sphere&quot; in which our beloved historical figures lived and <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look up various keywords like &quot;Yasui Bank&quot; to learn about the <br/>\nsignificance of Tokio opening a bank account...for example<br/>\nhttp://www1.kinjo-<br/>\nu.ac.jp/~nakata/Nakata/Data/Sectors/2Sector/EYasuda.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that there are more hard records in Aizu about Tokio <br/>\nbecause she retained a leadership role due to her past employment <br/>\nwith Teruhime and ofcourse she did collect money to build a memorial <br/>\nfor those killed in Aizu.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso found some valuable stuff on two of Kondo&#39;s buddies back home <br/>\nin Tama during the Bakumatsu and what they did in the Meiji (let&#39;s <br/>\njust say the farmers of Tama weren&#39;t all that -simple-).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Sherl, whatever you can dig up is appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I love SCANDAL...the  ROKUMEIKAN kind ::hehehe:: <br/>\nsomeone should totally write a fantasy Shinsengumi fanfic putting <br/>\nthem in the Deer Cry Pavilion.  For the new people please see the <br/>\nMeiji thread at shinsengumimb.com</div>",

While there are many connections to the Shinsengumi in terms of mutual memberships in groups and a lot of philosophical ideas, my research won&#39;t be reported here on the list since Sagara wasn&#39;t a miburo.  *Always* in a state of correction, editing, and constant growth, it now spans over several journals pointing back to the main journal, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sagara_sozo\">http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sagara_sozo</a> .<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Also, for those of you who lurk -- what are you dying to get your hands on that you think other Shinsengumi fans on this list are interested in?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Take advantage of people like this *any* chance you get!  ^_^  It is absolutely amazing the things they can track down and find out!  Without others offering to help me find out obscure things, my research would be so far behind what it is now.

You&#39;d be surprised at how many answers really are out there once there are people happily digging away.  And you just never know when someone else who&#39;s been lurking might&#39;ve already found it!  If it has to do with the late Tokugawa/bakumatsu, then it has relevance to the Shinsengumi.  They surely didn&#39;t just sit around in a temple collecting paychecks, slash a few unknown/unimportant people at night, and do nothing else.  ^_^  I think we&#39;ve seen interest, too, in what became of those who survived to live on into the Meiji... men whose lives didn&#39;t just end when the glory days were over... as well as the families of those who didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s all interconnected, and for those involved in fiction writing (fanfic or original), this list is a fantastic resource for information to help with plots and<br/>\n atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nphil (who apologizes if the formatting is screwed up in this reply... sometimes the mailer does weird things I&#39;m just not sure *how* it&#39;s going to turn out)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
