            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-922562912\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;I have *so* many questions right now, but I&#39;ll keep it to just a<br/>\n&gt;few at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t worry, history is my job-- I live for these questions. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Why would Rintaro be adopted into the Okita family?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because Souji was too young and being trained in kenjutsu-- and if Kondo <br/>\nlater had the intention to adopt him, this all makes sense-- Kondo would <br/>\nhave probably had that intention when Souji entered the school. With Souji <br/>\nessentially &quot;out&quot; of the Okita family (or such a discussion taking place <br/>\nwhen Katsujiro was still alive), the only alternative would have been for an <br/>\nheir to be adopted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If Katsujiro died in 1845, and Rintaro married in 1846, was this<br/>\n&gt;arranged in advance by Katsujiro - or someone else?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They would have probably been engaged before Katsujiro died. My guess would <br/>\nbe that they waited an appropriate time. In Asian cultures (I speak from <br/>\nexperience) engagement can come anywhere from one year to three before the <br/>\nactual marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If Katsujiro<br/>\n&gt;was ill and knew he was going to die, would it have been the normal<br/>\n&gt;thing to do in adopting an heir because Souji was so young?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Amongst Shogunal officials it was weirder-- sometimes one could be dead <br/>\nfor several days and then they&#39;d set his body up behind a screen and have a <br/>\nretainer read something that the deceased supposedly wrote-- &quot;Due to my <br/>\nillness, I hereby adopt so-and-so as my heir...&quot; Because, you see, no heir <br/>\nmeans the family not only ends, but the surviving relatives (especially <br/>\nwomen) have pretty much their entire estate/source of livelihood taken away <br/>\nby government order (I think it&#39;s called &#39;toritsubushi&#39; in some cases).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Did<br/>\n&gt;that make Rintaro head of the Okita family?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very much so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What if Souji had not<br/>\n&gt;died so young? Could an adopted heir displace a blood heir?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes-- happened sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And,<br/>\n&gt;where does &quot;Fujiwara&quot; in Rintaro&#39;s adopted name come from?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fujiwara are one of the three big Heian-era clans that everyone liked to <br/>\nclaim descent from. The other two were Minamoto (Genji) and Taira <br/>\n(Heike/Heishi). Fujiwara were court nobles, the other two were princely <br/>\nfamilies that became warrior clans. So when someone gave their full name, <br/>\nthey&#39;d also name who they (ostensibly) descended from, even if it was a <br/>\nsomewhat tenuous claim *cough*Lord Ieyasu*cough*<br/>\n<br/>\nHence, Okita Souji&#39;s full name was first &quot;Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no <br/>\nHarumasa&quot; and later &quot;Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in some dealings with the Imperial Court, if Souji had, say, received <br/>\na summons from the Emperor or a Prince or other noble, he would have been <br/>\nsummoned-- not as Okita Souji, but as &quot;Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot;-- kind of like <br/>\nhow Matsudaira Katamori *was* summoned as &quot;Minamoto Katamori&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Perhaps<br/>\n&gt;someone wouldn&#39;t mind giving a quick history lesson on adopting<br/>\n&gt;heirs?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s sort of tricky...but I&#39;ll try to figure a general description out and <br/>\npost it before long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And...about the adoption situation presented in NHK with Shuhei - If<br/>\n&gt;Kondo was going to name Souji his successor as the Tennen Rishin<br/>\n&gt;master, why wouldn&#39;t he also make him the Kondo family heir?  I had<br/>\n&gt;assumed it was because he was already the Okita family heir. Is this<br/>\n&gt;a case of mixing historical accuracy and taking historical liberties?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes...sorta. Inheriting the tradition doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you <br/>\ninherit the master&#39;s family. Tennen Rishin Ryu today is an example of that-- <br/>\nthe Kondo and Miyagawa families alternate headship, if I recall correctly, <br/>\nbut the present master is......Sono Seigo? Not sure...the last Kondo to be <br/>\nhead of the school was Kondo Isuke, who I believe died in the early 1990s.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said before, Okita was probably not the family heir, even from the <br/>\nvery beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Kondo was going to name Okita his heir for both school and family, he <br/>\nprobably would have followed how Kondo Shuusuke did it for *him*-- train him <br/>\nfirst, then when he was about to take over, have him change his name and <br/>\nthen succeed to the family *and* dojo headship.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust me, family/succession issues in Edo-era Japan are incredibly weird. <br/>\nWhich is why Kondo naming Tani Masatake as his heir (Kondo Shuuhei) is <br/>\ninteresting-- he would have been prepping Souji for years, BUT, since Tani <br/>\nMantaro and Sanjuro, two brothers who ran the Tani spear dojo (Taneda Hozoin <br/>\nRyu) joined Shinsengumi, Kondo would have done what was natural in a <br/>\n&quot;business deal&quot; like that-- adopted their brother in order to seal the deal <br/>\nby &quot;family&quot; ties. Incidentally, the Tani dojo was where Harada Sanosuke <br/>\nlearned how to use the spear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",

Great-grandfather- Kan&#39;emon- died Bunsei 2 (1819)<br/>\n2. Grandfather- Sanshiro- died Tenpo 4 (1833)<br/>\n3. Father- Katsujiro- Koka 2 (1845)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not doubted that Katsujiro was his real father, but there&#39;s still the <br/>\nrecord of &quot;2nd son of Okita Rintaro&quot; to deal with. The Hino Sato family <br/>\n(Hijikata Toshizo&#39;s brother in law Hikogoro) also records Soji as being <br/>\nOkita Rintaro Mototsune&#39;s youngest son. According to the &quot;Okita-ke Bunsho&quot; <br/>\n(Okita Family Record), however, lists Rintaro Mototsune as being Mitsu&#39;s <br/>\nhusband, so it&#39;s impossible that he was Soji&#39;s father.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if the death record is correct, then we must conclude that Soji&#39;s <br/>\nfather was *another* Rintaro. But that complicates things. After all, <br/>\nRintaro was adopted as the successor, and thus became Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;son&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn May of Bunkyu 3 (1863), when Rintaro entered Shinchogumi, he denoted his <br/>\nfather as &quot;the late Okita Katsujiro, retainer of Lord Abe Noto no Kami,&quot; and <br/>\nagain, describing himself in Keio 1 (1865), as &quot;son of Okita Katsujiro, <br/>\nretainer of Lord Abe Noto no Kami&quot; and again, in official documents of Meiji <br/>\n4 and 5, before the prefectures were organized into their present form, as <br/>\n&quot;Eldest son of Okita Rintaro, former samurai of Nihonmatsu Prefecture, in <br/>\nOushuu.&quot; That being the case, it is impossible that Rintaro was Soji&#39;s real <br/>\nfather. At the same time of Rintaro&#39;s last description of himself (the Meiji <br/>\n4/5 one), Mitsu was listed in the same document as &quot;Eldest daughter of <br/>\nKondou Shuusuke of Tokyo&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Meiji 7, the Okita family records list her the same way. Her son <br/>\nYoshijiro mentions her the same way-- &quot;Eldest daughter of Kondou Touzou of <br/>\nNorth Tama county, Ozawa Village.&quot; Mitsu&#39;s true origin as a daughter of <br/>\nOkita Katsujiro and her even having been born into the Okita family are thus <br/>\nhidden. Why is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason is: A man by the name of Chiba Yaichiro entered Shinchogumi in <br/>\nKeio 2 (1866). In his record, &quot;Shinchogumi to Shonai-han&quot; (Shinchogumi and <br/>\nthe Shonai domain), he lists Rintaro as &quot;the birth brother of Okita Soji.&quot; <br/>\nRintaro, it seems, told everyone he was Soji&#39;s blood brother, and in order <br/>\nto hide this, he listed Mitsu as the daughter of the Kondou family.
