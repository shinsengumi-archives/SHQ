            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1244978213\">Okay... We&#39;ve talked about this before.... OMG... I want to go... If <br/>\nanyone is serious enough to go next year, count me in...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site is in Japanese and YES babelfish is our friend for now.. If <br/>\nyou want to see this great tour... <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rau.milkcafe.to/makoto/book/tour_1.htm\">http://rau.milkcafe.to/makoto/book/tour_1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe tour starts with the Ishin shishi sites, the Restoration mansion <br/>\n(yeah what did you expect! just kidding). <br/>\n<br/>\nClick next at the bottom<br/>\n<br/>\nThis part of the tour shows the home of Katsura and Ikumatsu. If you <br/>\nremember the RK OVAs then this should look familiar... There&#39;s <br/>\nactually some sort of info (I&#39;m not really sure as babelfish is <br/>\nweird), that the Shinsengumi attacked the place and Katsura had <br/>\nIkumatsu hide in the big chest (don&#39;t worry you won&#39;t miss it). <br/>\nThere&#39;s a picture of Ikumatsu (not far from how she was drawn in <br/>\nRK). Looks like she was also a Geisha? (not sure) <br/>\nThen there seems to be a restaurant inside the Restoration mansion? <br/>\n<br/>\nOh of course the prices are there too.<br/>\n<br/>\nClick next at the bottom<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it mentioned that they visited the Ikeda house but I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure about the pictures... <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are pictures of what I&#39;d say castles, probably the official <br/>\nheadquarters in Kyoto? I&#39;m not sure please clarify this for me. <br/>\nThanks...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they leave for the good part, the Maekawa residence (where the <br/>\nShinsengumi stayed after they separated I think from Serizawa Kamo?)<br/>\nThere is a shot of the corridor, shot of the house outside and a <br/>\nshot of the storehouse. The storehouse is an interesting thing <br/>\nbecause most tours I&#39;ve read do let you go inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nClick next <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is inside the storehouse... The floors are removable? What for?<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the low ceiling and the pulley there. The webmaster <br/>\nsaid probably for torture... Remember RK OVA again... I think it was <br/>\nin the directors cut, a footage was shown about this. More removable <br/>\nfloors... Finally what is that wood panel with the name Shinsengumi <br/>\non it? A postcard... <br/>\n<br/>\nThen contact information! I REALLY WANT TO GO!<br/>\n<br/>\nclick next<br/>\n<br/>\nYagi residence headquarters of Shinsengumi... I think this is where <br/>\nSerizawa Kamo was forced to commit seppuku (not sure as usual... I&#39;m <br/>\nbad at this)... Bunches of pictures of the house... PLUS Shinsengumi <br/>\nmerchandise... I really want that UNIFORM... Last interesting note <br/>\nfor me is the Heshou Well, it says it has been in existence while <br/>\nour bishies stayed there. I&#39;m not sure what they meant when they <br/>\nstarted talking about the &quot;stones&quot;... More yagi residence pictures...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tour was conducted by bus for one day, back in June 2003.<br/>\n<br/>\n~wounds</div>",
