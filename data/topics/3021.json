Here&#39;s the current version with <br/>\ncitations.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\nTodo Heisuke (1844 - December 13, 1867) was the eighth unit captain of the <br/>\nShinsengumi.<br/>\n<br/>\n==Background==<br/>\nTodo was from Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo). Very little is known about his origin. <br/>\nAlthough he was said to be an illegitimate child of a feudal lord, it is debatable. <br/>\n(Yamamura, 179-180)<br/>\n<br/>\nTodo was a practitioner of the Hokushin Itto-ryu, trained at Chiba Shusaku Narimasa&#39;s <br/>\ndojo. (Yamamura, 181) However, according to some sources, he was trained at Ito <br/>\nKashitar?&#39;s dojo instead. (Yamamura, 182)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn around 1862, he started &quot;taking his meals&quot; at Kondou Isami&#39;s Shieikan.(Nagakura, 20<br/>\n-21)<br/>\n<br/>\n==Shinsengumi Period==<br/>\nIn 1863, Todo joined the Roshigumi with Kondo and other members of the Shieikan. <br/>\n(Yamamura, 185) After the Shinsengumi was formed, Todo first became a fukuchou jokin <br/>\n(assistant vice commander) and then became the captain of the eighth unit in 1865. <br/>\n(Yamamura, 186)<br/>\n<br/>\nTodo received a wound on his forehead during the Ikedaya Jiken on July 8, 1864. <br/>\n(Yamamura, 177)<br/>\n<br/>\n==Death==<br/>\nTodo was killed during the Aburakoji Affair on December 13, 1867.(Yamamura, 189)<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&quot;, Kondo had wished to spare <br/>\nTodo&#39;s life. (Nagukura, 144) However, Todo was killed by a new member, Miura <br/>\nTsunesaburo, whom did not know the circumstances.
