It&#39;s a misconception that Okita&#39;s mother died when he was &quot;very young.&quot;  In fact, she <br/>\ndied in 1862. (Mori, p.36 - p.37)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Okita Souji is listed in the death records at the family temple<br/>\nas being the &quot;2nd son of Okita Rintaro Genji (sp???)&quot; (not to be confused with  Okita <br/>\nRintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune.) Okita Rintaro Genji (also from the Inoue family) was <br/>\nadopted into the Okita family; he died in 1852.   (Mori, p.10)   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s believed that Okita Rintaro Genji adopted Okita Souji. (Mori, p.11)<br/>\n(Myabe he also adopted Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune?)  Okita Rintaro Genji served <br/>\nas the head of the Okita family, before Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune became the <br/>\nhead of the family in place of the young heir, Okita Souji.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Okita changed his name to &quot;Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot; before his departure to <br/>\nKyoto.  He could have changed his name in 1863 (or in 1862, or less likely, in 1861.)  I&#39;ve <br/>\nreversed my notes on the Okita discussion page at Wikipedia (and have taken all the caps <br/>\noff.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;A few notes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. Okita was born in the Shirakawa-han&#39;s mansion in Edo (present day Tokyo.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2. His birth name (in full) was Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa. He later &gt;changed <br/>\n&gt;his name to &quot;Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi.&quot; Other than his full &gt;name, he could be <br/>\n&gt;referred as Okita Souji, Okita Souji Kaneyoshi, or Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi. In the case of <br/>\n&gt;his birth name, he could be referred as Okita Soujirou, Fujiwara no Harumasa, or Okita <br/>\n&gt;Soujirou Harumasa (never Okita Harumasa Soujirou!)<br/>\n&gt;Family Name: Okita<br/>\n&gt;Given Name/First Name Equivalent: Soujirou, Souji<br/>\n&gt;Family Clan Name:Fujiwara<br/>\n&gt;Formal Given Name/Middle Name Equivalent: Harumasa, Kaneyoshi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3. Okita was enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school between 1850 and 1852, Kondou <br/>\n&gt;Isami was enrolled in 1848. Kondou Isami was like a &quot;TA&quot; to Okita and didn&#39;t become the <br/>\n&gt;forth master until 1861, the same year Okita mastered all the techniques of Tennen <br/>\n&gt;Rishin-ryu.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. Okita was actually Hijikata&#39;s &quot;senpei&quot; and was enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school <br/>\n&gt;before Hijikata. (Hijikata was formally enrolled in 1859.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5. Okita was sent to a hospital in Edo during the Boshin War(1868-1869) and after the <br/>\n&gt;first battle (Battle of Toba-Fushimi) of Boshin War. It was not a tuberculosis hospital and <br/>\n&gt;an injured Kondo was sent to the same hospital with Okita.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>4. This is only a suggestion,  I think it&#39;s more appropriate to refer him as &quot;Okita Souji <br/>\nFujiwara no Kaneyoshi.&quot; While Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi was a member of the <br/>\nShinsengumi, Okita Soujirou Fijiwara no Harumasa was the Head Coach at the Shieikan.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Even though my user name is &quot;nlf7,&quot; I&#39;ve been using my nickname &quot;Seven&quot; on all the <br/>\ndiscussion pages at Wikipedia. May I suggest that you also use my nickname &quot;Seven&quot; to <br/>\navoid confusion or list both my user name and my nickname?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Seven<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; test run <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; again nlf7 can gather more Okita fans to improve upon the page <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a proper disclaimer has been inserted at the top of the page<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; also if there is an error please give the page address so I know what <br/>\n&gt; to revise...for example just say &quot;Background&quot; &quot;Shinsengumi Period&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; so forth so I can save some time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; over time as more information is gathered and contributed many <br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi member&#39;s pages will change to this format<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

Here&#39;s the Okita article with &quot;(author, page #.)&quot;\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita S?ji<br/>\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita S?ji (?? ??), (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the first troop of <br/>\nthe Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate period. He was <br/>\na well-known genius swordsman, being one of the strongest out of the Shinsengumi, <br/>\nalong with Saito Hajime and Nagakura Shinpachi.<br/>\n<br/>\nContents<br/>\n\t \t1 Background<br/>\n\t \t2 Shinsengumi Period<br/>\n\t \t3 Death<br/>\n\t \t4 Trivia<br/>\n\t \t5 References<br/>\n\t \t6 Okita in Fiction<br/>\n<br/>\nBackground<br/>\nHe was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai family <br/>\nin the Shirakawa- han&#39;s Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His Great-grandfather was Okita <br/>\nKan&#39;emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His father, Okita <br/>\nKatsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907) and Okita Kin <br/>\n(1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita family, Okita Rintaro <br/>\n(1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuke <br/>\nin name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and Okita started <br/>\ntraining at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time, Kondo Shusuke had <br/>\nalready adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijikata Toshizo had not <br/>\nyet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy and attained <br/>\nMenkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 - p.11)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1861, Okita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often <br/>\ncommented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he was also <br/>\nknown to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori, p.27 - p.28)<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) and Satou Shun&#39;sen (Satou <br/>\nHigokorou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high cheekbones, a <br/>\nwide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he was known as a man who <br/>\nsmiled and laughed well (not very talkative, however.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi Period<br/>\nOkita changed his name to Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before his departure <br/>\nto Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and a <br/>\nFukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou, also a <br/>\npractitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the Shinchougumi (the <br/>\nShinsengumi&#39;s brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, with Todo Heisuke being <br/>\nthe youngest. He was one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (one of <br/>\nthe original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro assassinations in <br/>\n1863. (Oji, p.132)<br/>\n<br/>\nEqually skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his signature technique was <br/>\nnamed the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (which translates as &quot;Three Piece Thrust&quot;), a <br/>\ntechnique that could attack one&#39;s neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. <br/>\n(the Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but this is most <br/>\nlikely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention and it could <br/>\nhave been derived from an invention of Hijikata&#39;s (the Hirazuki.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was rumored that his tuberculosis was discovered when he coughed blood and fainted <br/>\nduring the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say that he contracted the disease after that. <br/>\nBoth are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very slowly (many years). <br/>\nWhile many of the Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaru was killed by Okita <br/>\nduring the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction), it is in fact historically <br/>\ninaccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction, many also believe that Okita and Hijikata were like <br/>\nbrothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly <br/>\nrelationship with. Yamanami&#39;s seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was an <br/>\nextremely painful incident in Okita&#39;s short life. (Mori, p.78) There is no record showing <br/>\nthat Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got along with <br/>\nHijikata.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and also served as a <br/>\nkenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be <br/>\nthe fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana called Kikuichi-<br/>\nmonji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a wakizashi) and <br/>\nhis so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo instead. (Oji, 96)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath<br/>\nDuring the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of Keiou 4, Okita went <br/>\ninto Matsumoto Ryoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a guesthouse <br/>\nwith Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces (including <br/>\nthe Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region, Okita remained in <br/>\nEdo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May 30th), 1868. Later <br/>\nthat night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present Tokyo), under his birth name <br/>\n(with Okita Souji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is not open to the <br/>\npublic. (Oji, p.252)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that he was born <br/>\nin 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in 1868 (or on a <br/>\nlesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and therefore was <br/>\n25 by Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTrivia<br/>\nIt is historical accurate that Okita loved children. During his time in Kyoto, he was often <br/>\nseen playing with children and was a baby-sitter to Yagi&#39;s sons in Mibu. (Oji, p.100)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was not particularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved sweets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from being treated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku (medicine for <br/>\nenervation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with Ishida Sanyaku for <br/>\ntreating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has not been any evidence of an Okita photograph.<br/>\n<br/>\nReferences<br/>\n\t? \tMori, Makiko. Okita Soji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999.<br/>\n\t? \tOji, Kazuko. Walking with Okita Soji. Tokyo: Shin Chosha, 2003.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita in Fiction<br/>\nIt is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with historical data about him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita is briefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga series Rurouni Kenshin, which <br/>\ntakes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. A character later on in the <br/>\nseries, Seta S?jir?, was based on the Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi Keppuroku (and <br/>\ntherefore, darker than the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in the anime/manga <br/>\nPeacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an episode of the anime <br/>\nGS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about the <br/>\nBakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only of killing <br/>\npeople (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the show&#39;s rendition of <br/>\nHijikata.) Okita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru, which is a fictional <br/>\nstory about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (where Okita trains a <br/>\nyoung girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her father and older brother.) He is also <br/>\ndepicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/manga series Shura no Toki, <br/>\nOkita&#39;s (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with a warrior from the <br/>\nMutsu, a clan that supposedly practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a request from <br/>\nOkita himself from years before.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man (sometimes a <br/>\nbish?nen). The Latin American dub of Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook Okita for a <br/>\nwoman, and the Hijikata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the fangirls of <br/>\nPeacemaker Kurogane.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a flashback and as a <br/>\npossible ghost), Okita&#39;s (obviously) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an equally-obviously <br/>\nfictional unnamed wife) is one of the three main characters of the series.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are also very similar to the <br/>\ncharacter Ukyo Tachibana from the video game series Samurai Shodown.</div>",

Many of us here who have written<br/>\n&gt; articles for the website, also use historical references extensively,<br/>\n&gt; please see this article as an example:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis and Okita Soujiro<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; see how if a quote or detail is taken from a book...the exact<br/>\n&gt; book/author and page number are noted OR the author is mentioned in<br/>\n&gt; the text.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t misunderstand me,  I was only commenting on the Okita article (http://<br/>\nwww.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm) I understand that you also use historical <br/>\nreferences, but please double check whether your own information is correct when there&#39;s <br/>\nconflicting info. (I believe some mistakes to be human errors or/and typos.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, make sure your &quot;historical references&quot; are actually in the history section and are not <br/>\ncategorized as (historical) fiction. For example, many regard the trilogy by Shimozawa Kan <br/>\nas &quot;historical references&quot; but in fact, his Shinsengumi books are categorized as (historical) <br/>\nfiction. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and about Okita&#39;s birthday<br/>\n&gt; have you seen his updated page?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was NOT talking about his birthday earlier today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nquote from www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm<br/>\n&quot;Born in Tenpou 13 (1844) (some say Tenpou15)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was saying that Tenpou 13 = 1842 (not 1844.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but imagine this:<br/>\n&gt; (visitor to Okita page) &quot;wow lots of cool info from nlf7---but which<br/>\n&gt; book did that detail come from?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; we cannot tell people to just &quot;believe us&quot; just because we can post a<br/>\n&gt; website on the internet---we want to give people the tools to learn on<br/>\n&gt; their own<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve already given you a list of books.  However, I haven&#39;t used quotes in regard of the <br/>\nShinsengumi. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, almost all the books/chapters in regard of Okita contain this (rather basic) <br/>\ninformation. For example, <br/>\n<br/>\nMori, Makiko.  Okita Soji Feature (Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999)<br/>\nOji, Kazuko. Walking with Okita Soji  (Tokyo: Shin Chosha, 2003)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I hope you can head up the Okita Team if you have the time and<br/>\n&gt; get in touch with other mailing list members and put your fabulous<br/>\n&gt; minds together.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d rather &quot;chat&quot; on the Okita Soji discussion page at Wikipedia.  I understand that some <br/>\nfans of the Shinsengumi/Okita don&#39;t have access to SHQ nor want to join it. (To tell you <br/>\nthe truth, it took me a while before I decided to join this group.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, I suggest that we merge the Okita Soji article at Wikipedia and the Okita article <br/>\nat SHQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been keeping an eye on all the Shinsengumi articles at Wikipedia since March.  It&#39;s true <br/>\nthat anyone could edit or delete information at Wikipedia and I had a problem with it when <br/>\nI started editting the articles (as all could see on my talk page.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, the Wikipedia&#39;s linked to library networks so improving articles at  at <br/>\nWikipedia is certainly more than worthwhile. (At least, that&#39;s what I tell myself when I feel <br/>\nlike giving up.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAs anyone could see from the history of every article on the Shinsengumi, I&#39;ve done many <br/>\ncorrections and whenever there was any conflicting info, my version would always end up <br/>\non top (since my edits could be backed up with research and historical references.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, Ito and Todo don&#39;t have their own articles yet and the new Inoue and <br/>\nTakeda articles need  a lot of help.  (I&#39;ve done most research on the members of the <br/>\nShieikan so I could only write more about Inoue when I get the chance.)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Seven</div>",
