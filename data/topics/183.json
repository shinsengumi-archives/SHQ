            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1749923501\">yeah, sometimes the most simple truths are hard to grasp.<br/>\nI read in a book that talks about the origin of &quot;bu&quot; from Chinese and<br/>\nexplains how things were done in imperial China.  People who<br/>\nrepresented &quot;Bu&quot;, warriors were placed nearly at the same level as<br/>\nthose who represented &quot;Boon&quot; that is the thinkers/advisors. Boon&Bu<br/>\nare &quot;supposed&quot; to assist the leader in making decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany books out there will as you mentioned give the definition to<br/>\nbushido as &quot;the way a samurai is supposed to conduct himself&quot; perhaps<br/>\nthis is due to the elaboration of the meaning during the Tokugawa<br/>\nperiod when things were ~relatively~ peaceful---and there was a need<br/>\nto redefine their roles?  During the Tokugawa many samurai added more<br/>\n&quot;peaceful&quot; aspects to their way of life right (popularity of zen,<br/>\ncalligraphy, and flower arrangement &lt;- this one still shocks me but I<br/>\ndefinately read this in a book on samurai!)?  So for non practitioners<br/>\nwho just read anything that comes our way the definition of bushido<br/>\nitself is far removed from its origins (99.9% of the writers do not<br/>\npractice martial arts and therefore can&#39;t tap into the warrior aspect<br/>\nof the samurai).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you guys have a chance, join e-budo.com and read the posts to get<br/>\nan idea of what others are thinking and there are some really<br/>\nknowledgeable posters some of whom have all these characteristics<br/>\n1)know the language 2)research 3)practice martial arts (some for<br/>\nseveral decades).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite post is &quot;Rural swordsmen beat urban &quot;Zen&quot; swordsmen&quot; which<br/>\nreminds me of Kondo and company moving into Kyoto :)<br/>\nE-Budo.com &gt; Koryu Bujutsu &gt; Sword Arts &gt; Rural swordsmen beat urban<br/>\n&quot;Zen&quot; swordsmen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.e-budo.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?s=2ae32c79ca36fe0c19b56ae7bbdfda37&threadid=22266&highlight=Rural+swordsmen+beat\">http://www.e-budo.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?s=2ae32c79ca36fe0c19b56ae7bbdfda37&threadid=22266&highlight=Rural+swordsmen+beat</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Mesina&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; These are just some thoughts I wanted to share since it relates to<br/>\nthe samurai in general.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This whole week i&#39;ve been attending a seminar for Suio Ryu headed by<br/>\nthe headmaster who came from Japan.
