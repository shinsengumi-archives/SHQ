Photos of <br/>\nthe fire and earthquake disasters in Tokyo and drawings of <br/>\nuniforms,medals, hats and western style sabres.  Interestingly, <br/>\nthere seems to be a couple of drawings of what looked <br/>\nlike &quot;Rokumeikan&quot; scenes....hmmm I figure police officials attended <br/>\nthose dances as well.  As you guys know from my previous posts the <br/>\nTMPD had guys in the Imperial Guard which escorted members of the <br/>\nroyal family from point A to point B.  There were plenty of <br/>\nentourage photos.  Many of the drawings we&#39;ve seen are 100% accurate <br/>\ndown to the uniforms of the security on horseback.  The book even <br/>\nincluded a side by side comparison of hand drawings and photos.  The <br/>\ndrawings were able to show alot of detail compared to the grainy <br/>\nphotos. One interesting photo of a cop trying to hold back dozens of <br/>\nrioters I think.  Lots of stuff on the different buildings and <br/>\nheadquarters.  Humorous drawing of a cop shining a light on a group <br/>\nof people.  Some people were &quot;evil&quot;, they had smirking animal-like <br/>\nfaces, while some were &quot;good&quot;, they were 100% human.<br/>\n<br/>\nSerious Business Stuff....<br/>\nGIRLS OF THE SHINSENGUMI FANART CONTEST<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/contest.htm\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/contest.htm</a></div>",
