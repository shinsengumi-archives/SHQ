            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-182822629\">Miss B how could you miss this one...<br/>\nTHE BACHELOR: Hijikata ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep mentioning that Mamoru Oshii&#39;s (famous for Ghost in the Shell)<br/>\nJin Roh: The Wolf Brigade is influenced by the Shinsengumi...now I<br/>\nhave even more proof.  Mamoru Oshii also made a film called Jigoku no<br/>\nbanken: kerubersu (1991) or Stray Dog: Kerberos Panzer Cops (USA<br/>\nrelease 2003) (actually made in 1991)I think Kerberos is a corruption<br/>\nof Cerberus the 3 headed dog of the underworld.  It can be categorized<br/>\nas an art film and it is not for everyone.  &quot;Stray Dog&quot; is almost a<br/>\nlive action verson of &quot;Jin Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot; (easy to find in the<br/>\nU.S.) but with a totally different storyline.  Same group of guys<br/>\n(with armor and night vision capabilities) but this time it is about 2<br/>\nsurviving members of Kerberos.  One was a prisoner for 3 years, I&#39;ll<br/>\ncall him Mr. A, and the stock phrase &quot;best behavior&quot; was in the<br/>\nsubtitles...one escapes to China.  Most of the movie takes place on a<br/>\nshrimp farm in China as the subordinate officer tries to understand<br/>\nhis former superior officer (commander of the Kerberos Group) let&#39;s<br/>\ncall him Mr. B.  Mr. A receives a deal from the government to track<br/>\ndown Mr. B so Mr. A is working for the new government on an informal<br/>\nbasis.  The movie makes a bid deal about &quot;dogs&quot; and their value in<br/>\nsociety and their role to their masters (Jin Roh replaces dogs with<br/>\nwolves)...and how dogs are used and discarded.  The movie contains<br/>\nflash backs, during the end of the Kerberos force, Mr. A is abandoned<br/>\nby his commander Mr. B.(this is the source of confusion for Mr. A).<br/>\nNow after the government is established both Mr. A and Mr. B have lost<br/>\nall direction in life.  Kerberos and Jin Roh are without a doubt a<br/>\nsynthesis of Shinsengumi history and not any other group because of<br/>\nthe emphasis on the end of an era and noticeably in Kerberos the<br/>\nbringing together of various stary dogs (ronin?), giving them the best<br/>\nequipment money can buy and organizing them into small units (namely<br/>\n1,2,3).  Kerberos and Jin Roh are not armies they are a special task<br/>\nforce of the police department thus there is no basis for connecting<br/>\nthem to let&#39;s say the Satsuma samurai now known to the west as the<br/>\nLast Samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nQUOTES FROM THE MOVIE...(and ummm some of it will sound very familar)<br/>\n&quot;The riots were over and became just a part of history.  The<br/>\ngovernment officials had completely oppressed and annihilated the<br/>\nopposition.  However, this lead to another battle against the elite<br/>\nsecurity unit that is known as &quot;kerberos&quot; who refused the order from<br/>\ntheir officials to disband. It created a symbolic figure at the end of<br/>\nthis age.  It was a rebellion of watch dogs who had lost their<br/>\nmasters.  People called it the Kerberos Uprising.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still human inside even though I was trained to be a dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe ability to &quot;smell&quot; comrades and find them<br/>\n<br/>\ndesire to choose a master to be faithful to...&quot;like a nation or a thought&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I wish we both could find masters who we won&#39;t regret&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They(watch dogs) will never know the reason why their master had to<br/>\ndump them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m going to talk about and impressive but tragic story about a dog<br/>\nwho is looking for his master and his future.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are many reasons why masters dump their dogs...you can even<br/>\ncall it a historical necessity.  No matter how unreasonable it may<br/>\nsound the dog has to pay for any misfortuneon his own even if he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand the reason why.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHero/main character got out of jail fast because &quot;given a separate<br/>\ntrial and was a well-behaved model prisoner.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;the time when dogs will disappear from this country will come...Even<br/>\nif your membory of the time you were a dog fills your hear with<br/>\nexcitement humans have to live only as humans.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[I have screenshots from this film and will put them side by side with<br/>\n Jin Roh and will probably go all crazy and do a write up for<br/>\nSHQ...even though I have to finish other stuff ^_^]<br/>\n<br/>\nI watch Onmyoji (recommend by unsafesects I think) and it is from the<br/>\ndirector of Mibu Gishi Den (When the Last Sword is Drawn)...decent<br/>\nfilm about the sorcerer Seibei who lived during the Heian era AND HE<br/>\nWAS A REAL PERSON!!!!  I watched the extras and found the extras to be<br/>\nvery cool because the guy who portrays seibei, a kyogen actor(?), had<br/>\nto go to Seibei&#39;s shrine in Kyoto (built at the location of his.<br/>\nSeibei&#39;s house).  The actor in the extras and in the movie talks about<br/>\nthe significance of names for spells and how names ARE spells.  He<br/>\nsaid &quot;when I get tired of myself I can/will just change my name&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to finish off my marathon movie watching weekend my new copy of<br/>\nTwilight Samurai arrived.  If Mibu Gishi Den is about what was going<br/>\non in Kyoto then Twilight Samurai deals with what was happening in the<br/>\n countryside during the exact same time period.  The 2 fight scenes in<br/>\nTwilight Samurai are ~masterful~ (and I wish Mibu Gishi Den had more<br/>\nof these scenes!) and the movie gets and A+ from me for great story,<br/>\ncinematography and acting.  The film will touch on the koku rice<br/>\nsystem, famine, the escalating violence in Kyoto, the hardship of<br/>\nronin, the representation system in Edo (where retainers hardly meet<br/>\ntheir lords) and low ranking samurai.  The domain in which the movie<br/>\ntakes place was pro shogunate and close to Aizu (heroine was supposed<br/>\nto marry a retainer in Aizu)...and well you can kind of guess the<br/>\nending.  This film is not an epic it is like Mibu Gishi Den a very<br/>\ngood drama.  Twilight Samurai is a must see because it will allow us<br/>\nto better understand the demographics in the Shinsengumi not everyone<br/>\nwas from a high ranking samurai family e.g. Saitou.</div>",
