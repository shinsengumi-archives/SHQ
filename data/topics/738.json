He was recruited to travel to Edo, modern day Tokyo, to assist the Lord Nariakira. He was later put in command of over fifty thousand samurai, a large part of the imperial army. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a leader of the Imperial forces in the Boshin War, Saigo was one of the key figures in the Meiji Restoration. In spite of his humble background, he became the state councilor and army general of the new state. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaigo disagreed with the modernization of Japan and the opening of commerce with the West. He did insist, however, that Japan should try to annex Korea before the West realized that country&#39;s potential. Because the other leaders of the restoration strongly opposed these plans, Saigo resigned and returned to his hometown of Kagoshima. <br/>\n<br/>\n Shortly thereafter, he established a private academy in Kagoshima for the faithful samurai that had also resigned their posts in order follow him from Tokyo. In 1877, led by Saigo, they revolted against the central government, which had just eliminated their rice stipends. The imperial palace had recruited new guards who were nothing more than glorified rice peasants and armed them with modern weapons. The samurai, also being equipped with modern weapons, were able to seriously challenge the imperial army in battle for several months. Badly injured in hip during the fierce battle, instead of being killed or captured by the enemy, Saigo asked for his head to be cut off by a comrade to preserve his honor. Legend and art show that Saigo committed seppuku a traditional form of suicide before this, though autopsy and the original historical records deny this. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany legends sprung up concerning Saigo, many of which denied his death. Many people in Japan expected him to return from India or China or to sail back with Russia&#39;s crown prince to overthrow injustice. Unable to overcome the affection that that the people had for this hero of tradition, the Meiji govenment recognized his bravery and pardoned him posthumously on February 22, 1889. <br/>\n<br/>\nA famous statue of Saigo walking his dog stands in Ueno Park, Tokyo. Saigo&#39;s last stand against the Meiji government was the historical basis for the 2003 film The Last Samurai. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThe Last Samurai<br/>\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPromotional poster<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Last Samurai is a film released in the United States on December 5, 2003. It is set in the 1870s in Japan and stars: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n   Tom Cruise as   Nathan Algren, an American Civil   War veteran   <br/>\n   Ken   Watanabe as samurai lord   Katsumoto   <br/>\n   Masato   Harada as industrialist and pro-reform politician Omura   <br/>\n   Shichinosuke   Nakamura as Emperor   Meiji   <br/>\n   Hiroyuki   Sanada as Ujio, one of the most dedicated and viscous samurai.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral information<br/>\nThe film&#39;s plot is loosely based on the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion led by Saigo Takamori, and also on the story of Jules Brunet, a French army captain who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the Boshin War. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlgren goes to Japan to help the new Meiji government train its first Western-style army. He leads the army into battle against Katsumoto&#39;s men, is routed and captured, and learns the way of the samurai from his imprisonment in Katsumoto&#39;s isolated village. The movie&#39;s climax occurs as a rebel cavalry charge is stopped by Gatling guns. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough many of the film&#39;s cast members are Japanese, the production crew is entirely American, and most of the movie was filmed in New Zealand. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Jules Brunet<br/>\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. <br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Jules Brunet was a member of the first French military mission to be sent to Japan in order to help modernize the armies of the shogunate. He was a graduate of the �cole Polytechnique, and he specialized in artillery. He arrived in Yokohama in the beginning of 1867. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mission was able to train the Shogun&#39;s army for a little more than one year, before the Shogunate lost to the Imperial forces in 1868 in the Boshin War. The French military mission was then ordered to leave Japan by Imperial decree. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Jules Brunet chose to remain. He resigned from the French army, and left for the North of Japan with the remains of the Shogunate&#39;s armies in the hope of staging a counter-attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nJules Brunet helped set up the Ezo Republic, with the leader of the Japanese shogunate&#39;s navy, Admiral Enomoto Takeaki, as the President. The final stand occurred in the northern island of Hokkaido, in the city of Hakodate, where in June 1869 the shogunate forces lost a final battle between 800 shogunate soldiers and an 8000-strong Imperial army. <br/>\n<br/>\nJules Brunet was sent back to France for trial. He was quickly rehabilitated by the time of the war between France and Prussia in 1870, and later rose to the position of Chief of Staff of the French army (&quot;Chef d&#39;Etat Major&quot;) under the Minister of War Chanoine (curiously, his superior officer at the French Military mission when he was in Japan) 30 years later in 1898. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee also: The Last Samurai <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

So here I&#39;m...<br/>\nHonestly Barbara, I share your opinion about Okubo and Omura. It seems to me that they have &#39;melt&#39; Okubo in Omura.<br/>\nPersonally I didn&#39;t like the movie, and I a disagree with many things in it, but then again, you need to twist history a bit when you are doing a film, or otherwise it might bee too gory, too boring (or not... some periods were really a rollcoaster) and even too unbelievable (sometimes reality surpasses fiction). Look at the &#39;The Alamo&#39; movie...<br/>\nI thought immediately about the Seinan wars and Saigo. it&#39;s almost the same time period, a similar conflict, and Saigo also died committing seppuku according to popular belief, though the circumstances were different. He also was kept in high esteem by general public and his popularity was so great that the Meiji government had to grant him a posthumous pardon. In fact, he is even enshrined... Some details of the movie fitted too well into this picture, especially concerning the characters, to be merely fiction, though you can say it&#39;s a story loosely based on real events, and as such, you cannot say it is &#39;real&#39; in the depiction of events.<br/>\nI like the ending of the last battle scene though, it had an emotive touch, and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what would have felt Algren at this point, when the respect of the victor over the defeated is so painfully obvious, and in such stark contrast with his experiences fighting the Indians. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From:   Barbara Sheridan <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 8:45 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re The Last Samurai   (Possible Spoilers)<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nI _still_ wish the Saitou-like Ujio (Katsumoto&#39;s &quot;right   hand man&quot; would <br/>\nhave said something like  &quot;If you did not make us   take up arms with the <br/>\nChoshu we wouldn&#39;t be in this   mess.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Sorry, Barb...

I don&#39;t care how<br/>\nmuch vengeance he may have felt towards Satsuma... I cannot help but<br/>\nwonder what it felt for someone with his rich samurai background to<br/>\nuse a gun against other samurai.  I was beginning to think to myself<br/>\nit was a good thing if he had feelings of revenge... it probably kept<br/>\nhim sane.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***but samurai were using guns against samurai for a couple hundred<br/>\nyears prior to Saitou&#39;s time (I know this because the present day<br/>\ncountry Thailand exported gunpowder to medieval China/Japan).  It was<br/>\njust a whole lot more practical to keep swords on one&#39;s person than a<br/>\nrifle...ofcourse the way of the sword offered more than just<br/>\nself-defense there was a whole spiritual dimension to it as<br/>\nwell...samurai were ultimately pragmatists when it came to battlefield<br/>\ntactics.<br/>\n~No~ doubt he wanted revenge but here is something to consider...his<br/>\nfirst son was hardly 2 years old...becoming a father can really make<br/>\none&#39;s life complicated...as someone with an insane amount of<br/>\nbattlefield experience (I&#39;m still babelfishing his chronology line by<br/>\nline---the man did not know when to quit) Fujita Goro understood very<br/>\nwell there was a 50/50 chance he would get killed or maimed...I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink he wanted to &quot;abandon&quot; his own son by getting killed...he, as<br/>\nwell as anyone in that era would&#39;ve seen alot of orphaned children I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think he would want his son to be fatherless.<br/>\nNote, in Remember Aizu it is mentioned that former Aizu men<br/>\nvolunteered to go to fight against the Satsuma rebels...however Fujita<br/>\nGoro was already a policeman and the police were ordered to go fight<br/>\n(the police were merely another branch of the military)...Toshiyoshi<br/>\nKawaji was himself from Satsuma! and he had to order his own police to<br/>\ngo put down this rebellion....so its a toss up as to whether Fujita<br/>\nGoro either volunteered to go or he was ordered to go fight in this war.<br/>\n<br/>\n[somewhat related nonsense speculating from me again]<br/>\nsome of us chatted at shinsengumimb.com and kicked around the idea<br/>\nthat he was an adrenaline junkie.  Let&#39;s elaborate...he may&#39;ve had a<br/>\ndeathwish of some sort to begin with sometimes the fish says he<br/>\n&quot;meant/meaning&quot; to die at Buddha Hall, as I&#39;m sure the 13-20 guys who<br/>\nwere there with them...but he didn&#39;t...at Buddha Hall I believe they<br/>\ncould not draw enough attention from the gov. troops which were merely<br/>\ninterested in making through the mountain pass as fast as possible to<br/>\nget to the castle/town (and they were smart enough not to get<br/>\ndistracted by a small group which intended to harass them)...so he was<br/>\n-resigned- to death already.  The idea that &quot;I was supposed to die<br/>\nmuch earlier&quot; may have been on his mind (recall old survivor&#39;s guilt<br/>\ndiscussion)...I don&#39;t think he was an adrenaline junkie because people<br/>\nback then had very different lifestyles than we do today (they killed<br/>\ntheir own food sometimes built their own homes and many grew up in<br/>\nrural communities and lived off the land)...in fact people who don&#39;t<br/>\nusually face physical hardship tend to be adrenaline junkies (e.g.<br/>\noffice worker/college student become weekend warriors/atheletes to get<br/>\ntheir dose of physical exertion/adrenaline).  I also mentioned the<br/>\nunique experience of battle...related to adrenaline...the heightened<br/>\nperception and mind/body alignment needed to survive...but again at<br/>\nthis point in his life his sense of responsibility as a father would<br/>\nhave came first IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also somewhat curious now as to what kind of firearm Saitou<br/>\nmight&#39;ve used... I know next to nothing about gun history, but I was<br/>\nsurprised to see them apparently loading shot (or maybe it was single<br/>\ncartridges) during the first training scenes.  Too slow to face a<br/>\nsamurai with, surely.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***it is possible to figure out what firearms were used its just there<br/>\nmay not be books in English for us...the group photo shows their<br/>\nrifles (an expert on the American Civil War weaponry even which zooms<br/>\nin on the image would be able to help us I guess---they may have used<br/>\nolder model guns just because it may have been more affordable for the<br/>\ngov.)...yes the Satsuma samurai fought effectively enough for Kawaji<br/>\nto later write an essay saying that policemen should continue to hone<br/>\ntheir sword skills because the sword was still an important weapon in<br/>\nthis rebellion...I&#39;ve seen the western sabres from that exact time<br/>\nperiod, online and it was just plain common sense for Fujita Goro and<br/>\nhis comrades to request the use of katanas...the sabre handle only<br/>\nallows one to wield it with one hand...western sabres were also much<br/>\nshorter.  One look at those sabres and men who were trained in<br/>\nkenjutsu may have said &quot;no way I&#39;m going into battle with an weapon<br/>\nI&#39;m not used to wielding&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like I remember hearing somewhere that *reliable* repeating<br/>\nrifles were only coming into wider use around then.  Did the Americans<br/>\nindeed negotiate with the Meiji government some kind of trade deal<br/>\nthat included more sophisticated weaponry?<br/>\n<br/>\n***from studying Thailand, I know that there are many resources which<br/>\nwould clearly reveal this...trade agreements are very well documented<br/>\nbut boring to read...Phil you are asking for serious library research :P </span></blockquote></div>",

Note as seen in<br/>\nMibugishiden when HIjikata yells to his men to use their swords at<br/>\nclose range---that was common sense to me too (use guns in an ambush<br/>\nand use swords to &quot;finish off&quot; the enemy).  Nakajima Nobori (who<br/>\nshould at least be the background of PMK---I insist!) also painted a<br/>\nportrait of one of the older members of the Shinsengumi manning a<br/>\ncannon.  I believe one of the Japanese websites also lists a member of<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi who taught gunnery.  Well, the group photo of Fujita<br/>\nGoro shows him with a rifle.  So he must&#39;ve been knowledgeable of its<br/>\nuse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of Aizu...it was just outdated cannons vs. &quot;newer&quot; government<br/>\ncannons so when it came down to it---it was about the money.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2036820864\">For various reasons, I missed this film when it was released in theatres.  Because of that, I&#39;ve ignored posts here and elsewhere that talked about the film while I waited to see it for myself, so I have no idea what others have said and apologize if I&#39;m only repeating the obvious.  To cheer me up, my husband bought me a copy when it came out last Tuesday on DVD.  I finally got to it tonight.  Cheer me up?  Ha!!  I&#39;m still friggin&#39; crying while I write this...<br/>\n <br/>\nNo use asking me about anything technical about the film.  I wasn&#39;t even paying attention to things like acting, plot, choreography, blah, blah, blah.  I was too busy absorbing the atmosphere... to be able to get away from the anime environment and vicariously step into a world I could almost touch, smell, taste.  A scene opens onto the streets of Meiji Yokohama and I&#39;m immediately imagining Saitou walking there.  We watch as Algren trains conscripts... how clumsy and slow they are at first... how hastily and sloppily they were being trained... how unready to march on samurai.  I&#39;m sitting there wondering what kind of training Saitou went through before being sent into the Seinan War... having to adapt to things foreign to him as a samurai.  The last battle nearly destroyed me emotionally... by now I&#39;m seeing Saitou on both sides --- the proud samurai defending Aizu against impossible odds and probable annihilation and the Meiji soldier putting down a rebellion.  I don&#39;t care how<br/>\n much vengeance he may have felt towards Satsuma... I cannot help but wonder what it felt for someone with his rich samurai background to use a gun against other samurai.  I was beginning to think to myself it was a good thing if he had feelings of revenge... it probably kept him sane.  When Omura&#39;s second-in-command demands the gunners stop firing the Gatling guns, removes his hat and kneels... the look of pain on his face says so much. (Uh... I lost count of how many times I physically jumped when a gun was fired... it really bothered me.)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s stupid... I&#39;m full of thoughts and yet speechless.  :-D  One comment at the very beginning, as Algren is crossing the ocean to Japan, struck me immediately and made me think of RK Saitou from the start... about having to accept the hard truth that being hired to suppress another rebel may be the only work he was suited for.  I&#39;ve often thought about that idea in regards to RK Saitou and how he might feel about it.<br/>\n <br/>\nGuess I&#39;ll do some reading up on the film tomorrow... I&#39;m curious as to how much, if any of it, is fact or if the characters were only meant to represent the history.  I got the impression that Katsumoto was meant to represent Saigou (though he was too noble to be Saigou for me) and his rebellion the Seinan War.  Whether they intended it or not, that&#39;s exactly what my mind said I was watching.  I&#39;m also somewhat curious now as to what kind of firearm Saitou might&#39;ve used... I know next to nothing about gun history, but I was surprised to see them apparently loading shot (or maybe it was single cartridges) during the first training scenes.  Too slow to face a samurai with, surely.  It seems like I remember hearing somewhere that *reliable* repeating rifles were only coming into wider use around then.  Did the Americans indeed negotiate with the Meiji government some kind of trade deal that included more sophisticated weaponry?<br/>\n <br/>\nWhether the film was good or bad from a technical or strictly historical viewpoint, it certainly made things real for me and is making me re-think some things.  And, honestly, I really didn&#39;t need more reason to feel how painful this time was in Japanese history.<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (who thinks Katsumoto should&#39;ve slapped some sense into the emperor when he had the chance... sorry, Barb... I just couldn&#39;t feel sorry for Meiji even knowing he was stuck between a rock and a hard place)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
