Will scan soon, but all I <br/>\nhave to say is WOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nKondou- Ferocious, muscular, young but not too young...utterly cool in <br/>\narmor.<br/>\nHijikata- A lot like Kondou but more handsome in his own way.<br/>\nOkita- NOT a pretty boy, for once, though he is kinda childlike.<br/>\nHarada- HUGE guy with a HUGE sword and a HUGE spear.<br/>\nMatsubara- Usually nonexistent in other depictions, this time you see him in <br/>\naction with his naginata.<br/>\nInoue- Kinda weird-looking, but he&#39;s important.<br/>\nYamazaki- NOT a ninja, for once! Seems to like playing &quot;go&quot; with Shimada.<br/>\nShimada- Like Harada, a HUGE guy with a HUGE sword. The ending of the <br/>\nIkedaya attack is at the start of the manga, and maaaaaan...<br/>\nNagakura- Perpetually smoking a Japanese-style metal pipe, even when he <br/>\nfights! Really cool sideburns, too...and he&#39;s not an uber-chibi short guy!<br/>\nSaitou- Dark, brooding type with a scar on his left cheek.<br/>\nYamanami- Looks like he&#39;s about to cry most of the time, but still rather <br/>\nhandsome.<br/>\nSasaki Tadasaburo and the Mimawarigumi-- These guys make me think we were <br/>\nright in our guess...a turf war is a HUGE factor in this volume. Oh, and why <br/>\ndo all the Mimawarigumi guys look alike, I wonder?<br/>\nThere&#39;s also an Aizu retainer named &quot;Shiba&quot; something...<br/>\n<br/>\nEach volume&#39;s cover features a key member of the Shinsengumi-- this one had <br/>\nHarada, and inside the jacket flap, has a mini-bio.

Will scan soon, but all I <br/>\nhave to say is WOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nKondou- Ferocious, muscular, young but not too young...utterly cool in <br/>\narmor.<br/>\nHijikata- A lot like Kondou but more handsome in his own way.<br/>\nOkita- NOT a pretty boy, for once, though he is kinda childlike.<br/>\nHarada- HUGE guy with a HUGE sword and a HUGE spear.<br/>\nMatsubara- Usually nonexistent in other depictions, this time you see him in <br/>\naction with his naginata.<br/>\nInoue- Kinda weird-looking, but he&#39;s important.<br/>\nYamazaki- NOT a ninja, for once! Seems to like playing &quot;go&quot; with Shimada.<br/>\nShimada- Like Harada, a HUGE guy with a HUGE sword. The ending of the <br/>\nIkedaya attack is at the start of the manga, and maaaaaan...<br/>\nNagakura- Perpetually smoking a Japanese-style metal pipe, even when he <br/>\nfights! Really cool sideburns, too...and he&#39;s not an uber-chibi short guy!<br/>\nSaitou- Dark, brooding type with a scar on his left cheek.<br/>\nYamanami- Looks like he&#39;s about to cry most of the time, but still rather <br/>\nhandsome.<br/>\nSasaki Tadasaburo and the Mimawarigumi-- These guys make me think we were <br/>\nright in our guess...a turf war is a HUGE factor in this volume.
