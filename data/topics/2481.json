Ninjadojo is a very active community.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you may know there is more than one Dai-bosatsu Toge (based on <br/>\nthe novel of the same name) the most popular and easy to find is the <br/>\none starring Tatsuya Nakadai directed by Kihachi Okamoto...the other <br/>\nversion is called Satan&#39;s Sword directed by Kenji Misumi, which <br/>\nsticks to the novel more which means it will cover more ground <br/>\nduring the Shinsengumi &quot;arc&quot;.  Satan&#39;s Sword is in the process of <br/>\nbeing re-subbed right now and will be sold unofficially.<br/>\n<br/>\nfor our new members the novel (which is SUPER hard to find in <br/>\nEnglish) can be downloaded <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Dai-bosatsu%20Toge/DBT.zip\">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Dai-bosatsu%20Toge/DBT.zip</a><br/>\n6mb<br/>\neven if you don&#39;t have time to read it -now- just please download <br/>\nwhile I can still host the file---when the novel discusses Shimabara <br/>\nthe author kind of goes off on a tangent but he does provide some <br/>\nvaluable info<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nOff-topic<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kurotokagi.com/\">http://www.kurotokagi.com/</a>  (also offers ASSASSINATION--on Kiyokawa <br/>\nHachiro)<br/>\nis selling a film called BURAIKEN (about a bunch of misfits in a <br/>\nkabuki troupe) which is not only rare but one of the most <br/>\nextensively discussed films by western critics<br/>\nI have never purchased a film from kurotokagi--but I will probably <br/>\ndo so just because they offer BURAIKEN</div>",
