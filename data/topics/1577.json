A lecturer is Mr. Tatsu <br/>\nFukumoto who is the posterity of Mr. Otori&#39;s brother. Precious data, <br/>\nsuch as Mr. Otori&#39;s letter (actual thing), are brought, and I was <br/>\nallowed to see them close at hand. About Mr. Otori, only vague career <br/>\n(bony portion) which has appeared in the person file was known until <br/>\nnow. I carry out [ mind as meat was attached luckily this time ]. <br/>\nAlthough it was mainly the contents after Meiji, it is a too <br/>\nattractive person. It is devoted to one thing and respects in &quot;person <br/>\nwho excelled in learning&quot; ÁÄ HONTO. Lecturer reason &quot;Otori is a <br/>\nscientist and is not a military man&#39;s type&quot; -- I also felt so. <br/>\nIn addition, height is as short in stature as 150cm. However, DEKA ³ <br/>\nof the part courage is that it was considerable. It was a lecture <br/>\nmeeting very significant and precious when considering the thing of è<br/>\n&#39;C war, the thing in Goryoukaku, etc.</div>",
