I don&#39;t know personally I think it was rushed, <br/>\nbut I liked it nonetheless.... Somehow though, my favorite character <br/>\nchanged from Susumu to Suzu. I feel so sorry for him... The ending <br/>\ndefinitely gives good way for a second series which might not be too <br/>\nfar off if ADV does license the anime... <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one ever answered my question before whether the Anime started <br/>\nwith the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker or Peacemaker Kurogane manga. <br/>\nI&#39;m just curious because I&#39;d like to see a second season an was <br/>\ncurious what that might contain...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, while watching Hijikata&#39;s interrogation of that store owner, <br/>\nI remembered a few weeks ago I posted a bus tour here in the mailing <br/>\nlist. The reason I did that was because it had very interesting <br/>\nphotos on the Maekawa residence particularly the storehouse where <br/>\nthey did the interrogation of prisoners. The site is in Japanese and <br/>\nI can&#39;t find it in my bookmarks right now... Sorry, I&#39;ll put it up <br/>\nonce I find it. Anyway, the pics are in the location section of the <br/>\nphotos.</div>",
