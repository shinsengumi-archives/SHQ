The torrent is named &quot;NHK Shinsengumi! Drama - Original Soundtrack II&quot; and is currently showing on the first page of the torrent list ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php\">http://d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php</a> ).  If you leave it till later, just type in NHK Shinsengumi in the search field on that page (you don&#39;t have to specify anything else) and it&#39;ll bring up the OST torrents for the drama.  File size is approximately 110MB.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  phil (who practically lives at d-addicts anymore ^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nCelebrate Earth Day everyday!
