Died<br/>\nTaisho 4 (1915), September 28, at age 71.<br/>\n--Hometown: Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo).<br/>\n--Style: Itto-ryu<br/>\n--Original name: Yamaguchi Hajime. Other names: Yamaguchi Jirou,<br/>\nIchinohe Denpachi, Fujita Gorou.<br/>\n--Born into the house of a Shogunal retainer.<br/>\n--Father: Yuusuke. Brother: Hiroaki. Sister: O-Katsu (married Soma<br/>\nYoshiaki, chief physician of the Mito Tokugawa clan).<br/>\n--Family was from Akashi, because his father was an ashigaru (low-rank<br/>\nfoot soldier samurai) of the Akashi han.<br/>\n--Hajime&#39;s father, entrusting family affairs to his younger sister,<br/>\nwent to serve in Edo, earning a small sum and buying stocks for the<br/>\nfamily with it.<br/>\n--In Ansei 5 (1858), Hajime had his genpuku (coming of age ceremony).<br/>\nAfter this, he studied Itto-ryu swordsmanship in the dojo at the Aizu<br/>\nclan&#39;s Edo mansion (despite the many branches of Itto-ryu, Aizu<br/>\nretainers studied Mizoguchi-ha Itto ryu). This kindness of the Aizu<br/>\nclan was brought about by Hajime&#39;s father&#39;s service in Edo (comment:<br/>\nkindness of teaching Itto-ryu to an incredibly low-ranking samurai&#39;s<br/>\nson, I suppose).<br/>\n--At 19, he mistakenly killed a man and was forced to flee from Edo to<br/>\nKyoto.<br/>\n--In Kyoto, he became an assistant instructor (Shihan dai) in<br/>\nYoshida&#39;s Taishi Ryu dojo (probably Yoshida Katsumi of the Shotoku<br/>\nTaishi Ryu). After this, in Bunkyu 3 (1863), he met up with his old<br/>\nfriend Kondou (Isami), who had just arrived in Kyoto with the<br/>\nRoushitai. Before long, Saitou had entered the Shinsengumi.<br/>\n--A very mysterious fellow. Conducted internal spying on possible<br/>\nenemy operatives (i.e. the Itou case), as well as monitoring other<br/>\nintelligence and possible enemy activity.<br/>\n--After the collapse of the Shinsengumi, he stayed for awhile in Aizu,<br/>\nand it&#39;s thought that he was with childhood friends there (from his<br/>\ndays at the Itto-ryu dojo). After the &quot;Restoration&quot;, he worked in the<br/>\nTokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and lived the rest of his life<br/>\nunder the name Fujita Gorou.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStuff about Saitou (originalHajime-san Are-kore- literally<br/>\n&quot;Hajime-san this and that&quot;)<br/>\n\t--Was not a man predisposed to small talk.<br/>\n\t-- According to the testimony of those who knew him, Saitou was tall,<br/>\nand his eyebrows served to accentuate his direct, clear, piercing gaze<br/>\n(comment: the &quot;light shone from his eyes&quot; line). Throughout his life,<br/>\nhe was rather husky, but later on in life, he put on some weight. As<br/>\nfor the remaining portrait of him, his eldest son served as the model.<br/>\nIt&#39;s said that a real photo of him exists in the Shinsengumi<br/>\nHoumotsukan (comment: `Shinsengumi Treasure House&#39;. No idea where this<br/>\nis, but it&#39;s probably the picture that was in the lower area of the<br/>\nphoto of the display with his haori in it).<br/>\n\t--The character of &quot;Saitou&quot; in the manga &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is<br/>\ntremendously different from the real Saitou Hajime. Unfortunately,<br/>\nmany many people think that they are one and the same. This is unfair,<br/>\nand the real Saitou deserves to be known more.<br/>\n\t--There is word that he was left-handed.<br/>\n\t--It&#39;s said that in swordsmanship, he was one of the strongest of the<br/>\nShinsengumi, on par with Okita himself.<br/>\n\t--He went with Itou&#39;s splinter group as a spy for Kondou and<br/>\nHijikata, although there is no evidence to this end (comment: huh?). A<br/>\nsurviving aide of Itou said &quot;Saitou himself stole money in order to<br/>\nsupport a woman.&quot; He believed this even after the Restoraton.<br/>\n\t--Also, after the Restoration, he was known for washing and changing<br/>\nhis underwear (known in the Bakumatsu as a fundoshi) every day,<br/>\nwashing it thoroughly and striking it with both hands to get the<br/>\nwrinkles out and hanging it with a pin.<br/>\n\t--Whenever he sat, he would sit straight up in seiza position, always<br/>\nkeeping aware, so that if attacked he could react instantly.<br/>\n\t--In his later years, he was quiet as always. However, he would<br/>\nsometimes drink sake with his brother in law Morinosuke, as well as<br/>\nYamakawa Hiroshi, and would indignantly lament the evils of the times<br/>\n(comment: Like Hiko Seijuurou in the Rurouni Kenshin OAV: &quot;They are<br/>\nafflictedthe times, and the mind of man&quot;)<br/>\n\t--The name &quot;Fujita Gorou&quot; was granted by Lord Matsudaira Katamori. As<br/>\na result, it was very very important to Saitou.<br/>\n\t--Married Tokio, the eldest daughter of Aizu retainer Takagi<br/>\nKojuurou, in the 7th year of Meiji (1874). At this time, Fujita<br/>\n(Saitou) was 31, and Tokio was 2 years younger than him.<br/>\n\t--In Meiji 7 (1874), Saitou married Tokio, the eldest daughter of<br/>\nAizu retainer Takagi Kojuurou. At this time, Fujita (Saitou) was 31,<br/>\nand Tokio was 2 years younger than him. The lesser go-betweens in the<br/>\nmarriage deal were Yamakawa Hiroshi and Sagawa Kanbee (Aizu chief<br/>\nretainer), and the main go-between was Lord Matsudaira Katamori himself.<br/>\n\t--ChildrenHis eldest son, Tsutomu, was born in Meiji 9 (1876).<br/>\nExtant records show that Tsutomu&#39;s godfather was Yamakawa Hiroshi.<br/>\nSecond son was Tsuyoshi, who spent many years abroad. Tsuyoshi&#39;s wife,<br/>\nYuki, was the granddaughter of Tanaka Tosa. The third son, Tatsuo, was<br/>\nadopted from the Numazawa family, who were relatives of Tokio&#39;s mother.<br/>\n\t--While Saitou was in Aomori (comment: specifically, in the Shimokita<br/>\nPeninsula), before having married Tokio, he married a woman named<br/>\nYaso, who was 4 years older than him.<br/>\n\t--At the Battle of Aizu, Yamamoto Yaeko (sister of Yamamoto Kakuma,<br/>\nand later, the wife of Niishima Jo (famous Japanese Christian and<br/>\nfounder of Doshisha University)) left with Saitou for the front. Yaeko<br/>\nused a rifle, and outdid everyone in &quot;masculine braveness&quot; (?),<br/>\nfighting side by side with the men. She tried cutting off her hair<br/>\nwith her wakizashi (short sword), but (comment: a little weird after<br/>\nthis. Not quite sure what&#39;s going on) it is said that &quot;Takagi<br/>\nMorinosuke&#39;s elder sister Tokio cut her (Yaeko&#39;s) hair&quot;.<br/>\n\t--Around Meiji 23 (1890), Saitou was serving as a police inspector in<br/>\nAzabu (an area in modern Tokyo). There is also record remaining that<br/>\nhe participated in Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department sword<br/>\ncompetitions.<br/>\n\t--Later in life, Fujita (Saitou) and Tokio served together at Tokyo&#39;s<br/>\nJoushi Takashi (Women&#39;s High School, now Ochanomizu University<br/>\n(comment: not sure about the name)). When the school day would be out,<br/>\nhe would be in charge of traffic control for rickshaws. He was also in<br/>\ncharge of finances and general affairs.<br/>\n\t--His favorite sword was the Settsu Juu Ikeda Kishinmaru Kunishige<br/>\n(comment: Not sure about the name).
