Because the maps are color coded and I used <br/>\nthe web pallet thing...we are talking about a bit over 50 maps <br/>\npeople ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\n*The book does not have an isbn you can&#39;t just order a collection of <br/>\nthese war maps anywhere...<br/>\n<br/>\nBook...<br/>\nShinpen Seinan Senshi Fuzushu<br/>\n1977<br/>\n<br/>\n*please get the free adobe acrobat reader because pdf files allow <br/>\nyou to zoom in on text, images and it keeps everything nice and neat<br/>\n<br/>\n*I scanned the book backwards because I thought it would be like <br/>\nmost Japanese books...wrong...so the first maps you see will take <br/>\nplace near the [end] of the war amongst hills and mountain passes <br/>\n(recall the newspaper article which mentions Fujita Goro)...as you <br/>\nprogress towards the beginning of the war you will see how all the <br/>\nfighting was around more populated/urban areas (this is why the <br/>\ngovernment ended up burning people&#39;s homes...more on that in the <br/>\nreport)...to get a good general overview go to map #3 (the maps are <br/>\nnumbered do not use the numbering system in the pdf file---use the <br/>\nnumbers the author actually wrote ON the maps)</div>",
