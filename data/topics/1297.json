It is amazing how much difference there can be between a child who starts school at the youngest age possible for public school entrance and one who is at the other end of that range... and it is only a matter of months.  It would be fascinating to see if being born at the end of the year and suddenly being considered 2 years old when you are only a month old caused problems as adults since they were age-mates with people, like Saitou, who would have been a full year older.  We could start a new reason for people to be troublemakers... look to see when they were born.  :-D<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you, momoiro-usagi, for the details!
