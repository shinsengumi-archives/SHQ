The <br/>\ncustoms of sakayaki began from the Muromachi period. If hair is not <br/>\nshaved when a samurai wears armor, a head is steamed and it is very <br/>\ndangerous.^^;;; <br/>\nPeople of other classes also performed these customs at the Edo <br/>\nperiod. When set to Bakumatsu, it was in fashion not to shave <br/>\nsakayaki among samurais. However, the samurais who value manners <br/>\nshaved sakayaki every morning, and prepared appearance. For them, <br/>\nthe barber came every morning.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMikura and Araki sat on the veranda and were making the barber <br/>\nprepare hair. <br/>\nSaitou and Nagakura absorbed their footstep and approached behind <br/>\nChoshuu spies. <br/>\nSaitou and Nagakura stabbed and killed the back of the spies of <br/>\nChoshuu. <br/>\nMatsui Ryuzaburou, Echigo Saburou, and Matsunaga Kazue who looked at <br/>\nit escaped. <br/>\n(Naturally, they are also the spies of Chosyuu.) <br/>\nAlthough Okita and Toudou pursued spies, they were not able to catch <br/>\nspies. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis incident arose ten days after Serizawa group assassination. <br/>\nTherefore, Serizawa&#39;s assassination was made into what these spies <br/>\nperformed. <br/>\nOf course, the truth is different.^^;;; <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout other spies, I do not know well. <br/>\nThere is an opinion that Saeki Matasaburou was a Choshuu spy. <br/>\nIn the Taiga drama, he became a Shinsengumi member from the domestic <br/>\nof Yagi house, and flattered Serizawa. <br/>\nAnd he was killed by Serizawa by trifling mistake. <br/>\nHe of a historical fact is not related to Yagi house. <br/>\nHe was killed by Serizawa. The reason is not known. <br/>\nSince he stole Serizawa&#39;s important thing, there is an opinion that <br/>\nhe was killed by Serizawa. <br/>\nOr since he raped the girl whom Serizawa wanted, he is said to have <br/>\nbeen killed by Serizawa. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, an opinion completely different from these exists. <br/>\nThere is an opinion that he was the spy who went into Shinsengumi by <br/>\nthe command of Yoshida Toshimaro. <br/>\nAnd since he betrayed Choshuu, he was killed by Yoshida. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not known whether this is a true story. <br/>\nTo the last, it is one of the talks told. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr there is an opinion that Niimi Nishiki was the spy of Choshuu. <br/>\nThis is the opinion which Kimura Sachihiko of Ryozen museum has <br/>\nsaid. <br/>\nRyozen museum is a museum which is exhibiting the articles left by <br/>\nthe departed of Ishin-shishis. <br/>\n(In Shinsengumi relations, many articles left by the departed of <br/>\nShimada Kai exist.) <br/>\nThis museum is located in Kyoto. <br/>\nRyozen shrine which deified Ishin-shishis exists in the <br/>\nneighborhood. <br/>\nFurthermore, the cemetery of Ishi-Shishis, such as Sakamoto Ryoma <br/>\nand Takasugi Shinsaku, exists. <br/>\nKatsura Kogorou built here for Ishin-shishis. <br/>\nAccording to Mr. Kimura&#39;s opinion, Niimi is deified in Ryozen <br/>\nshrine. <br/>\nKatsura deified him here. <br/>\nOnly Ishin-shishis which had a contribution to the Meiji government <br/>\nis deified in this shrine. <br/>\nMr. Kimura thought that Niimi was spying within Shinsengumi by the <br/>\ncommand of Katsura. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this opinion is very much interesting. <br/>\nI think that Choshuu was really fearful enemy for Shinsengumi if <br/>\nthis was true.<br/>\nIt means that Shinsengumi had had an enemy&#39;s spy in one of <br/>\ncaptains....Fear!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is this extent that I know. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi(Did my talk become your reference?)</div>",
