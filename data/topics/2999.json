In 1867, he <br/>\njoined the Shinsengumi with his older brother Tatsunosuke and served as Hijikata <br/>\nToshizou&#39;s page. In 1868,  Tatsunosuke left the Koyochinbutai (the renamed Shinsengumi) <br/>\nafter the battle in Koshu. However, Tetsunosuke decided to stay with the group.  He <br/>\ncontinued to fight in numerous battles (for example, in Aizu, Fukushima, Sendai and <br/>\nHakodate.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Hakodate War, on April 15 (lunar calendar) or May 3 (lunar calendar) 1869, <br/>\nTetsunosuke was instructed by Hijikata to bear his photograph, letter, death poem, <br/>\nkatana, and several strands of his hair to the home of his brother-in-law, Sato Hikogoro, <br/>\nin Hino. <br/>\n<br/>\nTetsunosuke arrived in Hino three months later and stayed at Sato&#39;s house for 2-3 years.  <br/>\nDuring his time in Hino, Tetsunosuke studied kenjutsu and literature(?). Later, <br/>\nTetsunosuke returned home to Ogaki and was reunited with Tatsunosuke.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few theories in regard of Ichimura Tetsunosuke&#39;s death date, while many <br/>\nbelieve that Ichimura joined Saigo Takamori&#39;s army and died during the Satsuma Rebellion <br/>\nin 1877, some believe that he died from an illness in 1873. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe uploaded scans from &quot;Shinsengumi Dokuhon~Taishi Gaiden 2&quot; support the latter <br/>\ntheory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=10\">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=10</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=11&m=s&o=0\">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=11&m=s&o=0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=12&m=s&o=0\">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=12&m=s&o=0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n==========<br/>\nReferences<br/>\n<br/>\nKojima, Masataka.
