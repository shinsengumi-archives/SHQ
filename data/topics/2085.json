            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1616226238\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; This is where I get confused. You say that Sadakichi<br/>\n&gt; was Shusaku&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; brother? But I saw one website that listed him as<br/>\n&gt; his nephew. To make <br/>\n&gt; matters even more confusing, Hillsborough states<br/>\n&gt; that Sadakichi was <br/>\n&gt; the master of one of the &quot;three greatest fencing<br/>\n&gt; schools in Edo&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; Ryoma was the &quot;head&quot; of this school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tama-san explained that better than I :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The problem is that if you look up these two,<br/>\n&gt; Shusaku&#39;s Genbukan Dojo <br/>\n&gt; is listed as one of the &quot;three greatest&quot; in Edo.<br/>\n&gt; [The other two were <br/>\n&gt; Shunzo Momonoi&#39;s Shigakukan Dojo (Kyoshin Meichi<br/>\n&gt; Ryu) and Saito <br/>\n&gt; Yakuro&#39;s Renpeikan Dojo (Shindo Munen Ryu).] <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s right. And sometimes, Iba dojo of<br/>\nShingyoto Ryu is also included in the list, making the<br/>\n&quot;four greatest&quot; in Edo.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, it&#39;s &quot;Shinto Munen&quot;, not &quot;Shindo Munen&quot; :)<br/>\nDang Japanese names :D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This<br/>\n&gt; might fit since <br/>\n&gt; Hillsborough calls the other two dojo by the names<br/>\n&gt; of the <br/>\n&gt; swordmasters rather than their official name. (He<br/>\n&gt; calls <br/>\n&gt; them &quot;Momonoi&quot; and &quot;Saito&quot; schools.) But then Ryoma,<br/>\n&gt; to be &quot;head&quot; <br/>\n&gt; of &quot;Chiba Dojo&quot; would have had to study under<br/>\n&gt; Shusaku rather than <br/>\n&gt; Sadakichi?! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. &quot;Chiba dojo&quot; could either mean Chiba Shusaku&#39;s and<br/>\nChiba Sadakichi&#39;s. Ryoma was the &quot;jukutou&quot;, the &quot;head<br/>\nstudent&quot;, who represented the dojo, but the real<br/>\n&quot;owner&quot; of the dojo, so to speak, was Chiba Sadakichi.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another curious thing, I note that on Serizawa&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; site it is stated <br/>\n&gt; that Yamanami studied at the Genbukan? So it becomes<br/>\n&gt; more likely then <br/>\n&gt; that Ryoma and Yamanami would have known each<br/>\n&gt; other?! Even if it -was-<br/>\n&gt;  another school, they would have met each others<br/>\n&gt; students I would <br/>\n&gt; assume?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As Tama-san did put it, it is possible that they had<br/>\nmet, but not certain, unfortunately. The same goes<br/>\nwith Toudou Heisuke. Likewise, it is possible, but not<br/>\nlikely, that Nagakura met Serizawa before the<br/>\nShinsengumi and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the chrysanthemum dolls that appeared in a<br/>\nprevious post, they are NOT from Bange, AFAIK. Bange<br/>\nis a place next to Aizu Wakamatsu, but not famous by<br/>\nits dolls. The &quot;kikuningyo&quot; is from Nihonmatsu and its<br/>\nneighborhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p133.pcsn.co.jp/~nihonmatsu/kiku.html\">http://p133.pcsn.co.jp/~nihonmatsu/kiku.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nSerizawa Kamo<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.<br/>\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.<br/>\n  I have created over a thousand blades.<br/>\n       Unknown to Death.<br/>\n   Nor known to Life.<br/>\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.<br/>\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.<br/>\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
