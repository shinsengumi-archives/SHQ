            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-359614614\">Ezboard&#39;s shinsengumimb.com is down because ezboard is doing some kind<br/>\nof maintenance...<br/>\n<br/>\n***many of the Japanese boards are discussing newspaper articles, and<br/>\nnovels printed in newspapers.  The mixture of new fiction and articles<br/>\nexamining the group from different angles have caused Shinsengumi<br/>\nenthusiasts to mistaken the novels as revealing new info (posts go<br/>\nsomething like this &quot;I read xxxx in the newspaper novel is this true?<br/>\n I never heard of this before&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n***there was an interesting post that mentions Japanese politicians<br/>\ndiscussing the Shinsengumi on the floor of the Diet or something like that<br/>\n<br/>\n***there is a book out which babelfish translates as &quot;Shinsengumi<br/>\nRevelations&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n***the ladies at 3-hajime.com also write &quot;amateur novels&quot;=fanfiction:)<br/>\nthe most interesting post at 3-hajime.com is about how this one person<br/>\nloves Yamaguchi Jiro/u so I replied trying to ask if she felt that<br/>\nYamaguchi Jiro/u was ~different~ from Saitou or if Yamaguchi Jiro/u<br/>\nwas featured in some manga or anime.  Can it be that there is an<br/>\nentire set of different info (fiction/historical) on Yamaguchi Jiro<br/>\nfor this person to be attracted to him, Yamaguchi J., rather than his<br/>\ntime in the Shinsengumi?  In any case I found it to be fascinating how<br/>\nthe appeal of historical Saitou Hajime comes from the way he<br/>\nlives...that is his 3 &quot;bodies&quot; as babelfish put it (I think they are<br/>\nonly counting S.H, Y.J., and F.G) and leaving out Denpachi Ichinohe.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks interesting...I haven&#39;t had time to babelfish it though<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tamatsukuri.or.jp/shinsen-hp/index.htm\">http://www.tamatsukuri.or.jp/shinsen-hp/index.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJapanese site w/ fanart and flash animation<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members10.tsukaeru.net/mach25/makoto/mein.htm\">http://members10.tsukaeru.net/mach25/makoto/mein.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTheir own fanart of Saitou Hajime<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members10.tsukaeru.net/mach25/makoto/e2/13.htm\">http://members10.tsukaeru.net/mach25/makoto/e2/13.htm</a></div>",
