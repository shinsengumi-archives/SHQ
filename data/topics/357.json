Perhaps he speaks of himself and those he came in contact with in <br/>\nsuch a way that he comes across as a general &quot;nice guy&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I would certainly LOVE to learn more about the Shinsengumi <br/>\nmembers not only during their time in Kyoto but also before and after. <br/>\nMaybe, just maybe the Hillsborough book will give us that. I was able to <br/>\nget his Samurai Sketches through the library and I thought it was very <br/>\nwell done, it&#39;s a definite &quot;have to buy&quot; book on my list.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBarbara Sheridan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barbarasheridan.net\">http://www.barbarasheridan.net</a></div>",
