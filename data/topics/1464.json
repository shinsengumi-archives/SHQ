            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-89638215\">We have several people now playing major roles in the Shinsengumi <br/>\nRPG. However there are still several Captains and other fairly well-<br/>\nknown members who are still available, among them Harada Sanosuke <br/>\n(surprisingly). And so far NO ONE has volunteered to be part of the <br/>\nIshin! Not even a taker from the RK folks for Hitokiri Battousai!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright folks, we know some of you out there have got to want to <br/>\nplay! No need to worry if you&#39;re holding out because you don&#39;t <br/>\nconsider yourself to be &quot;knowledgeable&quot; enough about the Shinsengumi. <br/>\nWe&#39;re not following exact history here. In fact, history has pretty <br/>\nmuch alreay gone out the window! Just the basics you&#39;ve picked up <br/>\nfrom here and by watching RK and PMK will do. That&#39;s really all you <br/>\nneed to know. And the game isn&#39;t all that time consuming either. I&#39;m <br/>\ninvolved with another RPG and I&#39;m not having to devote nearly the <br/>\ntime I originally feared to it. We all have lives to lead off the <br/>\ninternet after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to check out the community later (once the game has <br/>\nstarted, which it has not yet) the url is:<br/>\nhttp:/www.livejournal.com/community/miburo_lair<br/>\n<br/>\nCome on folks! We can&#39;t have all cowboys and no indians! Someone <br/>\nneeds to take on the roles of Katsura, Takasugi, Sakamoto, Saigo, <br/>\nOkubo, the four hitokiri, Yoshida. We&#39;re even accepting Hitokiri <br/>\nBattousai (further proof history has long since been disregarded).<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t anyone want to be the bad guys? Or is that the good guys? LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far the list of taken characters is:<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata - MissBehavin<br/>\nIto - Barb<br/>\nSuzuki (Miki) - Phil<br/>\nSaitou - Angrybee<br/>\nKondou - Wounds<br/>\nOkita - Aurus<br/>\nNagakura - Masayoshi<br/>\nAyunee - Sherlgirl<br/>\nYamanami - Tama<br/>\nTakeda - Sanada<br/>\n<br/>\nAll others are up for grabs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin aka Toshizo Hijikata</div>",
