Much like how the characters used to spell the<br/>\nlast shogun Yoshinobu&#39;s name can be read &quot;Yoshihisa&quot;, &quot;Yoshinobu&quot;, or<br/>\n&quot;Keiki&quot;-- which, as I&#39;ve found in the United States government&#39;s<br/>\ndiplomatic records of that period, confused foreigners to no end.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, despite the fact that that name should be read &quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;,<br/>\nwhat I had said earlier regarding Rintaro Fusamasa still holds true:<br/>\neven though the reading is different, the kanji itself-- read &quot;Fusa&quot;<br/>\nin Rintaro&#39;s case, or &quot;Kane&quot; in Souji&#39;s case-- is the same. Which is<br/>\nsomething in support of what you&#39;ve been saying (as quoted in Mori&#39;s<br/>\nwork) regarding Souji&#39;s closeness to Rintaro Fusamasa. Souji may or<br/>\nmay not have received that kanji from/in honor of Rintaro Fusamasa;<br/>\nhowever, usually in a family, to have two people with the same<br/>\ncharacter in their names is not coincidence. Case in point-- (despite<br/>\nthe fact that in this case, the reading of the character is<br/>\nconsistent) much of the lineage of the Matsudaira lords of Aizu had<br/>\nthe character &quot;Kata&quot; in their names (Katasada, Katanobu, Katamori, and<br/>\nso on).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always, my thanks for your efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",

However, I wanted to comment on your note on the<br/>\n&gt; Okita Rintaro page at Wikipedia.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;However, with a family clan name &quot;Fujiwara&quot;, this &quot;Fujiwara no<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mototsune&quot; would have shared an identical pronunciation with Fujiwara<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no Mototsune (836-891). Wouldn&#39;t a 19th century Japanese man avoid a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;name like that? If this Inoue Rintaro was born with the formal given<br/>\n&gt; &gt;name/middle name &quot;Motosune,&quot; wouldn&#39;t he have also changed it when he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;changed his name to Okita Rintaro?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If he received the formal name &quot;Mototsune&quot;, it would probably either<br/>\n&gt; be in honor of that ancestor, or a coincidence. After all, the two<br/>\n&gt; names are written with different characters, though they&#39;re pronounced<br/>\n&gt; the same-- so there wouldn&#39;t be a pressing reason to avoid use of the<br/>\n&gt; name.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, on a purely linguistic basis, the name still would be read<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Mototsune&quot;. To pronounce it &quot;Gentsune&quot; would be, at best, irregular,<br/>\n&gt; as that makes it half &quot;on-yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese reading) and half<br/>\n&gt; &quot;kun-yomi&quot; (Japanese reading).
