Which include:<br/>\n1) Shinsengumi parades/cosplay<br/>\n2) &quot;Who wants to be SAitou contest&quot; (no detail on how to win this contest)<br/>\n* The event will have Shinsengumi club members from all over Japan in<br/>\nattendance and ofcourse the Aizu chapter will be doing alot of the work<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not clear which photograph, or if these are *new* photos. <br/>\nPerhaps it is the photo printed in a magazine earlier this year of a<br/>\nvery old Fujita Goro at Tsuyoshi&#39;s (second son) wedding/engagement.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nGoro&#39;s time at Aomori (Northern Japan) after the defeat of the Aizu<br/>\ndomain still remains a mystery.  To read the sketchy details we have<br/>\nand see a timeline go to the &quot;FILES&quot; section and open the &quot;SAitou&quot;<br/>\nfolder.  All we know is that he and his first wife Yaso lived in two<br/>\nhouseholds: The Kurasawa family and another family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Kurasawa home and the area in Aomori where many Aizu immigrants<br/>\nlived is explored at this webpage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/\">http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/</a><br/>\nThere is 2 pages of info and photos specifically on Saitou here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/saitou.html\">http://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/saitou.html</a> (scroll to bottom to<br/>\ngo to the 2nd page)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Kurasawa family is related to Takagi Tokio.<br/>\nTokio was adopted into the Kurasawa family!  The very high possibility<br/>\nremains that Mr. Fujita met Tokio while still married to Yaso.<br/>\nBut why was Tokio adopted---her own father was a senior inspector for<br/>\nAizu.<br/>\nThe answer seems to have been posted here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://8907.teacup.com/yazikita/bbs\">http://8907.teacup.com/yazikita/bbs</a><br/>\nAgain, no text is cited so we don&#39;t know where the info is coming from<br/>\nbut it seems that both of Tokio&#39;s parents &quot;died of illness&quot;, leaving<br/>\nher without an older male relative to protect her or her younger<br/>\nbrother Goro (later known as Takagi Morinusuke).<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nI have been told by one of volunteer translators that Takagi<br/>\nMorinusuke, later a Public Prosecutor or Chief Prosecutor should be<br/>\nvery &quot;researchable&quot; as he handled many important cases at Fukushima<br/>\nand Hakodate.  He was famous and would&#39;ve appeared in Meiji Era<br/>\nnewspapers.  Unfortunately many newspapers during the Meiji era are<br/>\nnot digitalized---you cannot &quot;search&quot; for names---you have to manually<br/>\nsearch page by page in newspapers or try to find a specific case<br/>\nMorinusuke prosecuted and &quot;follow along&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would Takagi Morinusuke be possibly important in terms of Fujita<br/>\nGoro&#39;s biography?  We know that his sons studied kenjutsu with Uncle<br/>\nGoro---clearly he was close with the Takagi family. If his sons wrote<br/>\ndown anecdotal stories about their studies with Uncle Goro---then you<br/>\nhave some valuable information.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nTokio&#39;s Bio *before* 1868<br/>\nThis is based on a question and speculation by a Japanese fan (however<br/>\nthe reasoning is very sound).<br/>\n&quot;If the Takagi family was based in Edo---wouldn&#39;t Tokio have been<br/>\nraised in the Matsudaira household?  More specifically the official<br/>\nAizu mansion in Edo?&quot;<br/>\nThe poster, who seems to have an outstanding command of historical<br/>\nminutia, is giving information which corroborates with the biography<br/>\nof Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s own granddaughter (Princess Chichibu).  That<br/>\nis the children of retainers are raised in the household of the<br/>\ndaimyo, in fact children of SERVANTS were also raised in a similar<br/>\nfashion.  All of this makes sense.  Young Sada, Tokio, would need the<br/>\neducation and familiarity with etiquette needed to later work with<br/>\nTeruhime.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nSeveral months ago, many TV stations aired a documentary on Nagakura<br/>\nShinpachi made by one of his descendants in the media industry.<br/>\nThis documentary recently won or atleast was nominated for a<br/>\nprestigious award.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nComing Soon to SHQ.com....<br/>\nAn info sheet on Shimada Kai !</div>",
