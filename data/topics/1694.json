            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-595566297\">My choices (until I change my mind again :D)<br/>\n<br/>\nKondou - I really like the NHK version As much flack as poor Shingo Katori is getting for this role I think he&#39;s doing a nice job. If you see the last few episodes (this coming Sunday will be #40) You can really see the change in Kondou. He looks so much harder and older than he did in the beginning. The job has clearly taken its toll. Maybe that&#39;s why the historic Kondou looks much older than  his years?<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata -Keppuroku Hijikata is by far the coolest though I like Mibugishiden Hijikata. I think Maybe NHK Hijikata wins out though. He comes across as pretty believable most of the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkita --This is a four way ties between Mibugishiden, NHK and Keppuroku and Gohatto OKita. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou--Again with the tie! RK was the and the best for a long time but then Koichi Sato won me over in Mibugishiden (his sneer is to died for!)closely followed by NHK Jo Odagiri.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHarada --PMK & NHK tie again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTodou --Yet again with the PMK NHK tie though I think NHK Heisuke has the edge because he&#39;s really so sweet with his feeling that he&#39;s in OKita&#39;s shadow in everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nNagakura--Though he had but 37 seconds in screen time Mibugishiden Shinpachi is #1 all the way. They really needed to let his character do more because he really stood out in his brief appearances. <br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami ---PMK edges out NHK in this case. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBarbara Sheridan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barbarasheridan.net\">http://www.barbarasheridan.net</a></div>",
