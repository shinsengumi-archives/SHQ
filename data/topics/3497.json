            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1508064354\">I&#39;ve been studying/reading about the Shinsengumi for a few years now. I realized over that time, that it was become a very popular subject for modern culture/entertainment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read/watched many different representations of the Shinsengumi. I really have enjoyed them all. Then I found this: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mangafox.com/manga/shinsengumi_jingishou_asagi/\">http://www.mangafox.com/manga/shinsengumi_jingishou_asagi/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis manga seems really great. I like that they address life as the Shinsengumi was forming & coming under the leadership of Kondo-san, Hijikata-san, & Yamanami-san. <br/>\nThis manga seems to have been dropped as a project for English translations. I know it has 5 volumes published in Japan, but I can&#39;t seem to find any way to get my hands on this manga. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that this post complies with this community&#39;s posting regulations. If not, please let me know. <br/>\nIf anyone does have news on this manga, I would really be grateful! I&#39;m always looking for new material, even in Japanese. :)</div>",
