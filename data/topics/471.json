It is a book, and there&#39;s some writing on the <br/>\ncover as you can see, though I can&#39;t read it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img29.photobucket.com/albums/v86/mibella/what-002.jpg\">http://img29.photobucket.com/albums/v86/mibella/what-002.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is what it looks like after the 21st page, again there&#39;s some <br/>\nwriting in the top right, and it&#39;s the same on all of the other pages, but <br/>\nagain, I can&#39;t read it. That in the middle is a printed copy of what&#39;s on <br/>\nthe twenty first page, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have no idea what this is and what it&#39;s for...if you know, could you <br/>\nplease tell me? My curiousity is killing me!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMiser Bellatrix<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Allow me to give you a hand...with your doom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nStop worrying about overloading your inbox - get MSN Hotmail Extra Storage! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=hotmail/es2&ST=1/go/onm00200362ave/direct/01/\">http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=hotmail/es2&ST=1/go/onm00200362ave/direct/01/</a></div>",
