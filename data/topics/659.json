After<br/>\nall these wars I imagine there were plenty of injured/maimed people so<br/>\nhe saw the need for hospitals...he and I believe Saitou may not have<br/>\nseen themselves as being &quot;Meiji dogs&quot; (as Shishio would put it) but<br/>\npublic servants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder why S.H./Suzuki didn&#39;t join the military. Perhaps you got<br/>\npaid more being a policeman/inspector?  Or because of their experience<br/>\nin the Shinsengumi they felt their skills were more effective when<br/>\nconcentrated in a local area (like modern police they were assigned to<br/>\ndistricts/wards) while the military is on a national scale.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) he stayed out of it completely for personal and/or philosophical<br/>\n </span></blockquote>reasons (I don&#39;t think anything is mentioned of his being involved in<br/>\nthe Seinan on the one site we have).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe babelfish didn&#39;t say anything about Seinan (or garbled military<br/>\nconflict to suggest the Seinan/Satsuma rebellion)...very often the<br/>\nfish says &quot;taking to the field&quot; in regards to participating in a battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny information that might point us to the truth?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>NOne of the Shinsengumi sites which strive to be comprehensive mention<br/>\nhim...the site I found was the only one...the best bet is root arond<br/>\nthe big sites and read their message boards</div>",
