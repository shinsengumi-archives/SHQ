Natsume did read many of his<br/>\nstudent&#39;s work, he was after all once a professor of English Lit<br/>\n(succeeded LAFCADIO HEARN) at Tokyo Univ.<br/>\n<br/>\nNatsume was at least an acquaintance of Fujita Goro, AND some of the<br/>\nFujita family&#39;s Aizu friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNatsume DOES use Aizu folks as characters in his novels and one<br/>\nunnamed friend of his (appears as a recurring character on more than<br/>\none work) and shares his physical illness of gastric ulcers does have<br/>\na physical description matching the 2nd photo of Fujita Goro (released<br/>\nlate 2004-5). I&#39;m just being...silly now...<br/>\n<br/>\nNatsume&#39;s father (birth father or adopted father not clear) was a<br/>\nfriend of Nagakura.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmmm maybe...<br/>\n<br/>\nNakazato &quot;Natsume-sensei I&#39;m bored, I want to write about SAMURAI!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNatsume &quot;have you ever heard of the Shinsengumi?....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNakazato &quot;I want to also put a hitokiri in the story too!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNatsume &quot;go ahead, I&#39;m sure one day someone will also write about a<br/>\nhitokiri too---but your story will the first to examine the psyche of<br/>\na manslayer&quot;</div>",
