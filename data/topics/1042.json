It&#39;s about <br/>\neight warriors who are descendents from an inu god and it&#39;s set <br/>\nduring the feudal age of Japan. I won&#39;t say much but it I thought I <br/>\nshould mention that the story revolves around the &quot;Murasame&quot; and oni <br/>\nand spirits. The story can be hard to follow sometimes because <br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of symbolization and drifting in/out of reality. <br/>\nThere&#39;s also a lot of abuse of power directed towards commoners. Just <br/>\nthought I should mention it in case anyone is interested, since in <br/>\none of the chats the murasame sword was discussed...<br/>\n<br/>\n~wounds</div>",
