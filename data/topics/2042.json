It&#39;s the last link on the bottom of the first<br/>\n &gt; page about<br/>\n &gt; Hijikata that takes you to the page I was trying to decipher. The passage<br/>\n &gt; about Tamejirou inspiring him to write haiku is right under the<br/>\n &gt; picture of the<br/>\n &gt; bamboo plant. It&#39;s the same passage that talks about someone jumping<br/>\n &gt; into the<br/>\n &gt; river.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s said that Tamejiro was a kind of dilettante who liked making <br/>\nHaiku and Tanka very much and no doubt Toshizo&#39;s haiku hobby is the <br/>\ninfluence of the older brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one day on the way home from the brothel at Fuchu of Musashi, the <br/>\nriver Tama rose and Tamejiro should have stopped there.<br/>\nBut suddenly he took of his clothes to wrap them around his head, and <br/>\ndove into the water. Then he swam using an overhand stroke and went back <br/>\nto the riverbank of Ishida village like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Below that is the one that mentions Daisaku and seems to be saying<br/>\n &gt; something<br/>\n &gt; about him making the Shinsengumi sign. I cannot find where I saw that<br/>\n &gt; one of<br/>\n &gt; the brothers looked after the dojo now though. Must be a long-lost<br/>\n &gt; website.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Daisaku who is adopted by Kasuya family, likes making poetry and excels <br/>\nfor the calligraphy. The great sign of the Shinsengumi HQ at Mibu might <br/>\nbe written by him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; The passage about Hijikata taking &quot;plain food&quot; at Hakodate is at the<br/>\n &gt; bottom<br/>\n &gt; of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.toshizo.com/name/toshizo.html\">http://www.toshizo.com/name/toshizo.html</a> page.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At Hakodate, Toshizo contented to take plain food and kept the women <br/>\naway from him. (the link of the same line which gives the reflection <br/>\nabout the homosexuality and the practice of adoption is interesting too...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; The passage that says something about him going off alone in a corner to<br/>\n &gt; drink is on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.toshizo.com/name/tohito.html\">http://www.toshizo.com/name/tohito.html</a>  It appears to be the<br/>\n &gt; testimony of a journalist of some sort? It&#39;s one of the longer notes.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This one is the testimony of Genichiro Kikuchi who has known the people <br/>\nof Shieikan and who become a journalist in Meiji era.<br/>\nBut the part about Hijikata&#39;s attitude when the other are drinking is <br/>\nthe comment added by the web mistress it seems.( so the source is not <br/>\nmentioned) and it&#39;s said that Toshizo often drinks alone leaning against <br/>\na pillar and only looks with smirk the other fellows making noises.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; I was wrong about where I saw the note about his temper. It&#39;s on this<br/>\n &gt; page:<br/>\n &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.h3.dion.ne.jp/~ash-gate/fukuchyo-2.htm\">http://www.h3.dion.ne.jp/~ash-gate/fukuchyo-2.htm</a>  I think it&#39;s some<br/>\n &gt; official<br/>\n &gt; (possibly named Kato?) who was the one who made the comment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This one is Hiroyuki Kato&#39;s testimony ( he was the professor of the <br/>\nwestern study school of Bakufu) about Hijikata.<br/>\nHe said, Hijikata was a very calm man who keeps cool in the face of <br/>\ntrouble but once he got angry he went wilder than Kondo.<br/>\nFor Bakufu, Kondo was easier to deal with and Hijikata was difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt; And the mention of the &quot;sogami hairdo&quot; (I am still not sure if the<br/>\n &gt; translator<br/>\n &gt; worded that properly) is on<br/>\n &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatu-fubou.htm\">http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatu-fubou.htm</a>  It&#39;s in the<br/>\n &gt; section on Hijikata and says something about him following<br/>\n &gt; Kondou or something and what they were wearing I think? Cannot really<br/>\n &gt; make heads<br/>\n &gt; or tails what that one is trying to say...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The link doesn&#39;t work but I think I figure out what they talk about.<br/>\n&quot;sogami hairdo&quot; means (In correct Japanese) &quot;Souhatsu&quot; hairstyle.<br/>\nWe may wonder watching costume film of Bakumatsu, why some men<br/>\nhave shoved head and the other are not.( without Sakayaki, shoved <br/>\nhairstyle)<br/>\nSuch a long hairstyle without shoving the front is called &quot;souhatsu&quot;.<br/>\nThe photo of Kondo and many other have this hairstyle because souhatsu <br/>\nhas become &quot;a la mode&quot; in Bakumatsu period. That was a sort of <br/>\nperformance symbolizing they are so concerned by the future of Japan <br/>\nthat they haven&#39;t even the time to shove their head.<br/>\n( can be compared little bit those hippie of 70&#39;s having long hair as <br/>\nthe symbol of defiance)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Here&#39;s a link to one of the pages on mizosoba I was looking at:<br/>\n &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ne.jp/asahi/kumagaisan/flowers/mizosoba.html\">http://www.ne.jp/asahi/kumagaisan/flowers/mizosoba.html</a><br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; It mentions the &quot;splinter&quot;, but it has something else interesting too. It<br/>\n &gt; says something at the end about the fruit of the plant? Are there two<br/>\n &gt; different<br/>\n &gt; plants called &quot;mizosoba&quot;?<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s said Mizosoba has some sharp splinters at the stem.<br/>\nThe common name of mizosoba is come from mizo( gutter) and soba( <br/>\nbuckwheat). Because its fruit and leaf look like buckwheat and in the <br/>\ntime of famine, people cultivated this plant to make sobagaki( a kind of <br/>\ngnocchi made by buckwheat) with the fruits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope those answers make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nTama</div>",

( The author of the manga &quot;Burai&quot; which is a kind of X-file <br/>\nof Shinsengumi at the beginning, has an interesting reflection about <br/>\nthis, saying if they mentioned especially about that, because <br/>\n&quot;something&quot; mysterious has happened...lol)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll look for the answer about other questions and if you would give the <br/>\nurl of exact pages which mentions about the Toshizo&#39;s temper etc, that <br/>\nwould help me more.<br/>\n<br/>\nTama</div>",

What <br/>\nis it saying about Toshizou&#39;s temper? Something about when he was <br/>\nangry (which was rare) he was &quot;stormier&quot; than Kondou and could not as <br/>\neasily be calmed down again?
