Her father(?) was an instructor in gunnery...and the whole bit<br/>\nabout cutting hair is because she and other women had to disguise<br/>\nthemselves as men<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t believe I found this link from reading a humorous/silly fanfic<br/>\ninvolving Yamaguchi Jiro wearing a western uniform at Aizu (all the<br/>\nmen around him noticed how handsome he looked wearing it) and learning<br/>\nhow to use a gun...and just about every guy (including Hijikata)<br/>\naround him chasing after him @_@</div>",
