            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1868444343\">After his escape from Edo, Hijikata Toshizo and Otori Keisuke, a commander <br/>\nof the former Shogunate&#39;s infantry, led an attack on Utsunomiya Castle. <br/>\nUtsunomiya Castle was strategically located-- it was on the northward roads <br/>\nleading to places like Aizu and Sendai, and one of the locations prime for <br/>\nattack by the new government&#39;s army.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question that has been on my mind for some time was the following-- a <br/>\ncastle in Edo-era Japan is never without an occupant. A ruling family of <br/>\nUtsunomiya was never mentioned in anything I&#39;d read on Hijikata&#39;s attack, <br/>\nand this led me to believe that perhaps it was one of the Tokugawa family&#39;s <br/>\ncastles. Checking the list of castles in direct posession of the Tokugawa, I <br/>\nquickly found that this was not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho ruled Utsunomiya Castle, then? Where was its lord, and why was his <br/>\ncastle attacked by Hijikata and Otori?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe logical step was to look for &quot;Utsunomiya-han&quot; (&quot;Utsunomiya domain&quot;) in a <br/>\nreference book-- in this case, volume one of Ogawa Kyoichi&#39;s &quot;Edo Bakuhan <br/>\nDaimyo-ke Jiten&quot; (&quot;A Dictionary of Edo-era Lordly Families&quot;), and Abe <br/>\nAkira&#39;s article on Utsunomiya-han in volume two of the the extensive domain <br/>\nencyclopedia &quot;Hanshi Daijiten&quot;. Sure enough, I found it: Utsunomiya-han was <br/>\na domain ruled by the Toda family. As of Keio 3 (1867), it was a <br/>\nmoderately-sized domain of 70,850 koku, or roughly a quarter of the size of <br/>\nthe Aizu domain in the same year (280,000 koku). The lord of Utsunomiya was <br/>\nToda Tadatomo, who in 1868 was a young 20 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next question on my mind that arose was this, now that I knew the name <br/>\nof the lord-- did he have any history of a disconnect with the Tokugawa <br/>\nfamily, or a tendency toward inaction when it came to Shogunal politics? The <br/>\nanswer was a resounding no-- Tadatomo held high positions in the Tokugawa <br/>\nadministration, both as a Master of Ceremonies (soshaban) and a Magistrate <br/>\nof Temples and Shrines (Jisha-bugyo). He was appointed to these posts as of <br/>\nthe 25th day of the 7th month of Keio 3 (1867), so that doesn&#39;t leave much <br/>\nroom for him to do anything antagonistic to deserve an attack by the former <br/>\nShogunate&#39;s infantry.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at a timeline of the actions of the lords of Utsunomiya throughout <br/>\nhistory, I found the following: Toda Tadatomo was, on the 15th of the 3rd <br/>\nmonth of Meiji 1 (1868), in Otsu, on his way to Kyoto, to transmit Tokugawa <br/>\nYoshinobu&#39;s apologies to the Imperial Court, when he was arrested and <br/>\ndetained. Utsunomiya was thus left lordless, until the 6th of the 4th month, <br/>\nwhen his predecessor, Toda Tadayuki, returned to Utsunomiya from Edo, and <br/>\nofficially submitted to the new government.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis answered my question of why exactly Hijikata and Otori attacked him. <br/>\nBut I read further-- about a week after Tadayuki returned, a peasant riot (a <br/>\n&quot;yonaoshi-ikki&quot;, as it&#39;s known in Japanese) broke out, and hard on the heels <br/>\nof the riots, only a handful of days later, Hijikata and Otori arrived and <br/>\ntook the castle on the 19th of the 4th month. However, the new government <br/>\nattacked Utsunomiya Castle a handful of days later, on the 23rd. Years <br/>\nlater, Otori wrote an account of the events, which was published in the <br/>\nmagazine &quot;Kyu Bakufu&quot; in Meiji 32, in which he said that Hijikata was <br/>\ninjured in the toes and subsequently taken to the Higashiyama hotsprings <br/>\nwithin the Aizu domain for treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a little example of the level of detail that I am beginning to discover <br/>\nin my research on the Bakumatsu.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Sources: &quot;Kyu Bakufu&quot;, vol. 1. no. 1; Ogawa Kyouichi, &quot;Edo Bakuhan <br/>\nDaimyo-ke Jiten&quot; (vol. 1); Abe Akira, �Utsunomiya-han�, in Hanshi Daijiten, <br/>\nvol. 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",
