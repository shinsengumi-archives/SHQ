Major award-winner --- Palme d&#39;Or (first Japanese film to win the Grand Prix) at Cannes and the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (honorary award since the category wasn&#39;t made official until the next year).  13th/14th century samurai love story.  (A note of interest, apparently the director was known for female roles (oyama?) in silent film.)
