            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1349902295\">In light of recent interest in where our community has concentrations of members, it might be interesting to give everyone a chance to show just what corners of the globe the Shinsengumi have reached.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnderstanding that where people live can be a sensitive and private issue, two polls are about to go up with various countries and geographic locations as options.  The world is a very big place and poll options limited, so there are two polls: one for the Americas/Asia/Australia and the other for Africa and Europe.  If your specific country isn&#39;t listed, please don&#39;t feel slighted.  No offense was intended.  Also, no infomation is collected or recorded in regards to answers, and all features of the SHQ Yahoogroups site are available *only* to members, so no one will be able to determine where you&#39;re coming from.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe polls are set to be open indefinitely so that new members can contribute and I encourage everyone to check back periodically to see results.  They can be accessed at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq</a> .<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope you&#39;ll take a minute or two and help us learn a little more about our community!<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n(Co-moderator)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
