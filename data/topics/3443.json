I know I&#39;m hoping for the best with this project.<br/>\nTechnology is always changing [damn it] and no sooner we learn how to<br/>\nmanipulate one dynamics, here comes another even more complicated to<br/>\nlearn.  After my 10+ years of working as a web host, I&#39;m ready to go to<br/>\nthe lulu bin after then introduction of all sorts of new scripts.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten to the point of washing my hands entirely of it and sticking to<br/>\njust doing graphics for the clients.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m soooo looking forward to the new site and the information<br/>\nthat will be available to everyone.  I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re willing to<br/>\nsacrifice your time to this effort.
