Yamanami <br/>\nwas particularly educated in literary and military arts, with a gentle personality and a kind <br/>\nheart. He was very much admired by the Head Teacher (Jukutou) at the Shieikan, Okita <br/>\nSoujirou (the later Okita Souji), who called him a big brother. In 1863, Yamanami. Kondo <br/>\nand other members of the Shieikan joined the Roshigumi, the military unit being sent to <br/>\nKyoto by the Tokugawa Shogunate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi Period<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Kyoto, Kondo and his &quot;faction&quot; stayed in Kyoto while the rest of the Roshigumi returned <br/>\nto Edo. Soon, the Mibu Roshigumi (which would eventually become known as the <br/>\nShinsengumi) was formed. Yamanami served as a vice-commander, alongside Hijikata <br/>\nToshizo and Niimi Nishiki (after Niimi&#39;s demotion due to the fight with wrestlers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami was said to be one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo <br/>\nassassination in 1863. After the purge of the Serizawa faction, Yamanami and Hijikata <br/>\nbecame the two vice-commanders.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami did not take part in the famed Ikedaya Jiken in 1864, instead he guarded the <br/>\nShinsengumi&#39;s headquarters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath<br/>\n<br/>\nSome time after the Ikedaya Jiken he tried to escape the Shinsengumi. As a result, he <br/>\ncommitted seppuku with Okita as his second on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23), <br/>\n1865. There are several speculations on Yamanami&#39;s reason to escape, including a theory <br/>\nthat Yamanami committed suicide without ever leaving Kyoto.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most accepted theory is that Yamanami fled to Otsu while Kondo sent Okita to retrieve <br/>\nhim. After Yamanami returned to Mibu, he was ordered to commit seppuku. He asked <br/>\nOkita to serve as his second. There is also a theory that Kondo asked Okita to serve as <br/>\nYamanami&#39;s second out of respect for Yamanami. (The second was usually a closest friend <br/>\nor family member whenever possible.) <br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami was buried at the Koen Temple in Kyoto.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrivia<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami owned a sword named Sekishin Okikou.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami was also known as Sannan (the alternate reading of his family name).<br/>\n<br/>\nYamanami was said to be small-statured and pale-skinned.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring his time in Edo, neighborhood children were very fond of Yamanami.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough some believe Akesato to be fictional, Yamanami did in fact have a mistress <br/>\nnamed Akesato in Kyoto.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReferences<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi Master&#39;s Bible.
