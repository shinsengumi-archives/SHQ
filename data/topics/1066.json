            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2108539833\">Used VHS copies are available too...I own the vcd of sword of doom and<br/>\nthere are no cool extras or anything (I think it is based on the<br/>\nEuropean release).  Warning to Hijikata fans, this film contains a<br/>\nvery unflattering portrayal.  Kev&#39;s pdf file which has the excerpt<br/>\nfrom the novel reveals that a tiny but significant part was cut from<br/>\nthe movie involving Hijikata.  You just have to compare the 2 versions. <br/>\n<br/>\nBased on Momoiro&#39;s post about Grampa Nagakura...<br/>\nIf you were grandson/daughter who would you choose to spend your<br/>\nSundays with<br/>\n<br/>\na) Grampa Nagakura Shinpachi...every now and then during the movie<br/>\nhe&#39;ll ask you what the heck is going on in the plot (his memory/vision<br/>\naren&#39;t so good anymore)...its either the same movie over and over<br/>\nagain or the same story about the Shinsengumi over and over<br/>\nagain...you choose your own form of torture ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Grampa Nakajima Nobori (who died young so he probably didn&#39;t even<br/>\nsee his grandkids)...who will have you repotting/fertilizing his<br/>\nbeloved plant collection [or] look after his firearms store (it&#39;s<br/>\nnever too early to have kids learn how to run an arms business)...on<br/>\nthe bright side you may get drawing lessons...be prepared to use lots<br/>\nof red paint<br/>\n<br/>\nc) Grampa Saitou...after a cup/saucer of sake maybe he&#39;ll tell you how<br/>\nto deal with criminals who don&#39;t &quot;cooperate&quot;...and neat little tricks<br/>\nfor covert operations/espionage missions...heck if Grandmother Tokio<br/>\nisn&#39;t around maybe you&#39;ll get a special tour of the museum after hours<br/>\nusing the special set of keys he duplicated so long ago...but without<br/>\nthe sake he just does the laundry and doesn&#39;t say much...<br/>\n<br/>\nd) Grampa Miki who will instill in you a deep hatred for surviving<br/>\nmembers of the Shinsengumi *especially* for that Nagakura who got away<br/>\n(grrrrr) Nagakura probably said &quot;go after Saitou or should I say<br/>\nFujita Goro&quot;...then you&#39;ll have to put up with his -alternate- history<br/>\ninvolving Sagara<br/>\n<br/>\ne) or how about the guy who converted to Christianity...church church<br/>\nand Sunday school (he probably won&#39;t get any votes)<br/>\n<br/>\nf) Grampa Shimada Kai...frequent trips to the candy store ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the series Hatchobori 7...the officers use a neat little weapon<br/>\nwhich is shaped like a &quot;U&quot; but with one leg of the &quot;U&quot; much longer<br/>\nthan the other...it basically looks like a weird fish hook with a red<br/>\ntassle.  I&#39;ve seen much bigger versions as a Chinese weapon...the<br/>\nofficers use it to catch/hook swords and slash at criminals so I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming it was designed to be non-lethal as Aoyama keeps saying to<br/>\ncatch criminals alive...the officers carry it in their waistband like<br/>\na sword.  It is a pretty small weapon too as the officers have to get<br/>\nvery very close to their opponents.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;bsher213&quot; &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The Sword of Doom a/k/athe movie Miss B and I Always come into too<br/>\n&gt; late when it&#39;s on tv is now available for buying!
