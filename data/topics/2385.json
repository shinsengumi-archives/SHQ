I mean, they really share a bond,<br/>\nespecially in Kurogane when Nakagura, Shinpatchi, and<br/>\nHarada are known as the &#39;Comedic Trio&#39;.  Their<br/>\ncharacters prefectly balance each other out.  The<br/>\nshort Nakagura is smart and seems to know what he&#39;s<br/>\ntalking about while Harada... is not.
