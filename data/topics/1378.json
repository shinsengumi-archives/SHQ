It seems that, till 1948,<br/>\n&gt; the Hijikata family still made that medicine. My only<br/>\n&gt; doubt is the name of the herb: I thought it was<br/>\n&gt; &quot;gyukawa-so&quot;, but in the article says &quot;mizosoba&quot;. I<br/>\n&gt; wonder if they are the same thing...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Serizawa Kamo<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, &quot;Mizosoba&quot; and &quot;Gyukaku-sou&quot; are the same plants. <br/>\nIn a strange thing, if net search is carried out by Gyukaku-sou, <br/>\nonly the site related to Ishida Sanyaku will come out. <br/>\nPossibly, Gyukaku-sou may be a local name in Hino area. <br/>\nThe scientific name of Mizosoba is &quot;Polygonum thunbergii&quot;. <br/>\nA general alias is &quot;Ushi-no-hitai&quot; and there is no English name.<br/>\n<br/>\nManufacture is stopped soon after WWII, and since the master of the <br/>\nHijikata family who learned the manufacture method in 1988 passed <br/>\naway, those who tell the right manufacture method of Ishida Sanyaku <br/>\ndo not exist now. <br/>\nAfter the medicinal law changed, the manufacture stop was brought <br/>\nabout because Ishida Sanyaku was not able to get the registration <br/>\npermission as a medicine. <br/>\nAlthough Mizosoba seemingly has some effect of a medicine, since <br/>\nIshida Sanyaku burns it, the effect of a medicine of it is lost. <br/>\n<br/>\nmomoiro-usagi</div>",

It seems that, till 1948,<br/>\nthe Hijikata family still made that medicine. My only<br/>\ndoubt is the name of the herb: I thought it was<br/>\n&quot;gyukawa-so&quot;, but in the article says &quot;mizosoba&quot;. I<br/>\nwonder if they are the same thing...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSerizawa Kamo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
