            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1174523780\">1) Name/Nickname/SN: <br/>\n I don&#39;t have AIM like everyone else, my e-mail is name is the way to find me on MSN messanger (except that instead of yahoo. com it&#39;s hotmail.com ^^;;).   I normally go by the name WhiteRabbit/ Bunneh anywhere I go, but seeing as how common this is I ended up using the name Eeni for just about everything I do online now a days.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi?:<br/>\nFirst saw them on Rurouni Kenshin and wondered for the longest time wether the lil character called &quot;Okita&quot; was a girl (I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only who ever thought this).   A few years later, I started doing a lil research for my Kenshin fanfic and I ran across the Shinsengumi once again.   Being the ignorant person I was, I was amazed to find out that they in fact were a real group of people.   I read a lil more about them and was even more amazed.   So to this day, I&#39;m still trying to read as much about them as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?:<br/>\nSerizawa Kamo and Okita Souji.   Oktia because he&#39;s always said to have been a guy who would rather have a good laugh then be serious ^_^   As for Kamo, I was reading about him on the Kamo biography page and just thought, this guy didn&#39;t take shit from anyone.   Kondou forgot to count him into the number of people staying at an inn, it&#39;s ok with him... but if he can&#39;t sleep comfortably, no one else will.   BONFIRE!!!!<br/>\n <br/>\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?:<br/>\nRurouni Kenshin (manga/anime), NHK Shinsengumi!, and PeaceMaker (manga only)<br/>\n<br/>\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think captured your favorite members(s) the best and why?:<br/>\nI have no idea... <br/>\n<br/>\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular Shinsengumi members or events?:<br/>\nHow did Saitou end up marring the daiymo(sp?)&#39;s sister.   From what I understand he was a no one by birth and a pretty much the inside hitman of the Shinsengumi... so what were the politics (if any) behind this marrage???? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

Online I tend to go by the screen names szabotage or<br/>\nreynardine.  I&#39;m mostly interested in ancient Japanese history, but<br/>\nthe Shinsengumi caught my attention and so now I&#39;m enjoying learning<br/>\nabout the late Tokugawa/early Meiji eras as well.  I&#39;ve been lurking<br/>\nfor quite awhile (actually used to lurk on the Miburo list as well<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;, but rarely post.  Enjoy reading what people have to say, though.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) How did you &quot;discoverEthe Shinsengumi?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rurouni Kenshin.  The manga, actually--that flashback picture of the<br/>\nguys just caught my attention and I&#39;ve been devoted ever since.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, Saitou was my first love.  I think the fact that he survived and<br/>\nhad to live out his life in the new era is poignant.  It&#39;s one thing<br/>\nto go out in a blaze of glory.  It&#39;s quite another to have to live<br/>\nhaving been defeated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter seeing the NHK version, I&#39;ve become interested in Yamanami<br/>\nKeisuke.  He seems to have been an honorable man and it&#39;s hard to<br/>\nunderstand the circumstances of how he died, especially considering<br/>\nthe rank he held.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm.  Lesseee:<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi Keppuroku: not my favorite, thought it was kinda stilted<br/>\n<br/>\nthe entire NHK series:  Loved it!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPMK manga/anime:  I&#39;ve only seen what&#39;s been released so far in the<br/>\nUS.  Have enjoyed it, especially the anime.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaze Hikaru manga: entire series so far--the style is girly, but it&#39;s<br/>\na really well-written story.  Glad it&#39;s being released here in North<br/>\nAmerica, hopefully Viz won&#39;t screw up the translation too badly. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\nKunoichi: Deadly Mirage:  see here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/reynardine/56002.html\">http://www.livejournal.com/users/reynardine/56002.html</a> <br/>\nfor my spoiler-filled review of this immortal work ;-D  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways looking for more Shinsengumi-related manga.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI so very much want to see Mibu Gishiden, but am holding out to see if<br/>\nthere will be a region 1 DVD release.  I&#39;m a great fan of (the actor)<br/>\nSakai Masato and can&#39;t wait to see his portrayal of Okita!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>\n&gt; think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the NHK series really captured the feelings I had about some members<br/>\n(although I know it wasn&#39;t exactly historically accurate in places). <br/>\nSakai Masato&#39;s portrayal of Yamanami Keisuke was brilliant.  Through<br/>\nsmall things (narrowing his eyes, his formal movements, his hesitant<br/>\nspeaking at times) he was able to convey a lot of what the character<br/>\nwas feeling.  I also really liked Fujiwara Tatsuya&#39;s portrayal of<br/>\nOkita (he&#39;s not a favorite of mine, but Fujiwara-kun did a fantastic<br/>\njob!).  Oh, and Sato Koichi as Serizawa Kamo.  I don&#39;t know much about<br/>\nSerizawa, but the angle of a man bent on his own self-destruction was<br/>\ninteresting, and Sato-san did a remarkable job.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>\n&gt; particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not at the moment.  :-)  May think of some later.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Maria</div>",

At the Aikido dojo my sensei trained at in Osaka <br/>\nthere were teachers from 4 groups of classical Heiho, of which <br/>\nTennen Rishin Ryu was only one.  He ended up training in Yagyu <br/>\nShinkage Ryu, which is what he brought back with him and I train in <br/>\nnow.  However, because he was in so tight with Yoshida Sensei he got <br/>\nthe chance to learn some of TRR&#39;s kihon (which he often reminds me <br/>\nins&#39;t much).<br/>\nTennen Rishin Ryu uses very thick, heavy bokken.  Much larger than <br/>\nother styles like Jigen Ryu or Jikishinkage Ryu (the bokuto we use <br/>\nin Yagyu Ryu is a twig by comparison).  It&#39;s techniques are very <br/>\nindicative of the &quot;Beater&quot; styles that became popular at the end of <br/>\nthe Edo Jidai.  Most of the techniques seem to involve bashing the <br/>\nopponent&#39;s sword aside and thrusting into his throat.  The style was <br/>\ndescribed to me as something to get people reasonably good with a <br/>\nsword very fast.  <br/>\nBy contrast Yagyu Shinkage Ryu can best be described as a &quot;Baiting&quot; <br/>\nstyle, where you offer up an apparent opening to get an opponent to <br/>\nattack the way you want him to and cut him down when he does.  Can <br/>\nbe very formidable once you have it down, but you&#39;re not going to <br/>\nget it fast at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a lurker here for a while and have enjoyed all the obscure <br/>\ninfo dug up here.

I go by MissBehavin (MissB) on <br/>\nthe list. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi? The first time I saw the <br/>\nShinsengumi was in the RK OVA. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why? Anyone here can tell you I <br/>\nam completely obsessed with the Shinsengumi Fukuchou (Vice-Commander) <br/>\nHijikata Toshizo. His strength of character, his conviction to follow his own <br/>\nbeliefs, and his loyalty to his cause are inspiring to me. Over time it has become <br/>\nclear to me that his character has been much maligned by history and the media. <br/>\nHe was not the evil &quot;demon&quot; that some would have people believe.  Rather he <br/>\nwas a man dedicated to both his friends and his followers, who willingly rode <br/>\ninto danger in a futuile attempt to save his &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe accounts we have of him actually suggest that he was very well liked and <br/>\nrespected by the Shinsengumi members. Many followed him all the way to <br/>\nHakodate, despite their cause being hopeless. An account one of them left behind said <br/>\nthey &quot;cried like babes who had lost their mother&quot; when they were later told <br/>\nof his death.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the most intriguing thing about him was the fact that he was born a <br/>\nmere farmer. By law he should have never held a sword or any position of <br/>\nauthority. However it was his dream to become a samurai and through a strange mix of <br/>\nluck and sheer determination he and Kondo both rose to unheard of heights of <br/>\npower for men of their class. By the end Hijikata was leading the army in Ezo. <br/>\nThose who fought with him said he &quot;died more samurai than the real samurai&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe Katsu Kaishu summed his life up best when he said Hijikata was &quot;one <br/>\nman of great caliber.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen? I have seen the RK OVA and <br/>\nanime and I am reading the Viz version of the manga now. I have seen PMK and most <br/>\nof NHK. Saw Gohatto, Sword of Doom, and Shinsengumi Keppuroku. I would love to <br/>\nget my hands on one of those Shinsengumi video games, but that is probably a <br/>\npipe dream...<br/>\n<br/>\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think <br/>\ncaptured your favorite members(s) the best and why?<br/>\nSo far, I think that Shinsengumi Keppuroku did the best job of presenting <br/>\nHijikata Toshizo&#39;s character. He did not come across to me as unnecessarily cruel <br/>\nor &quot;grumpy&quot;, nor does he seem blinded to all else by his convictions. Case in <br/>\npoint, he tells Okita after Yamanami&#39;s &quot;escape&quot; that &quot;if you -don&#39;t see him-, <br/>\ncome back and report.&quot; Okita presses him by saying &quot;you mean let him escape?&quot; <br/>\nHijikata replies &quot;I mean if you -don&#39;t see him- come back and report.&quot;  While <br/>\nit is made perfectly clear that he must and will uphold the beliefs of the <br/>\nShinsengumi even against a friend, it is equally clear that he does in fact care <br/>\nabout his friend and has no intention of hounding him mercilessly to his <br/>\ndeath.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular <br/>\nShinsengumi members or events?<br/>\nI would love to find out exactly what happened at Utsunomiya. I know that <br/>\nHijikata was injured there, but not much else. I would also love to find out more <br/>\nabout the famous Sanjo bridge incident. Any information about Hijikata&#39;s <br/>\nvarious lovers would be nice too. The only one I have heard anything about is the <br/>\nwoman he was supposed to marry back in Tama...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Saitou is a very complex man with *issues* and<br/>\nultimately I believe he tried his best in every role he assumed or<br/>\nordered to perform.  To top it off...he married a woman of Aizu.  I<br/>\nthink that he stayed in Aizu for more reasons than just blind loyalty<br/>\n(or the widely accepted theory that he was their spy)...there is more<br/>\nto the story.  I think Saitou had a reserve of not only physical<br/>\nstrength as a warrior but mental strength as well from the description<br/>\nof his death.<br/>\n<br/>\nNakajima Nobori similarly was a man of many talents and his decision<br/>\nto join the Shinsengumi affected his family life.  The love and skill<br/>\npoured into the production of his paintings is his expression of<br/>\nsincerity towards comrades he lost.  Yamazaki Susumu like some members<br/>\nof the Shinsengumi had other options besides joining a police<br/>\ntroop---but he obviously put his skills to good use.  The information<br/>\ngathering arm in the shinsengumi is most complex and sadly reduced to<br/>\nsimple cross dressing and ninja stereotypes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShimada Kai is to me loveable...his wife was lucky he COULDn&#39;T DRINK<br/>\neven if he wanted to!  I want to learn more about everyone but until<br/>\nwe get a translation company together to publish these books we&#39;ll<br/>\nnever have access to details.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do love Hijikata Toshizo however my interest is very superficial (I<br/>\nsaw the picture ---end of story) I can&#39;t think of him beyond his good<br/>\nlooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiki, was a good man caught up in circumstances beyond his control. He<br/>\nalso had a charitable side and prayed for the men who murdered his<br/>\nbrother, yes he tried to exact revenge (which was a ok under the<br/>\ncircumstance) ....simply he had more strength than we can even gauge.<br/>\nMiki is the butt of our jokes and even his guardian fangirl<br/>\naccidentally be-littles him...quote from PHIL....(^_^)<br/>\n(Suzuki may have been sent to the Tokaido, the eastern road connecting<br/>\nEdo and<br/>\nKyoto... not sure about that yet... no big deal since his Second<br/>\nPatrol was disbanded two weeks after it was created.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>all the ones Barb mentioned<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>\n<br/>\nRurouni Kenshin&#39;s Fujita Goro to me is how I imagine historical Fujita<br/>\nGoro when he was at work. From my readings on police mentality...they<br/>\ndivide work and home and adopt almost different personalities in each<br/>\nsphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi Keppuroku = Hijikata, Okita (both characters HIGHLY<br/>\nbelievable)...a series which at times captures the complexity of the<br/>\nsituation better than NHK<br/>\n<br/>\nMIbugishiden = OKita (for his dark portrayal), Saitou is a bit too<br/>\nrude/rough which actually flies against my own view of historical<br/>\nSaitou...Mibugishiden was too keen on contrasting Saitou with<br/>\nYoshimura...but Koichi Saitou is too darn SEXY<br/>\n<br/>\nMibugishiden Nagakura...that face those eyes...we NEED MORE NAGAKURA<br/>\nand I can imagine this actor to be more sociable like historical<br/>\nNagakura too!<br/>\n<br/>\nNHK = Hijikata (has the looks but not the *presence), Serizawa Kamo<br/>\n(PERFECT), Saitou (good but why make up the carving detail while<br/>\nLEAVING OUT his practice time with Yamazaki Susumu?) but I love JO<br/>\nODAGIRI, Yamanami Keisuke (superior acting, and the thoughtful<br/>\nnarrowing of eyes) he carries the drama of the series ....ITOU +<br/>\nTAKEDA  Itou is sooo cold blooded, devious and hot...and Takeda is<br/>\njust funny<br/>\n<br/>\nNHK has sacrificed historical detail (which can be presented in an<br/>\ninteresting way) because they don&#39;t have faith in the audience.  I<br/>\nhave said to myself many times that a time of hardcore fans could<br/>\nwrite better scripts using this cast.  The series is uneven and is<br/>\nrescued by some of the stronger actors (thankfully).  But now it will<br/>\ntake a while for new fans to work past the fictional devices to get to<br/>\nthe really good stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>\n&gt; particular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Too many to post<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very open minded and for every *positive interpretation for a<br/>\nperson or situation I have a *dark interpretation as well.  I have my<br/>\nown vision of a Shinsengumi narrative set in modern times which does<br/>\nnot simply &quot;modernize&quot; them superficially.  The struggles of the<br/>\nShinsengumi is also a matter of social class, and ultimately universal<br/>\n,tragic and are participants in history as well as victims.  We have<br/>\noverlooked their lives as martial arts practitioners and people who<br/>\n*think and *change.  I frequently imagine the survivors reflecting on<br/>\ntheir tumultuous youth and the pain of having to keep their past to<br/>\nthemselves from new families and friends who would never be able to<br/>\nunderstand.</div>",
