            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-431057949\">Author Barbara Sheridan will take reader&#39;s into an exotic world of<br/>\ncourtesan&#39;s and samurai in 19th century Japan where a helpless British<br/>\nwoman is held prisoner by a mysterious warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nOfcourse, if SAMURAI CAPTIVE was that simple, and the female<br/>\nprotagonist weepy and &quot;helpless&quot;, I probably wouldn&#39;t bother the list<br/>\nwith this off-topic post.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai Captive is about perception, both cultural and physical, it&#39;s<br/>\ndeadly mixture with lust and a high stakes game involving the opium trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis e-book opens with the Richardson Incident (The Namamugi Incident)<br/>\nduring which our feisty heroine Hannah is injured and later sold to<br/>\nthe Yoshiwara red-light district in Edo.  Hannah not only enters into<br/>\ndangerous surroundings but also finds herself in the middle of an<br/>\nunlikely love triangle between two samurai.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s just say the other man in the story is not too happy with his<br/>\nlover&#39;s newly acquired &quot;barbarian&quot; pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall this is a very strong work that is both romantic and thrilling<br/>\n at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI leave you with a quote from the ever hard to please Mrs. Giggles, a<br/>\nwell known reviewer of romance novels:<br/>\n<br/>\nHannah&#39;s &quot;free show leads to her being bought by one of the men in the<br/>\naudience. ...Hannah is not a happy property and she bites too, not<br/>\nthat Katsu is too unhappy about that.&quot;<br/>\nquoted from <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mrsgiggles.com/ebooks/sheridan_captive.html\">http://www.mrsgiggles.com/ebooks/sheridan_captive.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the cover here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2qgwwr\">http://tinyurl.com/2qgwwr</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you are above 18 and looking for some <br/>\nmxf, fxf and samurai x samurai set in pre-modern Japan head over here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loose-id.net/BSSaCaex.aspx\">http://www.loose-id.net/BSSaCaex.aspx</a><br/>\n(there is a sample excerpt on this page too)<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn more about the book here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://b-sheridan.livejournal.com/41350.html\">http://b-sheridan.livejournal.com/41350.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTidbit:  The character of Katsu is supposed to look like major star<br/>\nHiroyuki Sanada (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that e-books may be a bit new for some people but I always<br/>\nfound them to be very convenient when I had a borrowed laptop.  You<br/>\ncan always balance out computer work with a quick break by reading a<br/>\nchapter or two in an e-book.  Loose-id is a great site with an easy to<br/>\nuse and secure shopping cart.  So if you&#39;ve never bought an e-book<br/>\nbefore then let Samurai Captive introduce you to this new medium for<br/>\nliterature.</div>",
