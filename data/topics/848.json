It got me thinking abou the Sekiguti/Sekiguchi<br/>\njiujitsu S.H. believed to have practiced.  On one of the posts at<br/>\n3-hajime.com<br/>\n<br/>\nfish says...<br/>\n&quot;Saito one Sekiguti style [jiujitsu lineage/style] softly had<br/>\ncompleted technique, because the history charge supporting is not<br/>\nclear, assertion is not possible, but because it is the information<br/>\nwhere the Akama Cipango [Akama Shizuko] child person is procured from<br/>\nthe Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, as for the possibility it is<br/>\nhigh with you think. Because Tadasi Matsubara softly seems that is<br/>\nsoftly the master of technique of the extent which serves the<br/>\ntechnique teacher head afterwards, being taken after, is not strange,<br/>\ndon&#39;t you think?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nso the info is from the TMPD.  The Sekiguti style was mentioned on the<br/>\nS.H.&#39;s chart <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/\">http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/</a> <br/>\nAnd I think the guy in the NHK drama was Tadasi Matsubara--master of<br/>\nhis style(?)  his name pops up in other threads regarding the drama. <br/>\nIndeed the guys in the Shinsengumi were skilled as is ...and due to<br/>\nthe varied demographics of the group they continued to broaden their<br/>\nmartial knowledge obviously. I just found it pretty neat how Akama S.<br/>\nwas able to find this shred of info.</div>",
