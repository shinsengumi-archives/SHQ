Now,  Misaki didn&#39;t  ask me to draw this, I did it on my own out of pure urge to see what  this one particular scene would look like.   I was extreamly  nervous when I sent her the links to the pages and I am overly excited  that she loves them.   She loves them so much that she suggested I  share these pages with the SHQ mailing list (BTW are the SHQ & Spy  division under the same e-mail address for the mailing  list?).   So, without further adue, the small section of  fanfic turned doujinshi:<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970162/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970162/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970267/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970267/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970380/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970380/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/25006043/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/25006043/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/25255863/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/25255863/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/25256502/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/25256502/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/25275526/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/25275526/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/view/25394256/\">http://www.deviantart.com/view/25394256/</a><br/>\n  <br/>\n  If any of you haven&#39;t read this fic, you should.   It is  exquisitly writen.   The fanfic can be found both on  fanfiction.net (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/1/)\">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/1/)</a> & on  hakubaikou.com ... the one on FF.net is more far ahead then the one on  Hakubaikou&#39;s site.   Anyways, I hope you guys all enjoy this  as much as Misaki did (I know secretarytocapt3 enjoys the fic  ^.^).   So, &#39;till later!<br/>\n  <br/>\n  -Bunneh/ WhiteRabbit/ Eeni<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo! Personals<br/>\n Single?
