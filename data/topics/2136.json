They catch some girl spying on them (for that Utsuki Hyoma <br/>\nguy), Ryunosuke says he&#39;ll dispose of her, and Serizawa  leaves.

At some point, in the middle of that weird little <br/>\nscene where the girl thinks she sees the ghost of a murdered woman and <br/>\nRyunosuke starts going nuts, it flips over briefly to Hijikata and the others rushing <br/>\ninto the room Serizawa is sleeping in and killing him. Then it goes back to <br/>\nRyunosuke, who is slashing everything in sight (blinds, Shinsengumi, etc.) and <br/>\nscreaming &quot;Serizawa! I&#39;ll do it! I&#39;ll kill Kondo for you! Serizawa!&quot; Then it <br/>\njust ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m told there is a sequel to this movie, which I have yet to see.
