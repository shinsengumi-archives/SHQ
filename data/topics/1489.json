And the person<br/>\nhasn&#39;t gotten back to me yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n[however] I noticed that some people started to download it<br/>\nanyways...so let me warn you...I had gathered some info from some<br/>\nbooks and arranged everything (my university library happened to have<br/>\nsome very good books in English on swords and fortunately traced the<br/>\nlineage of Saitou&#39;s sword&#39;s maker)...but keep in mind I don&#39;t collect<br/>\nswords so its like someone writing about car engines without having<br/>\ncome into direct contact with car engines.  Saitou&#39;s sword has a VERY<br/>\ninteresting history ^_^.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the people who downloaded the essay, I just uploaded an updated<br/>\nversion complete with &gt;&gt;images&lt;&lt; which explains the different kinds of<br/>\nhamon and pic of the &quot;Aizu Shintogo&quot; tanto forged by the FATHER of the<br/>\nSaitou&#39;s sword&#39;s smith. Yes, there is an *indirect* Aizu connection.</div>",
