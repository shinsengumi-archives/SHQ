            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-587447332\">Barb, we don&#39;t know if Fujita G was at Kumamoto Castle because it <br/>\nhappened very early on in the conflict...basically this Castle was <br/>\nstanding between Tokyo and Saigo&#39;s army.  The police stationed at <br/>\nKumamoto were pretty shocked to find a document on the body of one <br/>\nof Saigo&#39;s guys indicating that none other than Saigo was waiting <br/>\nbeyond the castle walls.  In this case the police trapped in the <br/>\ncastle were seriously outnumbered...I&#39;m not going to spoil the <br/>\nstory :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMiss B, remember how we were scratching our heads over the <br/>\nword &quot;tail&quot; that babelfish keeps spitting out?  Well it seems that <br/>\nin many maneuvers during the Seinan War, specifically involving <br/>\npolice battalions their goal was take attack Saigo&#39;s forces from the <br/>\nback, furthermore, the article I was reading deals alot <br/>\nwith &quot;pronged&quot; or &quot;pincer&quot; movements the government used to deal <br/>\nwith the guerrilla forces used by Saigo after siege of Kumamoto <br/>\nCastle (considered by another researcher to be a turning point of <br/>\nthe war because it raised the morale of gov. troops).  After the <br/>\nsiege of Kumamoto castle, fierce fighting continued (because other <br/>\ngroups of samurai began to join with Saigo) and in a way the gov. <br/>\nhad to deal with a smashed bee hive so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n3-hajime mentioned that it was hard/impossible to determine which <br/>\nbattalion Fujita G. was assigned to and I know why...once police <br/>\ntroops were deployed they were re-organized and split up a couple of <br/>\ntimes as tactics in the war changed.  All I know was that Kawaji was <br/>\nin charge of an independent brigade #3 and this was considered to be <br/>\na &quot;final&quot; reorganization as of March 1877.  None of the writers <br/>\nunderstand how to present the info visually like a pyramid structure <br/>\nor something because it seems that there are brigades/battalions and <br/>\nthen a whole bunch of other police battalions running around too <br/>\nwhich I assume are part of a larger brigade.  I know there is <br/>\nprobably a military book out there that explains this stuff but I am <br/>\nreading info from 3 authors and they mention both <br/>\nbrigades/battalions/units without drawing any distinction or even <br/>\ngiving a basic defintion :(<br/>\n<br/>\nMiss B, did you find in 3-hajime anywhere of a &quot;bonus&quot; or prize <br/>\naward given to Fujita G, besides the Medal &quot;Order of the Blue <br/>\nPaulownia&quot;?  One of the ideas adopted from the French/&quot;Paris&quot; police <br/>\nsystem was the idea of monetary awards to policemen.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember how we discussed how much 100 yen really was back then?  <br/>\nFujita G received the &quot;Order of the Blue Paulownia&quot; + 100 yen.  <br/>\nDuring the Seinan War, the gov. troops were in Saigo friendly <br/>\ndomains and when they inadvertantly destroyed civilian homes, <br/>\ncommanders had to compensate the civilians ofcourse.  In one record <br/>\nit mentions a gov. official awarding 5 to 10 yen to people who lost <br/>\ntheir home during the fighting...so 100 yen was -alot- of money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; secretary wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Today&#39;s &quot;Menu During a Seige&quot; as we wait for other police troops <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; &gt;show up... millet gruel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;vegetable gruel which looks like bird droppings<br/>\n&gt; &gt;horsemeat (lets hope one of our steeds get shot today)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;soup made from crushed horse bone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;yummy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; No wonder Saitou looks so blah and worn out in that group photo! <br/>\nThe <br/>\n&gt; poor man hadn&#39;t had a decent meal let alone a bowl of soba in far <br/>\ntoo long! </span></blockquote></div>",
