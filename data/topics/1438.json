(under his other name <br/>\nDenpachi Ichinohe)....what if the Numazawa&#39;s came into contact with <br/>\nS.H. during the exile?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Numazawa&#39;s were Tokio&#39;s (distant) relatives...they didn&#39;t <br/>\nexactly give away their son to complete strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did their 2 older sons think of their parents.  They probably <br/>\nwondered &quot;mom and dad gave away our brother&quot; this is something that <br/>\nthey would remember their whole lives. It is possible that the boys <br/>\nwere clueless (this secret may have been kept from them), but from <br/>\ntheir ages, I think they could guess that something was very wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did Tokio and Goro handle questions from co-workers?  Although <br/>\nthe Queen of Conspiracies, Mistress of Mysteries, the Chief to <br/>\nSHQ.com has come up with infinite ways in which the pregnancy can be <br/>\nhidden by having Tokio live with the Numazawas before and after <br/>\ngiving birth, the QUESTION REMAINS the Numazawas had to know of the <br/>\npregnancy through family channels and I think that externally the <br/>\npregnancy was obvious to anyone who may have seen Tokio. BUT what if <br/>\nshe was the rare woman who&#39;s pregnancy didn&#39;t &quot;show&quot; much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Numazawa&#39;s may be asking for payback for &quot;something&quot;.  Asking <br/>\nfor a family&#39;s child is not the same as asking for money, a car or <br/>\nfavor.  The Numazawa&#39;s had to be 99.9% that the Fujitas would <br/>\nsay &quot;yes&quot;.  Think, were the Fujita&#39;s in a position to say &quot;no&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that Tokio&#39;s letter to Tatsuo 1 month before Fujita Goro <br/>\ndied may have been an attempt to explain things to Tatsuo and more <br/>\nimportantly allow F.G. to get things off his chest before he died.  <br/>\nIn fact, what if both parents decided that after all one was dying <br/>\nmight as well atleast attempt to clear things up and settle secrets.<br/>\n<br/>\nTatsuo&#39;s tears are to be expected.  His aunt&#39;s words basically <br/>\nturned his world upside down and he had HIS OWN SUSPICIONS, that is <br/>\nwhy he asked...people may have treated him differently and so <br/>\nforth.  My question is did he come into contact with the Fujitas <br/>\nevery once in a while during family gatherings and so forth?  <br/>\nTokio+Goro would have atleast wanted to see their son from [afar] <br/>\nand both would be careful not to do anything which would jeopardize <br/>\nTatsuo&#39;s position in the Numazawa family.  Both parents would engage <br/>\nin the &quot;blame game&quot;, imagine their long talks and attempt to avoid <br/>\nconversations which may lead to the 3rd son. I would think F.G. <br/>\nwould&#39;ve made the decision but they were related to Tokio,they would <br/>\nrelive over and over the decision and harbor their own doubts and <br/>\nwonder &quot;how is our Tatsuo doing?&quot;  The adopting out of Tatsuo any <br/>\nway you look at it was a like a lifelong cloud of sorrow which would <br/>\nhang over Tokio&#39;s conscience.  I do not see either parents as <br/>\nshopping around and looking for a family to take their son once the <br/>\npregnancy was apparent...I think the Numazawa&#39;s made a request that <br/>\nthey had to fulfill and I don&#39;t think simple loyalty was the ONLY <br/>\nREASON.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they lived in a different culture and different time period.  <br/>\nHowever, the human heart has not changed much.  Culture and society <br/>\ncan help them to try to rationalize their actions to themselves but <br/>\nthe bottom line is that a mother&#39;s instinct is to grieve the loss of <br/>\nher child...it was a peculiar situation and in their early 40s, <br/>\nFujita Goro was a chief inspector and Tokio was well placed in her <br/>\ncareer both would have been financially able to raise another boy.<br/>\nNo husband/father can understand the heart of a mother and Tokio <br/>\nwould have to grieve alone...I actually imagine Fujita Goro <br/>\nconcentrating more and more on work to the point he would lose <br/>\nhimself in it.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-146017112\">Just to clarify since my name has been brought up, when I spoke of not applying 20th century values to Meiji thinking, I was referring to the Fujitas&#39; decision to either have the child purposely to help the other family survive or to allow the family to adopt their much younger third son... not to how Tatsuo might have felt.  Though the practice of surrogating has always been around and continues to this day, I don&#39;t think people have as much contact with it as they do adoption in general and it may be difficult to accept how a couple could purposely produce or relinquish a child, especially when part of the driving force is loyalty to something as broad as keeping Aizu strong.  And as difficult as it seems to fathom how a woman could do what Tokio did (and others have done, before and since), she may have cared for this relative of hers and felt both blessed and honored that she could do this for her as well as an Aizu family.  Of course she felt something... those 9 months do<br/>\n something to you... but from everything I&#39;ve learned about Tokio on this list, this was a very strong woman with a loyalty to her homeland as strong as her husband&#39;s and an ability to live a life of her own instead of simply through her husband and children.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I&#39;m curious about is why Tatsuo was upset about the news... upset with his adoptive family or with the Fujitas?

The website<br/>\n&gt; mentions Tokio&#39;s letter to Tatsuo one month before Fujita Goro <br/>\ndied. <br/>\n&gt; We can only wonder about the words a mother would write to a son she<br/>\n&gt; had to give away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWell we can speculate... However a few days ago I was IM&#39;ng with Phil <br/>\nand she turned me into the reason that they gave their last son away <br/>\nor had their last son because that Aizu retainer needed to continue <br/>\ntheir family name. Although I did not really agree with her because I <br/>\nfound the reason a bit unacceptable in my point of view, being an <br/>\nadopted person myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads me to wonder how exactly did Tatsuo react after <br/>\naccidentally learning of that fact. I seem to remember this was <br/>\ndiscussed several months ago, he was pretty angry at the situation. <br/>\nSo maybe Tokio wrote him a letter to apologize? Did she realize that <br/>\nher child&#39;s life wasn&#39;t theirs to do as they wish? I know a number <br/>\nwon&#39;t agree with me since as Phil pointed out, I&#39;m applying 20th <br/>\ncentury values to the Meiji... But even if we don&#39;t speak about <br/>\nvalues, let&#39;s just go through a normal person&#39;s psyche, Tatsuo&#39;s <br/>\nreaction is not surprising as basically he would see himself not <br/>\ntreated the same way as his siblings, he was given away... <br/>\n<br/>\nWell I better stop here...<br/>\n<br/>\n~wounds<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

However a few days ago I was IM&#39;ng with Phil <br/>\nand she turned me into the reason that they gave their last son away <br/>\nor had their last son because that Aizu retainer needed to continue <br/>\ntheir family name. Although I did not really agree with her because I <br/>\nfound the reason a bit unacceptable in my point of view, being an <br/>\nadopted person myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads me to wonder how exactly did Tatsuo react after <br/>\naccidentally learning of that fact. I seem to remember this was <br/>\ndiscussed several months ago, he was pretty angry at the situation. <br/>\nSo maybe Tokio wrote him a letter to apologize? Did she realize that <br/>\nher child&#39;s life wasn&#39;t theirs to do as they wish? I know a number <br/>\nwon&#39;t agree with me since as Phil pointed out, I&#39;m applying 20th <br/>\ncentury values to the Meiji... But even if we don&#39;t speak about <br/>\nvalues, let&#39;s just go through a normal person&#39;s psyche, Tatsuo&#39;s <br/>\nreaction is not surprising as basically he would see himself not <br/>\ntreated the same way as his siblings, he was given away... <br/>\n<br/>\nWell I better stop here...<br/>\n<br/>\n~wounds</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1940335964\">I understand that many people are perplexed with the question of adoption in <br/>\nJapan in the past.<br/>\nCertainly blood relation is important for us, if so we wonder why so many <br/>\nadoption cases?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve seen NHK drama, you can remember Isami&#39;s mother-in-law talking that <br/>\n Isami was adoptive son for Kondo family as well as his father-in-law. <br/>\nTherefore none of Isami, his father and mother-in-law have blood relation with <br/>\noriginal Kondo family!<br/>\nAnd again, recently in the drama, Isami adopted another stranger for the <br/>\nfamily, the youngest brother of Tani bros. as the heir of Kondo family, because he <br/>\nhasn&#39;t a son yet and Tani are distinguished family.<br/>\nIt seems strange, no? But it doesn&#39;t mean Kondo family case was special nor <br/>\nit was invention of scriptwriter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be explained just in earlier Japan, the family name was considered <br/>\nmore important than blood relation, especially in some important family.<br/>\nFamily name means every property, function, duties, and rights attached to <br/>\nthe family.<br/>\nAnd at that time as only male successor is considered as heir of the family, <br/>\nhaving no son means extinction of the family. Extinction of the family name <br/>\nwas something very painful and humiliating thing for the people of that period. <br/>\nWe can understand that mentality as the extinction of family has been the <br/>\nmost important punishment for Daimyo or Hatamoto during Edo period.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdoption has been also a method of social promotion for rich farmer or <br/>\nmerchant family.<br/>\nThere were different forms of adoption; adopting a child of certain family as <br/>\nthe heir, or taking the husband of the daughter as adoptive son. The latter <br/>\none means the husband takes the name of his wife&#39;s family and this practice is <br/>\nalways done in certain family even now.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcerning Numazawa family, as this family has been the chief retainer of <br/>\nAizu,it was important for  Numazawa Kohachiroo to maintain the family name. <br/>\nAnd if they&#39;ve kept the secret, I think that they just wanted to raise Tatsuo <br/>\nas their own son as he was a baby, for son&#39;s happiness.<br/>\n(Because if they adopted a grown son like Isami, naturally there is no <br/>\nsecret.)<br/>\nFor Fujita&#39;s side, I think they gave the son for the solidarity of the <br/>\nrelatives and respect for the Aizu clan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact our mentality has been changed so much since after WW2, and we became <br/>\nmore than more individual, and such adoption is now considered as something <br/>\nspecial. <br/>\nAlthough my family isn&#39;t an important one, I have also some adoption cases <br/>\nwithin my relatives, until at the time of my grand parents, so this kind of <br/>\npractice is not so shocking for me, thinking the context of the period.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay be I talked too much!<br/>\n I&#39;ll keep post for the Saito&#39;s possibly new photo.<br/>\n<br/>\nTama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
