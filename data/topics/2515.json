The legal release is put out by Geneon(Pioneer) and is purchasable at websites like YesAsia.<br/>\n<br/>\nVolume 1 (I believe of 2) is YesAsia Catalog No.:1003916602. Volume 2 should also be listed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, if you have a good connection, you may download fansubs using bittorrent.  See <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php\">http://d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php</a> for the list of torrents, and their corresponding FAQ if you are unfamiliar with the p2p client Bittorrent.<br/>\n<br/>\n From my understanding the available torrent is taken from a screengrab of the subtitled  English version that aired in some select places in the U.S.  The subtitles are embedded , not softsubs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been a few &#39;regionless&#39; editions that have shown up on Ebay.  Most likely, unless they state that they are Region 2, Geneon releases these are pirated versions.  I do not know if they are copies of the legal releases, or are HK versions (with questionable English subtitles) or pressings of the fansub versions. Buyer beware.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\n<br/>\n*red-bird.org*</div>",
