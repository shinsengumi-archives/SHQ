For the RPG I&#39;m in (isn&#39;t that fun?) and well, Rurouni Kenshin. I noticed that it&#39;s usually the precursor to most Shinsengumi fans, myself included, unless they have access to NHK (or were paying attention, at least ^^;;). We have NHK here but, regrettably, I wasn&#39;t watching closely enough to have seen the series coming... :&#39;(<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it quite obvious? :D I have an irrepressible flair for the dramatic. And as all fangirls go... *squee*! Kidding. I really don&#39;t know; maybe because I admire his strength and his genius. The ferocity that&#39;s hidden behind that amiable face. As I said, an &quot;irreressible flair for the dramatic&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd Saitoh. He creeps the hell out of me. Sheer viciousness. He&#39;s not just your typical bad boy (don&#39;t we just love those?)<br/>\n <br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?<br/>\n<br/>\n*sniff* Rurouni Kenshin... although I am planning on getting my hands on my own set of the Peacemaker series, and vowed to tune into NHK more frequently than I used to... And I&#39;ve been badgering the people at Power Books to look for novels/books/whathaveyous about them. Is &quot;Of Spirits Walking in the Red Shadow&quot; Shinsengumi-centric?<br/>\n <br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you <br/>\nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea... <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>\nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm...

Takeshi has ONE fangirl alive and kicking in this world.  :-D  (He was WAY too old for the role... no argument about that... but I liked the take on the torment inside the man.)  Now that I think about it, Gohatto was my TRUE introduction to the Shinsengumi... I saw the film long before RK... but I didn&#39;t make the connection until after I saw RK.  And it was Takeshi&#39;s performance that made me think of the film and how much I had liked it... enough for me to pick it up as a possible purchase one day and go &quot;WOW!!!  THAT WAS ABOUT THE SHINSENGUMI!&quot;  Of course, there was no question of me purchasing it then.  :-D  It was my first piece of Shinsengumi merchandise.<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Nagakura <br/>\nwas good but too old.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Saitou it&#39;s a tie between NHK and Mibu Gishi Den both had that RK <br/>\nbada$$ thing down to a &quot;T&quot; but I think I have to give the edge to NHK <br/>\nbecause he was the perfect age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Okita winner is a tie between Mibu Gishi Den&#39;s kicka$$, blood <br/>\nspewing Okita and the all around excellent Shinsengumi Kepproku version<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata was best in Shinsengumi Kepproku followed closely by the man <br/>\nyou love to hate in NHK and we will forget that Taboo Hijikata ever existed<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any <br/>\nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know what became of the Itou Dojo in Edo after Itou <br/>\nleft/died?
