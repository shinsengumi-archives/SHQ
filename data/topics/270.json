I just thought I would mention this...take it for whatever <br/>\n&gt; it is worth...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is taken from Mitsuo Kure&#39;s Samurai book:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Who was responsible for the killing of Ryoma? Under the Kyoto<br/>\n&gt; shugo there were two police organizations, the Shinsengumi and <br/>\n&gt; Mimawarigumi. When Matsudaira Katamori, the lord of Aizu, was <br/>\n&gt; appointed as shugo his soldiers were based at the Komyoji Temple. The <br/>\n&gt; Mimawarigumi stayed at a branch temple of the Komyoji and executed <br/>\n&gt; their duties around the temples of the city. Ryoma was regarded as a <br/>\n&gt; criminal because he had killed one of the police raiders with his <br/>\n&gt; revolver during the attack on him at the Teradaya inn; so it would <br/>\n&gt; not be strange if he was a police target. According to the memoir of <br/>\n&gt; Teshirogi Suguemon, an inspector of the Shinsengumi who served under <br/>\n&gt; Matsudaira Katamori, it was Katamori who ordered Ryoma&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; assassination, and Suguemon is a credible source. But if Ryoma was a <br/>\n&gt; criminal why did the Mimawarigumi resort to assassination? Legitimate <br/>\n&gt; police activity did not have to be kept secret. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  If it was not a simple matter of police revenge, then who profited <br/>\n&gt; most from Ryoma&#39;s death? The answer must be that the men who<br/>\n&gt; wanted to unleash military violence against the bakufu broke from the <br/>\n&gt; spell of the most influential voice speaking against the civil<br/>\n&gt; war.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Samurai: An Illustrated History, Kure, p. 139)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kevin </span></blockquote></div>",
