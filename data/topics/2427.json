            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1676710936\">A BIG thank you to Tama for the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nShinohara did, in fact participate in the assassination of <br/>\nTakeda.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s said also Shinohara and Takeda had been good friends. So <br/>\nTakeda trusted Shinohara. [and why he took that after dinner walk with him, <br/>\nne?]<br/>\n <br/>\nThat was written by Kenbun Nishimura, the guardian samurai of <br/>\nNishihonganji<br/>\ntemple. In NHK he was the man for whom Kawai told his story <br/>\nbefore dying<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a former Satsuma samurai called Toyama Yahei who committed <br/>\nmurder and was banished from Satsuma clan.. He ask Kondo to join <br/>\nShinsengumi.<br/>\n Kondo was leery of the guy but  Itou supported this Toyama and <br/>\nconvinced Kondo to accept him.<br/>\n<br/>\nItou then made Toyama be something of a spy and to report to Satsuma <br/>\nclan what Kondo was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough Toyama, Itou met Okubo. He met  often with him and  participated <br/>\nto other meetings to overthrow Bakufu. [Not sure if this was just with <br/>\nOkubo or with other high Ishin figures, my guess is it was]<br/>\n<br/>\n In his diary Itou wrote that everything went as he expected. Except <br/>\nafter leaving the Shinsengumi he couldn&#39;t find a suitable place to stay....<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\nItou was promoted to the court rank of Ju-goi on November 18 ( his death <br/>\nanniversary) Taisho 7 (1918) &quot;Ju&quot; means &quot;Vice&quot; and the rank comes just <br/>\nafter Sho-go-i.<br/>\n <br/>\nJugo-i rank, it&#39;s lower than Sagara&#39;s, but we don&#39;t know why. It comes <br/>\njust after Shogo-i which is Sagara&#39;s.. Itou was enshrined in Yasukuni <br/>\nShrine and became a kami on April ( no mention for the date) Showa 4 ( <br/>\n1929) [same shrine as Sagara]<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nNote about court ranks<br/>\nThe &quot;Ikai&quot; or court rank system has been existed since 1400 years ago in <br/>\nJapan.<br/>\nThere are miner changing of the system but since Taisho era, the court <br/>\nrank has had the number 1 to 8 and each rank number has its &quot;vice&quot; <br/>\ntherefore 16 ranks in total.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it has &quot;Sho-ichi (1)- i &quot; at the summit and &quot;Ju-ichi-i&quot; comes next, <br/>\nthen Sho-ni(2)-i , Ju-ni-i and so forth. (sho-go-i means 5th)<br/>\nThose rank are given to the people contributed to the country and except <br/>\nImperial family and Korean royal family.<br/>\nSometimes, the promotion is posthumous and the highest rank <br/>\n&quot;Sho-ichi-i&quot;has never been given before one&#39;s death.<br/>\nThis rank always exists but after W.W.II  the promotion became <br/>\nposthumous only.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~BH3H-SMJY/rekisi/ikai.htm\">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~BH3H-SMJY/rekisi/ikai.htm</a> Tama gives <br/>\nus some Isihn leaders and their court rank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShoichi-i: (the highest)  Iwakura Tomomi<br/>\nJu-ichi-i: Okubo Toshimichi, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, (It isn&#39;t mentioned in <br/>\nthis site but also Kido Takayoshi/Katsura Kogoro is here)<br/>\nSho-san(3)-i : Saigo Takamori<br/>\nSho-yon(4)-i: Sakamoto Ryoma, Nakaoka Shintaro, Yoshida Shouin, Ii Naosuke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBarbara Sheridan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barbarasheridan.net\">http://www.barbarasheridan.net</a><br/>\nThe Blog-- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\">http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/</a></div>",
