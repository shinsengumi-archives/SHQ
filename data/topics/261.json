            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1109252503\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Shimazu Masayoshi&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So my professor and I had an argument today about kabuki, and why I<br/>\n&gt; think it was wise of the Tokugawa to control it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ofcourse in our day and age we believe in free speech and the <br/>\nrepresentation from all sides.  Now, I don&#39;t know enough about kabuki, <br/>\nbut weren&#39;t there other forms of entertainment that the masses could <br/>\nview...all of which could be well beyond the control of the Tokugawa?  I <br/>\nbring this up because I study Thailand and although theatre/poetry that <br/>\nhas been recorded and handed down is supposed to be &quot;court&quot; <br/>\nentertainment however there is more than enough evidence suggesting <br/>\nthat whatever was popular amongst the &quot;lower&quot; class soon became <br/>\npopular in the courts as well.  And yes ofcourse the upper class didn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy seeing themselves mocked/parodied but they couldn&#39;t REALLY <br/>\nstop it.  So the issue may be &quot;how effective was the Tokugawa was in <br/>\ncontrolling kabuki?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeudalism=bondage/vassal system there is no denying this...similarly so <br/>\nwas the monarchical system in Thailand before 1932 however many <br/>\nancient poems I read convey the need for the leader to be sure that the <br/>\npeople were well fed and that the leader be just (to the point of people <br/>\nsummoning the leader with a bell to preside over major conflicts).  Note <br/>\nthe people could call upon the leader.  Thus, there is a very CLEAR <br/>\nunderstanding that an unjust leader will be overthrown...mismanagement <br/>\nof the government will result in challenges.  My point is <br/>\nthat &quot;mainstream&quot; history is based on generalizations and that cannot be <br/>\navoided because people have to start &quot;somewhere&quot; before mastering a <br/>\nbody of knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to be respectful when addressing your professor and understand that <br/>\nit is very healthy to see things from many points of view...it is not <br/>\ninnappropriate to type a short and sincere apology:)  It is odd that your <br/>\ninstructor seems to disregard the fact that the samurai ideal can be <br/>\nfound in all social classes and in the case of Aizu amongst women and <br/>\npeasants as well...they weren&#39;t -just- defending their lord but their <br/>\nhomes/families and basically the only world they have ever known <br/>\n(seeing how people rarely travelled beyond their domain).  Ofcourse the <br/>\nideal, like religion, has been at times manipulated and its followers <br/>\nexploited but alongside these cases people like your professor must <br/>\nacknowledge that there are those who have interpreted the samurai <br/>\nideals in a noble way as well.</div>",
