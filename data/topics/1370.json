            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-734968404\">I watched this TV film for the first time when it was aired long long time <br/>\nago, and what I can remember now about it is this film made me cry and cry.<br/>\nI could just re-watched this one few days ago, It still made me cry, seeing <br/>\nthose young boys committing suicide, the tragedy of Aizu people so proud and <br/>\nloyal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the comment about this film in filmography section on SHQ site, this film <br/>\nhas two parts.<br/>\nThe first part shows well the complicated situation of Aizu. There is some <br/>\nsamurai of the domain like chief retainer Tanomo Saigo, who opposed to Katamori <br/>\nMatsudaira receiving the office of Protector of Kyoto, because they thought <br/>\nthat would involve Aizu too much in political conflict.<br/>\nThey show also the tragic destiny of Shuri Jinbo, who must commit seppuku <br/>\nafter the defeat of Toba Fushimi, as the responsible of Katamori&#39;s abandon.<br/>\n<br/>\nShinsengumi makes an appearance indeed, but they show only Kondo, Hijikata <br/>\nand Okita as main characters. There is no Saitou, nor other principal members.<br/>\nNevertheless, Ikedaya Raid scene is awesome one. I like especially Okita <br/>\nportrayed by Katsuhiko Nakagawa in this film. Kondo and Hijikata are also good, <br/>\nbut perhaps I&#39;m now so captivated by NHK Hijikata.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second part entirely focuses on Aizu War with many details.<br/>\nIt&#39;s really hard to see how Byakkotai boys decided to kill themselves, <br/>\nsuicide of Tanomo Saigo&#39;s family including little girls and servants, extermination <br/>\nof Nihonmatsu Shounentai ( a unit formed by little boys younger than <br/>\nByakkotai), etc...<br/>\nThere are also,mortal combat of female unit Joushitai with heroic death of <br/>\nTakeko Nakano, gun fighting of brave Yaeko Yamamoto, Battle of Bonari Touge(They <br/>\nshows only Hijikata, however we can imagine at that time Saitou strayed from <br/>\nShinsengumi for a while) .<br/>\n<br/>\nActors and actress are most prestigious whom you can see in many other films <br/>\nlike Hisaya Morishige(Okazumi Inoue),Koutaro Satomi(Yorimo Saigo),Morio <br/>\nKazama(Katamori Matsudaira), Yumi Takigawa(Princesse Teru of Aizu),Masaomi <br/>\nKondo(Hijikata) etc...    , <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough many of us might regret absence of Saitou or Tokio in this film, <br/>\nwatching this one makes us imagine his or her presence, have an idea about what <br/>\nhappened during the siege of Aizu.<br/>\nI have to mention brief appearence of Tokio&#39;s brother Morinosuke Takagi as a <br/>\nmessenger.<br/>\n<br/>\nTama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
