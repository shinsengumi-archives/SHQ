My replies to you should be regarded as between<br/>\nsecretarytocapt3 to nlf7/seven and not the entire SHQ to nlf7/seven.<br/>\n<br/>\nas mentioned before, there are people on this list who I think are<br/>\nsomewhat knowledgeable and have tried to learn by reading, reading and<br/>\nreading...we use some really great English language texts <br/>\n<br/>\nthere are also those who have studied Japanese for several years (many<br/>\nhave stated that it takes nearly 10 years to read a modern day<br/>\nnewspaper without opening a dictionary even once), and even to this<br/>\nday some names on the shinsengumihq.com page were romanized<br/>\nincorrectly because even a well educated Japanese may choose to<br/>\ninterpret the name differently (this is the nature of the language)<br/>\n<br/>\nthus do not make assumptions about the collective intelligence of this<br/>\ngroup---although we are fandom I think we can surprise you (^___^)<br/>\n<br/>\nthis list is mostly Shinsengumi there is a sister list called<br/>\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/<br/>\nand<br/>\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/community/edo_meiji<br/>\nwhich can handle Aizu-studies<br/>\n<br/>\nthis livejournal blog also can handle Aizu questions<br/>\nhttp://yamaguchiyukiko.livejournal.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nhowever, it is my personal opinion that the Shinsengumi history in<br/>\nconnection to Aizu is very very fascinating too (but few have found it<br/>\nbecause it has not been portrayed in popular culture other than the<br/>\nfilm Byakkotai http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm) all we need<br/>\nis Nobuhiro Watsuki to do the &quot;Aizu Arc&quot; of the Shinsengumi and throw<br/>\nin some of our naginata wielding hot females and he has a hit on his hands<br/>\n<br/>\nAizu was just like any other domain during the Bakumatsu but I have to<br/>\nsay here that it has been ignored and devalued because of its military<br/>\nand political defeat---there is simply very few books/articles written<br/>\non it.  Any analysis on the domain is shallow and one should not be<br/>\nsurprised that no one has bothered to study the Shinsengumi in a<br/>\nprofessional manner.  If one can &quot;find&quot; Aizu in Bakumatsu texts---you<br/>\n*will* find the Shinsengumi!  I stated in the past that there is a<br/>\nscholar who is working on a book on Aizu and I have humbly suggested<br/>\n(ok beg) that he also write in the Shinsengumi&#39;s patronage by Aizu in<br/>\nKyoto...<br/>\n<br/>\nthis list is more focused on just the Shinsengumi so I hope to keep<br/>\nthis brief:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor nlf7/Seven and others who would like to learn about Aizu:<br/>\n<br/>\nsee http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography.htm<br/>\nclick on &quot;Aizu&quot; for the list<br/>\n<br/>\nWright, Diana E. &quot;Female Combatants and Japan&#39;s Meiji Restoration: the<br/>\ncase of Aizu&quot;  War in History 2001 v. 8 (4) pages 396-417 <br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/FemaleCombatantsAizu.pdf<br/>\n(look for Takagi Tokio and other famous samurai women)<br/>\nsee their tribute vid!  <br/>\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/TheLastSamuraiWomen.wmv<br/>\n<br/>\nby the way, Prof. Wright is very cool<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShimoda, Hiraku, PhD Dissertation.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1134059304\">nlf7:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to take this time to once again commend you on your desire<br/>\nfor accuracy. However, I&#39;d like to bring a detail to your attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou corrected the entry, saying that Aizu was besieged in September<br/>\n1868, to saying that it was besieged in October 1868. I presume you<br/>\nmeant the beginning of the siege. In this case, you are correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;On the morning of the 23rd day of the 8th month, the new government&#39;s<br/>\narmy quickly broke through Takizawa Pass and arrived at the castle<br/>\ntown.&quot; (page 176 of &quot;Aizu-han&quot;, by Noguchi Shin&#39;ichi)<br/>\n<br/>\n23rd day of the 8th (lunar) month. That being the case, if you now use<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,\">http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,</a> and put in the<br/>\ndate of &quot;1868/8/23&quot;, and select the lower option to convert from lunar<br/>\nto solar calendar, and then click on the button on the lower right of<br/>\nthe green box, that translates to, in our modern calendar: October 8,<br/>\n1868. You are correct in saying October for the *start* of the siege;<br/>\nobviously, the article says &quot;they were eventually besieged at Tsuruga<br/>\nCastle, the seat of the Aizu domain, in October 1868.&quot; Besieged, not<br/>\ndefeated; so again, that&#39;s absolutely correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, those who read this article should be mindful that the siege<br/>\ndid not end overnight; according to the timeline that appears on page<br/>\n15 of the text &quot;Sendai Boshin Senshi&quot; (written by Fujiwara Ainosuke in<br/>\n1911), as well as the timeline that appears on page 237 of the<br/>\ntimeline compiled by Itou Tetsuya in &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no<br/>\nSubete&quot;, the date for the surrender of Aizu is the 23rd day of the 9th<br/>\nlunar month, 1868. Another source, page 182 of text &quot;Aizu-han&quot;, gives<br/>\nthe date one day earlier-- the 22nd day of the 9th lunar month, 1868,<br/>\nas being the date when, as the text says (I&#39;m quoting directly here):<br/>\n&quot;Shin-seifugun to no kyouryoku ga nari, tsui ni kugatsu nijuuninichi,<br/>\nroujou ikkagetsu nishite koufuku to kimatta.&quot; Translated, that reads<br/>\n&quot;After negotiation with the new government&#39;s army, the surrender was<br/>\ndecided for the 22nd day of the 9th month, after the siege that lasted<br/>\na month.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n22nd or 23rd, it doesn&#39;t matter much. Two other sources say 9/23, and<br/>\nas the siege started on the 23rd of the 8th lunar month, and Noguchi<br/>\nsays &quot;after a siege that lasted a month&quot;, I will go with the 23rd.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being the case, if you again use<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,\">http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv,</a> and put in the<br/>\ndate of &quot;1868/9/23&quot; and use the same method to convert it, that<br/>\ntranslates to, in our modern calendar: November 6, 1868.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou were right to correct the start date of the siege from September<br/>\nto October, however, the siege did take a month in the lunar calendar,<br/>\nand just under a month by the Western calendar, to end. I don&#39;t say<br/>\nthis to lecture anybody, I merely respectfully wish to bring correct<br/>\ninformation to people&#39;s attention-- just as you wish to bring correct<br/>\ninformation to people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, please accept my thanks for your efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M.</div>",
