An argument like this is like saying <br/>\n  &gt; Kondo and the Shogun had slumber parties as children because <br/>\n  there&#39;s <br/>\n  &gt; no documentation saying they weren&#39;t friends, or that there <br/>\n  weren&#39;t <br/>\n  &gt; any slumber parties in Japan, yet both were in Edo during that <br/>\n  time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To be sure, my explanation was ambiguous. <br/>\n  I&#39;m sorry supposing it irritates you. <br/>\n  However, do you understand that there is a possible range in <br/>\n  reasoning? <br/>\n  Kondou and Sakamoto may be able to be friends in Edo.<br/>\n  However, Shogun is unable to perform slumber parties with Kondou.<br/>\n<br/>\n  First of all, is slumber parties the event performed where? <br/>\n  Is it Japan? Is it Asia? <br/>\n  It is the event performed in the place which is not the area.<br/>\n  Do you understand the situation of Japan of the time? <br/>\n  Japan of the Edo period had closed the relation with the world as <br/>\n  you knew. <br/>\n  To the beginning of the Edo period, Japan disliked Christianity, and <br/>\n  it broke off the relation with foreign countries.<br/>\n  On the conditions which do not put in Christianity, only the <br/>\n  Netherlands traded with Japan in Europe. <br/>\n  At first, Japan did not import any books. <br/>\n  However, in order to collect information from the time of 8th <br/>\n  Shogun, everything but a Christianity-related book came to be <br/>\n  imported. <br/>\n  Scholars studied those books and got to know Occidental advanced <br/>\n  civilization. <br/>\n  They taught the government the importance of national defense. <br/>\n  However, it was not understood and they were often persecuted as <br/>\n  people who make society uneasy. <br/>\n  Since the Occidental thing was studied, there are people who <br/>\n  received a traitor&#39;s dishonor.<br/>\n  Those who imitate Western civilization have risk of being regarded <br/>\n  as a foreign enemy&#39;s cooperator. <br/>\n  Surely, there are no data that Japan of the time did not have <br/>\n  slumber parties.<br/>\n  However, is it possible to carry out slumber parties to the time <br/>\n  when the prejudice over the West was severe sure enough? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Incidentally, the official name of Shogun is Seiitaishogun. <br/>\n  This means it as Shogun which expels a foreign enemy. <br/>\n  Shogun is the person who got this class and power from the Emperor <br/>\n  on condition that national defense. <br/>\n  (When the Black Ships came, Shogun was not able to expel them. <br/>\n  The authority of Shogun fell. From the Battle of Sekigahara, Chosyu <br/>\n  and Tosa which had a grudge against Tokugawa begin to move. And <br/>\n  confusion of Bakumatsu took place.)<br/>\n  Then, why does Shogun take the lead in an Occidental event, and <br/>\n  perform it? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Although I say again, there is a possible range in reasoning. <br/>\n  A possibility that a possibility that they were friends, and slumber <br/>\n  parties were performed is not equivalent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is the site which I found by chance with the occasion. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage2.nifty.com/mu-2001/tsu37.htm\">http://homepage2.nifty.com/mu-2001/tsu37.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  It is a Japanese site. <br/>\n  If this information was believed, when Kondou was alive, there was <br/>\n  no slumber parties even in the West.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  By the way, are Kondou and Shogun able to be friends? <br/>\n  I think that it is impossible.  <br/>\n  Surely, they were in Edo at the same time. <br/>\n  However, class becomes serious hindrance in order for them to become <br/>\n  friends. <br/>\n  As for their classes differing, the action range of them also <br/>\n  differs.<br/>\n  Although Sakamoto may exist in the action range of Kondo, Shogun is <br/>\n  not. <br/>\n  As Kondou cannot frequent Edo castle, Shogun cannot walk along the <br/>\n  city of Edo freely.<br/>\n  Where do they meet? <br/>\n  Moreover, is there any common friend who may connect Shogun with <br/>\n  Kondou?<br/>\n  The Edo period was status society.<br/>\n  A part of privileged people can meet Shogun, and Kondou&#39;s friends are<br/>\n  the farmers of Tama, or lower samurais. <br/>\n  Many hierarchies were between these two groups.<br/>\n  I jump over these and cannot think that there are those who connect <br/>\n  two persons. <br/>\n  Even if there is an opportunity for Kondou to meet Shogun, exceeding <br/>\n  such difficulties, Kondo cannot speak to Shogun directly.<br/>\n  The time cannot be associated without considering the other party&#39;s <br/>\n  status.<br/>\n  Is there any method of making friends with Shogun? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sakamoto was the lower samurai of Tosa.<br/>\n  He is the student who came to Edo for the art of fencing.<br/>\n  He walks along Edo freely and he talks to townsmen freely. <br/>\n  Katsura is the elite of Chosyu.<br/>\n  However, he is a free student, while coming to Edo and studying. <br/>\n  They walk along the action range of Kondou freely.<br/>\n  They are Dojo which they are studying, interchange with the students <br/>\n  who came from other domains, and extend a connection.<br/>\n  Or an eager student visits other Dojo positively and spreads <br/>\n  knowledge.<br/>\n  The common friend was actually in Kondou and Katsura.<br/>\n  Watanabe Nobori who was learning by the same Renpeikan as Katsura <br/>\n  was the friend of Katsura.<br/>\n  For aid of a game, he often went to Shieikan. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Surely, there is no proof that Kondou, Sakamoto, and Katsura were <br/>\n  friends.<br/>\n  There are very few possibilities that they were friends. <br/>\n  However, the possibility is not equivalent to a possibility of <br/>\n  saying that Kondou and Shogun were friends. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Incidentally, although it is a possibility that Okita will learn the <br/>\n  art of fencing from a foreigner, there is a problem of the action <br/>\n  range and a language.<br/>\n  However, let&#39;s overcome them miraculously and think that the <br/>\n  foreigner taught Okita the art of fencing.<br/>\n  He teaches kindly the technique which was excellent in the sword of <br/>\n  the foreign country where weight, form, and the usage are completely <br/>\n  different from a Japanese sword.<br/>\n  Is really it helpful to Okita&#39;s art of fencing?<br/>\n  The style of the fighter of countries other than Japan thinks that <br/>\n  most has a sword and a shield. <br/>\n  A Japanese samurai has a Japanese sword with both hands.<br/>\n  He performs attack and defense with a Japanese sword. <br/>\n  Although it is thin compared with an Occidental sword and bends <br/>\n  immediately, it cuts even the thing of terrible hardness. <br/>\n  Therefore, the art of fencing of Japan did not need a shield. <br/>\n  The art of fencing of Japan is the technique for a Japanese sword. <br/>\n  The technique for using it completely differs from the technique <br/>\n  for an Occidental sword. <br/>\n  Of course, it differs from China and other Asia.<br/>\n  He will get nothing, even if Okita learns the art of fencing from a <br/>\n  foreign fighter.  <br/>\n  If you plan to talk about possibility, after considering whether it <br/>\n  is really possible, you should talk. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  A setup that Kondo and Sakamoto were friends was blamed by many <br/>\n  researchers even in Japan. <br/>\n  Their worries were giving the knowledge in which it made a mistake <br/>\n  to people. <br/>\n  However, I think that their worries are unnecessary.<br/>\n  If interested in Shinsengumi, he will make an effort which he <br/>\n  investigates by himself.<br/>\n  If uninterested, he will forget, after a drama is completed. <br/>\n<br/>\n  momoiro-usagi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself! <br/>\n<br/>\nAlan if you would read what she wrote, she only stated that it was -not <br/>\nimpossible-. She never said, -that&#39;s how it was-. In fact, she wrote that she <br/>\nherself found it unlikely. There&#39;s a difference between stating something as <br/>\nabsolute fact and asking for people to keep an open mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe throw out some very odd ideas around here from time to time. My advice <br/>\nwould be to learn some tolerance. No one is going to appreciate or accept being <br/>\nblasted for stating their opinion or making a suggestion about some point. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure what history groups you may have been a part of in the past that <br/>\nwould accept such things, but that&#39;s a huge no-no around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour opinions are just as unsupported, BTW. And MOST movies I&#39;ve seen where I <br/>\nknew a great deal about the history take the same liberties. Ever see Young <br/>\nGuns? They get very basic facts about Billy the Kid and his buddies wrong, but <br/>\nI still enjoyed the movie. The same is true of nearly every Jack the Ripper <br/>\nmovie I&#39;ve seen. <br/>\n<br/>\n I enjoy the Shinsengumi drama. I don&#39;t CARE if it&#39;s accurate or not. <br/>\nPeaceMaker Kurogane and Rurouni Kenshin have the same sorts of problems, as Firuze <br/>\npointed out. Yet they are mainly responsible for making people aware of the <br/>\nShinsengumi in the first place. So they DO serve a purpose in my own humble <br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I want to stress to Momoiro-usagi how grateful I am that she took the <br/>\ntime to offer some insight to the behind-the-scenes stuff of the drama. It was <br/>\nmuch appreciated, as was all the other wonderful info you&#39;ve given us about <br/>\nthe Shinsengumi that we would not know otherwise. THANK YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279029960\">I&#39;d like to say something at this time, having heard this debate.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing an active scholar of history, specifically Japanese history, in <br/>\ncollege, and on a track that will take me further and further into the <br/>\nacademic realm of studying this stuff for a living, I can tell you a few <br/>\nthings:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Japanese history, like all history around the world, is a bloody mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. History is written by the victors. Why do you think the Shinsengumi is so <br/>\nhard to research, much less write serious papers on? I know this for a <br/>\nfact-- I wanted to write my senior thesis on them, but I&#39;ve had to &quot;enlarge&quot; <br/>\nmy topic because Shinsengumi is too &quot;small&quot;. I&#39;m going to write about Aizu <br/>\ninvolvement in the Bakumatsu, which will include Shinsengumi and <br/>\nMimawarigumi, but even that will run into some problems, because we still <br/>\nlive in a world where Katsura, Takasugi, and Miyabe are the &quot;great men&quot;, <br/>\ninstead of everyone in that era being individually judged for their own <br/>\nworth.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. People from a culture generally know their own history the best. Trust me <br/>\non this-- if you&#39;ve learned something from the very very beginning of your <br/>\nlife, and if you&#39;ve learned it as part of your identity, then you are <br/>\nDEFINITELY going to know it better than someone who starts learning it from <br/>\nthe outside and later.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. The best avenue for historical discussion is calm, logical, preferably <br/>\nfriendly, and preferably light-hearted debate. Why scream at each other? Try <br/>\nto keep things in perspective, and remember-- it&#39;s HISTORY. It happened, and <br/>\nyou can&#39;t change what happened. However, just because it happened doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean it&#39;s over. History is being rewritten all the time-- this group is <br/>\nliving proof of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to extend my thanks to each and every member of this group for <br/>\nproviding me, probably the only historian in the East Asian Studies major on <br/>\nmy campus, with an avenue for expression. This group is priceless for <br/>\nme...here, I have all the peers and discussion partners in Japanese history <br/>\nthat I almost never had before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, thank you, thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>",

Oh, and that I&#39;m incidentally a Muslim too. So, you can guess I have quite a bit to say about the white male  and its inferiority complex myself. <br/>\nOh, who knows? Maybe I think this way just because I recall  the fact that Latin America endured 124 invasions by American forces since 1824 to 1994... ( included the nice interventions of Kissinger endorsing and encouraging torture in the area). Or who knows? Maybe is the nice discussion around Kippling&#39;s The White Man&#39;s Burden after the Sates invasion of Philippines (1899) and the American-Spanish war... Mark Twain opinions are very entertaining.  See? I&#39;m REALLY an history freak, you know....<br/>\n <br/>\nDon&#39;t like NHK drama? Ok, you are in your right. You stopped to watch it?

The two of them have lived extensive periods in Japan, and actually one of them is still actually living there after having just finished her thesis, involving the Meiji period, precisely.<br/>\n <br/>\nHaving said this, you can imagine that we were SLIGHTY irked at the liberality shown by the writers of the drama concerning the &#39;everybody had met everybody and had been pals just before the actual revolution&#39;. We had two choices: stopping watching it altogether, or make abstraction of the said historical horrors.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe chose the second path. You see, the reasoning behind it is the same why we enjoy fanfiction. It&#39;s fiction, playing with actual history.<br/>\nBattousai never existed, right? Soujirou never killed Okubo, or am I wrong? <br/>\nBut even then, we can enjoy Watsuki&#39;s work. At least, I know I do. They key in this is knowing the actual facts, and separating them from fiction. I know that due the massive impact the media have over viewers, the inaccurate handling of the facts have a repercussion in how they perceive the real facts later. An example: take The Alamo. It&#39;s historically more accurate than the J. Wayne  version. However, it was its downfall. People hated it because of the darker aspects of the real history.<br/>\nThis is not happening in Japan though, with this drama. In fact, the ratings are lower than other samurai dramas of similar length, just because of these inaccuracies. <br/>\n <br/>\nObviously, outside Japan, it can affect how viewers perceive the unfolding of the real events, but I believe that even the most naive viewer would shake his/her head knowing that it&#39;s kind of impossible that all the main characters knew each other previously. maybe they KNEW each other swordsman&#39;s reputation, the name of their dojos, have crossed in challenges, etc. But certainly they didn&#39;t foster friendships. JMO.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think I understand why they (the writers) choose this path. Both parties wanted essentially the same: to be independent , to avoid the horrors of Western dominance in neighboring China, and to become a strong, developed nation. The means and path to follow were what they clashed. After all, the bearers of the &#39;expel the foreigners, revere the Emperor&#39; were ironically those who opened the doors to the contact with the West. But what their tactics allowed Japan to do it more or less in its own terms. Trying to keep Japan absolutely closed to the world would have prompted  a reaction very similar to what China suffered during and after the Opium Wars. I think the Shogunate had this in mind during the turbulent times that lead to the Bakumatsu, and that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t act with the haste required by the Chosuu party. And obviously, there was a social/cultural decadence that required a social reform too. If you watch the drama, you&#39;ll see that they hint at least twice that both<br/>\n parties had common points and ideas. Personally, I think the scenario where the members of both parties are shown socializing is a symbolism, a way to make people understand that both wanted a better, stronger and independent Japan. Also, you&#39;ll see the social barriers and tenets that time required to be changed. Now, to understand this, I think it&#39;s necessary to grasp a basic knowledge of the actual history...<br/>\n <br/>\nMy advice is to take it all with a grain of salt (a BIG one), and do serious research. The fabulous recourses in this ML and the associated sites are a good start. Newbies can consult the list or recommended readings in this ML to have a wider vision. Consider the drama as a big, big and expensive fanfic, showing chapters every week.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, Alan, if you can&#39;t enjoy it like this, it would be better to stop watching it ASAP, because you&#39;ll surely find yourself very frustrated, as I was in the beginning....
