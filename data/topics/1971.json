THE GODDESSES of INDIA, TIBET, CHINA and <br/>\nJAPAN<br/>\nCesara Publications<br/>\n<br/>\npage 452<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Inari, offices and titles: Vixen Goddess, Associated Places: Japan, <br/>\nKyoto<br/>\n<br/>\nINari the Fox Goddess is associated wiht the fire and smithcraft.  <br/>\nWhen referring to her, Chamerlain writes of &#39;the assistance rendered <br/>\nby that deity to the famous swordsmith Kojaki, for whom she blew the <br/>\nbellows while he was forgina sword for an ancient Mikado.&#39;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe worship of Inari is mentioned by Chamberlain in his description <br/>\nof the places of pilgrimages in Japan;  he states that the &quot;great <br/>\nKyoto temple of the fox-deity Inari has a branch in almost every <br/>\nvillage&#39;.  This animal is considered in Japan to be of great magical <br/>\nimportance.<br/>\n<br/>\nJapanese women, according to Harrison&#39;s account, attach great <br/>\nimportance to foxes &#39;and take great pains to be on the....side of the <br/>\ngoddess Inari.&#39;  The same author also states that &#39;Geisha dn women of <br/>\npleasure are sometimes colloquially spoken of as kitsune (i.e. <br/>\nfoxes)&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the greater festivals of the Japanese Calendar, Chamberlain <br/>\nincludes the first day of the Horse (Hatsu-uma) in February, a <br/>\nmoveable feast, holy &#39;to the Fox-Goddess Inari&#39;.  Again on November <br/>\nthe 8th, the Festival of the Goddess of the Kitchen Range fires are <br/>\nlighted in honour of Inari and other deities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis goddess may have some connexion with the vixen, Aunt Piety, of <br/>\nChina.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI found the above mentioned info on Inari because I was checking info <br/>\non MARISHITEN...you can read more about her here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm54.showMessage?\">http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm54.showMessage?</a><br/>\ntopicID=28.topic</div>",
