I also<br/>\nhappen to love PMK Saitou&#39;s hair :) and how Nanae draws people&#39;s hair.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Reminder*<br/>\nA LOVE STORY OF SAITOU HAJIME (sadly, it seems the the writer for Kaze<br/>\nHikaru beat us to it---the story is about a young lady who literally<br/>\ncan&#39;t keep her hands off of S.H.! &lt;&lt;&lt; how&#39;s that for a teaser?)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fifay.net/projects/lovestory01.html\">http://www.fifay.net/projects/lovestory01.html</a></div>",
