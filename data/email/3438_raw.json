Color w=\r\nas spectacular.  Digital opening \nand closing is superb for a work with thi=\r\ns budget.\n\nChoreography\nGREAT!  This is due to the fact that the cast has s=\r\nome experienced actors \non board and it really paid off.  You have to watch=\r\n some of the movements \ncarefully because there are some good details in th=\r\ne fight scene.\n\nStory\nThe story may have been based on the Buddhist saying:=\r\n When you meet \nthe Buddha, kill the Buddha (you can imagine the multitude =\r\nof \ninterpretations for this, it is based on non-attachment and killing wit=\r\nhin \nyour mind, killing all sentiment towards someone psychologically--not =\r\n\nnecessarily literally killing---although in the Lone Wolf and Cub comic th=\r\nere \nwas a more gross interpretation).  Anyways in this film there is a tie=\r\n in \nwith the phrase but you need to replace the word Buddha with &quot;sensei&quot;.=\r\n  \n\nThe film&#39;s content was actually closer to 10 min and in that short amou=\r\nnt \nof time there was a good narrative.  Honestly I&#39;ve seen MUCH WORST and =\r\n\nso this film, IMHO, gets a solid &quot;A&quot;.  It&#39;s every manga fan&#39;s dream and ye=\r\nt \nit tries to kick up all the cliches we&#39;ve seen a hundred times a bit hig=\r\nher (in \na good way).  \n\nRather than opting for the &quot;supergirl&quot; angle, what=\r\n you get is a gritty and \nraw work without going overboard with the &quot;styliz=\r\ned&quot; movements we see \nin modern j-popish samurai movies (such as the forget=\r\ntable blood-fest \nAZUMI).  In fact it&#39;s better to watch a 10 min story whic=\r\nh gets to the point, \nhas some elegant action rather than buy a dvd of AZUM=\r\nI.\n\nIt&#39;s my understanding that the filmmaker greatly condensed the entire \n=\r\nscript due to lack of a budget (something from 10K to 5K) and yet he still =\r\n\nmanaged to create something to be proud of. If it was the filmmaker&#39;s \nint=\r\nent to demonstrate he can direct action (with one camera and a minimal \ncre=\r\nw), then he certainly succeeded.\n\nSo today, don&#39;t buy coffee and a pastry..=\r\n.just buy this movie and have your \npastry.  You&#39;ll be glad you did (AND) y=\r\nou&#39;ll be supporting an indy filmmaker \ntoo.\n\n\n\n"
