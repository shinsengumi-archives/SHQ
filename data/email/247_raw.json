I think that the two ML and the we=\r\nbsite are very nice ideas and that they=92ll certainly help us, Shinsengumi=\r\n fans, to easily access tons of information. I=92m amaze by how fast everyt=\r\nhing is getting organised and I really appreciate reading all of those post=\r\ns, even if sometimes, I wonder how I=92m going to find the time to read the=\r\nm all. The ML have been quite busy, but that=92s not a bad thing at all. (^=\r\n-^)\n\nIf I can, I=92ll try, in the future, to add my little contribution.
