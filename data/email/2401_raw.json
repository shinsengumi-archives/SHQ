(I need to verify this so that I don&#39;t screw up on my fanfic ^^;;;)  \n\nI think it&#39;s very unlikely.   Katsura/Kido opposed  the suggestion of military action on Kyoto  - and by extension any more extreme measures he would not likely have favored. \n \nRegarding the countercoup (From &quot;Choshu in the Meiji Restoration&quot; by Albert M. Craig  )\n\n-&quot;Sufu opposed it, but so also did Takasugi; Nakamura Kyuro, an important member of the Sufu clique, favored it, as did Kusaka.&quot;... (page 223)\n\n-&quot;Kido and Yamagata, as well as Takasugi, opposed the idea of a countercoup at this time.  Kijima, like Shoin, demanded action because there ought to be action; he gave little thought to its consequences.&quot;\n\nAhh and a very oblique reference to Ikedaya-da. (pg 227)\n\n&quot;On 14/6/64 (June 14, 1684) news came of Bakufu police action against loyalist samurai in Kyoto, in which several Choshu samurai had been slain, among them prominent members of the Choshu loyalist group.&quot;  \n\n\nS\nred-bird.org\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
