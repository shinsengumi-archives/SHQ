I was just wondering if anyone knew what the different \n&gt; colors of the Shinsengumi uniform meant? I know that there&#39;s the \n&gt; standard blue one, but I&#39;ve also seen a black one and a white one.\n\n\nNow, the real Shinsengumi uniform does not remain. \nBlue haori which we look at with an image is the clothes which \nresearchers produced based on testimony of people of those days. \nTherefore, nobody knows whether really the Shinsengumi uniform was \nthat form. \n\nIncidentally that haori was made of hempen cloth. \nA hempen kimono is a kimono for summer. \nI think that it is from June to September that they wore that haori.\nMembers stopped wearing it after Ikedaya.\n(In fact, it is about one year that they wore that haori, after \nforming Shinsengumi.) \nWhen Itou Kashotarou who wears haori of silk crape joined \nShinsengumi, the haori did not already exist^_^\n \nTheir uniform after a blue haori is stopped is not known well. \nAt testimony of a certain Shishi, it seemed to be the black haori \nand the black hakama. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
