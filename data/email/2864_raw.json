Just by looking at\nthe kanji, =\r\nI can tell that it could be read any of a number of ways:\n&quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;, &quot;Fus=\r\nayoshi&quot;, &quot;Fusanaga&quot;, &quot;Nobuyoshi&quot;, and so on-- the\nconfusing nature of which=\r\n gave rise to Souji&#39;s formal name being read\nby some as &quot;Fusanaga&quot;. Much li=\r\nke how the characters used to spell the\nlast shogun Yoshinobu&#39;s name can be=\r\n read &quot;Yoshihisa&quot;, &quot;Yoshinobu&quot;, or\n&quot;Keiki&quot;-- which, as I&#39;ve found in the Un=\r\nited States government&#39;s\ndiplomatic records of that period, confused foreig=\r\nners to no end.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that that name should be read &quot;K=\r\naneyoshi&quot;,\nwhat I had said earlier regarding Rintaro Fusamasa still holds t=\r\nrue:\neven though the reading is different, the kanji itself-- read &quot;Fusa&quot;\ni=\r\nn Rintaro&#39;s case, or &quot;Kane&quot; in Souji&#39;s case-- is the same. Which is\nsomethi=\r\nng in support of what you&#39;ve been saying (as quoted in Mori&#39;s\nwork) regardi=\r\nng Souji&#39;s closeness to Rintaro Fusamasa. Souji may or\nmay not have receive=\r\nd that kanji from/in honor of Rintaro Fusamasa;\nhowever, usually in a famil=\r\ny, to have two people with the same\ncharacter in their names is not coincid=\r\nence. Case in point-- (despite\nthe fact that in this case, the reading of t=\r\nhe character is\nconsistent) much of the lineage of the Matsudaira lords of =\r\nAizu had\nthe character &quot;Kata&quot; in their names (Katasada, Katanobu, Katamori,=\r\n and\nso on).\n\nAs always, my thanks for your efforts.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
