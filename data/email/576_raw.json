By the way the prof. is not some kind of weirdo \nradical.\n\nI always thought about the significance of the firstname &quot;Hajime&quot; it \nis a verb and you hear it everywhere including kendo tournaments and \nstuff and daily life. Belief systems which emphasize impermanence \nstate that a basic example that people &quot;begin&quot; again every breathe \nthey take due to the laws of impermanence.  Even your state of \nmind/mood changes by the second so you begin and end every second of \nyour life. Hence you can&#39;t attache your identity/ego to your \nmind...just sharing.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n&gt; that. It&#39;s actually very critical of the U. S. decision to use the \nbomb.  When I \n&gt; get time, I&#39;ll find out the exact title, author, etc. for those \nwho might be \n&gt; interested in hearing the other side of the story. \n\n\n\n"
