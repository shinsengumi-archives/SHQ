However there are still several Captains and other fairly well-\nknown members who are still available, among them Harada Sanosuke \n(surprisingly). And so far NO ONE has volunteered to be part of the \nIshin! Not even a taker from the RK folks for Hitokiri Battousai!\n\nAlright folks, we know some of you out there have got to want to \nplay! No need to worry if you&#39;re holding out because you don&#39;t \nconsider yourself to be &quot;knowledgeable&quot; enough about the Shinsengumi. \nWe&#39;re not following exact history here. In fact, history has pretty \nmuch alreay gone out the window! Just the basics you&#39;ve picked up \nfrom here and by watching RK and PMK will do. That&#39;s really all you \nneed to know. And the game isn&#39;t all that time consuming either. I&#39;m \ninvolved with another RPG and I&#39;m not having to devote nearly the \ntime I originally feared to it. We all have lives to lead off the \ninternet after all.\n\nIf you want to check out the community later (once the game has \nstarted, which it has not yet) the url is:\nhttp:/www.livejournal.com/community/miburo_lair\n\nCome on folks! We can&#39;t have all cowboys and no indians! Someone \nneeds to take on the roles of Katsura, Takasugi, Sakamoto, Saigo, \nOkubo, the four hitokiri, Yoshida. We&#39;re even accepting Hitokiri \nBattousai (further proof history has long since been disregarded).\nDoesn&#39;t anyone want to be the bad guys? Or is that the good guys? LOL!\n\nSo far the list of taken characters is:\n\nHijikata - MissBehavin\nIto - Barb\nSuzuki (Miki) - Phil\nSaitou - Angrybee\nKondou - Wounds\nOkita - Aurus\nNagakura - Masayoshi\nAyunee - Sherlgirl\nYamanami - Tama\nTakeda - Sanada\n\nAll others are up for grabs.\n\n-MissBehavin aka Toshizo Hijikata \n\n\n"
