Very little is know=\r\nn about his origin. \nAlthough he was said to be an illegitimate child of a =\r\nfeudal lord, it is debatable. \n(Yamamura, 179-180)\n\nTodo was a practitioner=\r\n of the Hokushin Itto-ryu, trained at Chiba Shusaku Narimasa&#39;s \ndojo. (Yama=\r\nmura, 181) However, according to some sources, he was trained at Ito \nKashi=\r\ntar?&#39;s dojo instead. (Yamamura, 182)\n\nIn around 1862, he started &quot;taking hi=\r\ns meals&quot; at Kondou Isami&#39;s Shieikan.(Nagakura, 20\n-21)\n\n=3D=3DShinsengumi P=\r\neriod=3D=3D\nIn 1863, Todo joined the Roshigumi with Kondo and other members=\r\n of the Shieikan. \n(Yamamura, 185) After the Shinsengumi was formed, Todo f=\r\nirst became a fukuchou jokin \n(assistant vice commander) and then became th=\r\ne captain of the eighth unit in 1865. \n(Yamamura, 186)\n\nTodo received a wou=\r\nnd on his forehead during the Ikedaya Jiken on July 8, 1864. \n(Yamamura, 17=\r\n7)\n\n=3D=3DDeath=3D=3D\nTodo was killed during the Aburakoji Affair on Decemb=\r\ner 13, 1867.(Yamamura, 189)\n\nAccording to Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi=\r\n Tenmatsuki&quot;, Kondo had wished to spare \nTodo&#39;s life. (Nagukura, 144) Howev=\r\ner, Todo was killed by a new member, Miura \nTsunesaburo, whom did not know =\r\nthe circumstances.
