As you stipulated in your previous essay, and I\ndo agree with you, when Goro married Tokio, Tokio had\nlost practically everything, what had he to gain? What\nmany people don&#39;t like about old-fashioned Japanese\nlove stories (they are thinking from a modern\nperspective on such things) is that Japanese love\nstories were often of illicit relationships. A man and\nhis geisha mistress. A lady separated from her true\nlove to be married to a lord. But infidelity in any\nform, I suppose, is not our &#39;modern&#39; ideal concept of\ntrue love. Japanese people, as in many other countries\nback then, did not marry for love, but for\npracticality, especially among the samurai classes.\nThat&#39;s not saying that married couples didn&#39;t love\neach other, but I know, even from my own grandparents&#39;\nexperiences, that love had little to do with the\nactual concept of marriage back then. Even now,\nmatchmaking (o-miai in Japanese) is common. When I\ndescribed my story as old-fashioned Japanese\nromanticism, I was taking these factors into account.\n*Then again, I may be biased because I have my own\nfictional* interpretation of why Tokio was adopted by\nthe Kurasawa family, and how the eventual marriage of\nGoro and Tokio came about and how Yaso fit into the\npicture.(Though whether anyone here is actually\nfollowing the story, I just don&#39;t know.) \n\n*lurks back into the shadows, but with the very best\nwishes for all* \n\n-------------------------------------------\nHow to speculate like a professional fangirl\n\nQuestion: &quot;What are the details of Fujita Goro and\nShinoda Yaso&#39;s\ndivorce?&quot;\n\na) Yaso divorced Goro\nb) Goro divorced Yaso\nc) they divorced *each *other (like millions of people\nall over the\nworld) because they couldn&#39;t get along\nd) there was a vast Aizu conspiracy to destroy the\ncouple and match\nGoro with Tokio, even though the domain had nothing to\ngain from such\na marriage \ne) we don&#39;t really know\n\ne) is correct \n\nbut you can LEARN MORE YOURSELF by looking at the\nSAITOU HAJIME\nTRANSLATIONS right here at our mailing list &quot;FILES&quot;\ndownload all the\ndocs and read it carefully.  The translations are from\na Japanese\nwebsite---this website was chosen specifically because\nshe used the\ntexts available regarding Saitou Hajime she even\nbothered to build a\nbibliography at her site.  Her speculations are\nclearly  separated\nfrom the historical facts (mostly drawn from the work\nof Shizuko Akama).\n\nyou may also use history to help you speculate for\nexample you may\nstudy divorce and marriage in that era and look at the\ntexts available\n \nhttp://www.hajimenokizu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=777#777\n\nalot of things will begin to make sense once you\nunderstand the\nhistorical context---the more you read the more your\nspeculation will\nchange over time---to remain static in your opinion\nwhen texts point\nto a different direction will not help you (unless you\nare writing a\nwork of fiction in which case you can write whatever\nyou want).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nNEW Yahoo!
