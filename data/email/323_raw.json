Many\npeople initially and understandably believed that the Shinsengumi\nkilled Ryoma Sakamoto because they did attempt to arrest him earlier\nbut failed.  I have read on 2 Japanese sites that Saitou Hajime was\nrelated to someone in the Mimawarigumi [this may be speculation ok it\nmay not be true at all--you&#39;ve been warned :)]\n\n*Romulus Hillsborough will address the above mentioned controversy in\nhis book on the Shinsengumi (in ENGLISH) which will be released this fall!\n\n3)Tokubetsu Koto (Tokko) Keisatsu (?) I&#39;m not sure if this is another\ngroup...whenever the Shinsengumi are mentioned this name follows so\nI&#39;m assuming they had a similar role.\n\n*I&#39;m sure there were more groups out there...Kyoto is a huge city I\nalways wondered how they managed to patrol it by foot and if these\ngroups had &quot;turf wars&quot;\n\n***WATCH Jin Roh: the Wolf Brigade***\nIt is very much like the story of Yamanami&Spy\n\n\n--- In edojidai@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tokugawa Hirotada&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Everyone (metaphorically speaking)knows about the Shinsengumi-- but\n&gt; what about the other patrol group in Kyoto-- the Mimawarigumi? If\n&gt; anyone out there has any information on them, it&#39;d be great to learn\n&gt; more. So far, all I have is the following: as with the Shinsengumi,\n&gt; they operated under the auspices of the Kyoto Military Commission, and\n&gt; the commander was a man named Sasaki Tadasaburou, a master of the\n&gt; kodachi (short sword). That&#39;s about it...\n&gt;\n&gt; --Hirotada\n\n\n\n"
