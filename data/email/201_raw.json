Serve the shogun with single-minded devotion. Do not measure your loyalty \nby the standard of other domains. If any Aizu daimyo is disloyal to the \nTokugawa house, he is no descendant of mine, and on no account are you to \nobey him.\n\n2. Do not neglect military readiness.\n\n3. Take as fundamental the Way of the Samurai.\n\n4. Do not confuse the duties of higher and lower ranks.\n\n5. Older brothers should be respected and younger brothers loved.\n\n6. The words of women should be totally disregarded.\n\n7. Lawbreakers should not be treated with leinience.\n\n8. Other than elders (&quot;karo&quot;-- high-ranking retainers), no one should have a \nvoice in determining punishments and rewards.\n\n9. If a retainer acts beyond his station, he should be dealt with strictly.\n\n10. The money and rice set aside for emergencies are to be used for the \ncommon people, and only in times of famine.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet reliable access on MSN 9 Dial-up. 3 months for the price of 1! \n(Limited-time offer) \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
