They were at Tennozan in Osaka-- \nhttp://www.rekishikaido.gr.jp/time-trip/gengo/eng/tennozan.htm. Important \nsite in the Sengoku for the  Battle of Yamazaki  (hmm...), was still a \nstrategic site in the Edo Period.\n\n- Matsudaira of Aizu are listed with the Sakai as being based at Ezo \nMatsumae (Hokkaido), defending against the Russians. Another Matsudaira had \neast Ezo, and Satake Ukyo-dayuu had west Ezo.\n\n-There were 11-- count &#39;em-- ELEVEN clans in Kyoto.\n\nShiba Gorou&#39;s &quot;Remembering Aizu&quot; puts this at 1806 earliest. I think that \nwas around the time of Oshio Heihachirou&#39;s rice riots in Osaka-- hence \npeople like Yamanouchi in Osaka and 11 clans in Kyoto. Remember, the Oshio \nrice riots are the precursors for the Ee Ja Nai Ka craze of 1868...\n\nWill update as I decipher more.\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
