Maybe after WW2 during the occupation the division\nhad to redefine itself so that it could continue to exist.\n\nPublic Security Division perhaps *transformed* into Public Security\nInvestigation Agency (PSIA) officially &quot;founded&quot; in 1952?  Just an\nidea....\n\nhttp://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/PSIA/psia-01.html\nhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/japan/koancho.htm\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;momomanjyuu2004&quot; &lt;momomanjyuu2004@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; (There is the rumor. There is an opinion that he is related to \n&gt; establishment of the public security division. Although the \n&gt; Metropolitan Police Department has his detailed curriculum vitae, it \n&gt; does not open to the public.)\n\n\n"
