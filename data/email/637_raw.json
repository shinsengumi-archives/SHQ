The best place to find \nbittorrent links would be www.animesuki.com. Here&#39;s the link direct \nto the PMK page in Animesuki... \n\nhttp://www.animesuki.com/series.php/267.html\n\nGot to hurry though since once ADV announces they&#39;ve licensed the \nanime, fansubs links for download will disappear. That&#39;s how \nfansubbers show support and respect to licensers.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, GCW &lt;saitohworship@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sorry, you prolly already mentioned this , but where did u \ndownload the\n&gt; anime?  i must be missing a lot of posts!  oh yeah, whoever had \nsent thhe\n&gt; page for the PMK contest, thank you very much!!!!!  I&#39;ll submit my \ndear,\n&gt; dear Yamazaki -sama ^^;;;  \n&gt; Thankx in advance, Grace!\n&gt; ~Saitohworship\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Grace Battista &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; You probably already know.. But for those who do not..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well I was just over at animenewsnetwork forum and was I \nsurprised! \n&gt; &gt; Geez go away for some weeks and miss out on things... ^_^*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ADV has announced that it will license 1000 volumes (not titles) \nof \n&gt; &gt; manga, so far 37 had gone through and this includes Peacemaker \n&gt; &gt; Kurogane. I could not find reference to whether they will be \n&gt; &gt; translating the prequel SIMP but translation of the second part \nPMK \n&gt; &gt; is ongoing. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; About the Anime, ADV (at least from what I know right now) has \nnot \n&gt; &gt; announced ownership of the Anime but there are rumors that they \nare \n&gt; &gt; or very soon will be dubbing the series... Wow that was fast. If \n&gt; &gt; this is true then I&#39;m glad I got the fansub version first. \nUnless \n&gt; &gt; ADV announces they officially licensed PMK Anime then I guess \nthe \n&gt; &gt; distribution of fansubs by fansubbers won&#39;t stop till then. So \nglad \n&gt; &gt; though that someone is picking up the manga because that means \nthe \n&gt; &gt; DVDs will be out soon, probably on or after fall this year. \n&gt; &gt; WAI!!! :O)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; Saitoh Worship\n&gt; ~Anime Mystique~\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
