I&#39;m new here. After reading that quote by\n&gt; Emperor Meiji, all I have to say is &#39;whoa, what\n&gt; audacity&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shimazu Masayoshi &lt;patriot014@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:(Quoted from &quot;The Last Shogun&quot;, by Shiba\n&gt; Ryuutarou)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Just before he died, his physician leaned over the\n&gt; pillow and asked,\n&gt; &quot;Are you in pain?&quot; Yoshinobu answered faintly, in an\n&gt; extremely\n&gt; accurate description of his condition: &quot;No, I am\n&gt; just weak. The pain\n&gt; is gone.&quot; Those were his last words. A few minutes\n&gt; later, at 4:10 PM\n&gt; on November 21, 1913, he was gone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was stunned when I read this.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No, I am just weak. The pain is gone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that he was sick, but these words, in my\n&gt; opinion, have a deeper\n&gt; meaning as well. As someone who is currently writing\n&gt; a book that is\n&gt; partly about the Tokugawa and what _might_ have\n&gt; been, it hurt to read\n&gt; these words. What hurt and stung even more was\n&gt; reading what Emperor\n&gt; Meiji said to Ito Hirobumi (the Prime minister),\n&gt; after having received\n&gt; Yoshinobu at the new Imperial Palace (formerly Edo\n&gt; Castle), and having\n&gt; bestowed upon him the rank of Koshaku (marquis):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yesterday I was finally able to do something to\n&gt; show my gratitude to\n&gt; Yoshinobu. I ought to be grateful; after all, I took\n&gt; the country away\n&gt; from him!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrogant little snot....\n&gt; \n&gt; --Masayoshi(stalks away muttering about the Imperial\n&gt; house)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; visit \n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n&gt; \n&gt; our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
