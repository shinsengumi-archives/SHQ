That would take alo=\r\nt of money and time due to the \n&gt; need of assembling a team of translators.=\r\n  So I cannot really say his \n&gt; information is bad.  However in terms of *s=\r\ncholarship* the book \n&gt; approaches the topic by using themes.  Instead of t=\r\nhe cause and effect \n&gt; of historical circumstances he for instance highligh=\r\nts the ambitions \n&gt; of the Shinsengumi.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; it is just not well writt=\r\nen, Is it a reliable historical reference? \n&gt; Or\n&gt; &gt; are there just issues =\r\nwith the conclusions he draws?  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Personally I think his work is ve=\r\nry immature due to the sarcasm he \n&gt; constantly uses to describe the Shinse=\r\nngumi.  If he wanted to write a \n&gt; text on history such a tone is entirely =\r\ninappropriate.  I think he did \n&gt; not use the most recent nor best sources.=\r\n..as Hillsborough \n&gt; knows..there are MANY books on the Shinsengumi\n&gt; \n&gt; fo=\r\nr example:  http://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography2.htm\n&gt; you will see b=\r\nooks which have collected letters written by the \n&gt; Shinsengumi\n&gt; \n&gt; Hillsb=\r\norough should have used those books to create a more complete \n&gt; narrative\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; the author also noted that his book is not 100% &quot;historical&quot; because \n=\r\n&gt; as he fairly noted---writing such a book on the Shinsengumi would be \n&gt; i=\r\nncredibly difficult\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe he should add that his heroes, the Ishin Shi=\r\nshi were 100% \n&gt; responsible for &quot;revising&quot; Japan&#39;s history and suppressing=\r\n what \n&gt; the &quot;other side&quot; (losers) had to say---THAT IS WHY IT IS HARD TO W=\r\nRITE \n&gt; A BOOK ON THE SHINSENGUMI.  Alot of info has been lost, destroyed o=\r\nr \n&gt; still hidden.  Even some descendents of the Shinsengumi today feel \n&gt; =\r\ninconvenienced to discuss their ancestors.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m starting to\n&gt; &gt; read up=\r\n on the Shinsengumi with a few Japanese books on the way via\n&gt; &gt; amazon.co.=\r\njp, but it is always nice to get a foundation in my native\n&gt; &gt; language. I =\r\nchecked the archives here, and it seems that people tend\n&gt; &gt; to dislike it,=\r\n but I&#39;d probably have to read every post to get the\n&gt; &gt; full picture, so I=\r\n hope you don&#39;t mind me cheating with a direct \n&gt; question.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think ma=\r\nny of us dislike it not because Hillsborough holds a \n&gt; different opinion o=\r\nn the Shinsengumi.  For me personally, I was \n&gt; angered by the fact that \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 1) he was writing the FIRST BOOK IN ENGLISH on the Shinsengumi---\n&gt; tec=\r\nhnically it makes his text &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.  Rather than providing \n&gt; a st=\r\nraight up text which is both neutral in tone and helpful in \n&gt; establishing=\r\n a foundation for future serious research he comes across \n&gt; as a bitter ma=\r\nn annoyed by the popularity of the Shinsengumi.  I \n&gt; would&#39;ve been eternal=\r\nly grateful if he was a bit civil in his text.  \n&gt; And imagine how much mon=\r\ney he can make if he followed up with an \n&gt; attempted biography of let&#39;s sa=\r\ny Okita?  The man shot himself in the \n&gt; foot IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) He abused that =\r\ngolden opportunity of being the first western author \n&gt; to introduce the gr=\r\noup in text by using the Shinsengumi to prove his \n&gt; own personal view that=\r\n the restoration was glorious and led by \n&gt; infallible idealists who were n=\r\not filled with personal ambition, greed \n&gt; or &quot;propensity to kill&quot; ---we kn=\r\now this to be innaccurate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hillsborough is a blatant Ishin &quot;worshipper=\r\n&quot; and fanboy who thinks \n&gt; that he is ripping the mask off the Shinsengumi =\r\nHEROES.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, Hillsborough is not aware of the fact that even=\r\n \n&gt; Shinsengumi fans have a mature view of the miburo and their record.  \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; We know they were not perfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; We get it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hillsborough should=\r\n put his journalism background to use and \n&gt; investigate his own &quot;heroes&quot; a=\r\nnd what foundation they laid for Japan!\n&gt; \n&gt; A Japan which was neither demo=\r\ncratic, nor enlightened.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1868 was the restoration of feudalism.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf he feels that the Shinsengumi were just the dogs of the \n&gt; bakufu...why d=\r\nid he write a book on them?  If they held historical \n&gt; significance why di=\r\nd he simplify their narrative so much?\n&gt; \n&gt; Because the Shinsengumi were/ar=\r\ne a hot topic and he wanted a piece of \n&gt; the pie.\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3 (i=\r\nncredibly hormonal today)\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S.  Shinsengumihq.com has quoted Hillsboro=\r\nugh&#39;s book extensively.  \n&gt; We have fans who did find the book very useful =\r\nand therefore we have \n&gt; not posted harsh criticism of his work anywhere on=\r\n our site.\n&gt; I respect HIllsborough for some &quot;effort&quot; and the fact that he =\r\nhas \n&gt; studied Japanese for 15 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact our home page recommends=\r\n the book because gosh darnit there is \n&gt; no other book to overshadow his t=\r\next.\n&gt; \n&gt; we tried our best to be fair and direct people to what is &quot;out th=\r\nere&quot; \n&gt; without making our personal opinion a deciding factor.\n&gt;\n\n\n"
