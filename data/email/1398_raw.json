It&#39;s also \nsaid that he was 10 years younger than Kondo, who was born in 1834. \nBut is this absolutely true?\n\nOne site did mention that there was a possibility that Okita might \nhave been born in 1842. It also gives the date of 1844 and says that \nit has been handed down through the family that he was 25 when he \ndied. But then it makes the bizarre claim, without any explanation \nwhy, that it&#39;s now &quot;generally accepted&quot; he was born in 1842. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight into this?\n\nThe site is:\nhttp://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~sohzi/about_Okita.html\n\nIt&#39;s in Japanese of course.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
