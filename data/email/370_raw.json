(The downside of working in a university research library was getting to see the price tags publishers are sticking it to the universities for...).  Of all the journals I want access to, this one is actually affordable for me (once I&#39;m getting paid again, that is... :-D ).  It may be a couple of months down the road, but I&#39;ll be subscribing.  If no one else subscribes to it, I&#39;ll let you know what&#39;s available in the issues.\n \nphil\n\nBarbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nTiffany wrote:\n\n&gt;http://www.ridgebackpress.com/links.htm.\n&gt;\n&gt;from ridgebackpress:\n&gt;&quot;You might also be interested to know about the publication of a new\n&gt;innovative quarterly -- Samurai History Journal \n&gt;\nThe downside is that it&#39;s $80.00 a year electronically and $110 via \nsnail mail Single issues are $25 and $30 respectively.\n\nWay too rich for my blood *sigh*\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan      \n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\nYahoo!
