I found a copy of the \nscript for the film online through www.simplyscripts.com and iI cannot \nbelieve they cut this second bit out when Katsumoto goes to see the \nEmperor---\n\nEMPEROR\n(subtitles)\nI am a living God as long as I do\nwhat they think is right.\n\nKATSUMOTO\n(subtitles)\nYour Highness, forgive me for\nsaying what a teacher must, **but\nsuch a statement is pathetic\ndrivel not worthy of an ignorant\nstable boy, let alone a young man\nI know to have some modest\nintelligence.**\n\nBit of trivia that surprised me---I automatically equated the Omura \ncharacter with Okubo but there was in fact an Omura who was the War \nMinister.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
