Searched online found he was a real person and an obsession was \nborn ^_^\n---------------------------------\n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?\n\nSaitou will always be near and dear to my heart since he was &quot;the first&quot; \nbut I like hearing more about Takeda Kanryuusai, Nagakura Shinpachi, \nTodou Heisuke and those silk-loving boys form Hitachi--Suzuki Mikisaburo \nand his big brother Itou Kashitaro\n-------------------------------\n\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\n\nPeacemaker Kurogane all of the anime and the current translated manga, \nThe entire NHK series, Shinsengumi Kepproku, When the Last Sword is \nDrawn (Mibu Gishi Den) Taboo (Gohatto), Band of Assassins, Shinsengumi \nChronicles, Okita Souji (The Last Swordsman), Cruel Story at the end of \nthe Tokugawa Shogunate, the end of Sword of Doom and how can we forget \nKunoichi Deadly Mirage\n-------------------------------\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you \nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?\n\nWhat is not to love about Itou & Takeda in the NHK drama???? Nagakura \nwas good but too old.\n\nFor Saitou it&#39;s a tie between NHK and Mibu Gishi Den both had that RK \nbada$$ thing down to a &quot;T&quot; but I think I have to give the edge to NHK \nbecause he was the perfect age.\n\nThe Okita winner is a tie between Mibu Gishi Den&#39;s kicka$$, blood \nspewing Okita and the all around excellent Shinsengumi Kepproku version\n\nHijikata was best in Shinsengumi Kepproku followed closely by the man \nyou love to hate in NHK and we will forget that Taboo Hijikata ever existed\n---------------------------\n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any \nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?\n\nDoes anyone know what became of the Itou Dojo in Edo after Itou \nleft/died? Did he have a successor?\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n"
