It isn&#39;t a movie at all.  I hesitated opening it right away because my computer is not cooperating with video files lately and I&#39;ve got stuff on my desktop I wasn&#39;t ready to put to bed, but didn&#39;t want to have to save.  Too curious, so I took the chance it wouldn&#39;t freeze everything up.  What a surprise to find jpgs.  :-)\n \nWounds, your heart was exactly in the right place.  It just wasn&#39;t cooperating and tried to fool you.  :-D  Thanks for trying.  And thanks for the hints for identifying the film, Kevin.\n \nphil\n\nKevin Closson &lt;k_closson2001@...&gt; wrote:\nI didn&#39;t get a chance to look since it isn&#39;t there\nanymore, but the easy way to tell if if Toshiro Mifune\npops out of nowhere or it says directed by Okamoto. :)\nEither way, don&#39;t worry because you are going to get\nit soon whether you like it or not anyways. ;)\n\nWierd how these coincidences happen if it is. \n\nKevin\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
