It was about Kondou facing off against \n  Serizawa as the Roushigumi headed from Edo to Kyoto and Serizawa was not \n  given proper accommodations.\n\n  If you aren&#39;t a fan of the actor playing serizawa (Koichi Sato who was \n  Saitou in Mibugishiden) you will be after seeing this performance. That \n  man can convey what would be lines and lines of dialogue with a few \n  facial expressions. I&#39;m not at all surprised he won an award for his \n  Saitou portrayal..\n\n  &gt;3) http://www.saitou-hajime.com or http://www.saito-hajime.com is\n  &gt;CLOSING :(\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;\n  Why are they closing down?
