I for one am extremely grateful to Momoiro-usagi for any \ninsight into the group she can give us.\n\nAbout the researchers that she refers to. We&#39;ve heard of these people from \nvarious sources and they are very dedicated to the true history of the \nShinsengumi. Some of them have spent nearly their entire lives in this pursuit. So if  \nthese people looked at what the drama writers were doing and they couldn&#39;t \neasily dismiss the notion that Kondo, Katsura, and Sakamoto might have met at \nsome point while in Edo, then neither should we.\n\nConsidering all of the facts, I have to go along with what Momoiro-usagi has \nsaid: It is not likely that they knew each other, but it is not impossible \neither.\n\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
