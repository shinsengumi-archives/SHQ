It&#39;s perfectly\n&gt; fine for me ^^ If it&#39;s true that you&#39;re using a\n&gt; translation software, then it&#39;s very good ^^ (Net no\n&gt; software (Babelfish sono ta) to kurabetara hontou ni\n&gt; sugoi desu)\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, Kenshin Kaden is going to be released in\n&gt; Portuguese in Brazil as well ^^ And the extra story\n&gt; &quot;Yahiko no Sakabatou&quot; as well. It seems that it&#39;s the\n&gt; first time that this extra story will be published\n&gt; outside Japan (and outside Shonen Jump...)\n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n\n\nThis is the talk of my Romanji.\nBy the text to Tama san, I expressed some by Romanji. \nThat is because translation of English may not have worked and may \nhave become an impolite expression at Tama san. Since I do not \nunderstand English, I am worried about this to anyone. Therefore, \nthe text was expressed by Romanji from Japanese&#39;s mind easy. \nHowever, I looked at the comment of Kamo san and I thought that the \ntext which mixed Romanji might confuse those who can read Japanese. \nTherefore, although I asked Kamo san, I seem to be OK. ne?\n\n\n\n&quot;Yahiko no Sakabatou&quot;!! If I confess, I am not reading it. \n(Of course, the story knows. However, I lost the chance to read it.)\nProbably, this is the first time that it goes abroad. \nAbout Brazil, I read this report considerably before. \n\nhttp://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/\n\nSince I did not think that RK became popular in countries other than \nJapan, I was very much surprised. \nHas a thing like this report really happened in Brazil? \n\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
