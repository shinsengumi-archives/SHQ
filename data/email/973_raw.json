I can try showing up... though this Sunday I\n&gt; will be in one of the presentations scheduled for this\n&gt; month, hopefully it will be over before 6:00 pm.\n&gt; Perhaps I will end up showing a little later (like\n&gt; 8:00 pm?), but I will try my best to show up.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I am a bit ahead of schedule in my translations and\n&gt; in my preparatives, I hope I will have some time to\n&gt; chat. I tried the chat applet and it worked fine, so I\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t have any problem with connection or the\n&gt; like.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n&gt; (still wondering how on Earth a movie could be\n&gt; produced in the 19th century :D)\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
