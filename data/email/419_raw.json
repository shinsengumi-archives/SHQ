Whatever you have to \ndo to see it, just do it!\n\nWonderful, gritty look at the internal world of the Shinsengumi from \njust after the Ikedaya Affair to just past the death of Yamanami.  \nFundoshi theft, homoerotic playfulness, guy talk about women & \nShimabara (including Kondou&#39;s 4 babes), a sweet love story, patrol \nchanges, after-hours in the barracks, execution of law breakers, a \nsamurai bacchanal, the clash of strong personalities, testing new \nrecruits, man&#39;s inhumanity to man, history, regrets, blood & gore, \nSaitou --- it&#39;s got a little of everything.  The ending is just too \namazing to even consider hinting at.\n\nThe flashback of Serizawa&#39;s assassination is pure poetry and exactly \nas I read about it.  I swear, the words came right to life before my \neyes.\n\nEvery Shinsengumi fan should have a copy of it!!!\n\nOne thing did hit me over the head like a brick, though --- when the \ncaptains are announcing themselves in one scene, when it comes to the \ncaptain of the 9th squad, the man is Abe Juro, not Suzuki.  Anyone \nknow why this would be?  I thought Abe Juro was a corporal (source: \nSerizawa Kamo&#39;s Biography --- see links on the shinsengumimb main \npage).\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122390/\n\n\n\n"
