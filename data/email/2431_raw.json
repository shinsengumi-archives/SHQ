I have insane cultural refs - like hairstyle books for the era, a 400 page book on wagashi, Kyoto historical landmarks refs,  Shinsengumi manga galore, but no idea how to prioritize what to tackle next (other than what I must return to the library by such and such time) and then how to extract and distribute content.    \n\nAlthough, I am currently committed to finishing up some work on Katsura Kogoro&#39;s influences (yes, the &#39;other side&#39;) that might take me through the summer, I do have other things that I am willing to try to push along if any of you doing your own work can benefit extensively from it. \n\nAlso, I might as well just say that with Tama&#39;s help -- I managed to get copies of the  Burai manga in duplicate. (As well as a few other lesser known Shinsengumi manga.)   I would be more than happy to work with someone reliable and work and getting the contents scanned if someone is willing to do the raw translations.    If any of you have any contacts or are very interested yourself, please let me know.   \n\nThanks!\nS\nPS: Got the Watsuki shijitaki for the new Shinsengumi game. *dies*   Okita rules!   \nPPS:  I noted the LJ community disappeared? Any plans to officially throw in support for one of the other ones?  Or to restart?\n\n\n"
