It is a name as a Buddhistic student. \nIn Japan, all people become the student of Buddha, after dying. \nTherefore, the &quot;kaimyo&quot; name was given to the dead in Buddhism of \nJapan. \n&quot;kaimyo&quot; changes treatment on various conditions. \nIn many cases, the priest of the temple where he was registered \ndecides &quot;kaimyo&quot;. \n(Tokugawa government was forcing registration of all Japanese to the \ntemple so that people might hide and they might not believe in \nChristianity.)\n&quot;Kaimyo&quot; of the Edo period changed with classes. \nMany samurais received the &quot;kaimyo&quot; name containing &quot;IN&quot; and &quot;koji&quot; \nclass. \n\nHowever, there is an exception. \nAlthough the words &quot;inden&quot; and &quot;daikoji&quot; are contained in &quot;kaimyo&quot; \nof Kondou and Hijikata, respectively, in fact, these express the \nvery high class. \nThese are the words which only daimyos and aristocrats are allowed. \n(In fact, it is the thing of an impossible class at them.) \nSimilarly in the Shinsengumi member, Miyoshi Yutaka has &quot;inden&quot; \nand &quot;daikoji&quot; in the &quot;kaimyo&quot;. \nAlthough he is the member who was in the second half of Shinsengumi, \nhe is the 4th son of Karatsu Han-Daimyo. \n\nhttp://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Namiki/3799/bekkan/miyosi.html\n\nMatsudaira Katamori presents &quot;kaimyo&quot; of Kondou and Hijikata to \nMeiji Era. \nI think that he wanted to present the highest &quot;kaimyo&quot; to Kondou and \nHijikata who fought and died for the Tokugawa government. \n\n\nIncidentally, since &quot;kaimyo&quot; is a Buddhistic custom, there are \nJapanese people who is not applied. \nSince Sakamoto Ryoma was buried in the Shinto style, there is \nnot &quot;kaimyo&quot;. \n\nFurthermore, although this is a very special example, and Saitou \nHajime was buried in the Buddhistic temple, he does not \nhave &quot;kaimyo&quot;. \nThis is his testament. \n&quot;I had many names until now. Therefore, other names are not desired \nany more.&quot; \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
