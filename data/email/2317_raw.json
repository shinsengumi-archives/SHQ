I&#39;d like to share it with a few PMK communities (if it already hasn&#39;t been put there.)\n\n&gt;Shinsengumi manga which I expect is only &quot;Getsumeiseiki&quot;.(cry) \n\nWell, there is Burai - but that too is still plodding along.  Mmm. Perhaps we should all harass Watsuki-sensei to pick up his Shinsengumi manga idea after all.  \n\n\n&gt;By the way, has &quot;SHOJO BEAT&quot; MAGAZINE already become the center of \n&gt;attention here?\n&gt;It is the Shojo manga magazine which BIZ will publish in July, this \n&gt;year. \n&gt;The series of Kaze Hikaru is determined by the magazine. \n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;http://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/2005/02_shojobeat.php&gt;http://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/2005/02_shojobeat.php\n\nI did mention this, but there isn&#39;t much to discuss at the moment.  The bad news about Viz is their turnaround time from serial publication into graphic novel format.   Regardless, I remain hopeful that Viz will stick with its commitment to KnH, unlike the other manga companies which have dropped titles after publishing one volume of a series.   In the U.S., it is one of the most stable and long-existing publication companies around.\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
