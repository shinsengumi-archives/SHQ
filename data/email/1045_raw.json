I think we should have a kind of contest here... give ourselves a couple weeks or so to come up with a Shinsengumi version of the game, then post them on a specific day so everyone can see what others came up with.  I&#39;m sure a template of the board could be created for people to download and fill out as well as space for things the little cards might say.  Is anyone &quot;game&quot; for it?\n \nphil\n\nBarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@...&gt; wrote:\nBelieve it or not I have no lame fundoshi joke to toss in here...not yet \nanyway :-D  However I received a sales flyer in the mail today from \nJoAnn fabrics and their online store offers a &quot;Make your own &#39;Opoly&#39;&quot; \ngame kit and of course the first thing I thought was creating \nShinsengumi-oploy!\n\nFor our members outside the US who may not know it Monopoly is a board \ngame that&#39;s been around forever and a day and I&#39;m sure every American \nkid has played it at least once. You buy property spaces on a board and \ntry to own more than everyone else, charge them outrageous rental fees \nwhen they land on your spaces etc--It&#39;s American capitalism at it&#39;s \nfinest--or worst-- which is why it&#39;s been selling copies for half a \ncentury!!!  LOL\n\nCan you see it? Saitou glaring at you in the &quot;Go Directly to Jail&quot; \nspace, Boardwalk and Park place can be Nijo Castle and the Imperial \nPalace. The &quot;bad part of town&quot;spaces at the game&#39;s beginning can be \nShimabara. Instead of  railroads and utility companies and railroads \nthere can be a soba shop, fundoshi emporium, a branch of the Sheiken \nDojo and the Kyoto residences of Choshu, Satsuma and Tosa which of \ncourse no one would want to buy...You could even mix and match the \nvarious universes and toss in the Kamiya Dojo, the Aoiya and Katsu&#39;s \nnewspaper office...the possibilities are endless.\n\n-- \n\nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nvisit \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\nYahoo!
