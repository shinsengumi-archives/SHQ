What is important about these caps is it shows a feature of\nthe French Police system and that is the higher your rank the less\nlikely you had to wear the uniform...but you had to wear western\nclothing. The general rule in the Meiji Era police system is that you\nhad to wear western clothing even when you are NOT on duty (0_0) keep\nin mind that the Meiji government was engaged in rapid nation/state\nbuilding and the &quot;new&quot; face of the modern government WAS the police\nsystem...the image of professionalism was not merely encouraged, it\nwas MANDATORY. The last installment of Lady Snowblood also shows the\ninfluence of Russian political theory behind the anti-government\nmovement.  Most police shown use sabres\n\nSanshiro Sugata...the film will show a police sponsored tournament\nbetween practitioners of judo (the winner will become an instructor in\nthe force).  Notice the police band (they are in the background),\nrickshaws, and how the typical Meiji era gentlemen wore western hats\nand kimonos (basically mixed attire from both cultures).  If I\nremember correctly, the police force in Sanshiro Sugata was the\nYokohama police, but keep in mind that the Meiji Era police system was\nHIGHLY centralized so the uniforms etc would be basically the same\nthroughout the country.  I specifically chose these screencaps to give\nus an idea of the atmosphere of the kenjutsu tournaments sponsored by\nthe TMPD.\n\nLast Samurai...the Tom Cruise movie will not mention the participation\nof the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department at all, even though the\nuse of the police was essentially a critical factor in the\ngovernment&#39;s victory (according to western writers).  The costuming\nand uniform shown in this movie does not look 100% like what is\ndepicted in the traditional paintings of the Seinan War.  However,\nsome of the traditional paintings show slightly different uniforms as\nwell...[shrugs] just rely on the group pic of Fujita Goro (^_^).\n\n\n"
