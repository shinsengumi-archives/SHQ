I mentioned that a lot of the\nstory is based on historical fact, and I told her a\nlittle of what I knew about the Shinsengumi. She\nsuggested I write and draw a small doujinshi on them,\nso I started doing some more research on the group. \n\nWith PMK and last year&#39;s Taiga drama, its a sort of\nbeen-there-done-that idea to write another account of\nthe Shinsengumi, but I&#39;m still chugging along at it.\n:) I can gather my character designs together and post\nthem for critique; I would love to get everyone&#39;s\ninput.\n\n--- Ai\n\n--- BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello Ai!\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re glad to have been of help.
