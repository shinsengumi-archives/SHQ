I know there is a police \nmuseum but I can&#39;t find their main site...other sites list the \nmuseum&#39;s address and phone number etc...I have also seen *really* \nfancy military uniforms...lots of embroidery on the sleeve cuffs.\n\nIf anyone knows where I can find a pic of a regular police uniform \nlet me know.  I noticed that in the anime S.H.&#39;s uniform is a \nlighter blue than in the OVA Remembrance (very dark navy blue)...it \nmay be due to the production of the series but I&#39;m wondering how \nthese uniforms really look like.\n\nIs there a live action movie from this period which features \npolicemen?\n\n\n"
