I&#39;ll see if I can screencap it later. I checked my volumes of Kaze Hikaru manga and it seems that it&#39;s the bamboo design as well. I&#39;ll scann that and out it up. Oddly enough, Kaze Hikaru has shots of almost every captain&#39;s mon which is where I initially found the mon for Okita. Harada&#39;s mon is similar to Kondo&#39;s but with only one horizontal bar.  \n\nOut of curiosity, why would his kamon have been wisteria? \n\nNote: Oddly enough, the biohazard sign used in our modern world was actually a family crest according to this small book I have.  \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, May 12, 2004 6:21 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Saitou ka-mon\n\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; I wasn&#39;t thinking of the Yamaguchi mon... the *Saitou* mon.  \n\n  *never found Saitou mon...even paused to see split second Saitou\n  appearance in the film Bakumatsu Monoga...during the movie to see if\n  he had kamon on his clothing....(in other films you can clearly see\n  Kondo+Hijikata&#39;s kamon)\n\n  (I was wondering why the mon was bamboo and not wisteria... will have\n  to hunt up that discussion... )  \n\n  *there are many reasons why bamboo would be a good choice\n  http://pub16.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.showMessage?topicID=5.topic\n  and we were good too...cited all websites:)\n\n  *nine...for the number of bamboo leaves by the way REALLY is\n  unlucky...I asked a Japanese student and that was her first\n  impression...but again superstitions/beliefs change over time\n\n  *I just thought is was interesting...once he gets his new Fujita last\n  name does he get a package &quot;this is your new family&quot; package complete\n  with crest, name etc...\n\n\n\n  visit \n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n  our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n        Yahoo!
