The info was passed along to me from Michael who composed\nt=\r\nhe Shinsengumi filmography (Michael is usually at\nhttp://www.ninjadojo.com =\r\nwhere he dishes out movie reviews and tidbits\non cinema).\n\n[Publication tit=\r\nle:The Daily Yomiuri. Tokyo: Feb 21, 2007.  pg. 1]\n\nMusings\n\nYomiuri\n\nThe f=\r\nollowing is a translation of the Henshu Techo column from The\nYomiuri Shimb=\r\nun&#39;s Feb. 20 issue.\n\n* * *\n\nUnable to have his petition to save impoverishe=\r\nd people suffering from\nfamine accepted, Oshio Heihachiro (1793-1837), a fo=\r\nrmer official of\nthe Osaka Higashimachi magistrate&#39;s office and a scholar o=\r\nf Wang\nYangming doctrines, led an armed uprising against the establishment =\r\nin\n1837. The rebels set fire to the town and attacked the warehouses of\nwea=\r\nlthy merchants.\n\n&quot;Daimaru is a chivalrous merchant shop. Don&#39;t vandalize it=\r\ns\nwarehouses&quot;--words uttered by Oshio and quoted in Daimaru Inc.&#39;s\ncompany =\r\nhistory book. The book says that Daimaru avoided being burned\ndown due to O=\r\nshio&#39;s words.\n\nMatsuzakaya Holdings Co., Daimaru&#39;s negotiating partner for =\r\nmanagement\nintegration, has a company history comparable to Daimaru&#39;s.\nMats=\r\nuzakaya originated from a kimono fabric shop opened in 1611 by Ito\nRanmaru,=\r\n a retainer of Oda Nobunaga (1534-82) in present-day Nagoya.\nHijikata Toshi=\r\nzo (1835-69), an executive member of the Shinsengumi\n(literally, newly sele=\r\ncted group) dedicated to support the Tokugawa\nshogunate, is said to have wo=\r\nrked as an apprentice at its Ueno branch.\n\nThus, the Daimaru-Matsuzakaya me=\r\nrger talks represent those between two\nshops with long-standing traditions.=\r\n\n\nThe two department store chains, which have their own traditions and\ncorp=\r\norate cultures, are reportedly approaching each other to seek\neconomies of =\r\nscale through management integration against the\nbackground of a market tha=\r\nt has been shrinking in size due to the\ndecline in the population--yet anot=\r\nher area over which the declining\nbirthrate has cast a shadow.\n\nThe two mer=\r\nchant shops evolved into leading department store chains\nafter surviving th=\r\ne turbulent years at the end of the Tokugawa\nshogunate, depressions, defeat=\r\n in the war, oil crises and the bursting\nof the economic bubble. Now each o=\r\nf them finds it difficult to go it\nalone as a consequence of demographic ch=\r\nange.\n\nHaiku poet Hiryoshi Tagawa composed a poem that reads:\n\nA line of st=\r\nudents\n\non a school excursion trip\n\npassing through Daimaru\n\nThis reminds m=\r\ne of a line of students walking through sales floors\nwhile looking around p=\r\nleasantly.\n\nAfter reading newspaper stories on the Daimaru-Matsuzakaya merg=\r\ner\nplan, I think of department stores as places that glitter with\nchildren =\r\nas a source of light.\n\nCopyright 2007 The Daily Yomiuri\n\n\n"
