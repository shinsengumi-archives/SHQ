Saitou was a natural lefty\nand acquired &quot;social&quot; ambidexterity...in the case of handing things to\npeople/writing in front of other (you usually hand things to people\nwith both hands or right hand at least in Japanese culture - I\nheard)...and many martial artists, e.g. bare-handed techniques will\npurposefully try to gain ambidexterity helpful in\ngrappling/throws/pins etc...so it is possible Saitou could use 2\nswords very well.\n\n\n"
