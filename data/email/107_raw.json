Hell, I even feel myself like some kind of intruder... However, I think it&#39;s not exactly a mystery that my second favorite character in the series is Saitou, and that&#39;s why I tend to give him an important role in my fics. So, well, I find tempting any place where I can find interesting information  as well as to hear interesting discussions about him, his past and the Shinsengumi. So here I&#39;m. \nYet, there is a second reason, since I am in love with PMK series. The guilty party here is composed by Barbara Sheridan and Miss Behavin *points at both* and their deliciously funny Mibu Times/Dispatch. I found that to understand certain jokes I had to know about PMK, so I decided to download several episodes. Since then, I&#39;m lost in addiction. *wails*\nA wave of sadness enveloped me over the past weekend, after I saw episode 23, since it announced that next one would be the ending. Is there any news on any kind of continuation? Is there any place where I can read/download scanlations/translations of the manga? I live where the world ends, in deep South America, so you can imagine, no dreams of getting any copy of the manga at all for a very long time. Any info will be deeply appreciated.\nFiruze\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
