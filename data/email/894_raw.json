I just finished watching &quot;Sword of Doom&quot; on this week&#39;s IFC Samurai Saturday and they just showed a promo for the new &quot;The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi,&quot; with Beat Takeshi (the guy who played Hijikata in &quot;Gohatto&quot; --- maybe he was too old for the role, but I love this guy).  They&#39;re advertising it as being in theatres this summer.  Anyone know, is this actually coming out in the US?  Looks to be another blend of humor and adventure... looks like it&#39;s going to be a lot of fun.\n \nphil (who still doesn&#39;t believe that Ryunosuke could take down THAT many miburo)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
