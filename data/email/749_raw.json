He was a graduate of the =C9cole   Polytechnique, =\r\nand he \nspecialized in artillery. He arrived in Yokohama in   the beginning=\r\n of \n1867. \nSNIP\n&gt;&gt;However, Jules Brunet chose to   remain. He resigned fro=\r\nm the French \narmy, and left for the North of Japan   with the remains of t=\r\nhe \nShogunate&#39;s armies in the hope of staging a   counter-attack. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Jul=\r\nes Brunet helped set up the Ezo   Republic, with the leader of the \nJapanes=\r\ne shogunate&#39;s navy, Admiral   Enomoto Takeaki, as the President. \nThe final=\r\n stand occurred in the   northern island of Hokkaido, in the \ncity of Hakod=\r\nate, where in June 1869   the shogunate forces lost a \nfinal battle between=\r\n 800 shogunate soldiers   and an 8000-strong \nImperial army. \n\nThank you so=\r\n much, Firuze, for   finding this!!!\n\nWhy, oh, *WHY* didn&#39;t the writers lea=\r\nve the story as it   was!!! Why \nchoose Saigou when they had Enomoto and Hi=\r\njikata!  (I can   just see \nthat final battle being led by Hijikata... coul=\r\nd Uijo have been   \npatterned after him, I wonder?  So much fire, such a de=\r\nmon!)    Make \nthe foreigner an American if they had to... things done in t=\r\nhe US   \nCivil War were gruesome enough (Tiff, I grew up near a Civil War  =\r\n \nbattlefield and while Arkansas never saw the bloodshed the deep South   \n=\r\ndid, it was still very much felt... maybe all battlefields have this,   \nbu=\r\nt Pea Ridge and other Civil War sites I&#39;ve been to felt haunted and   \nther=\r\ne was a sense of deep reverence about that piece of land ---   \ncompletely =\r\nunlike the scenes of bloodshed at locations here in   \nArizona... Tombstone=\r\n, the Salt River Canyon (it doesn&#39;t take much to   \nsee Apache braves stand=\r\ning guard amidst the rocks) and some of the   \nancient Moqui (Anasazi) ruin=\r\ns are the only places I&#39;ve felt that kind   \nof aura lingering) and there h=\r\nad been plenty of fighting Native   \nAmericans before Custer made an ignomi=\r\nnious name for himself.   \n(Naturally, the ONE thing I find believable abou=\r\nt Katsumoto being   \nSaigou --- the connection to Custer --- and they compl=\r\netely buried it   \nby making him a victim... very subtle... too subtle for =\r\nmost people \nto   get.  I also much prefer referencing Thermopylae in regar=\r\nds to \nthose   fighting in Ezo, though it does apply to those honestly tryi=\r\nng \nto keep the   samurai way of life alive in Satsuma.)\n\nPsht... this is j=\r\nust all   personal thinking out loud.  New things to \nthink about when I wa=\r\ntch   it the second time.  If anything, I&#39;d \nrecommend it for the chance to=\r\n   step into Meiji Japan in living color \nand Dolby sound (even if it was s=\r\nhot   in New Zealand, which I knew \nthanks to this household being Lord of =\r\nthe   Rings crazy).  There&#39;s \nsuch a claustrophic feeling to Yokohama &   T=\r\nokyo and that odd \ndisparity between the old world with telegraph posts   a=\r\nnd lines \neverywhere that is so unlike the wide streets in anime, and the  =\r\n weird \nmix of men in western suits walking among people still wearing   \nt=\r\nraditional clothing.  When Katsumoto walks into the council, the   \nonly on=\r\ne still in traditional garb... it was so suffocating compared   \nto council=\r\n scenes of earlier times you see from samurai film.  The   \natmosphere is w=\r\north taking in.\n\nAnd, MissB, that story idea I talked   to you about has ju=\r\nst been \nturned in a lot of new directions, for the   better I think... eve=\r\nn if \nSaigou has to become more than a black&white   bad guy.  What goes \na=\r\nround, comes around, ne?  :-D\n\nphil   (still reeling)\n\n\n\n\nvisit \n\nhttp://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour   companion list featuring fanf=\r\niction/art \n\n\n                Yahoo!
