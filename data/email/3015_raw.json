I&#39;d like to bring \nup another fact that is important for all of us who have an interest in \nShinsengumi or the period at large.\n\nFollowing the fall of Aizu, Saitou Hajime, who had tried to get into Aizu \nCastle, was with Aizu senior retainer Sagawa Kanbei, fighting on in \nMinami-Aizu, south of the domain capital of Wakamatsu. Aizu military affairs \nmagistrate Asabane Tadanosuke was sent to Sagawa&#39;s men, and informed them \nthat the battle was over. Saitou and the men who had fought outside Aizu \nCastle during the siege were rounded up and taken to an internment camp in \nShiokawa. They remained there until the beginning of the following year, \nwhen it was decided they were to be sent to Takada, in Echigo Province, for \nincarceration. The group stopped by Amida-ji in Aizu to pray for safety \nbefore embarking. Saitou had fought in that area, in the time leading up to \nand during the siege, and this must have affected him. On the 5th, the group \nwas separated into six units, and after some time they arrived in Takada.\n\nThey were to remain in Takada until the 9th month, and it was in reference \nto the 2nd day of the 9th month that scholar Ito Tetsuya notes something \ncurious: &quot;[On this day], the Meiji Government permits the prisoners to use \nsurnames and wear swords.&quot; (from-- Itou Tetsuya, &quot;Saitou Hajime Nenfu&quot;, \nappearing pp. 223-243 of &quot;Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot;. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu \nOraisha, 2003, p. 237)\n\nThe new government granting permission to have surnames and wear swords \nimplies that these men, who were samurai and *born* with that right, had \nbeen deprived of it after the surrender, since they were viewed as \ncriminals. (A pardon was issued hard on the heels of this announcement, on \nthe 28th of the 9th month)\n\nOur beloved Saitou Hajime obviously had a name-- Ichinohe Denpachi. The Aizu \nmen interacting with each other, men who in many cases knew each other since \nchildhood, obviously still had to have called each other by their names. But \nlegally, and in the eyes of the country, Saitou Hajime, and his Aizu \nfriends, were nameless, faceless, and without any clearly defined position \nin society. The best way that it can be described is if a group of people \nwere treated like burned-out lightbulbs and thrown into a box for nine \nmonths.\n\nI wonder...can any of us in this modern world of rights and privileges \nimagine what it must have been like, to have no name and no place in \nsociety? Can we imagine how heart-wrenching it might have been?\n\nOnce again, something to think about.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
