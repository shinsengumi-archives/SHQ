I wonder how modern Japan thinks of Sasaki? Either way, it&#39;s \ngood to know that&#39;s how he is, all the better.\n\nThe story about the girl, hilarious! I&#39;m wondering though if they \never saw through the disguise. I hope they didn&#39;t because, I don&#39;t \nknow I&#39;d think it&#39;d be mean for them to do that and I always had this \nvision of them being galant. :O)\n\nThanks again for the info...

I&#39;d really appreciate it because of I&#39;m writing this \n&gt; &gt;fanfic where in my main antagonist going to be under Sasaki \n&gt; &gt;Tadasaburo&#39;s leadership.&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Sasaki comes across to me as a guy who has some definite ideas of \n&gt; exactly how he wants things done and when. Sort of the type to \nsay &quot;When \n&gt; I say &#39;Jump!&#39; you ask how high.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;By the way this may sound odd (you might be thinking I should know \n&gt; &gt;this but I don&#39;t), who is the Roshigumi? &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; They were the group of 200 or so samurai who joined up to go to \nKyoto to \n&gt; help the Shogunate quell the unrest/violence. The one \nbacking/paying \n&gt; them I believe was a Matsudaira can&#39;t-remember-just-now (not \nKatamori, \n&gt; his father or grandfather)\n&gt; \n&gt; Kiyokawa, the guy Sasaki is always pissed at just last week on the \nshow \n&gt; tried to slip past everyone in the rules and regulations that they \nare \n&gt; not working for the Shogunate but &quot;supporting the Emperor&quot; \ni.e.siding \n&gt; with the Choshu rebels. The bookish/smarmy Yamanami has caught this \nbit \n&gt; of fine print and went to Sasaki with it and that&#39;s pretty much \nwhere it \n&gt; left off. The synopsis for this week says:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;Since Hachiro Kiyokawa&#39;s plan to make Roshigumi serve for the \nImperial \n&gt; Court, instead of the Shogunate is revealed, the leaders of \nRoshigumi, \n&gt; including Tadasaburo Sasaki decides to take the members back to \nEdo. \n&gt; ........ Keisuke Yamanami brings news that Roshigumi will be sent \nback \n&gt; to Edo. Toshizo Hijikata suggests Isami to form another Roshigumi \ngroup \n&gt; to stay in Kyoto. &gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You can read this synopses at the link below:\n&gt; http://www.nhk-jn.co.jp/wp/best_e.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a cool little side story where the daughter of the Yagi&#39;s \n(where \n&gt; Kondou & Kamo&#39;s groups are staying has to disguise herself as a boy \nso \n&gt; as not to draw attention from the miscreants invading their home. \nKondou \n&gt; & Hijikata come upon her and apparently make comments about her \nbeing \n&gt; pretty puny to wield a sword. They mention the Tennen Rishin style \nand \n&gt; I&#39;m guessing they said &quot;We&#39;ll teach it to you and make a man out of \n&gt; you!&quot; The poor girl runs crying to her mother the minute the guys \nwalk \n&gt; away. It was hilarious to see the girl&#39;s look of terror as they&#39;re \n&gt; lifting her arms,squeezing her muscles, adjusting the sword she&#39;s \n&gt; carrying in her belt.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;I really envy that you get to see this NHK drama... Over here in \nthe \n&gt; midwest, absolutely NOTHING. :O(&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I dropped the local cable service and signed up for Dish Network \n&gt; satellite because they offer TV Japan for an additional $25 a \nmonth. Of \n&gt; course it&#39;s not like I&#39;m obsessed or anything..................\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Barb Sheridan\n\n\n"
