I was wondering if you could post\nq=\r\nuestions here simultaneously with what is going on in your group. \nHOwever =\r\nanswers may not be so quick because yes, we will if possible\nlikely find a =\r\nanswer in a text.  In doing so we hope to have people\nwalk away with some e=\r\nvidence (ofcourse we do know texts can be faulty\nbut atleast we know where =\r\ndetails come from).  \n\nAlso it has been my past experience that it is good =\r\nto state up front\nin a discussion that an answer posted by a person (let&#39;s =\r\ntake for\ninstance a quote from a book) may not always reflect the personal\n=\r\nopinion of the poster.  \n\nIf the bigger picture of the Bakumatsu will be di=\r\nscussed, then that\nwould be awesome.  I know that some people on this list =\r\nmay have\ninformation which has never been mentioned in western texts before=\r\n. \nThe posting of those details may be a bit jarring to many people who\nhav=\r\ne been exposed to just the Imperial narrative etc so I don&#39;t want\npeople to=\r\n take things personally or take offense.\n\nWill you also summarize the discu=\r\nssion after it is over as well?  That\nwould be a good reference for people.=\r\n\n\nWe can link to the discussion thread and announce it on our blog and\non o=\r\nur updates page if you&#39;d like.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samu=\r\nrai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secr=\r\netarytocapt3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear SHQ members, recently I became acquainte=\r\nd with a programmer\nwho is\n&gt; &gt; willing to assist in the installation of a d=\r\natabase to the website to\n&gt; &gt; increase its functionality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking fro=\r\nm first-hand experience, installing a database in the\n&gt; website that allows=\r\n for multiple contributors is a great idea, and\n&gt; makes everything far easi=\r\ner to manage and update.  I&#39;m not sure what\n&gt; type of database you&#39;re plann=\r\ning, but I use Wikimedia (of wikipedai\n&gt; fame and infamy) on the Samurai Ar=\r\nchives (as of August or so of last\n&gt; year), and the ability to update insta=\r\nntly on the fly, and to have\n&gt; multiple contributors has absolutely revolut=\r\nionized the website, and\n&gt; has given me renewed energy in research, because=\r\n now I don&#39;t have to\n&gt; create a &quot;full and polished&quot; article, format it with=\r\n HTML, manually\n&gt; upload it, manually change all of the related pages, etc.=\r\n That was\n&gt; such a chore that even the thought of adding new research to th=\r\ne page\n&gt; had been daunting.  The new software is the reason I&#39;ve been getti=\r\nng\n&gt; into the Shinsengumi, it&#39;s given me the opportunity to do more\n&gt; resea=\r\nrch with &quot;immediate&quot; results. Counting myself, there are about 3\n&gt; people w=\r\norking on the Bakumatsu, and if anyone is interested in given\n&gt; me some fee=\r\ndback (or pointing out any glaring errors), I&#39;d really\n&gt; apprecite it - Bar=\r\nbara said she wouldn&#39;t mind if I mentioned it, so\n&gt; here is the &quot;Shinengumi=\r\n&quot; category (still at least half the articles\n&gt; are stubs, but it&#39;s a start)=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=3DCategory:Shinseng=\r\numi\n&gt; \n&gt; My goal is to make this the Japanese history version of wikipedia.=\r\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve always been extremely unhappy with wikipedia&#39;s &quot;failure&quot; to cite\n&gt; =\r\nsources with the Japanese history articles, and the overall poor\n&gt; quality =\r\nof many of the articles, so I run a pretty tight ship to keep\n&gt; out bad inf=\r\no (and the ShinsengumiHQ makes it clear that academic\n&gt; veracity is top pri=\r\nority as well).  Only people I &quot;approve&quot; can\n&gt; contribute (I decided to dis=\r\nallow &#39;anyone&#39; from editing because of\n&gt; some vandals and some poor or outr=\r\night copied articles that kept\n&gt; showing up), but if anyone does feel incli=\r\nned to help out, let me\n&gt; know.  I created the wiki as an alternative to Wi=\r\nkipedia, as a public\n&gt; database that anyone can use, and although for now m=\r\nost of the\n&gt; articles have come from the Samurai Archives, I consider this =\r\nmore of\n&gt; a &quot;public forum&quot; (for lack of a better term) than &quot;my website&quot;.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the new improvements on ShinsengumiHQ as\n=\r\n&gt; well - I&#39;m really looking forward to a streamlined search. The\n&gt; shinseng=\r\numiHQ is great, but admittedly I have trouble pinpointing what\n&gt; I&#39;m lookin=\r\ng for - but this could just be because of my own lack of\n&gt; knowing exactly =\r\nwhat I&#39;m looking for most of the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I&#39;m coordinating a &quot;Shins=\r\nengumi&quot; research-discussion group\n&gt; starting February 10th (which will last=\r\n a month), which I&#39;d like to\n&gt; try and somehow coordinate with this group, =\r\nsince the discussion and\n&gt; research will be starting &quot;at the beginning&quot;, an=\r\nd most people signed\n&gt; up really don&#39;t know much about the shinsengumi - so=\r\n if anyone has any\n&gt; ideas on how or what would be a good idea to do on tha=\r\nt front, I&#39;d\n&gt; appreciate it! A coordinated effort could benefit the shinse=\r\nngumiHQ as\n&gt; well - further discussion and research is always good.  I don&#39;=\r\nt expect\n&gt; any groundbreaking discoveries, but based on the last 2 discussi=\r\non\n&gt; groups, it should result in some good foundations for articles and\n&gt; h=\r\nelp with the &quot;big picture&quot;.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
