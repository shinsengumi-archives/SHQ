But;\n&gt; \n&gt; Who witnessed his death; and who was his suicide assistant(?)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Did he really try to escape with his lover, or is this just a rumor?\n\nActually, the whole story as it is generally told could well be a \nlie. We know that Yamanami died, but it is not clear -why- he died. \nThis information was orginally posted by Momoiro-usagi on the SHQ mb \nif I recall correctly...\n\nThe only source which mentions &quot;Akesato&quot; is the work of a researcher \nnamed Shimozawa Kan. No one can find any data relating to her outside \nof his papers. \n\nIt&#39;s the same situation with the &quot;Five Dreaded Articles&quot;. The rules \nthat were made after the Ikeda-ya Affair are real enough, but there \nis a lot of debate over whether the first five existed. I think it \nhas been mentioned before that if they did exist, they were not as \nharshly enforced as legend would have us believe.\n\nIt is also not clear whether or not there was actually any bad blood \nbetween Hijikata and Yamanami. And several different versions of his \ndeath have been given:\n\n-He was caught after he deserted because he wanted to die.\n-He wanted his death to be a warning to Kondo.\n-He was not happy about the Shinsengumi being subordinates of the \nShogun and abandoning the &quot;original&quot; purpose of Sonno-joi.\n-That he was actually seriously wounded in a fight with an enemy. \n-That he killed himself because he was suffering from some sort of \nneurosis.\n\nI believe that was the gist of what we were told? Anyone have any new \ninfo about this? \n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
