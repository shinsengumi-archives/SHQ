An argument like this is like saying \n&gt; Kondo and the Shogun had slumber parties as children because \nthere&#39;s \n&gt; no documentation saying they weren&#39;t friends, or that there \nweren&#39;t \n&gt; any slumber parties in Japan, yet both were in Edo during that \ntime.\n\nTo be sure, my explanation was ambiguous. \nI&#39;m sorry supposing it irritates you. \nHowever, do you understand that there is a possible range in \nreasoning? \nKondou and Sakamoto may be able to be friends in Edo.\nHowever, Shogun is unable to perform slumber parties with Kondou.\n\nFirst of all, is slumber parties the event performed where? \nIs it Japan? Is it Asia? \nIt is the event performed in the place which is not the area.\nDo you understand the situation of Japan of the time? \nJapan of the Edo period had closed the relation with the world as \nyou knew. \nTo the beginning of the Edo period, Japan disliked Christianity, and \nit broke off the relation with foreign countries.\nOn the conditions which do not put in Christianity, only the \nNetherlands traded with Japan in Europe. \nAt first, Japan did not import any books. \nHowever, in order to collect information from the time of 8th \nShogun, everything but a Christianity-related book came to be \nimported. \nScholars studied those books and got to know Occidental advanced \ncivilization. \nThey taught the government the importance of national defense. \nHowever, it was not understood and they were often persecuted as \npeople who make society uneasy. \nSince the Occidental thing was studied, there are people who \nreceived a traitor&#39;s dishonor.\nThose who imitate Western civilization have risk of being regarded \nas a foreign enemy&#39;s cooperator. \nSurely, there are no data that Japan of the time did not have \nslumber parties.\nHowever, is it possible to carry out slumber parties to the time \nwhen the prejudice over the West was severe sure enough? \n \nIncidentally, the official name of Shogun is Seiitaishogun. \nThis means it as Shogun which expels a foreign enemy. \nShogun is the person who got this class and power from the Emperor \non condition that national defense. \n(When the Black Ships came, Shogun was not able to expel them. \nThe authority of Shogun fell. From the Battle of Sekigahara, Chosyu \nand Tosa which had a grudge against Tokugawa begin to move. And \nconfusion of Bakumatsu took place.)\nThen, why does Shogun take the lead in an Occidental event, and \nperform it? \n \nAlthough I say again, there is a possible range in reasoning. \nA possibility that a possibility that they were friends, and slumber \nparties were performed is not equivalent.\n\n\nIt is the site which I found by chance with the occasion. \n\nhttp://homepage2.nifty.com/mu-2001/tsu37.htm\n\nIt is a Japanese site. \nIf this information was believed, when Kondou was alive, there was \nno slumber parties even in the West.\n\n\nBy the way, are Kondou and Shogun able to be friends? \nI think that it is impossible.  \nSurely, they were in Edo at the same time. \nHowever, class becomes serious hindrance in order for them to become \nfriends. \nAs for their classes differing, the action range of them also \ndiffers.\nAlthough Sakamoto may exist in the action range of Kondo, Shogun is \nnot. \nAs Kondou cannot frequent Edo castle, Shogun cannot walk along the \ncity of Edo freely.\nWhere do they meet? \nMoreover, is there any common friend who may connect Shogun with \nKondou?\nThe Edo period was status society.\nA part of privileged people can meet Shogun, and Kondou&#39;s friends are\nthe farmers of Tama, or lower samurais. \nMany hierarchies were between these two groups.\nI jump over these and cannot think that there are those who connect \ntwo persons. \nEven if there is an opportunity for Kondou to meet Shogun, exceeding \nsuch difficulties, Kondo cannot speak to Shogun directly.\nThe time cannot be associated without considering the other party&#39;s \nstatus.\nIs there any method of making friends with Shogun? \n\nSakamoto was the lower samurai of Tosa.\nHe is the student who came to Edo for the art of fencing.\nHe walks along Edo freely and he talks to townsmen freely. \nKatsura is the elite of Chosyu.\nHowever, he is a free student, while coming to Edo and studying. \nThey walk along the action range of Kondou freely.\nThey are Dojo which they are studying, interchange with the students \nwho came from other domains, and extend a connection.\nOr an eager student visits other Dojo positively and spreads \nknowledge.\nThe common friend was actually in Kondou and Katsura.\nWatanabe Nobori who was learning by the same Renpeikan as Katsura \nwas the friend of Katsura.\nFor aid of a game, he often went to Shieikan. \n\nSurely, there is no proof that Kondou, Sakamoto, and Katsura were \nfriends.\nThere are very few possibilities that they were friends. \nHowever, the possibility is not equivalent to a possibility of \nsaying that Kondou and Shogun were friends. \n\n\nIncidentally, although it is a possibility that Okita will learn the \nart of fencing from a foreigner, there is a problem of the action \nrange and a language.\nHowever, let&#39;s overcome them miraculously and think that the \nforeigner taught Okita the art of fencing.\nHe teaches kindly the technique which was excellent in the sword of \nthe foreign country where weight, form, and the usage are completely \ndifferent from a Japanese sword.\nIs really it helpful to Okita&#39;s art of fencing?\nThe style of the fighter of countries other than Japan thinks that \nmost has a sword and a shield. \nA Japanese samurai has a Japanese sword with both hands.\nHe performs attack and defense with a Japanese sword. \nAlthough it is thin compared with an Occidental sword and bends \nimmediately, it cuts even the thing of terrible hardness. \nTherefore, the art of fencing of Japan did not need a shield. \nThe art of fencing of Japan is the technique for a Japanese sword. \nThe technique for using it completely differs from the technique \nfor an Occidental sword. \nOf course, it differs from China and other Asia.\nHe will get nothing, even if Okita learns the art of fencing from a \nforeign fighter.  \nIf you plan to talk about possibility, after considering whether it \nis really possible, you should talk. \n\n \nA setup that Kondo and Sakamoto were friends was blamed by many \nresearchers even in Japan. \nTheir worries were giving the knowledge in which it made a mistake \nto people. \nHowever, I think that their worries are unnecessary.\nIf interested in Shinsengumi, he will make an effort which he \ninvestigates by himself.\nIf uninterested, he will forget, after a drama is completed. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
