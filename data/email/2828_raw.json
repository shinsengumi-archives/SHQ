On the board you proceeded to=\r\n SHOUT AND USE CAPS TO MAKE YOUR\nPOINT LIKE THIS. You must take up the matt=\r\ner with Mr. Hillsborough AND\nthe Japanese author of the book he used (not w=\r\nith me---I just read the\ninformation). Please keep that in mind.\n\nhowever w=\r\ne do link to certain Wikipedia articles (with warnings) such\nas the one on =\r\nTeruhime and Aizu which we did contribute facts\n\nIt is possible we have mem=\r\nbers who add information but individual\nactions should not reflect on our e=\r\nntire group\n\nfor the record we are one of SEVERAL Shinsengumi sites out the=\r\nre...it\nis possible you may be addressing the wrong group entirely...like I=\r\n\nsaid this is an open community with hundreds of members\n\nI&#39;m just being cr=\r\nanky...but if you want to talk then my AIM is\nbadgerturtle (again my area i=\r\ns post 1868 Fujita Family not Okita)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
