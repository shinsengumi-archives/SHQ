Although there is no either family estate &#12387; &#12390;\ngreat circumstance, those which can be transferred? It is doubtful\nvery. So as for being the family fact. If with it does, with the\nfamily we have related to espionage activities originally with the\nparent and child, and the espionage activities where one enlists in\nnew &#25776; group it turns out and with being on? &quot;Chain &#24119; child&quot; arrival\nit is with we wait for the opinion whose everyone is harsh densely.&quot;\n\nwhich ~seems~ to the poster that the whole business with buying stocks\nand stuff add validity to the theory that Saitou&#39;s father really was\ninvolved with &quot;espionage&quot;... the poster seems to make a huge leap in\ntrying to say &quot;like father like son&quot; in that Saitou was a spy within\nthe new selection group (Shinsengumi).\n\nyou know the business with Saitou studying swordsmanship in Aizu also\nmeans that he had at least minimal knowledge of the geography of the\ndomain which made him the perfect candidate to temporarily lead the\nShinsengumi while Hijikata was recovering from an injury\n\nand another thought...unless toshizo.com&#39;s webmaster is drawing quick\nconclusions...this also means that Saitou + his dad atleast had to\nspend a considerable amount of time in Aizu...how can one possibly\nconsider X-ryu (Mizoguchi Ittoryu gosh these names are hard to\nremember) to be part of your art if you didn&#39;t spend some serious time\nstudying it...its not like you can study it for a month while your dad\nwas there on &quot;business&quot; and then say I&#39;m part of x-ryu\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shimazu Masayoshi&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Saitou Hajime\n&gt; (from www.toshizo.com/name, translated by Shimazu Masayoshi, June 15,\n&gt; 2004.
