Online I tend to go by the screen names szabo=\r\ntage or\nreynardine.  I&#39;m mostly interested in ancient Japanese history, but=\r\n\nthe Shinsengumi caught my attention and so now I&#39;m enjoying learning\nabout=\r\n the late Tokugawa/early Meiji eras as well.  I&#39;ve been lurking\nfor quite a=\r\nwhile (actually used to lurk on the Miburo list as well\n&lt;g&gt;, but rarely pos=\r\nt.  Enjoy reading what people have to say, though.\n \n&gt; 2) How did you &quot;disc=\r\nover=81Ethe Shinsengumi?\n&gt;\nRurouni Kenshin.  The manga, actually--that flas=\r\nhback picture of the\nguys just caught my attention and I&#39;ve been devoted ev=\r\ner since.\n \n&gt; 3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?\n&gt; \nWell, S=\r\naitou was my first love.  I think the fact that he survived and\nhad to live=\r\n out his life in the new era is poignant.  It&#39;s one thing\nto go out in a bl=\r\naze of glory.  It&#39;s quite another to have to live\nhaving been defeated.\n\nAf=\r\nter seeing the NHK version, I&#39;ve become interested in Yamanami\nKeisuke.  He=\r\n seems to have been an honorable man and it&#39;s hard to\nunderstand the circum=\r\nstances of how he died, especially considering\nthe rank he held.\n\n&gt; 4) What=\r\n Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\n&gt;\nHmm.  Lesseee:\n\nShinsengumi Keppur=\r\noku: not my favorite, thought it was kinda stilted\n\nthe entire NHK series: =\r\n Loved it!!!\n\nPMK manga/anime:  I&#39;ve only seen what&#39;s been released so far =\r\nin the\nUS.  Have enjoyed it, especially the anime.\n\nKaze Hikaru manga: enti=\r\nre series so far--the style is girly, but it&#39;s\na really well-written story.=\r\n  Glad it&#39;s being released here in North\nAmerica, hopefully Viz won&#39;t screw=\r\n up the translation too badly. :-P\n\nKunoichi: Deadly Mirage:  see here\nhttp=\r\n://www.livejournal.com/users/reynardine/56002.html \nfor my spoiler-filled r=\r\neview of this immortal work ;-D  \n\nAlways looking for more Shinsengumi-rela=\r\nted manga.  \n\nI so very much want to see Mibu Gishiden, but am holding out =\r\nto see if\nthere will be a region 1 DVD release.  I&#39;m a great fan of (the ac=\r\ntor)\nSakai Masato and can&#39;t wait to see his portrayal of Okita!\n \n&gt; 5) In t=\r\nerms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you \n&gt; think ca=\r\nptured your favorite member(s) the best and why?\n\nthe NHK series really cap=\r\ntured the feelings I had about some members\n(although I know it wasn&#39;t exac=\r\ntly historically accurate in places). \nSakai Masato&#39;s portrayal of Yamanami=\r\n Keisuke was brilliant.  Through\nsmall things (narrowing his eyes, his form=\r\nal movements, his hesitant\nspeaking at times) he was able to convey a lot o=\r\nf what the character\nwas feeling.  I also really liked Fujiwara Tatsuya&#39;s p=\r\nortrayal of\nOkita (he&#39;s not a favorite of mine, but Fujiwara-kun did a fant=\r\nastic\njob!).  Oh, and Sato Koichi as Serizawa Kamo.  I don&#39;t know much abou=\r\nt\nSerizawa, but the angle of a man bent on his own self-destruction was\nint=\r\neresting, and Sato-san did a remarkable job.  \n&gt; \n\n&gt; 6) Do you have any que=\r\nstions that are nagging at you about any \n&gt; particular Shinsengumi members =\r\nor events?\n\nNot at the moment.  :-)  May think of some later.\n\n--Maria\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"
