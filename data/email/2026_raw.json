I was \nwondering if Miki worked in a more rural area...if so he would&#39;ve \nmanaged chuzaisho (rural versions of the &quot;koban&quot;* police boxes) and \nhad to deal with the army which was more dominant in rural areas.  \nPolice in rural areas are even more *closer* to citizens too.\n\n*during the Meiji Era another term was used for koban (which meant \ndormitory) but the term &quot;koban&quot; stuck to this very day\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMeiji Era police (every jurisdiction) had songs...during major events \nsuch as kendo or judo tournaments bands would play (see Kurosawa&#39;s \nSAnshiro Sugata, during the 70s notes/lyrics for police music were \nreprinted to celebrate the centenial anniversary of the police \nsystem, the Seinan War pic of F.G. was discovered and later on the \ndiary of Toshiyoshi Kawaji in a law library)\n\n*major event*\n\nKoga Tanji (Fujita Goro&#39;s friend) &quot;Psst hey Goro, you have to sing \njust like the rest of us, we have to be unified and all that&quot;\n\nFujita Goro &quot;I refuse to do so&quot;\n\nKoga TAnji &quot;If you don&#39;t you&#39;ll end up assigned to the koban near \nyour house where you&#39;ll just stand there and give directions to \npedestrians all day&quot;\n\nFujita Goro [shrugs]\n\nKoga Tanji &quot;okay I&#39;ll bribe you&quot; (hands F.G. a bottle of sake)\n\n**5 minutes later**\n\nNew Recruit &quot;Koga-san Is there any way to STOP Inspector Fujita from \nsinging?&quot; (puts hand over ears)\n\nKoga TAnji &quot;I&#39;m afraid not, once he has sake in his system there is \nno stopping him, and he does have a kawaii voice you know&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
