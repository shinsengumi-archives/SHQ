Saitou is something\nlike this on 3-hajime it says he sat with his legs folded under him\ncasually or something along those lines***\n\n\nThats cool, at least you&#39;re accustomed to sitting in that position. At least you don&#39;t have the repetitive sit-stand-sit-stand type of work in kendo. After a 4 hr sat class it hard to walk sometimes haha. Although i&#39;m sure you feel that way anyways due to the intensity of your classes.    \n\n\n***but you know when we hit targets naturally the shinai bounces right\noff the armor and we don&#39;t &quot;follow through&quot; with the entire motion and\nthis doesn&#39;t happen with real swords...not many people enjoy\npracticing on the sidelines on their own before class starts...I have\nto because I&#39;m a newbie so I just move really really slowly to\nunderstand the swings etc***\n\n\nAhh that makes sense...the shinai bouncing off due to the say it&#39;s designed. I guess thats another difference in JSA, how in kendo you hit, and in iai you cut. It feels really weird to go through kata where I continuously cut through/into your opponent and then go to partner prractice where I have to stop short of hitting my partner. Course to hit or cut in reality it doesn&#39;t matter since as long as you reach your opponent with the weapon, thats all that matters in the end. Do you by chance have a training manequin(sp)? When I was at my former iai school that also happened to teach kendo, they used to bring out a sort of training dummy (vs each other) for cutting exercises for the new students.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 2004 3:42 AM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Some kendo stuff\n\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Okita Souji&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n  BTW, Did your knees/legs hurt from sitting in seiza for long periods\n  of time on the wood floor? \n\n  ***not really with the seiza business because although I was\n  born/raised in the USA I spent alot of time at a Thai Buddhist temple\n  and we usually have to sit in a position very similar to seiza but not\n  propped up on our toes\n  by the way one of unique personal traits of hist.
