It&#39;s supposed to be old. I \n&gt; think it came out in 1985 or somewhere around there? The reason I was \n&gt; wondering is I saw something that mentioned the Battle of Goryokaku \n&gt; is shown near the end. I seriously doubt Hijikata is mentioned \n&gt; anywhere in the film, but it might be interesting if there is \n&gt; anything much about the Boshin War in it. Does anyone know?\n\n\n"
