There&#39;s an account of a first meeting (and probably the last too) \nbetween Hijikata and Sakamoto. Basically Hijikata, who happened to be out with one \nof the patrols, stopped him and wanted to know who he was. Sakamoto happened \nto be working for a Bakufu official at the time, so he had to let him go.  This \nwas apparently before the Shinsengumi became famous in Kyoto. Whether this \nstory has any more truth to it than the TV miniseries I have no idea.\n\nGlad to have you with us Bruno!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
