According to MissB&#39;s electronic translation of info from http://www2.plala.or.jp/shyall/retuden/sinsengumi.html :\n&lt;&lt;&quot;Nagakura new 8 in Kyoto in 1869 and I try a surprise attack, but end in an attempt.&quot;&gt;&gt;\n \nI haven&#39;t investigated the site yet so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any other info like when he joined the police force.  It went further to say:\n&lt;&lt;belong to the Satsuma armed forces by a fight of Fushimi, Toba, and I join a red report corps, but I return to Tokyo, and I am imprisoned after having left it. The release back goes to the front of sergeant or Aizu, but, for the end of the war, returns to Tokyo.&gt;&gt;\n \nSomeone with the language skills must check this, but this almost sounds like after Toba-Fushimi he became second patrol captain of the Sekihoutai and (for whatever reason, which I&#39;d *love* to know --- Satsuma connections?) was imprisoned instead of being executed after Sagara&#39;s fall, then was released and fought in the Battle of Aizu (?).  Once that was over, he returned to Tokyo.  Eventually he became a police chief of Tsuruoka... do we know where that is/was?... but we don&#39;t have any specific year for when he joined the force.\n \nI can&#39;t remember... where was Nagakura during the battle for Aizu?  Is it possible Miki kept track of him starting there (*if* he fought with the Imperialists)?  And when did Nagakura begin working on Shinsengumi graves?  There maybe some clues out there to speculate from regarding Miki&#39;s ability to track him down.  I agree with secretary that it&#39;s doubtful it was purely &quot;chance&quot;.  I agree that he probably planned the surprise attack (and failed... again!).  But I don&#39;t think he was part of the police force yet in 1869... maybe he was.\n \nIf someone can translate the article MissB found that had info on Suzuki (the URL is above), I&#39;ll write up the information we have on Suzuki from that and the other website M translated and get it posted up on my Sagara site ASAP so it can be easily referenced.  (Could whoever translates it also give me the info on Shinohara Tainoshin?)   At least it&#39;ll be a start.\n \nphil\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
