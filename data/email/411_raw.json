It never\ndid of course, but those members were to become the\nShinchogumi (Newly Formed Group). When Kiyokawa and\nthe men reached Edo they started stirring up trouble\nin the city. \n With the news of a possible insurrection against the\ngovernment and Kiyokawa became known as part of the\nplot a hit was put out on him. He was killed on April\n13, 1963 (I would say yesterday was the anniversary,\nbut I think that date is using the other calendar).\nAnyways, the government then rounded up and imprisoned\nthe bad members of the group and those still around\nbecame the Shinchogumi. I don�t know anything about\nTadasaburo Sasaki&#39;s role in even of this though.\n\n I take it that in the tv series that it will be the\nend of episode 16 and then in episode 17 that Kondo\nand company become the Shinsengumi. \n\nKevin\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
