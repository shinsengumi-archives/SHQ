THE GODDESSES of INDIA, TIBET, CHINA and \nJAPAN\nCesara Publications\n\npage 452\n\n&quot;Inari, offices and titles: Vixen Goddess, Associated Places: Japan, \nKyoto\n\nINari the Fox Goddess is associated wiht the fire and smithcraft.  \nWhen referring to her, Chamerlain writes of &#39;the assistance rendered \nby that deity to the famous swordsmith Kojaki, for whom she blew the \nbellows while he was forgina sword for an ancient Mikado.&#39;  \n\nThe worship of Inari is mentioned by Chamberlain in his description \nof the places of pilgrimages in Japan;  he states that the &quot;great \nKyoto temple of the fox-deity Inari has a branch in almost every \nvillage&#39;.  This animal is considered in Japan to be of great magical \nimportance.\n\nJapanese women, according to Harrison&#39;s account, attach great \nimportance to foxes &#39;and take great pains to be on the....side of the \ngoddess Inari.&#39;  The same author also states that &#39;Geisha dn women of \npleasure are sometimes colloquially spoken of as kitsune (i.e. \nfoxes)&#39;.\n\nAmong the greater festivals of the Japanese Calendar, Chamberlain \nincludes the first day of the Horse (Hatsu-uma) in February, a \nmoveable feast, holy &#39;to the Fox-Goddess Inari&#39;.  Again on November \nthe 8th, the Festival of the Goddess of the Kitchen Range fires are \nlighted in honour of Inari and other deities.\n\nThis goddess may have some connexion with the vixen, Aunt Piety, of \nChina.&quot;\n\nI found the above mentioned info on Inari because I was checking info \non MARISHITEN...you can read more about her here\nhttp://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm54.showMessage?\ntopicID=28.topic\n\n\n\n\n"
