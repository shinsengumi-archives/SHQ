You=\r\n can skim it \nquickly and familiarize yourself with a very odd discovery a =\r\n\nresearcher made here about &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; who appeared in, \nTakamine&#39;s, a=\r\nn Aizu retainer, memorial book.\n\nTo summarize we try to prove and also list=\r\n arguments against \nhow &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; wasn&#39;t a random Aizu samurai.  But =\r\nin fact, \nFujita Goro (formerly SAITOU HAJIME). The strongest detail which =\r\n\nproves Saitou Kazuma is our Shinsengumi is that his background bares \ndeta=\r\nils very similar to that of Hajime.  Namely, they even lived in \nthe same r=\r\negion up north during the post 1868 exile.  Again, the \nthread is LONG and =\r\ntime consuming (^_^) and you can go over it at \nyour own pace.  If you&#39;ve b=\r\neen a member for a long time the info is \nredundant in some cases but we ha=\r\nd to state things logically best we \ncan.\n\nYes we know that he died with hi=\r\ns last name Fujita Goro, but as \nstated in the super long marathon length p=\r\nost....these people who \nreceived this memorial book were in a niche commun=\r\nity.  \n\nA community specifically which knew the Shinsengumi and were more \n=\r\nfamiliar even with Saitou Hajime or his third name Yamaguchi Jiro who \nfoug=\r\nht at Aizu and left behind a respectible if not heroic record at \nthat doma=\r\nin.\n\nOne of the interesting things the researcher noted was simply how one =\r\n\ncharacter was different in &quot;SAitou Kazuma&quot;.  Just one character.\n\nAs we kn=\r\now one character makes all the difference in \nChinese/Korean/Japanese.\n\nBut=\r\n here is the problem.  It may have simply have been an honest to \ngoodness.=\r\n..TYPO which was typical of that time period (especially if \nthis was done =\r\nat a small press).\n\nWell weren&#39;t there editors you might ask?\n\nYes.\n\nYamaka=\r\nwa Kenjiro, highly literate, competant and detailed was listed \nat the back=\r\n of the book---maybe as a financial contributor, maybe as \nan editor but no=\r\nthing is specific. The book doesn&#39;t say &quot;well here \nare the editors&quot; in any=\r\n way.  Yamakawa who could easily spell &quot;Saitou \nHajime&quot; properly may have c=\r\nontributed to the book but not had to \nproof it.\n\nThe book was written by a=\r\n group of people (I&#39;m guessing \neducators/former students of Takamine) who =\r\nlikely had NO IDEA nor \ndirect relationship with Fujita Goro/Saitou Hajime.=\r\n\n\nAgain, only Aizu folks especially would recognize Saitou Hajime and \nfor =\r\nthat matter any Shinsengumi name.\n\nI&#39;m thinking that SAitou Kazuma was a ty=\r\npo because even the surviving \nfamily members of Takamine family may not ha=\r\nve caught it for the same \nreason many of us (pretend you are Japanese) hav=\r\ne not seen the way \nyour dad&#39;s friend spells his name *on *paper because yo=\r\nur \nrelationship to that person was face-to-face (verbal interaction).  \nYo=\r\nu didn&#39;t read about your dad&#39;s friend in let&#39;s say a book or \nnewspaper.\n\nF=\r\nurthermore, the book was published in 1921.  It may have been \ncompiled mon=\r\nths and months earlier ofcourse since so many people&#39;s \nwords were incorpor=\r\nated into it.  If the project began in 1919 \n(Fujita was dead but his wife =\r\nTokio sure was alive to contribute and \nuse her husban&#39;d name)---I know tha=\r\nt Takamine&#39;s oldest son who \ntechnically should&#39;ve had a role in this book-=\r\n--was barely in Japan \nthat year!  He was also abroad in 1920.  The likelih=\r\nood of him \nspending time or even reading a first draft is unlikely.  Trave=\r\nl was \nnot only the issue this son was completing other work which would&#39;ve=\r\n \ntaken up most of his time.\n\nIf other family members were weighed down wit=\r\nh the editing/proofing \nthey&#39;d have *less ability to do so especially in te=\r\nrms of tiny \ndetails like name spelling.  The two youngest daughters only k=\r\nnew of \nan elderly Fujita Goro and Tokio.  There is little or no chance \nth=\r\ney&#39;d get the spelling of the name right---even in this very \nfascinating ca=\r\nse of using Fujita&#39;s most &quot;well known&quot; label.\n\nSorry about this rant---the =\r\nabove idea occurred to me because I read \na message online about someone cr=\r\niticizing a journalist for making a \ntyping error in an article (the name o=\r\nf a bridge).  Simply, the \ncomplexity of language Asian or otherwise just g=\r\nuarantees that some \nwords have more than one spelling.\n\n\n\n\n"
