But that&#39;s\n&gt; all ^^;;;\n&gt; \n&gt; As I&#39;ll be there till February, I want to visit some\n&gt; famous spots there ^^\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama-san and Momoiro Usagi-san: anata tachi wa Aizu\n&gt; chihou ni osumai deshouka? ^^;; Moshi sou deshitara\n&gt; aeru koto ga dekiru deshouka? ^^\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any help ^^;;\n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nHere&#39;s a great site that lists places that are related to the \nShinsengumi or to people who were involved with them! It even has a \nhandy little map so you can locate the sites easy!\n\nhttp://www.aiaiaizu.com/shinsengumi/\n\n \nThe site fails to mention this but Takizawa Go-honjin was also the HQ \nfor Matsudaira Katamori during the fighting. You&#39;re supposed to still \nbe able to see the bullet holes. It was originally a rest station. \n(The temple where he officially surrendered is right across from it. \nIt&#39;s called Myokoku-ji.) \n\nNyoraidou (Buddha Hall) - I think we determined this is where that \nSept. 4/5 battle took place?\nBonari Pass isn&#39;t mentioned on the site for some reason. \n\nI guess there is nothing left of them now, but the prison camps for \nthe Aizu samurai were at Inawashiro and Shiokawa. I think Saito was \nat least originally at Shiokawa.\n\nNot mentioned on this site:\nNihonmatsu Monument - Dedicated to yet another boys troop who were \nkilled in action.\nTonoguchihara Old Battle Site - Lots of heavy fighting here.\nTakeko Nakano (the leader of the women&#39;s troop) is buried at \nAizubange Town. Supposedly Horibe Yasubei&#39;s parents are also buried \nthere at Kitoku-ji Temple. \n\nAnother good site to look at would be:\nhttp://www.pref.fukushima.jp/index_e.html\n\n\nOh, the landscape around Aizu has changed a bit since the time of the \nBoshin War. I forget what year it was, but Mt. Bandai blew its top \nand ended up creating a bunch of lakes and marshes. I don&#39;t know if \nit changed any of the Shinsengumi related sites or not.\n\nEnjoy your trip!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n\n\n"
