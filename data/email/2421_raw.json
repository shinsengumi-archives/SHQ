Up till the time Western uniforms were used in the Boshin war, \nthere wasn&#39;t anything even remotely close to a uniform for Choshu. Up till \nthe time Satsuma joined in, the Choshu people operating in Kyoto were \nessentially operating independently, so they were very cash-strapped (like \nShinsengumi), and thus were likely to wear just their average street \nclothes-- kimono, hakama, and the like. Outside of the realm of Western \nuniforms, the only thing remotely close to a uniform with traditional \nJapanese clothes would be a haori with the crest of Mori (lord of Choshu) on \nit, which looked like this: http://www.samurai-archives.com/kamon/mori.jpg \nBut even then, wearing the lord&#39;s crest would only really be allowed to \nhigh-ranked samurai, I believe.\n\nLet me know if there&#39;s anything you need clarified.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
