The Kurasawa shared their home=\r\n\nwith Fujita Goro.  This is a well known fact amongst Japanese\nShinsengumi =\r\nresearchers.\n\nIn other words, &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; who knew the Takamine family f=\r\nrom their\ntime in Sannohe has the SAME biography as SAITOU HAJIME (FUJITA G=\r\nORO).\n\nWhich members of the Takamine family did &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; meet in\nSan=\r\nnohe?  He met Takamine&#39;s mother, and brothers (who were young\nchildren).  T=\r\nakamine Hideo (Tadayoshi) himself was a POW in Edo/Tokyo.\n The narrative of=\r\n the Takamine family has partly been preserved in the\ndiary of a Swiss immi=\r\ngrant (professor of Oswego Normal School).  In\nshort, &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; knew =\r\nthe Takamine family when they faced\nincredible hardship, so much so that th=\r\ney adopted one of their younger\nsons to another Aizu family.  Saitou Kazuma=\r\n knew this family well\nbefore they prospered in the Meiji Era.\n\nThus, we fe=\r\nel somewhat our theory has blossomed into something more.\n\nThank you to Mr.=\r\n Bakalian for doing this work.\nAs I have always known, Takamine and Fujita =\r\nwere truly good friends,\neven though they were 10 years apart and came from=\r\n different backgrounds.\n\nI hope they are enjoying a drink now, wherever the=\r\ny may be.\n\n----------------------------\nTHE MYSTERY OF SAITO KAZUMA\nBy Arme=\r\nn Bakalian \nwith notes by secretarytocapt3\n\nFACTS:  \nTakamine Hideo was the=\r\n cousin of Takagi/Fujita Tokio\nFujita Goro very likely found employment in =\r\nthe Education Museum\n(years on the job 1891-1899) through the assistance of=\r\n Takamine (who\nhad a leadership role in the Imperial Museum, and Educationa=\r\nl Museum\nwhich was affiliated with the Normal School he also managed).  \nFu=\r\njita Goro was employed at the Tokyo (Higher) Women&#39;s Normal School\n(years o=\r\nn the job 1899-1909) through petitions by both Takagi\nMorinusuke (his broth=\r\ner-in-law) and Takamine Hideo.\nA mystery is unfolding.\n\nIn the reminiscence=\r\ns collected in: Furoku: Tsuikai Danso of/about the\neducator Takamine Hideo,=\r\n three is one reminiscence, titled &quot;Ko\nTakamine Hideo-kun&quot; (The Late Mr. Ta=\r\nkamine Hideo) pages 5 to 7, penned\nby one &quot;Saito Kazuma, former Aizu retain=\r\ner.&quot; This would be inherently\nworth something, except when you consider the=\r\n following (note:\nJapanese kanji follow):\n\n&#25993;&#34276;&#19968; Saito H=\r\najime\n&#25993;&#34276;&#19968;&#39340; Saito Kazuma\n\nThere is a difference =\r\nof one kanji between this man&#39;s name and the\nname of the Shinsengumi captai=\r\nn, Saito Hajime. Nowhere in the text, or\nin the entirety of &quot;Takamine Hideo=\r\n Sensei-den&quot; (especially the\nchapter(s) on Aizu), does it have any mention =\r\nof this man; and it\ncertainly does not say anything about him being of the =\r\nShinsengumi.\nHowever, it also doesn&#39;t disprove his potentially being Saito =\r\nHajime\nof the Shinsengumi. Saito Hajime, at the time of Takamine Hideo&#39;s\nde=\r\nath, used the name Fujita Goro; however, let us consider the facts:\nthis is=\r\n a collection of writings in tribute to one of the greatest\neducators in mo=\r\ndern Japanese history.\nFujita Goro was a traffic cop, museum guard, and swo=\r\nrd appraiser to\nTakamine and personal friend; would the writings of such a =\r\nlow-ranking\nman fit alongside the tributes penned by Shinoda Toshihide, Yas=\r\nui\nTetsu, Baron Kuki Ryuichi, and the women who undertook high-level\nroles =\r\nin the Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School? In the modern day, would a\nbook of remi=\r\nniscences of a school or university president include the\nwords of the gate=\r\nman? Perhaps it is just my opinion, but the answer is no.\n\nHowever, Fujita =\r\nGoro does have a way of putting his words alongside\neveryone else&#39;s: his Ai=\r\nzu connection. He may not have been born in\nAizu, but he was adopted into i=\r\nts community, married the daughter of\nan Aizu samurai, and spilled blood fo=\r\nr its people. He had as much a\nright as anyone to call himself an Aizu samu=\r\nrai. Furthermore, &quot;Saito\nKazuma&quot; does what no one else in Furoku dares to d=\r\no: brings up, at\nlength, Takamine&#39;s Aizu connection, his conduct in the Bos=\r\nhin War, and\nhis continued devotion to his former lord&#39;s family. Others per=\r\nhaps\nmention Takamine&#39;s origins briefly, but pass over them quickly; after\n=\r\nall, at the time of Takamine&#39;s death, Aizu was still stigmatized under\nthe =\r\nfalse label of &quot;enemy of the throne.&quot;\nIt is not until 1928, the Imperial we=\r\ndding between Matsudaira Setsuko\nand Prince Chichibu (brother of Emperor Hi=\r\nrohito) did Aizu\n&quot;officially&quot; return into good graces to the national narra=\r\ntive.\n\nCould &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; be, in fact, the rather taciturn(1) Saito Hajim=\r\ne,\nwriting under a slightly, yet cleverly altered pseudonym? Could the\nold =\r\nwarrior have broken his silence for Takamine Hideo? While there is\nas yet n=\r\no definite &quot;yes&quot; answer to that question, there is also no\ndefinite &quot;no.&quot; H=\r\nowever, when considering even some of the points\ncovered by Ko Takamine Hid=\r\neo-kun, the facts line up a little too\nneatly for this to be mere coinciden=\r\nce.\n\n*&quot;Saito&quot; has intimate knowledge of the events concerning Takamine&#39;s\nsc=\r\nhool. Fujita Goro was an employee of the school.(2)\n\n*&quot;Saito&quot; devotes great=\r\n length to praising Takamine&#39;s art collection.\nTakamine, who relied on Sait=\r\no for sword appraisal, gave Saito\nunrestricted access to the art collection=\r\n in his LOCKED storehouse.(3)\n\n*&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s so=\r\nns came to Takamine&#39;s\nhouse for tutoring. Firstly, the Matsudaira children,=\r\n as sons of a\nformer daimyo, would not be taken just anywhere; secondly, fo=\r\nr &quot;Saito&quot;\nto know of this point, regarding the still maligned Matsudaira\nKa=\r\ntamori&#39;s family, shows that he was trusted. Fujita Goro spent a\ngreat deal =\r\nof time visiting Takamine&#39;s house.(4) After all, Fujita\nreceived the name F=\r\nujita Goro from Matsudaira Katamori himself.\n*&quot;Saito&#39;s own oldest son, Fuji=\r\nta Tsutomu, was friends with Matsudaira\nTsuneo.  Ofcourse Saito would know =\r\nif any one of the Matsudaira boys\nspent time at Takamine&#39;s home.  After all=\r\n, his own sons probably did\nas well.  We know that Takamine&#39;s own daughter =\r\nfrequently visited the\nFujita home.\n\n*&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Takamine talked ab=\r\nout the Matsudaira family to his\nAizu friend Kusaka Yoshio (Onetime governo=\r\nr of Nagasaki and Fukushima\nPrefectures), and &quot;shed sincere tears.&quot; Histori=\r\ncal records suggest\nthat Takamine almost never spoke openly about Aizu, tho=\r\nugh he was in\ncharge of the former retainers&#39; association; consequently, fo=\r\nr &quot;Saito&quot;\nto know of Takamine speaking about Aizu, and speaking emotionally=\r\n\nabout Aizu, shows his level of trust. Fujita Goro, as stated above,\noften =\r\ncame to the Takamine house, and when he came, would always drink\nsake(5). T=\r\nhose who know the Japanese culture of sake know that you\ndon&#39;t just randoml=\r\ny invite someone to your house and let them drink\nalone; first of all, for =\r\nFujita to be trusted to the point of being\nallowed to *always* drink sake a=\r\nt the Takamine house suggests that he\nmight have witnessed such discussions=\r\n about the past. Fujita often\nspoke of the past to Yamakawa Kenjiro, anothe=\r\nr prominent Aizu native,\nso it is not unreasonable to think that he may hav=\r\ne spoken of the past\nto Takamine, as well. Kenjiro&#39;s brother Hiroshi, durin=\r\ng his tenure as\npresident of the Normal School (while Takamine was still th=\r\nere), is\nbelieved to have been the one who recommended Fujita for employmen=\r\nt;\nan overlap between Fujita&#39;s discussions with Kenjiro and Fujita&#39;s\ndiscus=\r\nsions with Takamine Hideo is not at all unreasonable.\n\nThe Aizu natives who=\r\n are on record as having associated or been in\nclose proximity to Takamine =\r\nare all families who were high-ranking\nAizu retainers: Yamakawa, Ibuka, Tak=\r\nagi, Numazawa, Iinuma, Saigo...for\nthe sake of confirmation, I have looked =\r\nover the casualty lists for a\n&quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; or a relation of one, in Yamak=\r\nawa Kenjiro&#39;s Hoshu Aizu\nByakkotai Jukyushi-den, they include: Saito Gengo,=\r\n Saito Yukichi,\nSaito Jinzaemon, Saito Tasaburo, and Saito Tetsunosuke. Non=\r\ne of them\nparticularly high-ranking; none of them containing any reference =\r\nto a\n&quot;Saito Kazuma.&quot;(6)\n\nNotes:\n(1)Todo Toshihisa, &quot;Saito Hajime Kanren Jin=\r\nbutsu Jiten,&quot; pp. 193-206\nof Saito Hajime no Subete.

Hoshu Aizu Byakkotai=\r\n\nJukyushi-den. (Wakamatsu: Aizu Chorei Gikai, 1926), pp. 46, 94-95\nSome Pro=\r\ns and Cons to Consider\n1)\t Why would FUJITA GORO use a pseudonym?  It&#39;s unn=\r\necessary isn&#39;t it?\nMr. Bakalian raises and important point regarding status=\r\n.  In the\nMeiji Era generally you would invite someone honored to speak on\n=\r\nbehalf of the deceased.  While Fujita was no doubt a close and\nrespected fr=\r\niend his position cannot compare to many of the other\npeople who contribute=\r\nd to Takamine&#39;s memorial/biography.\n\nAgain, we have to think like a Japanes=\r\ne living in the Meiji Era not as\nsomeone living in 2007.\n\nAnother point to =\r\nconsider is clearly the fact that Saito Kazuma is not\naddressing educators,=\r\n he is addressing people of the Aizu community. \nTherefore the name &quot;Saito&quot;=\r\n may or may not ring a bell with people of\nthat background.  &quot;Saito&quot; would =\r\nmean nothing to many readers.  Simply,\nis this the coded language that come=\r\ns from living a bit separately\nfrom society due to one&#39;s past Aizu connecti=\r\nons?  Please keep in mind\nthat there was a lot of discrimination, favoritis=\r\nm and cronyism after\n1868 which was based on one&#39;s feudal hometown.\n\n2)\tSo =\r\nhow does Saito Kazuma get to write all this stuff?\nThat is the biggest ques=\r\ntion.  The Takamine family had several\nsurviving members, including Takamin=\r\ne Hideo&#39;s aged mother (who was\nclose to Tokio and no doubt knew Fujita Goro=\r\n VERY WELL), Takamine&#39;s\n2nd, 3rd son, and 2 daughters.  Why would four memb=\r\ners of the Takamine\nfamily let some strange person write all of this?  Clea=\r\nrly Saito\nKazuma is someone they knew and trusted very well\n\n3)\tWho else ov=\r\nersaw the publication?\nYamakawa Kenjiro&#39;s name appears at the end of the bo=\r\nok as likely a\nfinancial contributor to its publication.  He was also a mut=\r\nual friend\nof Fujita and Takamine and a major figure in the post 1868 Aizu\n=\r\nnetwork.  Again we ask, if Yamakawa proofread this work he had to know\nwho =\r\nSaito Kazuma was and like the Takamine family, was &quot;ok&quot; with it.\n\n4)\tWait a=\r\n minute!  Takamine&#39;s book was published in 1921 !  Fujita\nGoro was DEAD ALR=\r\nEADY in 1915!  He could not have written anything.\nThis is obviously a ques=\r\ntion which needs to be answered.  Takamine\ndied in 1910, however his memori=\r\nal was not published for a decade. \nJapanese frequently publish memorial ev=\r\nen years after the person has\ndied (they do so to fall on certain Buddhist =\r\nanniversaries).  It is\nnot strange for a friend to prepare statements which=\r\n are published\nlater on behalf of the deceased.  Most interestingly even so=\r\nme of\nTakamine&#39;s speeches were published years after he died (for the first=\r\n\ntime).  Furthermore, the words of Saito Kazuma may in fact be the\npolished=\r\n narrative assisted by Fujita Tokio (admittedly a very well\neducated of the=\r\n feudal era AND knew Takamine when he was still just a\nteenager as well).\n\n=\r\nTokio was alive when this project had already started (she died in\n1921). E=\r\nven though she may have retired from the Higher Women&#39;s Normal\nSchool (we d=\r\no not have the start or end dates of her employment\nthere), she was close t=\r\no campus and likely &quot;hung out&quot; there to help\nout or just be nosy. In doing =\r\nso she could easily be found. We must\nalso remember that Tokio was Takamine=\r\n&#39;s cousin and they knew each\nother since 1868 while serving in the castle.\n=\r\n\nTo prove that Saito Kazuma is NOT Fujita Goro:\n1)\tFind a real Aizu retaine=\r\nr who was named Saito Kazuma.  At this time\nwe have not yet found a retaine=\r\nr with that name after searching\nthrough more well known Aizu history books=\r\n (which do include lists of\nnames).  Perhaps one would have to go to a libr=\r\nary in Aizu Wakamatsu\nto find this man.\n2)\tFind an educator, artist, scient=\r\nist who was an Aizu associate of\nTakamine with the name Saito Kazuma.\nI, se=\r\ncretarytocapt3, have spent nearly 3 intense years studying\nTakamine Hideo f=\r\nrom various research angles.  I have never found the\nname of an educator, A=\r\nizu connections or not, with the name &quot;Saito\nKazuma&quot;.\n\n\n\n"
