To get to chat with others, and for a while I&#39;ve been thinking about reviving the chatroom created in mIRC from a couple of months ago.  If anyone still remembers, the chatroom is still on the same server (caelestia.net)  with the same channel name (#shinsengumihq).   I myself am only available on Wednesdays & Thursdays, but I would love to chat with all of you in order to get more information (as was my original intention for the chatroom).   \n\nAlso,  I was also intrested in getting the information about when and how the Shensengumi began to divide themselves into units.\n\n-Bunneh\n^_____________^\n\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:                               ok so we are all in agreement that there is some conflicting info on\n Okita but there are issues regarding citation\n \n as of today this page is now a mess  ::ROFL!!::\n http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n \n I can&#39;t keep up with you intense researchers (I work on the timeline,\n Saitou Hajime post 1868 because there is more info in English on the\n Meiji Era, Takagi/Fujita Tokio and some Aizu folks) so I have a ~weak~\n grasp of Okita (but I wrote that article on TB, that counts for\n something right?)...now this is an idea...\n \n why don&#39;t all the Okita specialists form a team and revise Okita&#39;s\n info page (^___^) get in a chatroom, or work on someone&#39;s blog and do\n some revising etc...but really you don&#39;t have to be a specialist you\n can be a fan who joins the group and asks questions, this will help\n the main writers understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of the hundreds of thousands of\n Okita fans out there\n \n again it is totally important to cite details this would be very\n helpful to visitors of the site\n \n also you may right some mini articles on Okita as well and I can\n create a sub-menu\n \n for example I split the Saitou Hajime page into sections (by the way\n I&#39;m in the process of converting my word document essay into html to\n enhance the info on the page) you can take a peak here:\n http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\n \n and when you are all done, just email the text, your names (real or\n user names) to shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com\n \n a similar approach was adopted with the gigantic still in progress\n timeline where several people over a couple of months emailed\n updates/entries\n \n so promise me that you will all think about it!  It is really\n impossible for one person to study ALL the Shinsengumi members or all\n facets of the history/culture\n \n specialize. divide and conquer!\n \n \n     \n                       \n\n __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
