Mind you, I&#39;ll be \nin MOPE LURK mode. :( \n\nArigarou gosaimasu f=\r\nor keeping us informed.\n\nKikue\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou=\r\n &lt;spiritus_saitou@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; To give you a bit of the background and =\r\nwhy you might never see \nsubs for this special, I&#39;m adding below some of th=\r\ne messages from a \ntopic over on d-addicts (and btw, they have a strict pol=\r\nicy of not \nrequesting subtitles... it&#39;s run purely on a volunteer basis an=\r\nd they \nwant no pressure put on those who have the ability).  The informati=\r\non \nis from a member who&#39;s been watching and dealing in jdrama (and with \nK=\r\nIKU) for a very long time.  If the link will copy here, the full \ntopic is =\r\nat \n&gt;   http://d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic_p438163.htm#438163 .  I&#39;m \nquo=\r\nting without permission, too, but felt this would be easier to \ncommunicate=\r\n the issue.\n&gt;    \n&gt;     &gt;&gt;Do you think the subs gonna be realeasd?\n&gt;     &gt;&gt;=\r\nNo, because TV Japan and KIKU-TV are not making English subs \nfor this SP. =\r\nTaiga dramas are never subbed by fansubbers because, \nlike you said, the ol=\r\nd language is too difficult to interpret. \nTraditionally we rely on the pro=\r\nfessionals for subs of taiga and many \nother jidaigeki/period dramas.\n&gt;    =\r\n The version of Shinsengumi uploaded on D-Addicts was subbed by \nTV Japan o=\r\nf New York USA, which is a partner of NHK. To date, there \nare no fansubs o=\r\nf taiga dramas because up to today there is no need \nfor fansubs. \n&gt; \n&gt; Bri=\r\nef review... Until Yoshitsune in 2005, two companies made \nsubtitles for ta=\r\niga dramas: TV Japan and JN Productions of Hawaii USA \n(using KIKU-TV to br=\r\noadcast.) The taiga dramas you see on the \nInternet was subbed by one of th=\r\ne two companies, depending on who \nprovided the resources. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the con=\r\ntinental US TV stations, the subs were provided by TV \nJapan. I&#39;m not sure =\r\nwho did the subbing prior to Toshiie to Matsu. \n&gt; \n&gt; In Hawaii, the subs we=\r\nre provided by JN Productions, and aired on \nKIKU-TV. One exception to this=\r\n is Shinsengumi (2004)... The first 25-\npercent or so of the series was sub=\r\nbed by JN Productions. In April \n2004, ties between KIKU-TV and JNP were br=\r\noken, so KIKU-TV subbed the \nremaining 75-percent of Shinsengumi in-house. =\r\nI&#39;ve yet to see the \nJNP/KIKU-TV version released to the Internet. \n&gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n is easy to tell who subbed what... \n&gt; - If the subs are white and two-line=\r\ns, they&#39;re JN Production subs. \n&gt; - If the subs are white and three-lines, =\r\nthey&#39;re KIKU-TV (in-house) \nsubs. \n&gt; - If the subs are yellow and two-lines=\r\n, they&#39;re TV Japan &lt;&lt;\n&gt;    \n&gt;   For what it&#39;s worth. I don&#39;t know what this=\r\n means for future \ntaiga dramas (I haven&#39;t been following this season&#39;s & d=\r\non&#39;t know if \nNHK & other entities are dropping subtitling all together).\n&gt;=\r\n   phil\n&gt;   \n&gt; secretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   Michael informed=\r\n me of a major CORRECTION to the message below\n&gt; \n&gt; The sequel aired in Haw=\r\naii LAST WEEKEND on NTV not KIKU and sadly \nit \n&gt; was not subtitled.
