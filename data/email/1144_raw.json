And Nagakura make a proposal to march toward Aizu with \ncurrent troop strength.\n*Nagakura who considers Kondo always as his fellow, is offended to see Kondo, \nnow became a direct vassal of Shogun of 300 koku.\n*Kondo probably thinks it would be better to recrute more solders and after \ntraining, he&#39; ll go to Aizu with them as the Supreme Commander.\n*So their discordant is due to different strategic point of view as well as \ntheir sentimental confrict.\n\nI have no intenion to idealize Kondo, may be he became little bit haughty, \nbut it was a point of view of Nagakura&#39;s side.\nAs I know similer condition in the history, I guesse what might be happened \nin a defeated army. \n\nTama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
