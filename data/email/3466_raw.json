While he was there, a coup d&#39;etat oc=\r\ncurred, led by court noble Iwakura Tomomi, and backed by the armed force of=\r\n Satsuma troops.\n\nPer Mori Mayumi, Shogitai Ibun, pp. 83-84, Yoshinobu had =\r\n3,000 Aizu men and 1,500 Kuwana men, together with Shinsengumi and others, =\r\nunder his command, and to use Mori&#39;s words, &quot;Yoshinobu missed his one chanc=\r\ne to put down Satsuma by force.&quot; Yoshinobu chose instead to leave Kyoto, th=\r\nen some time later sent his armies back to Kyoto with his letter to the Emp=\r\neror, and their progress was blocked outside Kyoto, which began the Battle =\r\nof Toba-Fushimi and the Boshin War. Then a few days into the battle, he abs=\r\nconded with the lords of Aizu, Kuwana, Matsuyama, and others, leaving said =\r\narmies without their seniormost leaders.\n\nThe reality remains though, that =\r\nYoshinobu let that chance while he was still in Kyoto slip him by. So I thi=\r\nnk that basically the fate of Toba-Fushimi and the war was sealed before ei=\r\nther Toba-Fushimi or the Boshin war even started.\n\nWorth thinking about.\n\n\n"
