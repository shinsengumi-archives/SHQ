It all depends on what material the hakama is made from. A lot of the lower end hakama, like the black one I have, is a polyester and tetron blend, so it tends to get a bit on the warm side, especially now since it&#39;s getting closer to summer. The 100% cotton ones definately breathe a lot better, but are a pain to care for in the pleat department, even if folded after practice. After 1 good practice, the pleats start to dissapear. Interestingly, in recent years new hakama which have the pleats sewn at the crease to keep them in, have started to become available. Having the pleats in makes it much easier to fold up into a square when not in use.  \n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, May 20, 2004 3:29 AM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Some kendo stuff\n\n\n  Well, since I know I can&#39;t continue beyond summer I didn&#39;t buy a\n  hakama or gi...however I kind of went with the tradition of other\n  members and wore a navy blue T-shirt (w/ school logo) and dark blue\n  work out pants...so basically everyone looked the same when they are\n  in armor...I understand that some dojos don&#39;t let their students start\n  off with hakama right away because when worn/tied a bit lower at the\n  waist the teacher can&#39;t see your feet/ankles too well to check on your\n  footwork...but hakama to me look comfortable for stretches and they\n  seem to &quot;breathe&quot; as well...perfect for those hot days right? :P  But\n  even regular workout pants don&#39;t allow for as much movement as say\n  karate/judo pants which can get pricey.
