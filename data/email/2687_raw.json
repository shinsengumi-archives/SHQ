First I=\r\n \nwill apologize to the list for this debacle. Second I will apologize \nto =\r\nSecretarytoCapt3 for downloading the stuff. I will explain, I use \na downlo=\r\nad manager that spiders ftps, file server and whole \nwebsites. I was at wor=\r\nk and yes was doing this on the side so I let \nit run automatically instead=\r\n of downloading the links provided one \nby one. I have not taken an in-dept=\r\nh look at the files provided and \nwhen I get to work will delete them. Yes =\r\nthis whole thing was =96my- \nfault and no I did not mean to steal anyone&#39;s =\r\nfiles nor bandwidth \nbut this is what happens when a person does not pay en=\r\nough \nattention. My apologies.\n\nTo the list, I&#39;m sorry you guys got involve=\r\nd in my stupidity. I hope \nthat SHQ will remain to serve the community that=\r\n visits it and not \nbe stuck in this one event. I will now excuse myself fr=\r\nom this list \nso as to prevent events of this kind and so that the list can=\r\n \nconduct its activities in a confident manner. I implore you to \nconduct y=\r\nour fandom as usual and put this incident behind you.\n\nTo the Mods and Secr=\r\netarytoCapt3 if you have further inquiries let \nme know via e-mail.\n\n~Kizu\n=\r\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Even though I own this list most of you probably don&#39;t know me \nsince I\n&gt;=\r\n keep a pretty low profile unless I feel I have something to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well=\r\n I have something to say now and I apologize in advance for \nbitching\n&gt; at =\r\nthose who are innocent of the episode that has gotten me \nseriously\n&gt; pisse=\r\nd off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier today Sec wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I got an email report about this s=\r\nerver\n&gt; whoever is downloading ALL MY FILES ***other than the ones\n&gt; [speci=\r\nfied] below should please please stop---those OTHER FILES \nhave\n&gt; *nothing*=\r\n to do with the Shinsengumi!\n&gt; \n&gt; ...when you download OTHER files it reall=\r\ny messes things up for me \nin\n&gt; terms of bandwidth...just right click and d=\r\nownload the files I\n&gt; specified [ONLY]\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks alot now I have to go th=\r\nrough and lock my other files&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Appalled doesn&#39;t even come close to de=\r\nscribing my reaction to \nthis.
