Let&#39;s hope that we get to see Koichi Sato in uniform \n(still amazed by his excellent performance in GONIN).  My hunch is \nSanada would be the bad guy and Kiichi Nakai is the poor family man \ncaught in this entire mess LOL!\n\nJSDF is everywhere in the world of anime most noticeably in the \nPatlabor 2 directed by Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell and Jin-\nRoh:The Wolf Brigade).  Mamoru Oshii is fascinated with how the \npolice and military function, advanced technology and ofcourse naked \nfemale cyborgs.  In Patlabor 2, no naked female cyborgs ^_^ by the \nway,  the tension between JSDF and the TMPD Mobile Unit (focus of \nthe film) is addresed and the director makes some pretty straight \nforward and highly critical AND controversial comments about \npolitics, an unjust/just peace, the concept of a just/unjust war and \nso forth.  I find it fascinating that many anime actually address \nthe competition(?) and quiet conflict between the police and army \n(all of which can be traced back to the Seinan War).  Mamoru Oshii \ndoes not show the police and army attacking one another but he does \nillustrate the rift between the organizations.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (I snagged it form a Hiroyuki Sanada \n&gt; fansite----http://www.twilightforest.net/sanada/)\n&gt; \n&gt; The title is &quot;Bokoku no Aegis&quot; (&quot;Aegis of ruined country&quot;?? hard \nto \n&gt; translate without reading the original story\n\n\n"
