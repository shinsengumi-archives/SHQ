Most focus on how it can be \ntransferred to modern-day life. Each has it&#39;s own interpretation of \nwhat Miyamoto Musashi was trying to say. But perhaps this one is a \nbit different...\n\nIt&#39;s the interpretation of Stephen F. Kaufman, Hanshi 10th Dan. On \nthe back it makes the claim that it is specifically for the marital \nartist, the way it was orginally intended. As Kaufman points \nout &quot;There is a significant difference between not getting a deal \nsigned and having your head cut off. Business is mental. War is \nmental -and- physical.&quot;\n\nAnyone on the list who studies the marital arts have an opinion about \nthis particular book? Anyone know a better interpretation? Let us \nknow. With so many different interpretations of Mushashi&#39;s work on \nthe market, it&#39;s hard for those of us with no martial arts experience \nor translation skills to know what to trust and what to stay away \nfrom.\n\n&quot;Musashi&#39;s Book of Five Rings&quot;\nStephen F.
