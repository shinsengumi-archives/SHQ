(In \n&gt; &gt;1876, Yugorou married Isami&#39;s daughter, became the fifth=\r\n master of \n&gt; &gt;the Tennen Rishin-ryu, and changed his name to Kondou Yuugor=\r\nou.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for all the info - as you can tell, I&#39;m really interes=\r\nted in \n&gt; all the adopting that was going on.  I&#39;ve been asking all my \n&gt; q=\r\nuestions using Kondou and Okita as examples.  Yes, Yugorou became \n&gt; Isami&#39;=\r\ns heir, but I guess what I really want to know is - *what if* \n&gt; Isami had =\r\nadopted an heir.  Would that person have to go through \n&gt; three adoptions (=\r\nMiyagawa, Shimazaki, Kondou) to finally become \n&gt; Kondou?  And why? (Since =\r\nIsami had to become a Shimazaki before a \n&gt; Kondou.) \n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone knows =\r\nof a book or someplace online where there is some \n&gt; explanation of adoptio=\r\nns during this time, feel free to direct me \n&gt; before I potentially drive e=\r\nveryone crazy with questions.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --Wanda\n&gt;     (Thanking everyo=\r\nne for their patience.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@...=\r\nm, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nlf7@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually, Isami&#39;s nephew Miyagawa Yugorou=\r\n became his heir. (In \n&gt; 1876, Yugorou married \n&gt; &gt; Isami&#39;s daughter, becam=\r\ne the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, \n&gt; and changed his \n&gt; &gt; name t=\r\no Kondou Yuugorou.) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I suppose that Souji&#39;s son could be Souji&#39;s h=\r\neir. Yoshijirou could \n&gt; also be the head of the \n&gt; &gt; family after Souji an=\r\nd before Souji&#39;s son. My guess is relevantly \n&gt; based on the Okita family \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; history through four generations.    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ten years after Rintarou=\r\n Kanemasa&#39;s death, Yoshijirou died in 1895, \n&gt; at age 43 (by East \n&gt; &gt; Asia=\r\nn age reckoning.) His grave is next to Souji&#39;s, by the way. \n&gt; Yoshijirou&#39;s=\r\n heir/eldest son \n&gt; &gt; Juji (sp?) died in 1910, at age 23 (by East Asian age=\r\n reckoning.) \n&gt; After Juji&#39;s death, his \n&gt; &gt; younger brother became the hea=\r\nd of the Okita family.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Souji had started a branch family, is that=\r\n considered a separate\n&gt; &gt; &gt;family altogether, or does that put Rintaro and=\r\n his family in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;inferior position within Souji&#39;s family?\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s co=\r\nnsidered a branch family that doesn&#39;t put Rintaro and his \n&gt; family in an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; inferior position within Souji&#39;s family (I think...)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~Seven\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zhusanna&quot; &lt;wsehome@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and he too=\r\nk the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;name Kondou when he became the 3rd master of the Tennen Rishi=\r\nn-\n&gt; ryu \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in 1830. Therefore, Kondou Isami was first adopted as a \n&gt;=\r\n Shimazaki \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before he took the name Kondou sometime after 1858.  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, wait.....if Kondou Isami had adopted =\r\nan heir, this heir would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to be adopted first as a Miyagawa, the=\r\nn as a Shimazaki, then \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a Kondou??  How much time had to pass b=\r\netween adoptions?  Didn&#39;t \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this adopting get confusing?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa befo=\r\nre Souji&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;birth (but that&#39;s not the point here.) Rintarou Mototsun=\r\ne served \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the head of the Okita family for a short time (possi=\r\nbly less \n&gt; than a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head o=\r\nf the family. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the he=\r\nad of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;family until Souji got married.  Had Souji lived longer, =\r\n\n&gt; Rintarou \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s son Yoshijirou would probably have become So=\r\nuji&#39;s \n&gt; heir \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and would likely have married Souji&#39;s eldest daughter=\r\n.) I \n&gt; suppose \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son ma=\r\nrried \n&gt; Rintarou \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s daughter instead.  However, considerin=\r\ng that Souji&#39;s \n&gt; son \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would&#39;ve been quite a few years younger than =\r\nRintarou Kanamasa&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this would&#39;ve =\r\nbeen the case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If Rintaro Kanamasa was =\r\nonly &quot;holding&quot; the heir position for \n&gt; Souji \n&gt; &gt; &gt; until he got married, =\r\nwhy wouldn&#39;t Souji&#39;s son (if he had had \n&gt; one) be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Souji&#39;s heir?  Wh=\r\nat would Rintaro&#39;s son have to do with anything \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now?  Because Rintar=\r\no was holding that position, did that make \n&gt; Souji \n&gt; &gt; &gt; obligated to him=\r\n?  Couldn&#39;t Souji have done whatever he wanted \n&gt; since \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he would be =\r\nhead of the family?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Souji can start &quot;Bunke&quot;, a =\r\nbranch family of Okita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Souji received Bakushin status in 1967 so hi=\r\ns Okita line could \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;higher than Rintaro&#39;s Okita line.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If Souji had started a branch family, is that considered a \n&gt; s=\r\neparate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; family altogether, or does that put Rintaro and his family i=\r\nn an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inferior position within Souji&#39;s family?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --=\r\nWanda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
