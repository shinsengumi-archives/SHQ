So the translator DID chose the wrong word when it was translating the part about his first wife!!! I suspected it might have, but I had not way of knowing for sure. So Saito was husky?! Well, that is COMPLETELY different than the picture RK paints of him, isn&#39;t it?! The part about Kondo being his &quot;old friend&quot; is interesting. Thanks for clearing that up M!\n\n-MissBehavin (Thinks the slogan for Babelfish and other translators ought to be: History for the insane!)\n\n"
