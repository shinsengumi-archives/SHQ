According to (1)Takada Omote\nOn-azukari Hitobito Betsu in (2) Takada Kinshinchuu Zakki that lists\npeople who were put them on their best behaviors, Hajime Saitoo is\nrecorded as Denpachi Ichinose among Suzaku  menbers who were\naccommodated in Temple Sooji-ji.   According to (3) Aihan Hokuetsu\nTakada Kinshinnin Mei, (4) Echigo Takada Tsume Myoosai Yuujin Choo,\nand (5) Aizu-han Takada Yuushuu Meibo, while he was on his best\nbehaviors, he is recorded as his false name, Denpachi Ichinose again.\n\nIt is confirmed by the list that puts the names of people who\nimmigrated to Tonan in 1869, that Hajime Saitoo used the name, Goroo\nFujita when he moved to Tonan.  He moved to Goko after he changed his\nname from Denpachi Ichinose to Goroo Fujita, and became a Tonan citizen.\n\n\n\n"
