Lost my DSL for almost a month\nnow... Using dial up in the meantime.... WHY? OH WHY? DOES ALL THE\nGOOD STUFF COME OUT WHEN MY DSL IS NOT AVAILABLE? Take for example\nthese scanlations (AND MANY THANKS TIFFANY! REALLY APPRECIATE THIS),\nhow many hours to download... Then I missed out on the bittorent for\nthe shinsengumi episode... Then I can&#39;t download musashi episode\n19....  T_T T_T T_T\n\nStill, I will go and download (these scanlations) regardless......\n\n~wounds\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFrom must-see cities to the best beaches, plan a getaway with the Spring \nTravel Guide! http://special.msn.com/local/springtravel.armx\n\n\n"
