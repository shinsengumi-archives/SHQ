The book is not a translation of Musashi&#39;s treatise so \nmuch as Kaufman&#39;s interpretation of various translations of the \nbook.  I have no idea what his credentials are, but I&#39;m pretty \ncertain they don&#39;t include Niten Ichi Ryu.  Over at Amazon.com \nthere&#39;s a pretty good review of the book that echos basically \neverything I&#39;d been told about it.  There is a man called Hyakutake \nColin who belongs to one of the surviving branches of that art and \nyou can read a bit more about it www.hyoho.com.  I&#39;m afraid exactly \nwhich translation he recommends escapes me at the moment.\nIt&#39;s been a while since I read the GoRin No Sho, I&#39;m more of a fan \nof Yagyu Munenori&#39;s Heiho Kadensho.  Though I belong to Yagyu \nShinkage Ryu so I&#39;m admittedly biased.\n\n\n\n\n"
