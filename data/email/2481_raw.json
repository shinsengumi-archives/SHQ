Ninjadojo is a very active community.\n\nAs you may know there is more than one Dai-bosatsu Toge (based on \nthe novel of the same name) the most popular and easy to find is the \none starring Tatsuya Nakadai directed by Kihachi Okamoto...the other \nversion is called Satan&#39;s Sword directed by Kenji Misumi, which \nsticks to the novel more which means it will cover more ground \nduring the Shinsengumi &quot;arc&quot;.  Satan&#39;s Sword is in the process of \nbeing re-subbed right now and will be sold unofficially.\n\nfor our new members the novel (which is SUPER hard to find in \nEnglish) can be downloaded \nhttps://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Dai-bosatsu%20Toge/DBT.zip\n6mb\neven if you don&#39;t have time to read it -now- just please download \nwhile I can still host the file---when the novel discusses Shimabara \nthe author kind of goes off on a tangent but he does provide some \nvaluable info\n------------------\nOff-topic\nhttp://www.kurotokagi.com/  (also offers ASSASSINATION--on Kiyokawa \nHachiro)\nis selling a film called BURAIKEN (about a bunch of misfits in a \nkabuki troupe) which is not only rare but one of the most \nextensively discussed films by western critics\nI have never purchased a film from kurotokagi--but I will probably \ndo so just because they offer BURAIKEN\n\n\n\n"
