Bodies were usually buried at night.  \n\nFrom\n&quot;Funerals&quot;.  Japanese Culture in the Meiji Era Volume 4: Manners and Customs\nPublished by The Toyo Bunko (The Oriental Libraly)  [sic]\nHonkomagone 2-chome, 28-21, Bunkyo-ku\nTokyo, Japan\nFirst Impression 1957\nReprint Edition 1969\n\n\n&quot;In general the idea underlying such customs was,... that the near relatives become for a time special companions of the dead.&quot;  \n\nAs night is the domain of spirits, this makes sense to have night burials.\n\nAlso considering that the bodies were considered unclean and there were numerous taboos associated with funerals, wakes, burials -- there may have been many pragmatic reasons for night burials.\n\nRegarding the lantern -&gt; I&#39;d probably analogize this to the mention of fire, which is described as follows (pg 190).\n\n&quot;In some place a fire was built at the house when the casket was being carried out, while in others the leader of the funeral processions or other members thereof carried a flame, and in still others a fire was started at the burial ground before or after interment.  The reasons varied.  Dependent on the locality, the fire served to guide the way, to fend off devils, to purify the surroundings, to light the funeral pyre, to burn trash, to keep people warm, or to accomplish some combination of these purposes, but in any case fire seems to have been a normal accompaniment to the funeral.  A number of dialectical terms suggested that it symbolized the presence of the fire deity.  &quot; \n\nS\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
