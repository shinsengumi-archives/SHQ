It would \nbe historically accurate that samurai would wear asagi colored kimono for \nseppuku ceremony.\nIf you saw NHK, that pale green Kamishimo worn by Yamanami or Kawai for their \nseppuku is also asagi color as there are many nuance of that color.\nDispite the difference of the tone, if speaking of Asagi color in bakumatsu \nit would be blue but slightly greenished close to cyan or peacock in western \ncolor.\n\nThe problem with TV drama or film is sometimes they choose deliberately \ndifferent color for that uniform rather than authentic asagi, by esthetic or \ntechnical reason.\nFor exemple, NHK staff told that authentic asagi color becomes less clear \nthrough the camera and they had to choose more vivid blue.\nAbout Gohatto, Takeshi Kitano said that was good choice if they used black \ncolor uniform instead of blue, because Shinsengumi appeared often in many skits \nwith that blue costume and if Kitano who had been known as a comedian appeared \nin such uniform, that would make laugh the people. \nThey could avoid too popular image.\n\nTama\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
