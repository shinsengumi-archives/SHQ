I also\nhappen to love PMK Saitou&#39;s hair :) and how Nanae draws people&#39;s hair.\n\n*Reminder*\nA LOVE STORY OF SAITOU HAJIME (sadly, it seems the the writer for Kaze\nHikaru beat us to it---the story is about a young lady who literally\ncan&#39;t keep her hands off of S.H.! &lt;&lt;&lt; how&#39;s that for a teaser?)\nhttp://www.fifay.net/projects/lovestory01.html\n\n\n"
