Can&#39;t wait to get to work to download it. \nI wonder what this teaser is about?\n\nOh Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker and Bakumatsu manga is there too.\n\nBye guys/gals.. ^_^ Yeah... I&#39;m SUPPOSED to be sleeping.. Three more \nhours and the luxury of sleep will be no more...  -_-\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This might be old news... I just found out about it... On April 4 a \n&gt; manga scanlation group named Atlantis dream came out with a teaser \n&gt; for Burai. I&#39;m waiting to get this from a messageboard member \n&gt; elsewhere, when I do I&#39;ll probably upload it. As Tiffany said \nbefore \n&gt; there is a place where you can get translations but I chose not to \n&gt; because I really don&#39;t like using paypal... Anyway I&#39;m mightily \n&gt; intrigued whether the group will still continue with the project as \nI \n&gt; can only find the Burai project in google&#39;s cache and not in \n&gt; the &quot;updated&quot; webpage...\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the cache\n&gt; \n&gt; http://216.239.39.104/search?\n&gt; \nq=cache:j8YgJG3EHVAJ:web.inter.nl.net/users/revena/projects.htm+atlant\n&gt; isdream+burai&hl=en&ie=UTF-8\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the old update for burai\n&gt; \n&gt; http://web.inter.nl.net/users/revena/old.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s their website\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.atlantisdream.cjb.net/\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah! Yey! I&#39;ve been waiting SO LONG for this...\n\n\n"
