How did they manage to not recognize Saitoh as a \nmember of\n&gt; the Shinsengumi again?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, all of them were samurai, mainly from Satsuma, as far as I\n&gt; understand (as it says in the RK manga, vol. 1). As for recognizing\n&gt; Saitou-- didn&#39;t he change his name? And besides, it&#39;s not like there\n&gt; were photos of him from his Shinsengumi days...so I don&#39;t think many\n&gt; former Ishin Shishi would&#39;ve recognized him...\n&gt; \n&gt; --M.\n\n\n\nvisit \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
