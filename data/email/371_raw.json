The messages come \ninto inboxes as much as 14 hours later, \nsometimes are sent multiple times (one \nlist member received a message into his \ninbox *24* times), and sometimes never \nshow up at all. For a discussion \ngroup, this is torture... and it&#39;s been \ngoing on for well over a week. \nNormally when we&#39;ve encountered \nproblems like this, the problem has \ncleared up, but it&#39;s not clearing up \nthis time.\n\nI&#39;ve been searching the Help files to \nno avail for what could be causing \nthis. May I suggest Yahoo create a \npage where users (of mail and groups) \ncan access update information about \nproblems the system is experiencing? \nIf such a page exists, WHERE is it?\n\nOf the groups I am on, the one \nexperiencing the most trauma (because \nit&#39;s the most active) is shq. \n\nI and the group are anxiously awaiting \nan explanation for the problems and a \nhopeful cure.
