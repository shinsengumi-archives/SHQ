San Francisco one \nis more Bakumatsu...I share your concerns Alan...I was on the phone, \nthe lady asked if I had seen the TV ad?  So I&#39;m assuming that this \nevent will attract alot of attention in the Japanese community.\n\n*yes, NHK&#39;s Shinsengumi does not advertise itself to be historically \naccurate...it&#39;s just entertainment...I agree that NHK should be very \nclear with some issues...perhaps the books sold concerning the \nseries points out what is history, rumors/folktales, or fiction...at \nleast I would hope that they feel some responsibility\n\n*I hope Hillsborough will give lectures too when his book is \nreleased...JAL is aware that Hillsborough has written a book in \nEnglish on the Shinsengumi\n\nMany of us here understand and appreciate the synthesis between fact \nand fiction but the bottom line...is the bottom line \n$$$$$...personally, I hope that the hyper commercialization of the \nshinsengumi will lead the few to appreciate their historical \nrelevance.\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan&quot; &lt;alanw1911@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perhaps not an authority, but as the key speaker(the one being \n&gt; advertised), I think it&#39;s important for anyone interested in going \n&gt; to know what they&#39;re paying for.  Will Jiro Asada be presenting \n&gt; anything insightful, or will this just be a press junket for his \n&gt; latest Shinsengumi-based novel?  I guess a better example would be \n&gt; if the marquee speaker is the scriptwriter for that god-awful NHK \n&gt; Shinsengumi series airing right now.  He may have done some \nresearch \n&gt; to write the script, but I doubt anyone would want to pay to hear \n&gt; his &quot;knowledge&quot; of the Shinsengumi.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if Hillsborough will be doing anything like this, \n&gt; especially when his new book comes out?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Well, we didn&#39;t say he is an authority on the Shinsengumi. I \ndoubt\n&gt; &gt; many people would dare to make that claim seeing how in the \nshort \n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; period the Shinsengumi existed, their intense record would cause\n&gt; &gt; people to divide up different aspects of their duties and battle\n&gt; &gt; theatres (Toba Fushimi, Nagarayema, Aizu and Hakodate).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the request of SAitou, his secretary has made numerous calls \nnow\n&gt; &gt; and spoke to 2 different people...all I can say is this JAL has\n&gt; &gt; contact info for translators in San Francisco and Torrance...It \nis \n&gt; UP\n&gt; &gt; TO THEM to do their part.  If you guys are interested please \ncall \n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; and urge them to acquire translators...my goodness there are grad\n&gt; &gt; students who would do this for free.\n\n\n"
