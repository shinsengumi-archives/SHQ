Hideo was 15 that\nyear and as a young man recognized for his intelligence he may have\nhad more important jobs. As Matsudaira&#39;s page he would have incredible\ninsight into the army&#39;s retreat and various negotiations, keep in mind\nthat he may very well have met Hijikata Toshizo & Co at Aizu. So\nsometimes to get really good info look for possible &quot;informants&quot; and\ncheck to see if they left memoirs.  \n\n(some of the translations on the following pages required the\nassistance of up to 3 volunteer translators to *confirm* the little\ndetails which did not appear in earlier translations)  Takamine\nHideo&#39;s daughter had memories of both Tokio and Goro\n\n[Takagi Tokio Info Page]\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\n*now with a bit more info on her brother Morinusuke and confirmation\nfrom 2 volunteer translators on Tokio&#39;s mother who had a reputation\nfor being a beautiful woman\n[note] the Tokio page does have alot of information but there are also\nimages as well if you go to the timeline look at the year 1889 and see\nan image of a graduating class---these were the girls Tokio mentored.\n\nand [Saitou Hajime Info Page]\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n"
