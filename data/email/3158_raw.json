Yamanami \nwas particularly educated in literary and military arts, w=\r\nith a gentle personality and a kind \nheart. He was very much admired by the=\r\n Head Teacher (Jukutou) at the Shieikan, Okita \nSoujirou (the later Okita S=\r\nouji), who called him a big brother. In 1863, Yamanami. Kondo \nand other me=\r\nmbers of the Shieikan joined the Roshigumi, the military unit being sent to=\r\n \nKyoto by the Tokugawa Shogunate.\n\n\nShinsengumi Period\n\nIn Kyoto, Kondo an=\r\nd his &quot;faction&quot; stayed in Kyoto while the rest of the Roshigumi returned \nt=\r\no Edo. Soon, the Mibu Roshigumi (which would eventually become known as the=\r\n \nShinsengumi) was formed. Yamanami served as a vice-commander, alongside H=\r\nijikata \nToshizo and Niimi Nishiki (after Niimi&#39;s demotion due to the fight=\r\n with wrestlers.)\n\nYamanami was said to be one of the Shieikan members invo=\r\nlved in the Serizawa Kamo \nassassination in 1863. After the purge of the Se=\r\nrizawa faction, Yamanami and Hijikata \nbecame the two vice-commanders.\n\nYam=\r\nanami did not take part in the famed Ikedaya Jiken in 1864, instead he guar=\r\nded the \nShinsengumi&#39;s headquarters.\n\n\nDeath\n\nSome time after the Ikedaya J=\r\niken he tried to escape the Shinsengumi. As a result, he \ncommitted seppuku=\r\n with Okita as his second on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23), \n1865. =\r\nThere are several speculations on Yamanami&#39;s reason to escape, including a =\r\ntheory \nthat Yamanami committed suicide without ever leaving Kyoto.\n\nThe mo=\r\nst accepted theory is that Yamanami fled to Otsu while Kondo sent Okita to =\r\nretrieve \nhim. After Yamanami returned to Mibu, he was ordered to commit se=\r\nppuku. He asked \nOkita to serve as his second. There is also a theory that =\r\nKondo asked Okita to serve as \nYamanami&#39;s second out of respect for Yamanam=\r\ni. (The second was usually a closest friend \nor family member whenever poss=\r\nible.) \n\nYamanami was buried at the Koen Temple in Kyoto.\n\n\nTrivia\n\nYamanam=\r\ni owned a sword named Sekishin Okikou.\n\nYamanami was also known as Sannan (=\r\nthe alternate reading of his family name).\n\nYamanami was said to be small-s=\r\ntatured and pale-skinned.\n\nDuring his time in Edo, neighborhood children we=\r\nre very fond of Yamanami.\n\nAlthough some believe Akesato to be fictional, Y=\r\namanami did in fact have a mistress \nnamed Akesato in Kyoto.\n\n\nReferences\n\n=\r\nShinsengumi Master&#39;s Bible.

I&#39;m glad that this ML is alive and still very \n&gt; active. I&#39;m a recen=\r\nt fan of the Shinsengumi and was instantly \n&gt; enamored b/c of NHK&#39;s Shinsen=\r\ngumi! series. I&#39;m mostly interested in \n&gt; Yamanami Keisuke&#39;s character but =\r\nall in all, I like them all \n&gt; especially Kondou Isami and Saitou Hajime.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; But first and foremost, Yamanami intrigues me the most. There aren&#39;t \n&gt;=\r\n any photos of him and not much sources about him as well. In \n&gt; Hillsborou=\r\ngh&#39;s book, he was mentioned but not much information was \n&gt; given. I was to=\r\nld that since he wasn&#39;t present during the Ikedaya \n&gt; Jiken (when the Shins=\r\nengumi&#39;s &#39;fame&#39; started) and b/c he didn&#39;t live \n&gt; that long to be recogniz=\r\ned, not much information is available about \n&gt; him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Since this group =\r\nis filled with Shinsengumi fans, I hope I can get a \n&gt; few things about Yam=\r\nanami (and about other Shinsengumi members too). \n&gt; And at the same time, s=\r\nhare something of worth in this ML. That&#39;s \n&gt; for a brief introduction. Yor=\r\noshiku onegai shimasu!:P\n&gt; \n&gt; moeru\n&gt;\n\n\n"
