And \nto anyone who knows a lot about Shinsengumi history. This has been \non my mind ever since I saw the ep. \n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; P\n&gt; O\n&gt; I\n&gt; L\n&gt; E\n&gt; R\n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; P\n&gt; A\n&gt; C\n&gt; E \n&gt; \n&gt; The whole incident with the Osaka official Uchiyama Hikojiro is \nshown in this episode. Now my question is, did this really happen in \nhistory? I&#39;m wondering since I never heard anything about this \nbefore. If anyone can answer this it would be greatly appreciated. \nThanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Okita \n\n\nI do not know so in detail about this episode. \nI know this episode in fragments. \nIt is these things that I know. \n\nUchiyama Hikojirou was actually assassinated. \nAbout a criminal, although there are various opinions, it is \ncorrectly unknown. \nSince Uchiyama performed the bribe or operated the market price of \nrice, he was disliked by people of a town as a bad government \nofficial. \n(Although I do not know whether this is a true talk, it is a fact \nthat he was considered to be a bad government official by people. \nAfter he was assassinated, people did not actually sympathize with \nhim.)\nIt is Nishimura Kanefumi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot;, and Nagakura \nShinpachi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki&quot; which are being written that \nShinsengumi was criminal. \nHowever, these two works are not exact as data. \nThe author of &quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; had prejudice in Shinsengumi \nvery much.\nThe journalist of an Otaru newspaper wrote &quot;Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki&quot; \nbased on Nagakura&#39;s discourse. \nAs for them, both have inconsistency in the contents of description.\n(Incidentally, this episode does not appear \nin &quot;Roushibunkyuhoukokukiji&quot; with more high data value with \nNagakura&#39;s work.) \nThere are researchers who acknowledge a Shinsengumi criminal theory. \nAnd there are researchers who deny it. \n\nSince this book released recently is written in detail about this \nincident, it explains referring to this. \n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4087747131/qid%\n3D1094474771/249-9385455-7181936\n\n&quot;Shinsengumi no enkei&quot;  Noguchi Takehiko work\nIncidentally this book has denied the Shinsengumi criminal theory. \n\nIt is &quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; in Meiji 22 (A.D.1889) that the \nShinsengumi criminal theory was announced at the very beginning. \n&quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; is writing that Uchiyama blamed Kondou with \nthe overbearing attitude, when Kondou reported sumo wrestling \nwrestler&#39;s incident. \n(Uchiyama disliked Shinsengumi which borrows money from the \nmerchants of Osaka forcibly.) \nKondou who received the very severe insult got angry, and made \nsubordinates investigate Uchiyama&#39;s thing. \nWhen it turned out that he is a bad government official, Kondo \nplanned his assassination.\nFour persons, Okita, Nagakura, Harada, and Inoue, are criminals who \nperformed it. \nThis book serves as the only basis of a Shinsengumi criminal theory. \nHowever, it is very dangerous to trust this. \nAlthough I had written to the board before, Nishimura Kanefumi, the \nauthor of this book, was working for Nishi-Honoganji. \nAlthough Nishi-Honoganji provided Shinsengumi with the place, it was \nthe ally of Chosyu in fact. \nNishimura had a severe prejudice to Shinsengumi. \nAfter Okita killed Uchiyama, Uchiyama&#39;s head was cut and it was \nthrust into the bamboo....&quot;Shinsengumi-shimatsuki&quot; is written such. \nHowever, there is no such fact. \nNishimura wrote that Kondou and Hijikata were illiterate barbarians. \nIt is dangerous to trust it, although not all of the contents of \nthis book are a lie. \nIncidentally, it has become clear that the place where Kondou \nreported sumo wrestling wrestlers&#39; incident was Higashimachi-\nBugyousyo (East town-Bugyousyo).\nUchiyama was the government official of Nishimachi-Bugyousyo (West \ntown-Bugyousyo).\nKondou and Uchiyama cannot confront in this incident. \n \nAlthough &quot;Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki&quot; is called Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s \nwork, the fact is the book edited based on the report serialized by \nthe Otaru newspaper. \nMany portions considered to be the Otaru newspaper reporter&#39;s \nfiction exist. \nThis book is writing that Uchiyama operated the market price of rice \nin cooperation with Chosyu.\nUchiyama is the government official of the pure government. \nHe does not need to conspire with Chosyu.  \nThis book makes criminals Kondo, Hijikata, Okita, Nagakura, Harada, \nInoue, and Shimada. \nThis book is writing that Kondo cut Uchiyama first. \nHowever, this book has the too careless facts. \nIt was that Uchiyama was assassinated on May 20 Genji 1 (A.D.1864). \nHowever, this book is writing that incident, after Ito Kashitarou \nwas assassinated (A.D.1867).\n\nAbout this mistake, Kikuchi Akira of a researcher is writing the \ninteresting opinion. \nAs for his opinion, although Nagakura talked about another incident \nwhich arose around 1867, the newspaper reporter has mistaken with \nUchiyama&#39;s assassination talk.\nAlthough the fact is not known, this book (Shinsengumi-tenmatsuki) \ncannot be used as data of the Uchiyama assassination. \n \nOr it is written in the diary of Shimada Kai that the injustice of \nthe government official of Osaka was investigated. \nThe researchers of Shinsengumi criminal theory say that this is \nabout Uchiyama. \n(Mr. Noguchi is writing that 60 government officials were in Osaka \nBugyousyo at the time.\nI think that it is difficult to affirm that it is Uchiyama&#39;s thing. \nAnd isn&#39;t it weak as a reason for assassinating Uchiyama?) \n\nAs for Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s work&quot;Roushibunkyuhoukokukiji&quot;, the talk \nof the Uchiyama assassination is not written. \nNagakura wrote this book in early stages of Meiji Era. \nNaturally, data value is high. \nHowever, this book was written in order to restore the honor of \nShinsengumi. \nTherefore, the inconvenient fact of Shinsengumi may not be written. \n(The researchers of Shinsengumi criminal theory emphasize it. \nIn fact, this book is not written at all about the death of \nYamanami.) \n\nUchiyama&#39;s assassination was on May 20, A.D. 1864. \nThere is a letter which Kondou addressed to the acquaintance on the \nsame day.\nIn the letter, he is sad about the situation of Shinsengumi. \nAt the time, Shinsengumi could not play an active part and Kondou \nconsidered even the dismissal.\nThe morale of Shinsengumi was falling very much.\nMr. Noguchi has regarded the possibility of an upper government \nofficial&#39;s assassination plan as questionable in such a situation. \nIt is not a best policy that they go to Osaka and cause trouble at \nthe time of such a critical situation. \n\n(Incidentally, this letter has reported that homosexuality is in \nprevalence within Shinsengumi.)^^;;; \n\n\nSPOILER?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAs for the episode of the Uchiyama assassination, being adopted in a \ndrama is very uncommon.\nAlthough some reasons are considered, I think that it is the big \ncause that is not suitable in the tale which made Shinsengumi the \nhero. \nAlthough Uchiyama is a bad man, the story that the powerless old man \nwas killed by young men is unjustifiable. \nThe fiction differs from the historical fact.\nThere is much episode which is not adopted as a drama or a novel \nwith the fact of being written to the research document.\nMany those episode is used for a Taiga drama. \n\nIn the drama, I looked at Tonouchi Yoshio for the first time. \n(He is the member of Roushigumi at the time of the beginning which \nremained in Kyoto together with Kondou and others.\nIn the Taiga drama, he was considered to be a betrayer and was \nassassinated by Serizawa.) \nAlthough his name is often seen with a research document, it is \nseldom seen in the fiction world. \nIn fact, almost all fictions write that only Serizawa group and \nKondou group remained to Kyoto. \nTonouchi group does not exist from the beginning in many cases. \nThey destroyed completely by conspiracy of Serizawa group and Kondou \ngroup. \nTonouchi may have been assassinated by Kondou in fact.\nThere is a letter by which Kondou boasted of Tonouchi assassination.\nTonouchi is not a bad man and this incident arose in the result of a \nstruggle for power. \nDo you think that you will adopt such episode supposing you write \nthe novel which made Shinsengumi the hero? \n(I think that it is the fun of this Taiga drama to have adopted it \nwell.) \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n"
