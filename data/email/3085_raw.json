After Ikedaya, the Bakufu offered to give Kondou a position\nas a \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nyoriki&quot;-- a police inspector. This would have made him a\nfunctionary of the=\r\n \n&gt; Bakufu and for all practical purposes, at least a gokenin (2nd-tier\nvas=\r\nsal) \n&gt; if not a hatamoto (direct vassal). He refused at that point.\nHoweve=\r\nr, a few \n&gt; years later when the bakushin-toritate of 1867 happened, he did=\r\n not\nrefuse-- \n&gt; he became a hatamoto, and even became a wakadoshiyori (jun=\r\nior\ncouncilor). \n&gt; This is, in my opinion, yet another instance of Hillsbor=\r\nough getting\nvery \n&gt; cocky with his limited understanding of (a) Shogunal p=\r\nrocedure and\nprotocol \n&gt; and (b) his confused and confusing narrative, and =\r\ncreating something\nthat, \n&gt; while not a lie, is not really the truth, eithe=\r\nr.\n&gt; \n\nHere is the quote - tell me what you make of it:\n\n(P. 63)\n\n&quot;In Octob=\r\ner (it doesn&#39;t say when, but I assume the month following the\nexecution of =\r\nSerizawa Kamo) in recognition of thier loyalty, the Roshi\nof the Shinsengum=\r\ni were invited to officially join the ranks of the\nhatamoto, the so-called =\r\neighty thousand knights of the Tokugawa\nShogun.  A generous monthly stipend=\r\n was attached.  Although the entire\ncorps, from Kondo and Hijikata on down,=\r\n undoubtably and indisputably\ncoveted the official ranking within the Tokug=\r\nawa Hierarchy, Kondo\nrefused the offer.&quot;\n\nThis says right out that they wer=\r\ne *all* offered a position, and it\nseems that he is also saying that Kondo =\r\nunilaterally declined it. He\ngoes on to say that this is because he felt th=\r\nat the Shinsengumi had\nnot fulfilled all of its objectives because it still=\r\n had not me the\ngoal of removing the foreigners. His included footnote only=\r\n describes\nhatamoto, but doesn&#39;t give any sort of source for the above.\n\n\n"
