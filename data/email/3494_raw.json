After quitting the publisher and working as a\n&gt; free-lance editor for some time, she debuted as a writer with her work\n&gt; &quot;Shinsengumi Bakumatsu no Seiran&quot; in 2004. She was awarded Waseda\n&gt; University&#39;s Tsubouchi Shoyo Taisho Shoreisho prize in 2009.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Source:\n&gt; http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110118p2a00m0na011000c.html\n&gt;\n-- Do dig up some info onthat. And the awardwinning book they talked about\nin the next paragraph sounds pretty awesome:\n\n&quot;Her award-winning work, &quot;Hyosa no Utau,&quot; is a sophisticated historical\nnovel depicting a pathetic former samurai who induces customers in a\nred-light district in Tokyo&#39;s downtown Nezu after finding himself unable to\ncatch up with the tide of the Meiji Restoration.&quot;\n\nWhat&#39;s not to love about a down on his luck samurai rounding up customers\nfor the local house of ill repute. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all literary and not what\nI&#39;d really like to see but the premise is cool.\n\n~ Barbara Sheridan\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
