Note: some missing information added)\n\n--Born in Tenpo 15 (1=\r\n844), 1st day (or 2nd day) of the 1st month. Died\nTaisho 4 (1915), Septembe=\r\nr 28, at age 71.\n--Hometown: Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo).\n--Style: It=\r\nto-ryu\n--Original name: Yamaguchi Hajime. Other names: Yamaguchi Jirou,\nIch=\r\ninohe Denpachi, Fujita Gorou.\n--Born into the house of a Shogunal retainer.=\r\n\n--Father: Yuusuke. Brother: Hiroaki. Sister: O-Katsu (married Soma\nYoshiak=\r\ni, chief physician of the Mito Tokugawa clan).\n--Family was from Akashi, be=\r\ncause his father was an ashigaru (low-rank\nfoot soldier samurai) of the Aka=\r\nshi han.\n--Hajime&#39;s father, entrusting family affairs to his younger sister=\r\n,\nwent to serve in Edo, earning a small sum and buying stocks for the\nfamil=\r\ny with it.\n--In Ansei 5 (1858), Hajime had his genpuku (coming of age cerem=\r\nony).\nAfter this, he studied Itto-ryu swordsmanship in the dojo at the Aizu=\r\n\nclan&#39;s Edo mansion (despite the many branches of Itto-ryu, Aizu\nretainers =\r\nstudied Mizoguchi-ha Itto ryu). This kindness of the Aizu\nclan was brought =\r\nabout by Hajime&#39;s father&#39;s service in Edo (comment:\nkindness of teaching It=\r\nto-ryu to an incredibly low-ranking samurai&#39;s\nson, I suppose).\n--At 19, he =\r\nmistakenly killed a man and was forced to flee from Edo to\nKyoto.\n--In Kyot=\r\no, he became an assistant instructor (Shihan dai) in\nYoshida&#39;s Taishi Ryu d=\r\nojo (probably Yoshida Katsumi of the Shotoku\nTaishi Ryu). After this, in Bu=\r\nnkyu 3 (1863), he met up with his old\nfriend Kondou (Isami), who had just a=\r\nrrived in Kyoto with the\nRoushitai. Before long, Saitou had entered the Shi=\r\nnsengumi.\n--A very mysterious fellow. Conducted internal spying on possible=\r\n\nenemy operatives (i.e. the Itou case), as well as monitoring other\nintelli=\r\ngence and possible enemy activity.\n--After the collapse of the Shinsengumi,=\r\n he stayed for awhile in Aizu,\nand it&#39;s thought that he was with childhood =\r\nfriends there (from his\ndays at the Itto-ryu dojo). After the &quot;Restoration&quot;=\r\n, he worked in the\nTokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and lived the rest=\r\n of his life\nunder the name Fujita Gorou.\n\n\nStuff about Saitou (original=97=\r\nHajime-san Are-kore- literally\n&quot;Hajime-san this and that&quot;)\n\t--Was not a man=\r\n predisposed to small talk.\n\t-- According to the testimony of those who kne=\r\nw him, Saitou was tall,\nand his eyebrows served to accentuate his direct, c=\r\nlear, piercing gaze\n(comment: the &quot;light shone from his eyes&quot; line). Throug=\r\nhout his life,\nhe was rather husky, but later on in life, he put on some we=\r\night. As\nfor the remaining portrait of him, his eldest son served as the mo=\r\ndel.\nIt&#39;s said that a real photo of him exists in the Shinsengumi\nHoumotsuk=\r\nan (comment: `Shinsengumi Treasure House&#39;. No idea where this\nis, but it&#39;s =\r\nprobably the picture that was in the lower area of the\nphoto of the display=\r\n with his haori in it).\n\t--The character of &quot;Saitou&quot; in the manga &quot;Rurouni =\r\nKenshin&quot; is\ntremendously different from the real Saitou Hajime. Unfortunate=\r\nly,\nmany many people think that they are one and the same. This is unfair,\n=\r\nand the real Saitou deserves to be known more.\n\t--There is word that he was=\r\n left-handed.\n\t--It&#39;s said that in swordsmanship, he was one of the stronge=\r\nst of the\nShinsengumi, on par with Okita himself.\n\t--He went with Itou&#39;s sp=\r\nlinter group as a spy for Kondou and\nHijikata, although there is no evidenc=\r\ne to this end (comment: huh?). A\nsurviving aide of Itou said &quot;Saitou himsel=\r\nf stole money in order to\nsupport a woman.&quot; He believed this even after the=\r\n Restoraton.\n\t--Also, after the Restoration, he was known for washing and c=\r\nhanging\nhis underwear (known in the Bakumatsu as a fundoshi) every day,\nwas=\r\nhing it thoroughly and striking it with both hands to get the\nwrinkles out =\r\nand hanging it with a pin.\n\t--Whenever he sat, he would sit straight up in =\r\nseiza position, always\nkeeping aware, so that if attacked he could react in=\r\nstantly.\n\t--In his later years, he was quiet as always. However, he would\ns=\r\nometimes drink sake with his brother in law Morinosuke, as well as\nYamakawa=\r\n Hiroshi, and would indignantly lament the evils of the times\n(comment: Lik=\r\ne Hiko Seijuurou in the Rurouni Kenshin OAV: &quot;They are\nafflicted=97the time=\r\ns, and the mind of man=85&quot;)\n\t--The name &quot;Fujita Gorou&quot; was granted by Lord =\r\nMatsudaira Katamori. As\na result, it was very very important to Saitou.\n\t--=\r\nMarried Tokio, the eldest daughter of Aizu retainer Takagi\nKojuurou, in the=\r\n 7th year of Meiji (1874). At this time, Fujita\n(Saitou) was 31, and Tokio =\r\nwas 2 years younger than him.\n\t--In Meiji 7 (1874), Saitou married Tokio, t=\r\nhe eldest daughter of\nAizu retainer Takagi Kojuurou. At this time, Fujita (=\r\nSaitou) was 31,\nand Tokio was 2 years younger than him. The lesser go-betwe=\r\nens in the\nmarriage deal were Yamakawa Hiroshi and Sagawa Kanbee (Aizu chie=\r\nf\nretainer), and the main go-between was Lord Matsudaira Katamori himself.\n=\r\n\t--Children=97His eldest son, Tsutomu, was born in Meiji 9 (1876).\nExtant r=\r\necords show that Tsutomu&#39;s godfather was Yamakawa Hiroshi.\nSecond son was T=\r\nsuyoshi, who spent many years abroad. Tsuyoshi&#39;s wife,\nYuki, was the grandd=\r\naughter of Tanaka Tosa. The third son, Tatsuo, was\nadopted from the Numazaw=\r\na family, who were relatives of Tokio&#39;s mother.\n\t--While Saitou was in Aomo=\r\nri (comment: specifically, in the Shimokita\nPeninsula), before having marri=\r\ned Tokio, he married a woman named\nYaso, who was 4 years older than him.\n\t-=\r\n-At the Battle of Aizu, Yamamoto Yaeko (sister of Yamamoto Kakuma,\nand late=\r\nr, the wife of Niishima Jo (famous Japanese Christian and\nfounder of Doshis=\r\nha University)) left with Saitou for the front. Yaeko\nused a rifle, and out=\r\ndid everyone in &quot;masculine braveness&quot; (?),\nfighting side by side with the m=\r\nen. She tried cutting off her hair\nwith her wakizashi (short sword), but (c=\r\nomment: a little weird after\nthis. Not quite sure what&#39;s going on) it is sa=\r\nid that &quot;Takagi\nMorinosuke&#39;s elder sister Tokio cut her (Yaeko&#39;s) hair&quot;.\n\t-=\r\n-Around Meiji 23 (1890), Saitou was serving as a police inspector in\nAzabu =\r\n(an area in modern Tokyo). There is also record remaining that\nhe participa=\r\nted in Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department sword\ncompetitions.\n\t--Later in=\r\n life, Fujita (Saitou) and Tokio served together at Tokyo&#39;s\nJoushi Takashi =\r\n(Women&#39;s High School, now Ochanomizu University\n(comment: not sure about th=\r\ne name)). When the school day would be out,\nhe would be in charge of traffi=\r\nc control for rickshaws. He was also in\ncharge of finances and general affa=\r\nirs.\n\t--His favorite sword was the Settsu Juu Ikeda Kishinmaru Kunishige\n(c=\r\nomment: Not sure about the name).
