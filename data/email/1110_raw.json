And the\nyoungest son actually wasn&#39;t their child. They adopted him. Apparently\nhe was the son of some of Tokio&#39;s relatives. He found out when he was\nin college by asking an aunt. We&#39;ve yet to figure out exactly what\nmade him suspicious, but the most likely explanation is that his name\ndoesn&#39;t appear of the Fujita house documents.\n\n\n"
