Well, if \nyou&#39;ve seen the Shinsengumi Keppuroku miniseries or if you&#39;ve read up \non the Ito assassination over at www.christophermayo.com, then you&#39;ll \nknow this is the guy who actually bumped off Ito. (Some sites \nmistakenly claim that Saito killed Ito, but all he actually did was \nget the goods on him so Hijikata would be able to justify ordering \nhis death. (And BTW ladies, the guy who plays Kuwajiro for his five \nseconds of fame in Shin Kepp is VERY drool-worthy!)\n\nANYWAY, I was just going over the Who&#39;s Who section of \nwww.tamahito.com and I found out a bit more about him. The translator \nisn&#39;t very clear, but he seems to have been known as the &quot;Sword \nOgre&quot;. (I would LOVE to know how he came by THAT name! Then again, it \nprobably involved lots of blood and gore...) He fought with the \nShinsengumi until the battle at Katsunuma on March 6th. After that, \nhe seems to have checked in one last time before going missing.\n\nKuwajiro turned up again in 1870. The next part was very confusing. I \ncouldn&#39;t tell if Mitsui was a place or a person. As near as I can \ntell, this was either someone from or a place in Satsuma. The long \nand short of it is, Kuwajiro was recognized and captured. After being \ninterrogated under the suspicion that he was involved in Sakamoto \nRyoma&#39;s murder, he was finally executed. You&#39;ll recall of course that \nKondou was wrongly executed for the same reason.\n\nJust thought some of you might like to know how it went after the war \nfor some of the &quot;regular joes&quot; in the Shinsengumi.\n\n-MissBehavin (Wonders if the &quot;Sword Ogre&quot; and the &quot;Demon of the \nShinsengumi&quot; liked to swap stories about the reactions their \nnicknames caused...)\n\n\n"
