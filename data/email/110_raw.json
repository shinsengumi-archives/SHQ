I found that to understand certain jokes I had to know about PMK, so I decided to download several episodes. Since then, I&#39;m lost in addiction. *wails*&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nIt&#39;s certainly not *our* fault that we stumbled upon a stack of old \nnewspapers and decided to share them is it????? *tries to contain mad \nlaughter* And besides as far as addictions go there are worse ones \n*cough* soba *cough*.\n\n&gt;A wave of sadness enveloped me over the past weekend, after I saw episode 23, since it announced that next one would be the ending. Is there any news on any kind of continuation?&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n*Sigh* the raw version came out last night and as far as I know that&#39;s \nthe end of that. However iI don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t give us a couple \nextra  movies---but please Dear Kami don&#39;t let it be anything like the \ndreaded RK Seishounen (sp?)\n\nIs there any place where I can read/download scanlations/translations of \nthe manga? &gt;&gt;\n\nThe first 2 or 3 volumes have been done and I believe it&#39;s on \nfifay.net   You should be able to find it by Googling\n\nAnd here&#39;s a wee something that might cheer you up because it seems that \nHijikata and company were sent on a little undercover assignment....\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/prom.htm\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
