William. Alternative =\r\nNarratives in Modern Japanese \nHistory.\nNew York: Routledge Curzon, 2003.Is=\r\nbn 0415305705 \n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm\n\n(the Facts s=\r\nection has been revised to make navigating more easy \nhttp://www.shinsengum=\r\nihq.com/facts.htm)\n\nMore interesting perhaps is that it is more *easier* to=\r\n paint the \nShinsengumi to be *villains because their enemies, the Ishin ha=\r\nve \nbeen generalized as men with a vision for a democratic Japan.  \n\nBoth s=\r\nides were motivated by ideals however there is in fact very \nweak evidence =\r\nto suggest that democracy or an egalitarian society \n(which really exists n=\r\nowhere in the world) was even on the minds of \nthe revolutionaries.\n\nWords =\r\nlike &quot;revolutionary&quot; hold a romantic appeal for people in the \nwest and aut=\r\nomatically researchers look to the data and filter for \nevidence which woul=\r\nd recreate the Ishin to fit their framework.  For \nmany, pre-1868 Japan was=\r\n nothing but a primitive and \nintellectualy &quot;dark&quot; society.  Only after 186=\r\n8 did Japan see \nthe &quot;light&quot; (which was from the West ofcourse).  Thus, the=\r\n men who \nbrought about the revolution must be torch bearers and their \nopp=\r\nosition must be all &quot;evil&quot;.\n\nReading texts on the Bakumatsu and Meiji Era i=\r\nn chronological order \naccording to publication date shows how deeply entre=\r\nnched the bias \nwas...only in the 1930s and post WWII do we see western sch=\r\nolarship \n*really look at the Meiji Era for what it was.\n\nCurrently, I am w=\r\norking on Unmasking the Meiji Era (still \nincomplete) http://www.shinsengum=\r\nihq.com/Ishin-1.htm (the \nnavigation, index, essays, biographies are on the=\r\n left of the image \nmap)which will not only show the real agenda of the Mei=\r\nji government \nbut also their *fear of a *real revolution.  As soon as they=\r\n came to \npower, they used legal means to be sure that the ideals which the=\r\n \nwest erroneously assigned to them...would never in fact achieve \nfruition=\r\n.\n\nI hope this mailing list and the http://www.shinsengumihq.com are \nhelpf=\r\nul in your studies. We look forward to learning from you.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;slvrgriffn&quot; &lt;meredith_hartley@...&gt; \nwrote:\nMy colleagues fail=\r\n to recognize that these\n&gt; were INDIVIDUALS making decisions based on their=\r\n beliefs and past\n&gt; experiences. They overemphasize political events withou=\r\nt \nconsidering\n&gt; the social atmosphere (for one thing, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s w=\r\nise to\n&gt; ignore the potential impact being raised in a region plagued by\n&gt; =\r\nbanditry had on a young Kondo and his fellows). \n\n\n\n\n"
