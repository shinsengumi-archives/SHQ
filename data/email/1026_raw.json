I can&#39;t wait to see\nthe next episodes but he wasn&#39;t only collecting money for a dojo but\nfor &quot;women&quot; because he even knew that the guy was buying women (he\nmentioned it to Serizawa)...ohhhh it seems that NHK Saitou is\nmoonlighting as a brothel money collector.\n\nSorry, but I just don&#39;t like NHK Okita...Okita from\nMibugishiden/Shinsengumi Kepp. were much better and it has nothing to\ndo with getting used to the actor either because the first moment I\nsaw Shinsen.Kepp. Okita I thought &quot;he&#39;s perfect&quot; and the ~darker~\nOkita in Mibugishiden is realistic a perfect combo of a smiling ass\nkicking kinda guy.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shimazu Masayoshi&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; wrote:\nI came up with a\n&gt; new slogan for our group:\n&gt; \n&gt; SHINSENGUMI: Puts the FUN in FUNdoshi!\n&gt; \n&gt; --M.\n\n\n"
