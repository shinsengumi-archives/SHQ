(this is not a list member, but someone from the general public.)  Is it available only in Japan and without any kind of subtitling?  If they decided to buy it from Japan anyway, any better place than through Amazon Japan?  Has someone managed to subtitle copies of it (like we have of other samurai films) and made it available somewhere on CD/DVD or streamload?\n\n  phil\n\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  Tired of spam?
