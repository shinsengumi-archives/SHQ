I didn�t realize how many new members we had \nuntil I took a glance at the members section on the yahoogroups page.\n\nYou guys have been awfully quiet so I think it would be super if we went \nthrough a little bit of an intro/re-intro period. So here are a couple \nquestions I hope you�ll all take a moment to answer (even you �Old \ntimers� from the late lamented Miburo list0\n\n1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you would like us to \nknow about you)\n\n2) How did you �discover� the Shinsengumi?\n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?\n\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\n\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you \nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?\n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any \nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?\n\nYour ever-loving list&quot;mom&quot;\n\nBarb Sheridan\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n"
