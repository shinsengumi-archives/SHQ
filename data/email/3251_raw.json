So I&#39;m glad to \n&gt; see you enter th=\r\nis field and hopefully inform JAS or MN (by providing a \n&gt; new venue). JAS =\r\nand MN have very strict rules on what they accept and \n&gt; what they publish.=\r\n  I&#39;m not saying your publication was intended to \n&gt; compete with JAS/MN bu=\r\nt perhaps offer something different (^_^)\n\n\nOh, looks like I mixed your two=\r\n messages, and then missed this one. \nObviously we are on a different playi=\r\nng field than the MN and JAS or\nthe journal of Japanese Studies, and one of=\r\n the reasons for our\njournal is specifically what you stated - no one I kno=\r\nw can ever hope\nto be published in any of the above. Also, the above are re=\r\nstricted by\nwhat is in vogue in academia, so we are able to sidestep that a=\r\nnd\nhopefully be able to publish what people want to read, rather than\nwhat =\r\nacademia wants to publish. No academic is going to attempt to put\ntime and =\r\neffort into something that interests them if they didn&#39;t\nthink that an acad=\r\nemic journal would publish it. And, like I said,\nJapanese military history,=\r\n narrative history, and biography is\napparently frowned upon currently. If =\r\nyou don&#39;t believe me, check out\nthe PMJS mailing list :P - it&#39;s all about h=\r\neian books, art history,\nintellectual history, and other things that I have=\r\n no interest in ever\nactually reading :D\n\n\n"
