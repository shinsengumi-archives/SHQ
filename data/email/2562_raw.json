Some usual\nactivities such as club members visiting the hot spring (now a modern\nhotel) where Hijikata spent time healing his wounds and so forth.\n\nPlease watch this site for an archived video of the events which\noccurred this past weekend (give them a few days):\nhttp://www.ntt-east.co.jp/fukushima/mado/archives/index.html#matsuri\n\nOn the same page you will see a vid with the title &quot;Akaeda Higanjishi&quot;\n(warning: this is a 10 minute video!  you may just want to watch 3\nminutes)\nthis is connected to an episode which occurred during the seige of the\ncastle.  \nAccording to Akiko Kuno&#39;s UNEXPECTED DESTINATIONS (ISBN: 4770016387),\nYamakawa Hiroshi (then called Taizo) had soldiers dress as farmers,\ndance and play music to enter the castle safely.  Understandably, the\ninvaders were very confused about the festive atmosphere--and the Aizu\nsamurai passed through enemy lines and entered the castle safely. \nThis event was also shown in the film BYAKKOTAI (which also depicted\nthe Shinsengumi!).  This film was reviewed by Tama\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\n*there is nothing to suggest that Shinsengumi or SAitou were involved\nin this dress-up strategy--however it would be interesting to explore\nin the world of fiction. It would be interesting to write about RK\nSAitou wearing *feathers*.\n--------------------------\nThere are many outstanding blogs in Japanese which cover Shinsengumi\nhistory, fiction and independent research.  One such blogger happens\nto be one of the most OBSESSED SAitou fan -ever-.  She is also a fan\nof Jo Odagiri (^_^).  \nHer site is http://shinneitai.com/html/ahome.htm\n(insert into http://www.nifty.com/globalgate)\n\nShe discusses the NHK Sequel and now her visit to Aizu.\nhttp://www.enpitu.ne.jp/usr3/36502/diary.html\n(she plans to update the blog daily during her stay there)\nshe will mention the bronze statue of the Byakkotai, Nisshinkan (the\nrebuilt domain school), and Yamakawa Kenjiro.  Both Yamakawa Kenjiro\nand Yamakawa Hiroshi&#39;s connection to the Fujita family are discussed\nbriefly at http://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm  She mentions\nhow Kenjiro is a &quot;genius&quot;.  He was, and he had some competition too,\nTakamine Hideo (relative, friend, and employer to Mr.and Mrs.\nFujita)---both Kenjiro and Takamine were skipping grades at\nNisshinkan---they must&#39;ve fought over the title of the\n&quot;strongest&quot;--err I mean the &quot;brightest&quot;.\n--------------------------\nMust See Doggy-Shinsengumi Wear\nhttp://www.kyoto-mibu-shinsengumi.jp/goods/index.htm\n**maybe when I get the time---I&#39;ll have my turtle cosplay, just to\ncompete with the Japanese fans!\n--------------------------\nhttp://www.hajimenokizu.com \nhttp://www.shinsengumifics.com\n\n\n\n\n"
