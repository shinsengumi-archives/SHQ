Or is it his\nwife&#39;s name or something...it is in the same sentence talking about\nhis firearms shop.  This detail interests me because orchids are very\nhard to cultivate ^_^ you really have to have a green thumb to have\nthem grow successfully.\nAll of this info really makes things even more intriguing ... because\nyou may have already read that Saitou was -sent- to Aizu with a couple\nof guys ahead of time...because there were battles at Aizu with many\nmembers of the Shinsengumi (Nakajima Nobori included) we have\nrosters...there was another Japanese site that said Shimada Kai was\nthick necked this no doubt means that he was &quot;buff&quot;.  It is\nunfortunate, but people can change for better or worst...in the case\nof Kondo, his story was a true rags to riches/power scenario and this\nprobably resulted in the clash with other managment level guys.  The\nsituation was so critical and stress levels must&#39;ve been\nhigh...dissent is normal when it comes to important tactical decisions.\n\nI also posted a question in English to a member of the 3-hajime.com\nboard, his/her name is &quot;Passenger&quot;, about the whole business with the\ntowel.\n\nWow, I wonder if Miki tracked down Nagakura...what made them stop\nfighting...\n\nI&#39;m impressed with Shimada Kai...have you guys seen how fancy Japanese\nBuddhist altars can get?  Some altars are HUGE...I&#39;m happy that he had\na nice and peaceful job.\n\n\n"
