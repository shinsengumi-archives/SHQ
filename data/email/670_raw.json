What do you think of it? A singaporean friend \nsent me a some songs and my favorite one (aside from the \nopening/closing) is either Sorezore no Hisou or Asamoya no Naka de \n(can&#39;t decide yet). I think both though was played during episodes \n18-19 the time of Ayu-nee&#39;s capture and death. I&#39;m no fan of \ninstrumentals (aside from some of the Kenshin ones), but I think \nit&#39;s a good change.\n\n\n"
