The sizes of the inside\nrooms help, but there is =\r\ntoo much unaccounted space to accurately\nfigure the length and width of the=\r\n actual building from it.\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Chuck Harris &lt;chuc=\r\nkjharris@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you to both Kitsuno and Seven for these imag=\r\nes; they are\nperfectly \n&gt; timed for an adventure that I am putting together=\r\n for my role-playing \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do have a couple of questions, though=\r\n. The first concerns the\nlabeling \n&gt; on Kitsuno&#39;s map. The rooms have label=\r\ns such as &quot;6=E5=B7=BE=E5=8D=A0&quot; (hopefully the \n&gt; message encoding allows t=\r\nhe kanji to display; if not, I&#39;m referring to \n&gt; the labels with a number f=\r\nollowed by a three-stroke and a five-stroke \n&gt; kanji). I&#39;m familiar with th=\r\ne convention of expressing room sizes by\nthe \n&gt; number of tatami, but I lea=\r\nrned that as 6-jou (6 =E7=95=B3) and could not find \n&gt; the map&#39;s notation i=\r\nn my dictionaries. Does the notation on the map\nmean \n&gt; the same thing? If =\r\nso, what is the distinction between the two?\n&gt; \n&gt; The two maps are clearly =\r\nderived from the same original source. Is this \n&gt; known to be a historicall=\r\ny accurate map of the Ikedaya, or drawn from \n&gt; typical inns of the period =\r\n(or perhaps the set of one of the\nShinsengumi \n&gt; films)?\n&gt; \n&gt; What would th=\r\ne exterior grounds look like (other than the rear garden)? \n&gt; Narrow alleys=\r\n between the\n&gt; adjacent buildings or a larger lot, potentially with a fence=\r\n or wall \n&gt; around the whole property?\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, in the interest of giv=\r\ning due credit, what are the sources for \n&gt; these two maps?\n&gt; \n\n\n"
