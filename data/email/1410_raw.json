He was about 25 in 1868, correct? But what \n&gt;&gt; about Okita?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I thought it was pretty much settled that he was 25 when he died \n&gt;in \n&gt;&gt; 1868. Most sites I know of list his birth year as 1844. It&#39;s also \n&gt;&gt; said that he was 10 years younger than Kondo, who was born in \n&gt;1834. \n&gt;&gt; But is this absolutely true?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; One site did mention that there was a possibility that Okita might \n&gt;&gt; have been born in 1842. It also gives the date of 1844 and says \n&gt;that \n&gt;&gt; it has been handed down through the family that he was 25 when he \n&gt;&gt; died. But then it makes the bizarre claim, without any explanation \n&gt;&gt; why, that it&#39;s now &quot;generally accepted&quot; he was born in 1842. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any insight into this?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The site is:\n&gt;&gt; http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~sohzi/about_Okita.html\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s in Japanese of course.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -MissBehavin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;His exact year of birth is not known. \n&gt;In the document which remains in Okita&#39;s house, there are data that \n&gt;Souji was 20 years old in Bunkyu 3 (1863), and it is the basis of \n&gt;the opinion in 1844. \n&gt;(Please calculate by kazoedoshi.)\n&gt;And it is the basis of the opinion in 1842 which was written to be \n&gt;22 years old to the list of names when participating in Roushi-tai. \n&gt;Recently, the opinion in 1842 is said to be leading. That is because \n&gt;these list of names are the documents of a public institution. \n&gt;\n&gt;In my memory, when I got to know Shinsengumi, almost all researchers \n&gt;were writing the opinion in 1844. \n&gt;(Incidentally, it is about 18 years ago that I got to know \n&gt;Shinsengumi.) \n&gt;In the world of manga, since there is a tendency which makes age of \n&gt;the character young, most works set up Souji in the opinion in 1844. \n&gt;^^;\n&gt;\n&gt;momoiro-usagi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nThanks Momoiro-san! I was wondering why there was such a conflict.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
