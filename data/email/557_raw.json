Shintoism is big on purification for example the\nmarking of sacred areas and the significance of water but that is\nmerely the beginning.  All shrines have official purification\nceremonies on their special festival days\n\nI think it is impossible to prevent the Shinsengumi from being\ndemoralized when news got out about Okita&#39;s condition.  I can imagine\nthat they were concerned about it leaking to the general public\nbecause the Ishin Shishi could definately &quot;spin&quot; it to encourage their\nfollowers that the Shinsengumi were not so invincible.\n\nThe website you brought up is awesome (I added it to the website\ndatabase back on Miburo Yahoo Groups).\n\nThe text resource it used are well accepted (Ikedaya info)\nHillsborough, Romulus. Ryoma: Life of a Renaissance Samurai [but] \n(Ueno War) Japan : An Illustrated Encyclopedia p.1643 is a very\ngeneral resource which can hardly explain the intricacies of what is\nconsidered to be a minor conflict.  \n\nTiffany/secretarytocapt3\nwho is waiting for more knowledgeable people to come forth otherwise\nwe&#39;ll have to send the fish after them!\n\n\n"
