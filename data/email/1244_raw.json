And we always complained about the order of his name \nchange and when he started to use such and such a name...the man \nhimself was tired of it! -_-\nI have to reiterate that I immediately noticed how NHK Saitou was \nannoyed and paused to think when Kondo asked for his name.  Saitou is \na man who owns nothing, not even his name, and come to think of it \nwhen you are the loser in a war and have to be moved around to this \ntemple to that camp as a prisoner you have nothing but the clothes on \nyour back.  (Weird Connection) didn&#39;t Musashi set down some rules...I \nthink 10 and one of the rules was not to own too many things (possess \nmaterial wealth)...keep your life simple.\n\nscreenplay title\n&quot;Saitou Hajime: The Man Who Owns Nothing&quot; ^_^\n\nend of mindless chatter\n-----------------------------------------------\nWho knew?  Tengu not only teach swordsmanship to lucky mortals...they \nalso forged swords.  That&#39;s right.  These talented mythical half-man \nhalf bird creatures, wear fundoshi and forge swords.  I saw a really \nbeautiful drawing of this but I was not allowed to scan or photocopy \nthe image (stored in the library director&#39;s office)...the art of \nforging swords has not changed one bit.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n\n&gt; This is absolutely fascinating!!! As I recall Secretary, you \nwondered at the time if the man ever had an identity crisis. It would \nappear the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. He had to change who he was so many times \nin life he was determined not to have to do it one more time even \nwhen he died.\n&gt; \n&gt; And thanks for giving us Hijikata&#39;s &quot;kaimyo&quot; momoiro! So it was \nMatsudaira who gave it to him? Never let it be said the man did not \nappreciate those who showed him loyalty!\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin\n\n\n"
