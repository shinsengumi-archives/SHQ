I&#39;m very glad you told me. ^_^\nI do have a story in progress, actually. ^^ It&#39;s In Your Shadow I Walk, a \nSAISA pairing story.\nBut I also have another one which is called Moonlit Destiny, it&#39;s also with \nthe SAISA pairing, but a cross over with my yaoi manga Demonic Obsessions. \n^^\nAnd then there&#39;s another story, called In Eternity and Forever, which I \nfinished and has been submitted to Nekkie&#39;s Ratnest for the fanfiction \nchallenge, it&#39;s also a crossover with Demonic Obsessions...not a bad one, \nI&#39;d say.\n\nAnd thank you for complimenting my artwork. I&#39;m very glad you think I draw \nwell. I can honestly draw much, much better than the ones you&#39;ve seen thus \nfar. It&#39;s just sometimes I can do things that look awesome, and then I have \ndays were nothing will look right.\n(An example? http://www.deviantart.com/view/6623911/ )\n\nOkay, I&#39;m done shamelessly promoting myself now. *droops head*\n\nMiser Bellatrix\n\n&quot;Allow me to give you a hand...with your doom.&quot;\n\n\n-------\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misery Mirror&quot; &lt;misery_mirror@h...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n &gt;&gt;Hehehe, anyway, I&#39;m lacking in brains, but I do have an artistic\ntalent. So\nI&#39;ll probably be sending little gifts for the members of this group\nonce in\na while. Hopefully that&#39;ll make up for probably never being able to\nhelp\nwith information gathering.&lt;&lt;\n\nJust a little reminder that artwork, whether stories or graphics,\nshould be posted over on shq_spy_division so we can keep the files\nhere as factual as possible.  :-D\n\nTo my fellow wolves here, Miser Bellatrix does some wonderful artwork\nand also writes (Miser, don&#39;t you have one in progress?  Or am I\nconfusing you with someone else?).  Definitely NOT lacking in brains!!\n\nphil (who woke up to 91 messages in her inbox, including several\ncopies of a reply from Yahoo apologizing, but nothing they could do\nuntil they get the bug fixed... time to reconfigure all my lists...\ngrrr... )\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar ï¿½ get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
