Even his curriculum vitae? So much information has already \n&gt; come out in the open and it has been around 100 years, I do not \nsee \n&gt; the reason why the State would not release it. Sounds suspicious...\n&gt; \n&gt; wounds\n\n\nHello, wounds-san.\n\nI also think that this talk is strange.^^;; \nI think that this rumor is believed by people since there are many \nmysteries about Saitou. \n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Momoiro always provides us with interesting details and rumors ^_^ \nshe\n&gt; is our secret agent in Japan!\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that it is just rumor and not confirmed fact.\n&gt; Perhaps Public Security Division [originated] in 19th century Japan\n&gt; and the division continued to change over time to meet the new \nneeds\n&gt; of the country.  Maybe after WW2 during the occupation the division\n&gt; had to redefine itself so that it could continue to exist.\n&gt; \n&gt; Public Security Division perhaps *transformed* into Public Security\n&gt; Investigation Agency (PSIA) officially &quot;founded&quot; in 1952?  Just an\n&gt; idea....\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/PSIA/psia-01.html\n&gt; http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/japan/koancho.htm\n\n\nSurely, the public security division was inaugurated in 1952. \nIt seems that however, there was the same organization as it from \nKawaji Toshinaga time, and main members did not change also after \ndissolving by GHQ. \n(Probably, it will be better not to say unnecessary things, since I \nam ignorant about this.) \n\nFurthermore, although this is that even many Japanese have mistaken, \nKawaji&#39;s first name is not &quot;Toshiyosi&quot; but &quot;Toshinaga&quot;.\nI also got to know just recently.^^;;; \n\nSaitou&#39;s posterity believed that his art-of-fencing style was Ittou-\nryuu. \nHowever, Akama Shizuko sensei who is  Saitou Hajime&#39;s researcher \nannounced that his style was Mugai-ryuu.\nShe said that she found it from the data of the police. \nProbably, I think that there is a rumor from the episode.\n\nThere is a strange talk about Saitou&#39;s sword style. \nNagakura was teaching the art of fencing to one time which became \nMeiji Era in the Tennenrishin-ryuu exercise hall which Kondou&#39;s \nnephew inherited.\nThe student of the exercise hall has questioned Nagakura about \nSaitou&#39;s style. \nNagakura&#39;s answer.\n&quot;Since I and Saitou-kun seldom talked, I do not know it.&quot;\nThough association of Nagakura and Saitou is only the Shinsengumi \nage, it is for five years. \nDidn&#39;t Nagakura care about a strong swordsman&#39;s sword style like \nhimself? ^-^\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
