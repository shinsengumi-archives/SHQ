I will\ntry to attend that ceremony, if possible. Even bought\na camera ^^;;;\n\n \n&gt; Serizawa san\n&gt; I&#39;m not Aizu people, living mostly in Tokyo when I&#39;m\n&gt; in Japan.\n\n\nI see ^^ But if you are coming to Aizu, perhaps we may\nset a date to meet ^^\n\nAnd finally had the chance to watch the NHK drama.\nWell... I think it&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t think it will\nbe my favorite series T_T I prefer those Shinsengumi\nseries/movies with more... passion, so to speak. The\ndrama is way more a soap opera than a jidaigeki\n(Kataoka Chiezo ya Mifune Toshiro ga detekisou na\nmono). Nothing wrong with that, but I am more used to\nand prefer more a jidaigeki... ^^;;;\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
