However, I wanted to comment on your note on the\nOkita=\r\n Rintaro page at Wikipedia.\n\n&gt;&quot;However, with a family clan name &quot;Fujiwara&quot;,=\r\n this &quot;Fujiwara no\n&gt;Mototsune&quot; would have shared an identical pronunciation=\r\n with Fujiwara\n&gt;no Mototsune (836-891). Wouldn&#39;t a 19th century Japanese ma=\r\nn avoid a\n&gt;name like that? If this Inoue Rintaro was born with the formal g=\r\niven\n&gt;name/middle name &quot;Motosune,&quot; wouldn&#39;t he have also changed it when he=\r\n\n&gt;changed his name to Okita Rintaro?&quot;\n\nIf he received the formal name &quot;Moto=\r\ntsune&quot;, it would probably either\nbe in honor of that ancestor, or a coincid=\r\nence. After all, the two\nnames are written with different characters, thoug=\r\nh they&#39;re pronounced\nthe same-- so there wouldn&#39;t be a pressing reason to a=\r\nvoid use of the\nname.\n\nAlso, on a purely linguistic basis, the name still w=\r\nould be read\n&quot;Mototsune&quot;. To pronounce it &quot;Gentsune&quot; would be, at best, irr=\r\negular,\nas that makes it half &quot;on-yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese reading) and half\n&quot;k=\r\nun-yomi&quot; (Japanese reading). I&#39;m not ruling out the possibility of\nthis bei=\r\nng an exception, as reading Japanese names-- particularly\npremodern ones-- =\r\nis a tricky business; however, I&#39;m just saying that\nit&#39;s not necessarily pr=\r\nobable.\n\nFurthermore, with regards to your information on Rintaro Fusamasa:=\r\n\nSerizawa Kamo&#39;s webpage (Serizawa Kamo being another member of this\nML)-- =\r\nhttp://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html#,\nindicates that at =\r\none point, Okita used the formal name &quot;Fusanaga&quot;. To\nhave a formal name tha=\r\nt had a first character &quot;Fusa&quot; would suggest a\ncloseness with someone who h=\r\nad the same character in their name--\nwhich you have brought to our attenti=\r\non as being Rintaro *Fusa*masa,\nas illustrated in the quote from Mori, p. 1=\r\n2, with young Souji calling\nhim &quot;Nii-san&quot; (elder brother). \n\nOnce again, th=\r\nank you for your interaction, and for your insight.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n\n"
