Those who get Gokenin-Kabu \n&gt;become Gokenin, but this practice is considered as adoption for the public.\n&gt;It&#39;s a way of social promotion in this periode just like some bourgeois in \n&gt;Europeen countries who bought their title of nobility in the past.\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope everyone could understand my English.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tama\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYour English is just fine as always. So, Hajime&#39;s father bought the \nfamily a higher social rank? Now that&#39;s a fascinating bit of news.  I \nsuppose this is how our Hajime was able to be involved with Matsudaira \nof Aizu and marry well?\n\nI knew the Matsudaira arranging his marriage was all about knowing the \n&quot;right people&quot;.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
