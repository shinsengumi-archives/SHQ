I thoroughly sympathize with this feeling, being a researcher \nand trying my best to constantly learn more about the Bakumatsu, though I am \nat heart a fan of the Shinsengumi, which is what sparked my interest in the \nperiod to begin with.\n\nAs an example of how the people and events of this period are so thoroughly \nconnected, I&#39;d like to share with you an anecdote from the life of Ando \nTozaburo, a young Aizu samurai who was one of the famed Byakkotai members \nwho died in the latter part of the Boshin War, on Mt. Iimori in the fall of \n1868.\n\nThe young Tozaburo was manning a barrier gate in the early parts of the \nsiege, before the Aizu forces were pushed back to Wakamatsu. He was \nostensibly on the lookout for any suspicious people approaching, when along \nrode a man on horseback. This man on horseback did not stop for him, so \nTozaburo turned and shouted &quot;Wait! Stop!&quot; and fired a warning shot over the \nman&#39;s head. The rider turned and rode back a bit, at which point he \nintroduced himself to the Tozaburo-- it was none other than Hijikata Toshizo \nof the Shinsengumi. Apologizing for his indiscretion to the young man, \nHijikata turned and rode on.\n\n(See http://www2.plala.or.jp/shyall/retuden/byakotai.htm for Tozaburo&#39;s \nbiography, as well as those of his comrades)\n\nFor those who want to see more of the Byakkotai, please visit \nhttp://www.byakkotai.net and keep your eyes open for the new Byakkotai \nmini-series that is due out in January of next year.\n\nThank you,\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon&#39;t just search.
