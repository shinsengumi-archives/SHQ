This\n&gt; kind of harassment has already happened to me, for instance people\n&gt; create usernames almost exactly the same as mine and post comments\n&gt; mocking &quot;myself&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; also I would like to warn everyone here there is this new\n&gt; law/article stating that copyrighted music (even if the artist gives\n&gt; it for free) cannot be superimposed or applied to moving images they\n&gt; have not approved of...which means if you stick a song onto anime\n&gt; and make your own fan music vid---you just broke the law. What does\n&gt; this mean? When you make a music vid...get ready to add your own\n&gt; music---yes go out and buy a kazoo or harmonica or gather your own\n&gt; band and record it (^_^)---does anyone pay attention to this law?\n&gt; Nope! I actually cite the artist and source of the music in my vids\n&gt; or summaries to my vids, often people don&#39;t even do that! (^_^)\n&gt;\n&gt; sadly this totally screws up what Hirotada Tokugawa and I had\n&gt; planned, that is a super masterpiece multi-part video/audio\n&gt; commentary/music extravaganza which would be our own, historically\n&gt; accurate documentary of the Shinsengumi & Aizu-han\n&gt; it would detail what Hillsoborough conveniently &quot;left out&quot; but other\n&gt; scholars have WRITTEN IN ENG, OR JAPANESE, and Aizu-han&#39;s narrative\n&gt; is not widely know, we&#39;d like to present it using extracted footage\n&gt; from old Shinsengumi films, old version of Byakkotai + new 2007\n&gt; Byakkotai...just to keep things visually appealing. We would use\n&gt; all that film footage to keep it &quot;interesting&quot; however it would be\n&gt; again totally accurate info (those films have slight innaccuracies\n&gt; or need further explanation)---it looks like we cannot do that\n&gt; EITHER (T_T)---and months ago I had painstakingly begun to gather\n&gt; footage and extracting scenes using free software only the super\n&gt; computer at school can run\n&gt;\n&gt; If we were going to do some sort of Shinsengumi & Aizu documentary\n&gt; using...I dunno...finger puppets, no one would watch it...\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; email I got....\n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; This is to notify you that we have removed or disabled access to the\n&gt; following material as a result of a third-party notification by TV-\n&gt; Asahi Corp. claiming that this material is infringing:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nisshinkan clip Byakkotai 2007 White Tigers:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-jUFAviUSw \n&gt; &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-jUFAviUSw&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Please Note: Repeat incidents of copyright infringement will result\n&gt; in the *deletion *of *your *account and all videos uploaded to that\n&gt; account.
