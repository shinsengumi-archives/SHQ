It was his men who set the fires that \ndestroyed the samurai homes which surrounded the castle. Pillaging and burning \nobviously are a common part of war, but they might have also been trying to \nremove anything that would keep their cannon from striking the castle since \nthey fired on it day and night after that. And these blazes had to be pretty \nintense because it began to rain around the same time. According to witness Shiba \nGoro, it looked like a &quot;sea of fire&quot;.\n\nMissB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
