It&#39;s now available over on d-addicts.  The URL for the torrent is http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?info_hash=e98207f407be423b5fbf693cf9078e8f4328578f  (hopefully that copied complete... if not, check the torrent page ( http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php)  and type in Shinsengumi in the search torrent field... it&#39;ll be the first on the list that comes up).  Size of the file is 624.50 MB.  Official title of the torrent is Shinsengumi!Hijikata Toshizou Saigo no Ichinichi(2006.01.01 704x396 DivX61)SP.avi  .  As new as it is, it&#39;s staying very well seeded.\n   \n  It currently does not have subtitles.  It&#39;s been said that neither TV-Japan nor KIKU-TV (out of Hawaii) are going to provide subtitling, nor do fansubbers tend to attempt taiga dramas because of the difficulty of the historical/more formal language used.  We&#39;ll just have to see what happens.\n   \n  If anyone who wants to see it isn&#39;t familiar with d-addicts or downloading torrents (or how to watch them), they have a lot of information to help you... http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16155 .  My knowledge is limited, but I can also help as much as I can and I know there are some pros on the list who would probably also be willing to help get someone started.  Don&#39;t be afraid to ask!  (And be forewarned that Jdorama of any kind is addictive, especially considering many of our beloved actors in &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; have very long, healthy drama careers!  ^_^)\n   \n  phil\n\n\t\t\t\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
