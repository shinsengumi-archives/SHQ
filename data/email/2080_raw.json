I do know that Hillsborough also says that Ryoma studied \nthere under Chiba Sadakichi. He does not go beyond that to state what \nthis Chiba&#39;s relationship was to Shusaku.\n\nThis is where I get confused. You say that Sadakichi was Shusaku&#39;s \nbrother? But I saw one website that listed him as his nephew. To make \nmatters even more confusing, Hillsborough states that Sadakichi was \nthe master of one of the &quot;three greatest fencing schools in Edo&quot; and \nRyoma was the &quot;head&quot; of this school. \n\nThe problem is that if you look up these two, Shusaku&#39;s Genbukan Dojo \nis listed as one of the &quot;three greatest&quot; in Edo. [The other two were \nShunzo Momonoi&#39;s Shigakukan Dojo (Kyoshin Meichi Ryu) and Saito \nYakuro&#39;s Renpeikan Dojo (Shindo Munen Ryu).] This might fit since \nHillsborough calls the other two dojo by the names of the \nswordmasters rather than their official name. (He calls \nthem &quot;Momonoi&quot; and &quot;Saito&quot; schools.) But then Ryoma, to be &quot;head&quot; \nof &quot;Chiba Dojo&quot; would have had to study under Shusaku rather than \nSadakichi?! \n\nOr were there, by Hillsborough&#39;s definition of the dojo names, two \nChiba dojo in Edo at that time and he has it wrong which of them was \nconsidered to be &quot;one of the three greatest&quot;? And if so, then were \ndid he get that Ryoma was &quot;head&quot; of the more important one? Did \nSadakichi perhaps succeed Shusaku as master of the dojo?\n\nAnd what of the other two people he mentions as being the &quot;heads&quot; of \nthe other two famous dojo at the time? Takechi Hanpeita of Tosa, he \nsays, was &quot;head&quot; of &quot;Momonoi Dojo&quot; and Katsura Kogoro of Choshu \nwas &quot;head&quot; of &quot;Saito Dojo&quot;. \n\nAnother curious thing, I note that on Serizawa&#39;s site it is stated \nthat Yamanami studied at the Genbukan? So it becomes more likely then \nthat Ryoma and Yamanami would have known each other?! Even if it -was-\n another school, they would have met each others students I would \nassume?\n\n-MissB (now completely lost somewhere out in left field)\n\n\n\n\n"
