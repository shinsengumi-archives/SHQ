The family even over time has become more &quot;public&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a new pic\n&gt; http://www.aizu.com/shinsengumi/archives/2006/10/post_194.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Photo at the Fujita family grave (where ashes are stored).\n&gt; Left is the president of the Hino Shinsengumi Club. The far right is\n&gt; the president of the Aizu Shinsengumi Club. The middle is a\n&gt; descendent of Fujita Goro through his second son Tsuyoshi. If any one\n&gt; can help double check the Japanese I&#39;d appreciate it.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.aizu.com/shinsengumi has cosplay pics from the fall festival\n&gt; --------------------------------\n&gt; http://www.samuraidvd.com\n&gt; merlin@... &lt;merlin%40samuraidvd.com&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; is now selling &quot;I WANT TO DIE A SAMURAI&quot; SHINSENGUMI\n&gt; SHIMATSUKI/CHRONICLES one of the finer classic Shinsengumi films\n&gt; starring Tomisaburo Wakayama as Kondou directed by Kenji Misumi\n&gt; Also, Okita in this film is very very interesting, he has a dark side\n&gt; but you have to watch for it....I especially liked Hijikata&#39;s fake\n&gt; tears after the mysterious death of SErizawa Kamo. Basically, I think\n&gt; the presence of the outstanding actor Raizo Ichikawa as the main\n&gt; character makes this a must view film.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note: THIS IS NOT THE TOSHIRO MIFUNE FILM (which was not as good)\n&gt; --------------------------------\n&gt; Need Shinsengumi Pop-Culture News?\n&gt; http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
