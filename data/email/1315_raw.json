Someone was \napparently recreating the medicine Hijikata sold to see if it really \nworked or not. Unfortunately the translator refused to make clear \nwhat the results were! Oh well... One thing of interest that did come \nup was the fact that the method for making the medicine was supposed \nto have been given to the family by a kappa through a dream. (Oddly \nenough there are many tales in the Faery lore of Western Europe that \nhave people learning medicine from river-dwelling faery.)\nThe site is:\n\nhttp://www.tpa-kitatama.jp/shinsengumi/shinsengumi_index.html\n\nThere was another site I glanced through that seems to have info on \nthe Shinsengumi&#39;s movements during various battles (like Toba-\nFushimi), but the translator didn&#39;t make enough sense of them for me \nto know who was doing what or why. Perhaps someone else can make \nheads or tails of it, so I&#39;ll include the link here.\n\nhttp://haruna.on.arena.ne.jp/index.html\n\n\n-MissBehavin \n\n\n"
