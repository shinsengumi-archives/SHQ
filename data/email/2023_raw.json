Younger brother of \nYamakawa Hiroshi and Oyama Sutematsu.  During the Boshin War, he \njoined (1)Byakkotai, but due to his age, he was discharged.  He went \nto the United States in 1871, and studied civil engineer at Yale \nUniversity.  After returning, he taught at Tokyo Kaisee University \nfirst, and became the first professor of physics in Tokyo \nUniversity.  He made &quot;Dictionary of English, Germany, and France in \nphysics terms.&quot;  He used an X ray for an experiment for the first \ntime in Japan.  Later, he engaged in development of educational \nadministration and science administration.  He became a president of \nTokyo University, Meiji Technical College, Kyuusyuu University, Kyoto \nUniversity, and Musashi High School.  He also became a member of \nCongress and worked for Privy Council.  He died 1931 (Syoowa 6).&quot;\n--------------------------------------------------\nYamakawa Kenjiro was the source of the Tenmaya story....\n&quot;Saitoo Hajime, later Yamaguchi Jiroo, often visited me and talked \nthis Tenmaya&#39;s story.  Since Saitoo Hajime felt that his enemy would \ncome on that night, he was drinking with wearing a chain mail.  \nHowever, when he got drunk, he was annoyed at his chain glove.  \nFurthermore, he felt it was too hot.  He tried to take off the chain \nmail, but he could not do it easily.  While he was trying to take off \nhis chain around his hand, many people were crushed into his room.  \nTherefore, he was lucky, and the chain mail became very useful then.  \nHe said:\n&quot;In a real fight with real swords, people cannot think how to knock \ndown their enemy.  We just fight off one&#39;s head (react---do \nnot &quot;think&quot;).  While I rampaged around in this evening as in the \nusual fight, one of enemies said, `he is wearing something.  Don&#39;t \ncut him, but thrust with sword.&#39;  Therefore, I thought if they \nstarted to thrust me with sword, I would wait for it.&quot;\nThis is the story that Shibozawa Hiroshi heard from Yamakawa Kenjiroo \nwho was still in life and 77 years old at that time.&quot;\n--------------------------------------------------\nNow for the really **WEIRD** part\nYamakawa Kenjiroo participated in a strange experiment involving \nCLAIRVOYANCE (^_^)\nhttp://ladyofthenet.com/UnifiedTheory_synopsis.html\n\nyou gotta read the entire article....so scary\n*when the RING was published in Thai there were related news articles \nand magazine columns which mentioned Japanese scientists conducting \nsuch experiments during the turn of the century...I didn&#39;t know that \none of them would be a very well respected scientist who had to put \nup with listening to Fujita Goro&#39;s Tenmaya story over and over and \nover again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
