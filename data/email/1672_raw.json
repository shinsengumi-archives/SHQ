Like what was she like?  How old was she after\n&gt; she died?  What happened to her after the Bakumatsu\n&gt; ended?\n&gt; \n&gt; Stuff like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maria\n\n\nKondou Tamako was born on February 15, 1862. \nSince Isami went to Kyoto one year after she was born, she lived on \nTsune and Edo. \nAfter Isami died, they lived in the house of the elder brother of \nIsami. \nShe married Miyagawa Yuugorou which is her cousin. \nYuugorou is the second son of Miyagawa Otogorou which is the elder \nbrother of Isami. \nThe Kondou family was continued because he becomes the adopted child \nof the Kondou family. \nIt was 1876 years. \nShe was 15 years old and Yuugorou was 26 years old. \nA son called Hisatarou (Kyutarou?) was born in 1883. \nHowever, she died of an illness at the age of 25 in 1886. \nTsune died the six years after. \nAnd Hisatarou was killed in the Sino-Japanese War as a soldier. \nTherefore, the direct posterity of Isami does not exist. \n\n\nYuugorou became the 5th generation of Tennen Rishin Ryuu. \nSince Shinsengumi was famous, 3000 or more students existed. \n\n\n\nIsami planned to make Tamako and Shuuhei get married. \nHowever, as for Shuuhei, the relation with Isami has run out. \nA cause is not known. \nHowever, their parentage was lost. \nAnd Shuuhei disappeared after Toba-Fushimi war. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n"
