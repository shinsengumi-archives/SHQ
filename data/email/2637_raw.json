Now,  Misaki didn&#39;t  ask me to draw this, I did it on my own out of pure urge to see what  this one particular scene would look like.   I was extreamly  nervous when I sent her the links to the pages and I am overly excited  that she loves them.   She loves them so much that she suggested I  share these pages with the SHQ mailing list (BTW are the SHQ & Spy  division under the same e-mail address for the mailing  list?).   So, without further adue, the small section of  fanfic turned doujinshi:\n  \n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970162/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970267/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970380/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25006043/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25255863/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25256502/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25275526/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25394256/\n  \n  If any of you haven&#39;t read this fic, you should.   It is  exquisitly writen.   The fanfic can be found both on  fanfiction.net (http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/1/) & on  hakubaikou.com ... the one on FF.net is more far ahead then the one on  Hakubaikou&#39;s site.   Anyways, I hope you guys all enjoy this  as much as Misaki did (I know secretarytocapt3 enjoys the fic  ^.^).   So, &#39;till later!\n  \n  -Bunneh/ WhiteRabbit/ Eeni\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n Yahoo! Personals\n Single?
