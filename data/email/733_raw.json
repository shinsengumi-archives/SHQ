Remember Tatsuo&#39;s original family, Numazawa? Well it turns out \n&gt; that the Numazawa family was already related to Tokio, on her \n&gt; mother&#39;s side.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m also working on translating the family tree, which is somewhat \n&gt; difficult given the amount of &quot;older&quot; characters in the names that \n&gt; aren&#39;t used very much today.
