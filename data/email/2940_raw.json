Northern forces put up stiff resistance there but were \neventually routed. One of the unit commanders was Oshima Torao, who was shot \nin the rear end (buttocks) as he retreated. Just as Oshima resigned himself \nto death, Saitou and the Shinsengumi appeared, and covered the retreat of \nOshima&#39;s unit with small-arms fire.\n\n(source: p. 194 of &quot;Saitou Hajime Kanren Jinbutsu Jiten&quot;, by Todo Toshihisa, \nin &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot;)\n\nHere&#39;s an example of someone who encountered Saitou in the Meiji era without \ninitially knowing who he was:\n\nImada Katsuyori was the son of the last armorer of the Aizu domain. In Meiji \n27, Katsuyori became a live-in student at the Yamakawa household (former \nsenior Aizu retainers) in Tokyo. Thus, occasionally he would be there when a \nfat, red-faced, sharp old man would come and tell tales of the Shinsengumi. \nWhen Katsuyori asked Yamakawa who this man was, he was told &quot;He was Saitou \nHajime.&quot;\n\n(source: same as above)\n\nThese little anecdotes really serve to show just how much even in 19th \ncentury Japan, &quot;it&#39;s a small world after all&quot;\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
