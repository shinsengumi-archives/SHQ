Not everything on the old site will be back online because \nwe =\r\nare trying to keep things simple.  If you recall our old hosting \ncompany w=\r\nas unable to restore the one html file which housed the \nentire site---that=\r\n&#39;s why SHQ died.\n\nAnyways some of the gory details.\n\nPut in 4 hours and jus=\r\nt came up with a list of things:\nhttp://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com/37668=\r\n.html\n\nThe evolution of SHQ over the past 4 years was\nsimple html &gt; html wi=\r\nth frames &gt; html with no frames but everything \nlooked much better and orga=\r\nnized &gt; content management system (I \nwas happy until the obliteration of t=\r\nhe critical file) &gt; Wordpress (present \nstate)\n\neach evolution was not simp=\r\nly &quot;cut and paste&quot; code either...it&#39;s all hand \ndone page by page (*_*)\n\nTh=\r\ne difficulty lies in the fact that SHQ had tons of text and some pages \nwit=\r\nh text and images and some pages with just images.  As someone \nwith absolu=\r\ntely no tech background prior to working on this--- all this \nhas been a re=\r\nal pain for me over the years as I split time between \nresearch and then tr=\r\nying to figure out how to put it all online.\n\nSneak Peak: http://shinsengum=\r\nihq.com/shq/\nI practiced working with Wordpress on other blogs recently and=\r\n \neverything is cool...until I messed with this particular template.\n\n\n"
