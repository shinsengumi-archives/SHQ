I can imagine some viewers lifting their \neyebrows at certain points in the script....\n\n1) the story is about how a Satsuma Hitokiri became a respected \nmilitary man in the new government....his friend tries to save him \nfrom marching on Tokyo (Seinan War) by saying...&quot;Saigo is a big old \nfool!&quot;\n\n2) Okita Soujiro (there is a FABULOUS indoor fight scene between \nOkita and the main character---easily the [BEST] I&#39;ve seen in \nJapanese cinema---and I&#39;ve seen plenty...the actors were splendid)\nAll of the moves were very clear to see and the choreography offers \nALOT of variety...truly worthy of depicting Okita S. one of the \nforemost swordsmen of his day...just this scene alone makes the film \nworthy buying ^_^\n\nShinsengumi (the most INTERESTING interpretation on their uniform \nI&#39;ve ever seen) vs. Mimawarigumi tension\na bit of Toba Fushimi\na tiny bit of Hakodate and Takeaki Enomoto\n\n3) the main character = master swordsman decent guy who&#39;s outlook on \nlife changes alot...an important lesson learned from this \nfilm...don&#39;t go blabbing about what you did during the revolution \nespecially to seemingly harmless barbers....\n\n4) a couple of interesting female characters...\n\n***this film covers alot of ground ^_^ (and includes even little \nthings like the retainers crying their eyes out as the Shogun \ndeparts from Edo) but it was well written and filmed skillfully and \nthe director never lost sight of the fact that it is supposed to \nENTERTAIN as welll (humor here and there some romance too)....I \nhighly recommend it!!!! However, if you purchase it there is a \nchance that it may not play on your PC....so no screencaps of the ---\ndifferent--- Shinsengumi uniform (-_-)...it seems to depend on what \nversion of Powerdvd you own\n\n\n\n"
