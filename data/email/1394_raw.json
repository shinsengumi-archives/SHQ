He was crucified and \npierced by spears.( Historical Izo is beheaded though) After death, as a revengeful \nghost, Izo&#39;s soul possesses the body of a homeless living in present-day \nTokyo.\nBecame a killing machine, Izo transcends between space-time to slay everyone \nwho cuts off his way.\n\nI think this film would be very violent and bloody one a la Miike, and \nperhaps recommendable for only fans of the genre. Nevertheless, this film has also \nfew Shinsengumi appearance and casts many stars like Takeshi Kitano( not as \nHijikata this time. LOL)or Ryuhei Matsuda.\n\nTama\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
