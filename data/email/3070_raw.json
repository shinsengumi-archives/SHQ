However, the pred=\r\nominant works of scholarship in English\nand Japanese usually operate by lun=\r\nar date and they call the lunar\nmonth by the name of the Gregorian calendar=\r\n month. Also, many Japanese\nsites, even accurate ones, give &quot;1.1.1844&quot; with=\r\nout giving any\nexplanation about the nuances of Gregorian vs. Lunar calenda=\r\nr. Hence\n&quot;January 1, 1844&quot;. But yes, in the end, you&#39;re correct-- 18 Februa=\r\nry\n1844. Which, coincidentally, is only three days after Matsudaira\nKatamor=\r\ni&#39;s birthday (by Gregorian reckoning).\n\nAlso, when dealing with dates prior=\r\n to the changeover of 3 Dec 1872\n(lunar) to 1 January 1873 (Gregorian), in =\r\norder to avoid confusion, it\nis safer to simply use lunar dates and indicat=\r\ne at the start of one&#39;s\nwork that they are being used-- as is the common pr=\r\nactice amongst many\nprominent Western scholars of Japanese history such as =\r\nHarold Bolitho,\nConrad Totman, Frank Chance, Karl Friday, and others.\n\n-M.\n=\r\n\n\n"
