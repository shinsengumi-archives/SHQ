Information on the film can be found at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060277/ .  For those new to the list, this film contains little tidbits concerning the formation of the Shinsengumi (look for Kondou & Serizawa at the tournament) and the ending is... wow!  A definite samurai classic, very much worth watching, directed by Okamoto Kihachi (director of two of my favorites, &quot;Kill&quot; and &quot;Red Lion&quot;) and starring Mifune Toshiro and Nakadai Tatsuya.\n \nphil (who promises to send a film update later today... maybe go back to listing films in the list homepage calendar)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
