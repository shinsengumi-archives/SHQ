Saitou&#39;s sword has a VERY\ninteresting history ^_^.\n\nTo the people who downloaded the essay, I just uploaded an updated\nversion complete with &gt;&gt;images&lt;&lt; which explains the different kinds of\nhamon and pic of the &quot;Aizu Shintogo&quot; tanto forged by the FATHER of the\nSaitou&#39;s sword&#39;s smith. Yes, there is an *indirect* Aizu connection.\n\n\n"
