It is really, *really* weird.  It&#39;s just that it&#39;s become so commonplace that it is almost like a joke to me.  This story of yours, though, takes the prize.  It&#39;s an anecdote worth keeping.

I got the Sagara book 2 days ago and commenced scanning \nand photocopying etc.  I returned the book to the circulation desk \nand reclaimed by driver&#39;s license and went online to check my library \naccount to see if my other requests have been processed....then\n\nmy account says my request for the Sagara book &quot;HAS BEEN DECLINED&quot;\ndated **** 7 days before I actually had the book in hand ****\n\nnow it was weird that it took like 3 weeks to get the book (because \nthe turn around time is usually VERY FAST like 7-10 days)...but \nclearly I got the book due to an ERROR.  \n\nI assume someone at the library of congress will be like \nclerk 1 &quot;so shouldn&#39;t we put that Sagara book in the preservation or \nTO BE REPAIRED DEPT&quot;\n\nclerk 2 &quot;I just mailed it out to the out of state university&quot;\n\nclerk 1 &quot;Nooooo, we rejectd that request&quot;\n\nclerk 2 &quot;oh, SH*T&quot;\n\nso my friends this is yet another interesting coincedences to add to \nthe list....&quot;\n\nIf spiritus Saitou recalls I emailed her well before getting the book \nto whine that my request is taking like 3 weeks to go through, and M \nmentioned that he was unable to acquire the book....so I have \nwitnesses....\n\n[CREEPY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
