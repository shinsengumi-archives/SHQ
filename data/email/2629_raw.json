I=\r\n found mention of the smiling ONCE---now I&#39;m\nfinding more examples---a dist=\r\nurbing pattern\n--------------------------------------------------------\nEpi=\r\nlogue (work in progress for Tokio page\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiT=\r\nokioinfo.htm)\n\nI recently viewed the film Twenty-Four Eyes \nhttp://tinyurl.=\r\ncom/a74np\nI didn&#39;t expect it to totally reflect upon Tokio&#39;s career/life!\nT=\r\nhe film dealt with a completely different generation of female\nteachers we&#39;=\r\nre talking late 20s to post WWII. The film by the way\nclobbered an action m=\r\novie called 7 SAMURAI in the box office. \nTwenty-Four Eyes is an antiwar fi=\r\nlm expressed through the biography of\nthe teacher and her students.\n\nIn the=\r\n film the heroine rides a bicycle out of necessity and wear&#39;s a\n&quot;man&#39;s suit=\r\n&quot;.\nThe principal at the school is worried because she is &quot;from the normal\ns=\r\nchool&quot;** &quot;serious about teaching&quot; and &quot;very smart&quot;\n**(likely prefectural no=\r\nrmal school)\n\nThe heroine had to deal with people judging her based on exte=\r\nrior\nsymbols of &quot;modernity&quot; (just as during the Meiji E. students would\nwea=\r\nr western clothing, interact with men and study English).  The\nheroine in f=\r\nact made her suit from a kimono and rides a bicycle to\nwork to avoid taking=\r\n a boat.  The film is often deceptively simple.\n\nShe teaches folksongs (as =\r\nopposed to JUST state songs) folk songs were\npreserved and taught at Tokyo =\r\nWomen&#39;s Normal School (this has more to\ndo with Yamaguchi Yukiko--Goro&#39;s ni=\r\nece) during the 1880s.  Folk tunes\nwere &quot;converted&quot; into western notes at t=\r\nhe TWNS.\n\nFuthermore the film captures the partnership between the only 2\nc=\r\nareers available to women: nursing and teaching.  One of the students\nin th=\r\ne film has a sister who is nurse--she promises to support the\nsibling if sh=\r\ne can manage to test into the normal school.  During\nTokio&#39;s time many grad=\r\nuates of the normal school also pursued nursing.\n\nThe incredibly hard life =\r\nof female teachers.\nI believe it was in Hani Motoko&#39;s narrative that she we=\r\nnt to Aomori\nand met a graduate of the Women&#39;s Normal School teaching in th=\r\nis\ndesolate area.  Again, Tokio would&#39;ve mentored young women who had to\nmo=\r\nve away very far away from home based on their appointments (this is\nwhy ch=\r\noosing this career was viewed as an act of rebellion).  This\nTOTALLY WAS AG=\r\nAINST cultural norms of the time where women moved in\nwith the family of th=\r\neir husbands---and moved wherever he went. \n\nI had to smile when I realized=\r\n how Tokio was involved with this\nmonumental progress.  As a dorm mother he=\r\nr job was to mentor, educate\nand restrain some young women from going &quot;over=\r\nboard&quot; with all these\nnew ideas---but to even be part of this progress impl=\r\nied an\nunderstanding and approval of the changes going on.\n\n\n\n\n"
