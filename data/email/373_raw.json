As it said \nthis place was for Aizu samurais who fought against the Meiji... So \ndoes this mean that they were actually being detained? Or did they \ndetain themselves &quot;at will&quot; (in best behavior), because doing \notherwise would be futile?

According to (1)Takada Omote\n&gt; On-azukari Hitobito Betsu in (2) Takada Kinshinchuu Zakki that lists\n&gt; people who were put them on their best behaviors, Hajime Saitoo is\n&gt; recorded as Denpachi Ichinose among Suzaku  menbers who were\n&gt; accommodated in Temple Sooji-ji.   According to (3) Aihan Hokuetsu\n&gt; Takada Kinshinnin Mei, (4) Echigo Takada Tsume Myoosai Yuujin Choo,\n&gt; and (5) Aizu-han Takada Yuushuu Meibo, while he was on his best\n&gt; behaviors, he is recorded as his false name, Denpachi Ichinose \nagain.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is confirmed by the list that puts the names of people who\n&gt; immigrated to Tonan in 1869, that Hajime Saitoo used the name, Goroo\n&gt; Fujita when he moved to Tonan.  He moved to Goko after he changed \nhis\n&gt; name from Denpachi Ichinose to Goroo Fujita, and became a Tonan \ncitizen.\n\n\n"
