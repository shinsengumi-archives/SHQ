A ruling family of \nUtsunomiya was never mentioned in anything I&#39;d read on Hijikata&#39;s attack, \nand this led me to believe that perhaps it was one of the Tokugawa family&#39;s \ncastles. Checking the list of castles in direct posession of the Tokugawa, I \nquickly found that this was not the case.\n\nWho ruled Utsunomiya Castle, then? Where was its lord, and why was his \ncastle attacked by Hijikata and Otori?\n\nThe logical step was to look for &quot;Utsunomiya-han&quot; (&quot;Utsunomiya domain&quot;) in a \nreference book-- in this case, volume one of Ogawa Kyoichi&#39;s &quot;Edo Bakuhan \nDaimyo-ke Jiten&quot; (&quot;A Dictionary of Edo-era Lordly Families&quot;), and Abe \nAkira&#39;s article on Utsunomiya-han in volume two of the the extensive domain \nencyclopedia &quot;Hanshi Daijiten&quot;. Sure enough, I found it: Utsunomiya-han was \na domain ruled by the Toda family. As of Keio 3 (1867), it was a \nmoderately-sized domain of 70,850 koku, or roughly a quarter of the size of \nthe Aizu domain in the same year (280,000 koku). The lord of Utsunomiya was \nToda Tadatomo, who in 1868 was a young 20 years old.\n\nThe next question on my mind that arose was this, now that I knew the name \nof the lord-- did he have any history of a disconnect with the Tokugawa \nfamily, or a tendency toward inaction when it came to Shogunal politics? The \nanswer was a resounding no-- Tadatomo held high positions in the Tokugawa \nadministration, both as a Master of Ceremonies (soshaban) and a Magistrate \nof Temples and Shrines (Jisha-bugyo). He was appointed to these posts as of \nthe 25th day of the 7th month of Keio 3 (1867), so that doesn&#39;t leave much \nroom for him to do anything antagonistic to deserve an attack by the former \nShogunate&#39;s infantry.\n\nLooking at a timeline of the actions of the lords of Utsunomiya throughout \nhistory, I found the following: Toda Tadatomo was, on the 15th of the 3rd \nmonth of Meiji 1 (1868), in Otsu, on his way to Kyoto, to transmit Tokugawa \nYoshinobu&#39;s apologies to the Imperial Court, when he was arrested and \ndetained. Utsunomiya was thus left lordless, until the 6th of the 4th month, \nwhen his predecessor, Toda Tadayuki, returned to Utsunomiya from Edo, and \nofficially submitted to the new government.\n\nThis answered my question of why exactly Hijikata and Otori attacked him. \nBut I read further-- about a week after Tadayuki returned, a peasant riot (a \n&quot;yonaoshi-ikki&quot;, as it&#39;s known in Japanese) broke out, and hard on the heels \nof the riots, only a handful of days later, Hijikata and Otori arrived and \ntook the castle on the 19th of the 4th month. However, the new government \nattacked Utsunomiya Castle a handful of days later, on the 23rd. Years \nlater, Otori wrote an account of the events, which was published in the \nmagazine &quot;Kyu Bakufu&quot; in Meiji 32, in which he said that Hijikata was \ninjured in the toes and subsequently taken to the Higashiyama hotsprings \nwithin the Aizu domain for treatment.\n\nJust a little example of the level of detail that I am beginning to discover \nin my research on the Bakumatsu.\n\n(Sources: &quot;Kyu Bakufu&quot;, vol. 1. no. 1; Ogawa Kyouichi, &quot;Edo Bakuhan \nDaimyo-ke Jiten&quot; (vol. 1); Abe Akira, �Utsunomiya-han�, in Hanshi Daijiten, \nvol. 2)\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
