I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s better served by creating an \ninformation-source folder in Links or creating a database of links, but could we all \nstart posting up links to the sources of this subject-specific information we \ndig up?  Going through the archive of messages is as torturous as \nweb-searching.  We really need something to help us and others find links to off-the-wall \ninformation about aspects of culture and the times.  Have we already done that \nand I&#39;ve forgotten/misplaced it?\n\nAlso, a comment to secretarytocapt3 about the message board.  We should have \na forum where members can introduce themselves... Shinsengumi recruitment, \nintake trials, party in Shimabara, or something.  What do you (or anyone else) \nthink?\n\nphil (who has *three* times today promoted *ALL* of the venues of SHQ...

Where would history be if the Meiji government had decided \nthat Saigo&#39;s head would just &quot;have to wait until tomorrow&quot;?! LOL!\n\nI agree with you about needing something either in the links or the database. \nI guess which one depends on whether we can add a discription of where it&#39;s \ntaking the person to in the links area. If not, then the database would be \nbetter. I&#39;ll start working on getting my resources together. And I don&#39;t recall if \nwe have a folder for info we find in books and want to share in the files \nsection or not? I definitely need to post some notes from some of the books I \nhave.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
