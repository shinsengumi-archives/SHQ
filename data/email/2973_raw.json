He wrote a book which was\npublished in 2004 called &quot;Negotiating with Imperialism\n- The Unequal Treaties and the Culture of Japanese\nDiplomacy&quot;. I have only been able to get a reading\nsample online and the book I ordered will not arrive\nin time for the shoot. \nI was wondering whether anyone here has it handy and\nwhat their thoughts were on the book and his analysis.\nAll comments would be very much appreciated. Thanks in\nadvance! \n\nBest wishes, \n\nMio. \n\n[PS. Shameless plugging alert: in case anyone is\ninterested, at last I have the next chapter finished -\nand it&#39;s been one of the worst writing experiences\nI&#39;ve had so far. I intend to post it on Friday night.]\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nAll new Yahoo!
