It deals with them at their low point, after \nToba-Fushimi and before Aizu. The text below is my compilation of the facts \nfrom two sources-- Akama Shizuko&#39;s book on Saitou Hajime (Shinsengumi Saitou \nHajime no Subete) and Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s own memoir &quot;Shinsengumi \nTenmatsu-ki&quot;\n\nAny errors in translation are my own.\n\n-M.\n---\nFollowing the disastrous defeat at Toba-Fushimi, the Shinsengumi headed to \nEdo, the Shogun&#39;s capital, by sea. (Akama 99) They were split up between two \nvessels-- the frigate Fujiyama-maru and the merchantman Jundo-maru. Kondou \nIsami (wounded since his departure from Kyoto) and the other wounded men \nwere on the Fujiyama-Maru. (Akama 99)\n\n-Jundo-maru shipped out on the 1st of February (Gregorian calendar) and \narrived in Shinagawa (near Edo) on the 4th. The 63 Shinsengumi men who were \non board disembarked and got shelter at a local kettle-vendor (Kamaya). \n(Akama 99)\n\n-Fujiyama-maru waited for the wind to change, and shipped out on the 3rd of \nFebruary, arriving in Yokohama on the 14th. The remaining Shinsengumi men-- \n22, who were heavily wounded-- were immediately taken to the Yokohama \nHospital. (Akama 99) The next day, the Fujiyama-maru entered Shinagawa, and \nKondou and Okita disembarked together, entering the Kanda Igakusho (Medical \nCenter). Based on this evidence, Akama Shizuko believes that 29 others, \nincluding Yamaguchi Jiro (Saitou Hajime), accompanied them. However, these \nmen did not enter the medical center, instead finding accomodations in the \nImado area and receiving medical treatment there. It&#39;s said that a man from \nAsakusa named Danzaemon looked after them. (Akama 100)\n\nAs the Shinsengumi men rested and recovered (including Saitou Hajime), a new \nheadquarters was provided for them-- the former residence of Lord Akizuki \nUkyo no Suke, within Kajibashi Gate. (Akama 101) First to arrive there were \nthe men who were staying in Shinagawa at the kettle vendor, then the wounded \nmen. While they rested there, small groups would be sent out for security \nduties. On March 5 (Western Calendar-- 2/12 old), Tokugawa Yoshinobu entered \nkinshin at Kan&#39;eiji Temple in Ueno, and the Shinsengumi, deploying on a \nrotating basis in small units, served as security for him from the 8th to \nthe 18th of March. (Akama 101) They were relieved of duty because of orders \nto deploy to KAI PROVINCE.\n\nKatsu Kaishu, who was in charge of much of Bakufu affairs at the time, was a \nsupporter of peaceful surrender, so it&#39;s said that he ordered Shinsengumi \n(supporters of armed resistance) to deploy westward-- to the neighboring Kai \nprovince, which the &quot;Imperial&quot; army was aiming for-- as an expedient for \neliminating them. However, the official Yuuki Munizou indicates that &quot;The \njunior councilor Nagai (Naoyuki) came up with the plan...Katsu and the \nothers were against it at first, but they couldn&#39;t do much to resist.&quot;\n\nHOWEVER, when Kondou was captured and questioned, he indicated that Okubo \nIchio (NOT the Satsuma Okubo...) had ordered the deployment, so in reality, \nit probably wasn&#39;t Katsu&#39;s or Nagai&#39;s order to begin with.\n\nThe Shinsengumi Leaders as Daimyo- Status on Paper\n\nOn the occasion of their deployment to Kai Province, a promise was made to \nKondou and his men. In a long tradition of such orders (dating back to \npre-Warring States era), IF they could be victorious, they could have the \nprovince for themselves. Kai was Bakufu land worth 1 million koku, and it \nwas to be divided as such:\n\nKondou: 100,000 koku\nHijikata: 50,000 koku\nThe Captains (including Saitou Hajime): 30,000 koku each\nOther supervisors: 10,000 koku each\n\n(Akama 102)\n\nThere were also other symbols of rank that they were given in a hurry. \nKondou was given the rank of a Bakufu Junior Councilor, and was allowed to \nride in his own palanquin. Hijikata received the rank of a yoriai \n(high-ranking hatamoto), and was given a horse (It was also at this time \nthat he started wearing his hair Western-style). The captains received the \nrank and privileges of average hatamoto, and were allowed to wear the riding \ncaps of hatamoto. (Akama 103)\n\n-At the time, Shinsengumi numbered only around 80 men. To this was to be \nadded the previously mentioned Danzaemon&#39;s unit of 100 men trained in the \nWestern style, and the unit became the Koyochinbutai-- Kai Province \nPacification Unit. (Akama 102)\n\nThe official orders came through on March 21. On the 20th, Shinsengumi had \nreceived 2400 ryo of war funds, along with a number of large cannons and \nrifles. With their money and new weapons in hand, they moved out on the \n22nd, camping at Naito-Shinjuku, where they joined with Danzaemon&#39;s men. \n(Akama 102)\n\nOn the 24th they stopped at Fuchu, and the next day they paused at Kondou \nand Hijikata&#39;s old neighborhood of Hino, where they met with Hijikata&#39;s \nbrother in law, Sato Hikogoro. Sato Hikogoro&#39;s privately-funded unit of 22 \nmen, the Kasugatai, joined Kondou, and this brought the unit strength up to \n200.\n\nOn the 27th they went through Sasago Pass, coming to Komakai Village, where \nthey received the news that the &quot;Imperial&quot; army had entered Kofu Castle-- \nthe center of Kai province. They pressed ahead to nearby Tanaka to \ninvestigate-- and it was at this time that Danzaemon&#39;s men-- more than half \nthe unit strength-- suddenly got up and left. This left the Koyochinbutai \nwith 121 men. (Akama 103)\n\nAt this point, Hijikata went back to Edo to get reinforcements, and Kondou \nmoved the men to the area of Daizenji Temple, near Katsunuma. Setting up a \nbarrier, he had the men light watchfires and waited until morning. (Akama \n103)\n\n**NAGAKURA&#39;s take**\n\n-Nagakura says that the warships were the Fujiyama-maru and Jutoku-maru. \n(Nagakura 164)\n\n-Also, he clarifies that &quot;Kamaya&quot; was not a &quot;kettle shop,&quot; but it was the \nname of a small inn. (Nagakura 165)\n\n-Also says that the HQ Shinsengumi received was the former residence of \nTorii Tango no Kami. (Nagakura 165)\n\n-Nagakura says &quot;At Toba-Fushimi, we lost Inoue Genzaburo, Yamazaki Susumu, \nAccounting Officer Aoki Makidayu, Corporal Ito Tetsugoro, Ikeda Kotaro, and \naround 20 others.&quot; (Nagakura 165)\n\n-Yamakawa Kenjiro wrote a letter to Nagakura&#39;s son, &quot;The Issue Concerning \nThose Responsible for Sakamoto Ryoma&#39;s Murder&quot;-- and says that he doesn&#39;t \nbelieve that it was Harada. (pp. 238-241)\n\n-Kondou took initiative and on 3/3 (what dating system??) Shinsengumi \nacquired a 70-man cavalry unit, the Kibatai (literally &quot;Cavalry Unit&quot;). (p. \n170)\n\n-They heard that Kofu Castle has fallen, and then Danzaemon got up and left. \nThis had them down to 121 men. The men got nervous and approach Harada and \nNagakura, saying &quot;If we don&#39;t get reinforced, we don&#39;t want to die for \nnothing.&quot; Harada and Nagakura went to Kondou, who said &quot;It&#39;s not good for \nthem to be un-warrior-ly. By the way, I&#39;m having a unit of 300 Aizu men \nreinforce us at dawn.&quot; Meanwhile, Hijikata was in Kanagawa, trying to get \nahold of the Natsubatai, a hatamoto unit. (p. 171)\n\n-Iwakura Tomomi was at Kofu Castle and he knew Kondou was near. So he sent \nout a messenger who said &quot;Bakufu-Koyochinbutai commander Okubo Takeshi, \nPrince Iwakura wants to see you.&quot; (Okubo Takeshi was Kondou&#39;s assumed name) \nAnd Kondou said &quot;I&#39;ll greet him with my guns.&quot; (p. 172)\n\n-Nagakura got 10 men and a 20 local hunters and headed to Mukoyama, where \nthere were imperial troops in a farmer&#39;s house. The hunters turned traitor \nand started shooting at Nagakura and his men. (p. 172)\n\n-At this point they realized that Kondou had lied about Aizu reinforcements. \n(p. 172)\n\n-Everyone started running in the direction of Kobotoke Pass. Nagakura&#39;s \ndetachment caught up-- Harada and Nagakura got horses and tried catching up \nwith the main unit, and made it to Yoshino-juku. (p. 172)\n\n-Kondou had decided that he was going to make his stand at Yoshino-juku. \nNagakura could not trust Kondou anymore, and so he left, making all the way \nto Hachioji before realizing that he still had hopes of joining Aizu and \nfighting for the Tokugawa house. So he thought &quot;It can&#39;t be helped. I have \nto go back to Shinsengumi, talk to Kondou, and convince him to put things in \nperspective and head to Aizu.&quot; So he returned and spoke with Kondou. Kondou \ntook a deep breath and went &quot;I want to die in battle at Aizu Castle, myself. \nI leave the men to you Nagakura and Harada. Take them back to Edo, and we&#39;ll \nregroup there.&quot; (p. 173)\n\n-The survivors made it to Edo, and headquartered themselves at Okubo Shuzen \nno Kami&#39;s former residence in Honjo futatsu-me. However, Kondou hadn&#39;t made \nit back yet, so most of the men slipped away-- leaving Nagakura, Harada, \nShimada Kai, Yada Kennosuke, and others. 10 men in all. (p. 174)\n\n-Nagakura and the others tried regrouping the AWOL men (some of whom were \noff in Shin-Yoshiwara), and succeeded in regrouping many of them. They \ndecided that they were to head to Aizu, where they would make their stand. \nThey found Kondou-- who had since made it back and was at the Izumi-bashi \nMedical Center-- and explained their decision to him. Kondou said, &quot;I will \nnot be part of any closed-door decisions of yours. I&#39;ll only allow this if \nyou all become my retainers.&quot; Nagakura responded with &quot;It is disloyal for a \nsamurai to serve two masters. I will not become your retainer.&quot; Nagakura, \nHarada, and Yada left. (pp. 174-175) (NOTE: Bear in mind that the \nShinsengumi &quot;served&quot; the Tokugawa already, having been officially recognized \nas hatamoto since 1867)\n\n\n-Kondou, having thus alienated the last of his former Shinsengumi men, was \njoined by Hijikata Toshizo, who helped him raise a force once again. Taking \nthe name Okubo Yamato, he went to Nagareyama, where, picking up stragglers \nfrom the Bakufu army, he brought his force strength to above 110. It was at \nNagareyama that Kondou fought for the last time and was captured. He tried \nto escape under his alias, but in the Imperial camp was Kano Washio \n(Michinosuke), who had been a member of Ito Kashitaro&#39;s faction-- and who \nrecognized Kondou immediately. Kagawa Keizou, an Imperial officer, commended \nKondou&#39;s bravery and suggested that. he surrender. Kondou replied with &quot;Is \nthe kangun the Emperor&#39;s army or Satsuma and Choshu&#39;s army? I can&#39;t tell...&quot; \nKondou was executed on Keio 4, 4/25 (Japanese calendar), dying at age 35. \nHijikata Toshizo, upon hearing this, escaped Nagareyama, and fought on, \nfinally dying in battle at Hakodate in Meiji 2. At death, he was the same \nage-- 35. (pp. 175-176)\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nAkama Shizuko, Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete.
