Went last week there and filmed\nit. For those who don&#39;t know, Eiga-mura (&quot;Movie\nvillage&quot;) is a place maintained by Toei where many\nhistorical soap operas (doramas) are filmed. The\nentrance of the Shinsengumi headquarters in the NHK\nTaiga dorama is in the Eiga-mura, as is the Ikeda Inn.\n\nThe quality is poor to save some space and to ease its\ndownload. Even so, it is around 30MB.\n\nSo, if someone is kind enough to provide the data of\nthe Streamload account, I can send the movie ^^\n\nI wish I could subtitle it, but I can&#39;t convert here\nthe format to .avi -_-\n\n\n=====\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nSend holiday email and support a worthy cause.
