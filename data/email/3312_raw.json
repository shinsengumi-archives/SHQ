I only got this far in what you&#39;ve written so far:\n\n***Age=\r\n: Takamine was exactly 10 years younger than Fujita Goro\nThis is important.=\r\n In 1868, Takamine was only 15 however unlike \nFujita he never really was a=\r\n fully a samurai &quot;in practice&quot; (if you \nincorporate the warrior definition =\r\nof a samurai). Takamine was a \npage, while that was an important job, he li=\r\nke another friend of \nFujita, Yamakawa Kenjiro, could not experience the di=\r\nmension of going \ninto battle.***\n\nI see what you&#39;re saying!  I can even re=\r\nlate to it, because Fujita-\nsama is my hero today, although I&#39;m way more th=\r\nan 10 years younger \nthan he.  Hey, I like feeling young again!\n\nThe reason=\r\n why I said this is as far as I got with what you wrote is \nbecause I&#39;m che=\r\nwing it slowly.  I cannot begin to tell you how much \nthis is impacting mys=\r\nelf personally.  I can understand Yamakawa & \nTakamine&#39;s interest in Fujita=\r\n-sama and I can just about feel the \nhonor they felt in knowing a man that =\r\nactually did so much for their \npeople.\n\nOMG and the fiction sense of the w=\r\nhole thing as a writer as I view \nTakamine as a page and Fujita-sama 10 yea=\r\nrs his senior :O  I&#39;m just \nfloored with this information.\n\nLike I said, I&#39;=\r\nm chewing this all so slowly, taking notes along the \nway and perhaps I&#39;ll =\r\nhave enough &#39;stuff&#39; to tack on an entertaining \nvolume to the fiction I&#39;m w=\r\nriting.  Right now I have Saitou in Kyoto \nawaiting to meet up with the Ros=\r\nhingumi and I&#39;m already over 51000 \nwords into the manuscript.  I&#39;m thinkin=\r\ng, just by what you&#39;ve written \nhere, later on down the road, after bunches=\r\n of study, I&#39;ll pen a \nTakamine episode.  Oh heavens, I can feel my heart t=\r\nhumping with \nexcitement.\n\nThanks for sharing all this stuff, I&#39;ll read and=\r\n chew more.  I just \nhad to mention this now before I pop. \n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; WARNING:  BEL=\r\nOW IS A VERY VERY LONG POST...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;kikue.mugen&quot; &lt;kikue.mugen@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; This is all making me so curious about the Takamine family.  I \nhav=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; not even thought of studying on Mr. Takamine, but after this, I \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n seriously want to know who this man is that trusted Saito with so \n&gt; &gt; man=\r\ny confidential areas of his life.  What was their relationship \n&gt; and what =\r\nmade them so compatible.  Oh, if only I could be a fly on \n&gt; the wall back =\r\nthen, can you imagine the conversations I&#39;d overhear?\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; Dear Kikue, thanks for your comment!\n&gt; \n&gt; J=\r\nust something for everyone to chew on.  WHO came up with the name \n&gt; Saito =\r\nKazuma?  \n&gt; \n&gt; I wager it&#39;s not even Fujita.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s Tokio.\n&gt; Let=\r\n me try to explain (and you all can disregard this blabber if \nyou \n&gt; want)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Japanese love to keep logs/records since feudal times.  If there is \n=\r\na \n&gt; famine you write it down.  If there is a fire, you note houses \nburned=\r\n.\n&gt; Yamazaki Susumu kept a good log on Shinsengumi\n&gt; Yamakawa Hiroshi (yet =\r\nanother friend of the Fujitas) even noted in \n&gt; his log when Fujita Tsutomu=\r\n was born (Goro and Tokio&#39;s first son)\n&gt; Many families (well before 1868) k=\r\nept an expense log (usually \n&gt; maintained by the wife if she was literate)\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; It is in no way strange if Fujita Goro scribbled something in his \nlog=\r\n \n&gt; book (mind you it&#39;s probably not a tell all diary XD) after \nTakamine \n=\r\n&gt; died.  When the book is printed, Tokio could easily rummage through \n&gt; hu=\r\nbby&#39;s stuff and pull out the papers=85and she may have done some \n&gt; editing=\r\n=85like tag on a fake name=85.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember Tokio was still alive=85this i=\r\ns still well before the 1923 \n&gt; earthquake when a lot of things are lost fo=\r\nrever.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kikue, it&#39;s not complete yet but you can visit this site \n&gt; htt=\r\np://www.takaminehideo.net (studied the T-sensei since 2004 and \nit \n&gt; occur=\r\nred to me to put up a site in 2006 XD---there is a section on \n&gt; the Siames=\r\ne and Takamine during Fujita&#39;s years at the school which \nI \n&gt; should uploa=\r\nd)\n&gt; \n&gt; Well the information we posted ofcourse is based on a translation \n=\r\nof \n&gt; just what &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; said about Takamine.  So your question \n&gt; a=\r\nbout what made two very very different men friends is very \nimportant \n&gt; to=\r\n me.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;d like to approach your question from another angle, &quot;what d=\r\nid \n&gt; Takamine think about Fujita?&quot;  I&#39;ve been studying this man since \n&gt; 2=\r\n004.  Info on Takamine appears in English, Japanese and Thai (I&#39;ve \n&gt; found=\r\n him in 4 Thai books---however 2 cite the other as source).\n&gt; I can&#39;t even =\r\nbegin to list how different they were in terms of \n&gt; background:\n&gt; \n&gt; Age: =\r\n Takamine was exactly 10 years younger than Fujita Goro\n&gt; This is important=\r\n.  In 1868, Takamine was only 15 however unlike \n&gt; Fujita he never really w=\r\nas a fully a samurai &quot;in practice&quot; (if you \n&gt; incorporate the warrior defin=\r\nition of a samurai).  Takamine was a \n&gt; page, while that was an important j=\r\nob, he like another friend of \n&gt; Fujita, Yamakawa Kenjiro, could not experi=\r\nence the dimension of \ngoing \n&gt; into battle.  The reason why both Takamine =\r\nand Yamakawa [respected] \n&gt; Fujita because: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Yamaguchi Jiro ~DEFEND=\r\nED AIZU, their homeland---if I may \nspeculate \n&gt; here, Fujita to them, was =\r\nsort of their hero.  Regardless of any \n&gt; difference in social class in the=\r\n Meiji, they didn&#39;t see him \n&gt; as &quot;officer Fujita&quot;  they saw him as a samur=\r\nai.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) They shared in survivor&#39;s guilt and had empathy for one another=\r\n\n&gt; Social Background:  Takamine (as a kid he was called Tadayoshi not \n&gt; Hi=\r\ndeo), completed his education at Nisshinkan (Aizu&#39;s school for \n&gt; samurai) =\r\nand was gifted enough to be called a &#39;shindo&#39;, he was \ngiven \n&gt; the job of =\r\npage to daimyo Matsudaira Katamori.  \n&gt; We know Saitou&#39;s background pretty =\r\nwell (^_^)\n&gt; \n&gt; Adulthood:  Takamine spent 3 years in the USA (rural New Yo=\r\nrk) and \n&gt; spent the rest of his life in Japan as an academic and was invol=\r\nved \n&gt; in many extracurricular activities (art, science, charity, working \n=\r\n&gt; with many foreigners--some of whom literally exported &quot;Meiji Japan&quot; \n&gt; to=\r\n the USA and even to Europe)\n&gt; Fujita&#39;s career was very &quot;classic&quot; post 1868=\r\n samurai jobs (police, \n&gt; bodyguard to Inoue Kaoru, Imperial guard detail f=\r\nor the Empress etc)\n&gt; \n&gt; Political/Social views:  Takamine was a &quot;true&quot; pro=\r\ngressive (not \nlike \n&gt; Mori Arinori, or even Takamine&#39;s own mentor Fukuzawa=\r\n).  Some women \n&gt; here may appreciate this:  &quot;He (Takamine) hated the old s=\r\naying &#39;men \n&gt; revered, women subjected&#39;....&quot; (danson-johi) (Takamine Hideo-=\r\nsensei \n&gt; den, p. 174 translated by A. Bakalian).  T-sensei worked very har=\r\nd \n&gt; for women&#39;s education and also adopted highly unpopular views at \nthe =\r\n\n&gt; risk of his own career.\n&gt; \n&gt; We don&#39;t know about Fujita&#39;s views.\n&gt; \n&gt; so=\r\n with all these differences in mind how did they become friends, \n&gt; other t=\r\nhan their common Aizu &quot;connection&quot; and the fact that Tokio \nis \n&gt; Takamine&#39;=\r\ns cousin?\n&gt; \n&gt; They are different that&#39;s why they get along.\n&gt; \n&gt; Takamine =\r\nwas VERY LOQUACIOUS (he can blah blah blah for hours on \n&gt; topics he likes)=\r\n.  Fujita was taciturn or he may have come across \nas \n&gt; a good listener.  =\r\nFor all we know Fujita may have learned how to \n&gt; sleep with his eyes open =\r\nin these one sided conversations : LOL :\n&gt; Fujita may have felt that some o=\r\nf Takamine&#39;s ideas were \n100% &quot;silly&quot; \n&gt; because---they were (if you imagin=\r\ne yourself to be a typical \nJapanese \n&gt; man of that era).  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, l=\r\nikely their conversations were &quot;selective&quot; and focused on \n&gt; things they co=\r\nuld agree on:  certain political figures they knew \nfrom \n&gt; before 1868, wh=\r\no were still around in the Meiji Era.  In other \n&gt; words &quot;Did you read abou=\r\nt that guy who just died, remember what he \n&gt; was up to during the war?....=\r\n&quot; etc etc\n&gt; \n&gt; Very few people can advise Takamine in matters of art, excep=\r\nt when \nit \n&gt; came to swords.  Again, one must meditate on the fact that Fu=\r\njita \nin \n&gt; his youth had to have had a peculiar education or mentor to be =\r\nso \n&gt; learned in the field of sword appraisal to have been able to give \n&gt; =\r\npointers to a man like Takamine who was -OBSESSED- with things like \n&gt; trad=\r\nitional, modern art, pottery etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; We all assume that Fujita&#39;s appointm=\r\nent to the Women&#39;s Normal \nSchool \n&gt; was to Fujita&#39;s advantage.\n&gt; \n&gt; From m=\r\ny own study into Meiji Education politics I don&#39;t think this \nis \n&gt; necessa=\r\nrily the only way to view the situation.  It was to \nTAKAMINE&#39;S \n&gt; ADVANTAG=\r\nE to have someone in the office to keep him informed.  \nThere \n&gt; was intens=\r\ne factionalism in the system and as the director it was a \n&gt; good idea to h=\r\nave a good &quot;pulse&quot; on the situation in the school and \n&gt; to inform him if s=\r\nome of his wacky ideas was truly accepted or not \nby \n&gt; his staff and facul=\r\nty. To keep this short, I have to say that \n&gt; Takamine&#39;s career had very ve=\r\nry severe declines.  By the time he \n&gt; drags a friend into the school, Taka=\r\nmine has seen it all when it \n&gt; comes to career matters.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Saitou Kazum=\r\na&quot; seemed to know intimate details about Takamine.  \nWell \n&gt; the reverse is=\r\n true as well.  When Numazawa Tatsuo asked his aunt \n&gt; Ibuka Saku about his=\r\n true parentage (Tatsuo was Goro and Tokio&#39;s \n&gt; third son), Ibuka told him =\r\nthe truth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ibuka is Takamine&#39;s  mother&#39;s family.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In other words=\r\n, it&#39;s impossible to imagine that Takamine didn&#39;t \nknow \n&gt; about the adopti=\r\non, Ibuka Saku was probably his mother&#39;s relative \n&gt; (sister?).  Tokio had =\r\nto have told Takamine&#39;s mother about the \n&gt; adoption.  Pic of Tokio&#39;s gal p=\r\nal &quot;Ma Takamine&quot; (Takamine Kinoko \n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/Ta=\r\nkamineKinoko.jpg). \n&gt; Takamine&#39;s mother in turn may have told her own relat=\r\nive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recall this testimony:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Mrs. Tokio and my grandmother Ikuno/=\r\nKinoko were very close to each \n&gt; other, and Mrs. Tokio often came over to =\r\nsee my grandmother...If my \n&gt; memories are correct, at the time Ms. Tokio h=\r\nad her bangs \n&gt; in &#39;kirisage style&quot;\n&gt; I remember, when my mother died, Ms. =\r\nTokio stopped by my house \n&gt; several times to help us.\n&gt; Mrs. Tokio was a w=\r\noman not too tall, but rather small of stature. \nShe \n&gt; certainly did look =\r\nlike an Aizu woman. (likely because she was \nsmall--\n&gt; or maybe also becaus=\r\ne she was hard-working) She often went to the \n&gt; Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s home=\r\n at Enoki-zaka...working there on many \n&gt; different things (or: There she d=\r\nevoted herself to various chores, \n&gt; such as housekeeping and other things =\r\nwomen were in charge)\n&gt; My grandmother often took my sister and I to Mr. Fu=\r\njita&#39;s \n&gt; residence...As I remember, from the street we would go down the \n=\r\nstone-\n&gt; made staircase to get to the house.\n&gt; \n&gt; These stories are from Ms=\r\n. Takamine Keiko who was interviewed in \n1978.\n&gt; \n&gt; Keiko was born in the 1=\r\n890s and therefore only knew very &quot;aged&quot; Mr. \n&gt; and Mrs. Fujita.\n&gt; \n&gt; I gue=\r\nss in a way this discovery of a &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; makes up for my \n&gt; disastrou=\r\ns attempt at acquiring the wedding photos of Mr. and Mrs. \n&gt; Takamine.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n While Takamine is not our main interest, what we want are the other \n&gt; Aiz=\r\nu figures which would show up in a group photo, namely, possibly \na \n&gt; man =\r\nwhich may or may not resemble the one shown in teh Seinan War \n&gt; photo.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Research is never neat and organized, you have to be really really \n&gt; wil=\r\ny to find what you need and look for other &quot;opportunities&quot; \nbecause \n&gt; afte=\r\nr all, there is little or no chance of anyone finding artifacts \n&gt; directly=\r\n related to the Fujitas.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
