It&#39;s about \neight warriors who are descendents from an inu god and it&#39;s set \nduring the feudal age of Japan. I won&#39;t say much but it I thought I \nshould mention that the story revolves around the &quot;Murasame&quot; and oni \nand spirits. The story can be hard to follow sometimes because \nthere&#39;s a lot of symbolization and drifting in/out of reality. \nThere&#39;s also a lot of abuse of power directed towards commoners. Just \nthought I should mention it in case anyone is interested, since in \none of the chats the murasame sword was discussed...\n\n~wounds\n\n\n"
