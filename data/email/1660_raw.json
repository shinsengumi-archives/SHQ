There were the traditional greetings\nafter the arrival of the Shinsengumi parade, some\nwords by Fujita Taro (the great-grandson of Fujita\nGoro), the memorial service and a demonstration\n(hounou enbu, actually) of Mugai-ryu iaijutsu. And I\ncould get to meet Tama-san in person, which was really\ngreat ^.^\n\nFor those who are interested, I have uploaded some\npictures I took at the memorial service. They are in\nthe Photos section of yahoogroups. Again, the images\nare very heavy...\n\nAnd I couldn&#39;t go to the Shinsengumi summit either.\nPity.\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
