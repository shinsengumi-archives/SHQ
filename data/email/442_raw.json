Sorry for dropping in the middle of \na discussion without a proper introduction.\nSo I go by the name Miser Bellatrix, but you can call me whatever you want. \nI have yet to look through all the information here, but I&#39;m certainly very \ninterested. The Shinsengumi caught my interest when I first fell in love \nwith *cough* Saitou, and ever since I&#39;ve been obsessed.\n\n...So I don&#39;t social much, so what?\n\nHehehe, anyway, I&#39;m lacking in brains, but I do have an artistic talent. So \nI&#39;ll probably be sending little gifts for the members of this group once in \na while. Hopefully that&#39;ll make up for probably never being able to help \nwith information gathering.\n\nMiser Bellatrix\n\n&quot;Allow me to give you a hand...with your doom.&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFrom must-see cities to the best beaches, plan a getaway with the Spring \nTravel Guide! http://special.msn.com/local/springtravel.armx\n\n\n"
