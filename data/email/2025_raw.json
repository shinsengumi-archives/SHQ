Also, Okita and Mitsu&#39;s \nfather, Katsujirou, was a foot soldier captain (ashigaru kogashira) \nstationed at the lower mansion (shimo-yashiki) of the Shirakawa clan, in \nEdo. Souji was also born in Edo.\n\nThanks! (bounces) Must tell my friend... she&#39;s really into Souji and this has been one of her pet peeves. She says there&#39;s a village named Shirokawa near Edo, and another in Aizu... but if it&#39;s the Shirokawa *clan* involved, we&#39;ve been barking up the wrong tree altogether.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
