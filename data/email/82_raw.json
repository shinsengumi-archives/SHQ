We&#39;re not going to \nplay dictator with you or anything! \n\nAs you all know, we want the files to remain strictly text files. \nThat generally means that they&#39;re some sort of wordprocessor file. \nThe trouble I&#39;ve run into with those is that they can occasionally be \nhard to open. Also, they can involve extra work when it comes time to \ntransfer the info to the website.\n\nThe suggestion we would like to make is that if you have the &quot;publish \nto html&quot; feature on your computer, please convert your files to this \nfirst. This will make it easy to open and hopefully save Barb some \ntrouble transferring it later on. If you do not have this feature (I \nthink both MSword and WordPerfect shoud have it somewhere under File) \nthen feel free to send the info to me or another moderator who has \nthe feature. We can convert it and post it for you or send it back to \nyou via e-mail attachment so you can post it yourself. Whichever you \nspecify. \n\nAgain, we&#39;re not trying to pressure anyone. We&#39;re not going to start \ndeleteing any file that&#39;s not html or anything. It is merely a \nsuggestion. We simply want this to be as enjoyable and easy on \neveryone involved as we can make it. \n\n-MissBehavin.\n\n\n"
