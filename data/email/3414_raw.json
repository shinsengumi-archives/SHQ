F=\r\nor example texts which are \ncharacter bios of the major figures in ROTK---t=\r\nhen people get so \ninterested they are willing to wade through the original=\r\n text.\n\nAnyways as stated here on the list in before, it is eery Kondou Isa=\r\nmi \nrelated himself to the character of Guan Yu who had a very tragic end i=\r\nn \nROTK.  More well known themes from ROTK is simply the &quot;PEACH \nGARDEN PAC=\r\nK&quot; during which 3 warriors swore to be brothers---this is a \nstock phrase u=\r\nsed all over the place in China/Korea/Japan in the context \nofcourse of a w=\r\narrior&#39;s bond.\n\nUltimately though it would have occurred to MANY MANY guys =\r\nduring the \nBakumatsu that on a national scale, politics had entered the &quot;s=\r\ntate&quot; of \nthree kingdoms (3 political units/parties etc) in which to surviv=\r\ne you \ndon&#39;t want to be the unit that gets ganged up on by 2 other units (t=\r\nhis is \nwhat happened to Aizu vs Sat-Cho, and a few smaller domains w/ Sat-=\r\n\nCho).\n\nAnyways people who study warfare, warriors or the &quot;mentality&quot; of \nm=\r\nilitary strategists and confine themselves to THE ART OF WAR, Book of \n5 ri=\r\nngs etc---are missing like a good 90% of detail, nuance, diplomacy, \nnon-mi=\r\nlitary tactics and personel management unless they seriously \nmake an effor=\r\nt to get a taste of one of Asia&#39;s most best-selling works of \nliterature.\n\n=\r\nFootnote:  Sichuan which experienced the devastating earthquake this \nyear =\r\nis one of the 3 kingdoms in ROTK.  I really appreciated how John \nWoo used =\r\nthe occasion of this movie&#39;s release to honor people who tried \nto alleviat=\r\ne the suffering there.\n\nEven in the ROTK text, earthquakes are mentioned an=\r\nd the very rugged \nterrain around the area used as a natural defense in pre=\r\n-modern times \nwas what hindered rescue efforts during this recent disaster=\r\n.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kikue.mugen&quot; &lt;kikue.mugen@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThe link leads me to a dead page :(\n&gt; How come that? :P\n\n\n"
