Awesome photos.  I have a question. \n &gt; Swerizawa&#39;s Quarters, was that where he was killed?\n &gt; \n &gt; \n \n If you look at this image:\n http://www.flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/2375667420/in/set-72157604321244361/\n \n The entrance on the left is the entrance to Hirayama and Serizawa&#39;s\n quarters. I&#39;ll see if I can explain it - Directly inside is the\n genkan, with a low hanging spear-rack.  Once you get inside the entire\n building is maybe 40 feet long, all tatami, and then at that time\n there was a partition where Hirayama Goro was (the partitions are now\n gone, but the low hanging beams that held them are only about 6.5 feet\n above the floor.  His &quot;room&quot; was about 8 feet long and maybe about\n that wide, and then another partition, where Serizawa was. Serizawa&#39;s\n &quot;room&quot; had direct access to the garden - and by &quot;garden&quot; I mean a\n really small area that looks like a typical &quot;Japanese garden&quot;. \n Someone here would know better than I how the attack played out, but I\n  do remember from the guide that Serizawa stumbled onto the wooden\n walkway before the garden, and took a left into the Yagi&#39;s sleeping\n quarters where he was killed.  There is a cut in the top of the\n doorway there, supposedly from a sword slash from that night.  No\n pictures were allowed inside or in the garden, unfortunately.  But it\n is all a pretty small area. It was pretty interesting walking through\n these rooms that I&#39;d read about.\n \n If I have time, I&#39;ll add more pictures tomorrow - I still have about\n 100 more to go.  I got some great pics of Osaka castle and elsewhere.\n \n \n     \n                                       \n\n       \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
