Takes place in the court of one of \nthe early Tokugawa shoguns (he play=\r\ns the shogun).  Unfortunately, I \ndon&#39;t think anyone has undertaken doing s=\r\nubtitles for it, but so \nmany Jdramas can be enjoyed without them.  The dra=\r\nma is available \nover on D-Addicts ( http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrent=\r\ns.php?\nsearch=3Dooku+hana+no+ran&type=3D&sub=3DView+all&sort=3D ).\n\nIf no o=\r\nne has pointed you in these directions, a couple of places to \nfind out mor=\r\ne about other things our Shinsengumi alumni have been in \nare Drama-Wiki ( =\r\nhttp://wiki.d-addicts.com/Main_Page ) and JDorama ( \nhttp://www.jdorama.com=\r\n ).  The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) can \nalso provide information, but =\r\nit&#39;s not as thorough on Japanese \nactors (http://www.imdb.com).\n\nAnd, yes, =\r\n&quot;Deborah the Rival&quot; is not to be missed for anyone who \nlikes Tanihara-san =\r\nand/or needs to laugh.

Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; If it&#39;s Tanihara you wish to admire and/or drool over you=\r\n MUST get \none \n&gt; of his early films---Fudoh. Sky High is also quite good w=\r\nith \nfreaky cool \n&gt; paranormal elements. he was also very good in a small p=\r\nart in \nSleepless \n&gt; Town and I&#39;m sure Ms. Phil and Sec & Tama will agree t=\r\nhat if you \ncan get \n&gt; hold of Deborah the Rival you&#39;ll be thrilled and ama=\r\nzed. ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; He&#39;s also done quite a few J-Dramas.\n&gt; \n&gt; And any film or dra=\r\nma you come across with Koichi Sato (Serizawa)\nis also \n&gt; a good bet.\n&gt; -- =\r\n\n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; http://www.dragonsdi=\r\nsciple.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
