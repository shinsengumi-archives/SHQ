So if you&#39;ve \nseen a film/anime featuring the guys =\r\nplease forward your review to: \nsecretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com .\n\nWe also =\r\nhave a list of films which already have reviews but they aren&#39;t live \nyet u=\r\nntil I reformat font/images.  So if you want to give your opinion on \nmore =\r\nmainstream films such as Gohatto or Mibugishiden just send me an \nemail.\n\nD=\r\nue to the fact that the Shinsengumi are featured in anything from rated-G \n=\r\nanime for kids, high brow cinema to adult films it is all right to write \nc=\r\nlever/cynical reviews because let&#39;s face it some of these films really \ndes=\r\nerve it. (^_^)\n\nI&#39;m currently figuring out an efficient way of putting thin=\r\ngs back online \nbecause I&#39;ve just determined that having Photoshop, WS/FTP,=\r\n Wordpress, \nWordpress edit mode, html builder all open at the same time is=\r\n really \nslowing me down.\n\nttyl\n\n\n"
