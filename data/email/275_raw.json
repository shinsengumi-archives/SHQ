I expect it will eventually... but it&#39;s really aggravating when a test message sent over an hour after it shows up before it.\n \nIn the meantime, the gist of what I replied was that of all days for me to be watching hours of prison history on History Channel, you would come up with your little tease of information.  If the Meiji was also structuring incarceration systems on western models (along with its armed and police forces), it would not have been unusual for Saitou/Fujita to have lived at the site as an officer, perhaps in charge of discipline (& he would&#39;ve probably been very effective, ne?).  Through the 19th and into the 20th centuries, it was more common for prison staff to live on or adjacent to the prison grounds, from the warden on down.  Given how strict and restrictive I&#39;ve read the police system was, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he was required to live there.  And, that&#39;s what I conclude from what you reported the woman telling you... he was an officer and he lived there, not that he was incarcerated there.\n \nIt&#39;s just one more of those incredibly fascinating things demanding a translation... which was it?  Was he an employee or an inmate????  And I wouldn&#39;t trust babelfish to give me a definitive answer.   :-D  I&#39;d *love* to know if you find out anything about it.\n \nphil (apologizing in advance for repeat of comments)\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
