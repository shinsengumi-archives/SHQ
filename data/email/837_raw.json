Don&#39;t know where my mind went!!! &lt;&lt;\n \nI think it&#39;s probably that you&#39;re more sane about this than I am.  :-D  You know what obsession is like...\n \n&gt;&gt;But maybe that does at least explain why Suzuki wasn&#39;t executed when Sagara was. Perhaps the fact that he was also in charge of those Satsuma ronin drew most of the blame to him?  They may have made a greater effort to capture him for this reason.&lt;&lt;\n \nI&#39;d think it&#39;s very possible.  This whole idea that members of the Sekihoutai did survive, that perhaps it was only the first patrol (Sagara&#39;s patrol) that was executed, is still too new to me.  Watsuki really gave the strong impression that it was the *entire* Sekihoutai that was wiped out.  Who knows... maybe Suzuki was really the sole survivor (though somehow I doubt it... I&#39;m still amazed so many Shinsengumi survived when earlier readings I did gave the impression they were destroyed almost to a man).\n \nIf nothing else, it dislodges the possibility that Saigou might&#39;ve done it for personal reasons as the only motive in my own thinking (which is kind of a relief, actually), that there were extenuating circumstances (still not Sagara&#39;s fault... he was following orders in a war) that might lead others to want his blood.  It was still a wretched thing to do... Sagara remains an absolute scapegoat... I still hate Saigou and believe he was at the heart of it... but at least it muddies the water so he doesn&#39;t have to be such a purely self-motivated person.  I mean, I still think he was a megalomaniac, but I can see how he could want his legend to be associated with the salvation of Japan, that sacrificing Sagara was worth it in his mind to strengthen the whole.  Do I have any hope that that makes *any* sense?\n \nphil (who thought Suzuki surviving was angst enough to throw into SaiSa... now I&#39;ve got Sagara as a Satsuma retainer... though I guess Sagara was dead before personal hatred of Satsuma would&#39;ve *really* touched Saitou??? Wasn&#39;t it over the Battle of Aizu that the hatred became intense?)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
