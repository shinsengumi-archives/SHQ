The whole site is EXCELLENT with superb info about Tokugawa and Meiji Era.\n\nFor those interested in Japanese beliefs, two sacred texts The Kokiji and the Nihongi\n\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/kojiki.htm\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/nihon0.htm\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/nihon1.htm\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/nihon2.htm\n\nThe Religion of the Samurai A Study of Zen Philosophy and Discipline in China and Japan By Kaiten Nukariya http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/rosa/index.htm\n\nHere, there is an interesting description, among other things, of Yoshiwara, Tokyo&#39;s counterpart of Shimabara. It might help though\nhttp://www.udel.edu/History/figal/Hist372/index.html\n\nThe Nakasendo page, its VERY detailed and interesting. I highly recommend it, because it deals with the controls in the post-towns and a lot of cultural hints during late Tokugawa. It might be helpful too as a reference concerning inns, permissions of transit, etc.\n\n\nIm pretty sure there is a twin site dealing with the Tokaido too, though I cannot find it among my bookmarks...\n\nFiruze\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
