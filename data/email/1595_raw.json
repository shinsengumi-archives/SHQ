I want to see the kenbu of\nByakkotai at the very least. And it seems that the\nactor playing the role of Hijikata Toshizo will join\nthe Aizu parade as well.\n\nhttp://www.aizukanko.com/maturi/autumn/aki-23.htm\n\n\n&gt; By the way, when Kamo-san comes to Japan, I want you\n&gt; to confirm. \n&gt; Probably, since you will come to Japan by an\n&gt; airplane, if you arrive \n&gt; at an airport, please confirm what kind of smell\n&gt; there is. \n&gt; Is there the smell of soy sauce? \n\n\nHmm... couldn&#39;t smell it... it was just plain air\nconditioning for me ^^;;; though my nose isn&#39;t good,\nso perhaps I didn&#39;t smell it because of my lack of\nsensitivity ^^;;; (and I like shoyu)\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
