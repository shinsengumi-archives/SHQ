Why Shinsengumi choosed the word &quot;makoto&quot; ?\nA very =\r\nvery general essay on &quot;makoto&quot; is here\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/definit=\r\nionsofmakoto.htm\n\nMakoto to one&#39;s lord (boss)\nMakoto to one&#39;s land (han/dom=\r\nain/feud)\nMakoto to one&#39;s teacher (either martial, educational, art, \nphilo=\r\nsophical or one who has given you a means to make a living such \nas someone=\r\n who teaches you how to be a swordsmith)\nMakoto to one&#39;s self\nSincerity is =\r\nwater which flows from one&#39;s heart, it is inexhaustible \nand gives life.\n\nI=\r\n&#39;ve never read a step by step account as to how Kondou Isami or \nother prom=\r\ninent figures in the Shinsengumi may have concluded to \nadopt this term---h=\r\nowever keep in mind that people across the \npolitical spectrum also drew on=\r\n this word frequently such \nas &quot;loyalty/sincerity to the emperor&quot;.\n--------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;   3. Does Shinsengumi has a connection with yakuza =\r\nera ?\n\nShinsengumi and Yakuza connection is mentioned here please click \non=\r\n &quot;Books Which Mention the Shinsengumi&quot;\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_fa=\r\ncts.htm\n\nYou may say &quot;NO WAY, the Shinsengumi should not mess with those sc=\r\num!&quot;\nhowever, way way way in the past...yakuza have existed for a very \nlon=\r\ng time serving as almost its own social class which ends up being \nan econo=\r\nmic safety net for ronin, social misfits and outcasts.  \nYakuza not surpris=\r\ningly rose in power alongside the merchant class \nduring the end of the Edo=\r\n Era.  There were also divisions and \nspecific labels for yakuza as well.  =\r\nThe term &quot;yakuza&quot; is very \ngeneral.\n\nMore importantly, yakuza ran the red l=\r\night district for a long time \nbefore the Shinsengumi were even born.  When=\r\n you think of yakuza try \nnot to picture &quot;modern&quot; yakuza.  Ofcourse histori=\r\ncally, there were \nflashy dressing thug yakuza on the street too.  HOwever,=\r\n the ones who \nhad &quot;real&quot; power acted....like RESPECTABLE SAMURAI OR MERCHA=\r\nNT \nFAMILIES (*_*).  Some people colleted artwork depicting samurai \n(often=\r\n actors portraying samurai)---some also collect artwork \ndepicting famous y=\r\nakuza who became &quot;folk heroes&quot;---thus from a social \npoint of view, yakuza =\r\nwere at times viewed as Robin HOod type \nfigures.  \n\nI think that -if- the =\r\nShinsengumi had more deeper ties with the \nyakuza it would be because yakuz=\r\na are information brokers.  If the \nShinsengumi wished to be successful in =\r\ntheir jobs they would try to \nbe on good terms with the yakuza and even buy=\r\n information from the \nyakuza.  From the Edo Era, Meiji and modern era, yak=\r\nuza and law \nenforcement have sought a strange &quot;balance of power&quot;.  If that=\r\n \ndelicate arrangement is disturbed one or the other side would take \nactio=\r\nn.\n\nI recommend Yakuza: Japan&#39;s Criminal Underworld, Expanded Edition \nby D=\r\navid E. Kaplan (Author), Alec Dubro\nYakuza are also mentioned here http://w=\r\nww.shinsengumihq.com/NSNR.htm\n-----------------------------\n&gt;   4. Is it wr=\r\nong if  I say &quot;makoto&quot; was Shinsengumi way of life / \nphilosophy?\n\nYou can =\r\nsay it was an ideal the group adopted---but like all &quot;ways of \nlife&quot; ultima=\r\ntely the individual decides how he can interpret it.\n----------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt;   5. ( Just for the people who love Shinsengumi ),, Would you ( i=\r\nf \nyou don&#39;t mind ) give me your private reasons why you love them ?\n\nI gre=\r\nw interested in the Shinsengumi from the anime/manga Rurouni \nKenshin.  Lat=\r\ner I became fascinated with the historical Saitou Hajime \n(Fujita Goro) and=\r\n the larger Aizu narrative.  \nI owe alot to the Shinsengumi for teaching me=\r\n about bias:  \n1) from people who are pro Ishin and Meiji revisionist texts=\r\n\n2) from Shinsengumi fans who romanticized the Miburo and try to white \nwas=\r\nh them\n3) people who confuse history with fiction and the subsequent \ndisil=\r\nlusionment with all things \n4) I like the &quot;free&quot; expressions of creativity =\r\nI see in Shinsengumi \nfandom---I especially like original works\n5) I&#39;ve nev=\r\ner really researched stuff like this before---so I picked \nup alot of neat =\r\nlittle tricks to find stuff in the library etc etc\n\nAlthough now I focus on=\r\n history (because I cannot afford manga/anime) \nI still do alot of fanfic w=\r\nriting and drawing although I don&#39;t \nsubject the public to those efforts (^=\r\n___^)\n\n\n\n\n"
