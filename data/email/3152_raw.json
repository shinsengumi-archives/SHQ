It has\n&gt; Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s Roushi Bu=\r\nnkyu Hokokukiji and Shimada Kai&#39;s Nikki.\n&gt; The bonus is that it has both th=\r\ne meiji era Japanese, and the modern\n&gt; equivalent on each page, so I don&#39;t =\r\nhave to fry my brain trying to\n&gt; read the old Japanese.  The version I have=\r\n was published in 2003,\n&gt; edited by Kimura Sachiko.  I found Nagakura Shinp=\r\nachi&#39;s post script\n&gt; particularly interesting:\n&gt; \n&gt; (I&#39;m paraphrasing)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot;This battle record was not written during the trying times of the\n&gt; actua=\r\nl battles. This was done after the fact, memories that I\n&gt; revisited now an=\r\nd then.  This is the story of what actually happened.\n&gt; Because of this, it=\r\n differs from fictional accounts, and I want it to\n&gt; be understood as a tru=\r\ne account.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s somewhere near the top of my to-read list, once I get=\r\n started,\n&gt; I&#39;ll post translations of the more interesting/broadly applicab=\r\nle parts.\n&gt;\n\n\n"
