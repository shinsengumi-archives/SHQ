The Japanese Okita Rintaro (Fujiwara no Fusamasa) article at Wikipedia =\r\nis\ncorrect.\n\nPlease see this page:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Okita_=\r\nRintaro\n\nOn the article page, I&#39;d copied ?? as &quot;Mototsune&quot; by mistake. It s=\r\nhould have been spelt as \nFusamasa instead.

Rintaro Mototsune is listed in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;Shinchogumi records as &quot;Son of the late Okita Katsujiro, retainer of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nLord Abe Noto no Kami&quot;. (Kikuchi, p. 26) \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry, but I have to res=\r\npectfully disagree. The record of Okita\n&gt; Rintaro as [adopted] son of Okita=\r\n Katsujiro *is* a fact, recorded in a\n&gt; source related to the Shinchogumi, =\r\ncompiled *during* the Bakumatsu,\n&gt; which Kikuchi lists. It wasn&#39;t raised as=\r\n part of explaining why Soji\n&gt; is listed as the &quot;second son&quot;, it was merely=\r\n confirming how Rintaro\n&gt; Mototsune/Fusamasa was listed in Shinchogumi reco=\r\nrds. Kikuchi\n&gt; theorizes later, but this much, with regards to Rintaro bein=\r\ng\n&gt; Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;son&quot;, is a fact which Kikuchi cites as coming from the\n&gt; r=\r\necord of &quot;Shinchogumi Meisaishosocho&quot;, from 1865.\n&gt; \n&gt; As always, thank you=\r\n for your interaction, and for bringing activity\n&gt; back into this group.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; -M.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
