Sec\nhas always graciously shared her great finds with those on this list and\nwillingly gave access to her university webspace for the benefit of all\nand now some little bastard has had the fucking nerve to root around in\nthe section with her school files and STEAL THEM!\n\nI hope you&#39;re very proud of yourself and happy with your &quot;finds&quot; which\napparently are of no use to anyone but Sec.\n\nI&#39;ve advised Sec not to share anything again with the group at large as\na result. If she chooses to share something in the future I&#39;ve offered\nto place it on  megaupload where only the item in question can be had.\n\nDon&#39;t be surprised though if anything new regarding the Shinsengumi or\ntheir times is only passed between a limited circle of friends leaving\nthe majority of you screwed and in the dark due to the  unconscionable\nbehavior of  others.\n---\nBarbara Sheridan\n\n"
