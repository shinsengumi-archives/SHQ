It would \n  be historically accurate that samurai would wear asagi colored kimono for \n  seppuku ceremony.\n  If you saw NHK, that pale green Kamishimo worn by Yamanami or Kawai for their \n  seppuku is also asagi color as there are many nuance of that color.\n  Dispite the difference of the tone, if speaking of Asagi color in bakumatsu \n  it would be blue but slightly greenished close to cyan or peacock in western \n  color.\n\n  The problem with TV drama or film is sometimes they choose deliberately \n  different color for that uniform rather than authentic asagi, by esthetic or \n  technical reason.\n  For exemple, NHK staff told that authentic asagi color becomes less clear \n  through the camera and they had to choose more vivid blue.\n  About Gohatto, Takeshi Kitano said that was good choice if they used black \n  color uniform instead of blue, because Shinsengumi appeared often in many skits \n  with that blue costume and if Kitano who had been known as a comedian appeared \n  in such uniform, that would make laugh the people. \n  They could avoid too popular image.\n\n  Tama\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
