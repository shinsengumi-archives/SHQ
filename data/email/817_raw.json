It&#39;s something I read in a book a while back,\nbut I don&#39;t\nremember what role the second has in it.\n\nI know for men, they tucked away their kimono under their knees in in\nsuch a\nfashion along with placing the wooden pedestal behind and under them\nto prevent\nthemselves from falling backwards. I forget if this also prevents them\nfrom\nfalling forward as well, or makes them only fall forward.\n\n[secretarytocapt3]\n\nOkita don&#39;t you think it is interesting/weird as to how these beliefs\ncame into existence? Falling forward/backwards...the right and wrong\nway to do anything is a recurring theme in Japanese martial culture.\n\nI&#39;ve read that in the scenario that a woman actually kills herself (no\nsecond to assist)...she will plunge the dagger into her heart...I got\n2 examples to help us understand\n1) The Shambhala Guide to Kendo by Minoru Kiyota isbn1570629277 page 110\n&quot;General Nogi Maresuke...dressed himself in ceremonial garb and\ndisemboweled himself while his wife, Shizuko, pierced her heart beside\nhim&quot;\n2) The following scenario involves a couple of samurai which took a\ncastle...they searched each room and found the body of a\nnoblewoman...she had killed herself ...the samurai I guess removed the\nknife and commented that maybe the dagger was not made by Mr. X\nbecause all weapons knives made by Mr. X would not have been easily\ndamaged by bone.  The gist is they thought the knife was a fake. Thus,\nthe point is the woman stabbed herself in such a way that it scraped\nbone (sternum?rib?) in the chest area.\n\n\n"
