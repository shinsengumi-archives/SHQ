You would not \nbelieve how much &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; sake is on the market. Saitou I am \nsure would have been pleased. LOL\n\nI am not so sure how Hijikata would have felt about being stuck on a \nbag of pickles in soy sauce...\n\nAlso, I am hoping to have this done in time for the SHQ&#39;s one year \nanniversary, but I am currently working on a report about Ishida \nSanyaku. This was the medicine that Hijikata used to wander about \nselling. Rumor has it that it was also used to treat the injuries of \nthe Shinsengumi. I won&#39;t tell anything about it here, but I will give \nyou some idea of what the report will discuss:\n\n-Will mention that there were in fact TWO medicines that Hijikata \nsold.\n-How the medicine was used, what it was used for, and where did \nHijikata go to sell it.\n-Information about the plant the medicine comes from: name, blooming \nseason, where it likes to grow, etc.\n-How Ishida Sanyaku was made: what time of year it was gathered and \nthe process by which it was turned into medicine.\n-The creature that supposedly taught the family how to make it. What \nexactly is a kappa? \n\nI had already heard of kappa long before I knew about the Hijikata \nfamily&#39;s connection to the water imp. However I was very surprised by \na bit of info that turned up during my research. As has been stated \non this list in the past, saying that a kappa had taught them the \nsecret was just an advertising gimmick, but my research into the \ncritter was very revealing about why this particular supernatural \nbeing was chosen...\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
