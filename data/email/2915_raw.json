To pin the timing of reformation on one even involving one \nclan  I =\r\nthink is much too simplistic.\n\nI still haven&#39;t finished Albert Craig&#39;s work=\r\n, but his work along \nwith Thomas Huber&#39;s gives a good illustration of poli=\r\ntics within \nChoshu and the conflict between the conservative pro-Bakufu el=\r\nements \nand the liberal pro-Emperor elements.  (These works are still both =\r\n\navailable in most academic libraries and on amazon.com if someone is \ninte=\r\nrested in pursuing them. And if so - feel free to ping me should \nyou devel=\r\nop any summaries you wish to be shared , archived, etc. on \nhttp://red-bird=\r\n.org/meiji)\n\nThomas M. Huber. The Revolutionary Origins of Modern Japan -- =\r\n\nStanford Unviersity Press, 1981. \nAlbert Craig. Choshu in the Meiji Restor=\r\nation, Lexington Press, 2000.\n\nI have a suspicion that Huber might have mad=\r\ne some arguments \nregarding the timing of massive changes in the political =\r\nscene in \nhis work, but would have to go back and look at this more closely=\r\n.\n\nAs for Ikedaya - there also seems to be little mention of it in \nCraig&#39;s=\r\n work or elsewhere.  The only reference someone was able to \nfind after tra=\r\nnslating some of the Japanese sites committed to \nlooking at the students o=\r\nf the Shoin jinja (where many of the \nyounger reformists studied or passed =\r\nthrough), is that had Yoshida \nToshimaro not perished in relation to that e=\r\nvent, more than likely \nhe would have been a key political figure in the Me=\r\niji government \n(as would have others from Choshu).\n\n\nHope this is helpful.=\r\n.. \nS\n\n\n\n\n\n"
