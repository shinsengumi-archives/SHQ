However, the Okita Rintaro article (\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okita_Rintaro)\n&gt; is not ready yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Wikipedia doesn&#39;t use the MLA-like &quot;(author, page #)&quot; format so I&#39;ve\n&gt; only listed 2\n&gt; major references. (Other Shinsengumi/Okita books, of course, contain a lot\n&gt; of the same\n&gt; info. Though, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to list all of them on the\n&gt; article page at this\n&gt; point.)\n&gt;\n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt;\n&gt; PS. Here&#39;s the Okita article with &quot;(author, page #.)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita Soji\n&gt; From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita Soji (?? ??), (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the\n&gt; first troop of\n&gt; the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate\n&gt; period. He was\n&gt; a well-known genius swordsman, being one of the strongest out of the\n&gt; Shinsengumi,\n&gt; along with Saito Hajime and Nagakura Shinpachi.\n&gt;\n&gt; Contents\n&gt; 1 Background\n&gt; 2 Shinsengumi Period\n&gt; 3 Death\n&gt; 4 Trivia\n&gt; 5 References\n&gt; 6 Okita in Fiction\n&gt;\n&gt; Background\n&gt; He was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a\n&gt; samurai family\n&gt; in the Shirakawa- han&#39;s Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His\n&gt; Great-grandfather was Okita\n&gt; Kan&#39;emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His\n&gt; father, Okita\n&gt; Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907)\n&gt; and Okita Kin\n&gt; (1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita\n&gt; family, Okita Rintaro\n&gt; (1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of\n&gt; Kondo Shusuke\n&gt; in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and\n&gt; Okita started\n&gt; training at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time,\n&gt; Kondo Shusuke had\n&gt; already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijikata\n&gt; Toshizo had not\n&gt; yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy\n&gt; and attained\n&gt; Menkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 -\n&gt; p.11)\n&gt;\n&gt; In 1861, Okita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he\n&gt; was often\n&gt; commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he\n&gt; was also\n&gt; known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori,\n&gt; p.27 - p.28)\n&gt;\n&gt; According to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) and Satou Shun&#39;sen\n&gt; (Satou\n&gt; Higokorou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high\n&gt; cheekbones, a\n&gt; wide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he was known\n&gt; as a man who\n&gt; smiled and laughed well (not very talkative, however.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Shinsengumi Period\n&gt; Okita changed his name to Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before\n&gt; his departure\n&gt; to Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and\n&gt; a\n&gt; Fukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou,\n&gt; also a\n&gt; practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the\n&gt; Shinchougumi (the\n&gt; Shinsengumi&#39;s brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, with Todo\n&gt; Heisuke being\n&gt; the youngest. He was one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa\n&gt; Kamo (one of\n&gt; the original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro\n&gt; assassinations in\n&gt; 1863. (Oji, p.132)\n&gt;\n&gt; Equally skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his signature\n&gt; technique was\n&gt; named the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (which translates as &quot;Three Piece\n&gt; Thrust&quot;), a\n&gt; technique that could attack one&#39;s neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder\n&gt; with one strike.\n&gt; (the Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but\n&gt; this is most\n&gt; likely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention\n&gt; and it could\n&gt; have been derived from an invention of Hijikata&#39;s (the Hirazuki.)\n&gt;\n&gt; It was rumored that his tuberculosis was discovered when he coughed blood\n&gt; and fainted\n&gt; during the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say that he contracted the\n&gt; disease after that.\n&gt; Both are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very\n&gt; slowly (many years).\n&gt; While many of the Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaru was\n&gt; killed by Okita\n&gt; during the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction), it is in\n&gt; fact historically\n&gt; inaccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)\n&gt;\n&gt; Based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction, many also believe that Okita and\n&gt; Hijikata were like\n&gt; brothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared\n&gt; a brotherly\n&gt; relationship with. Yamanami&#39;s seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865\n&gt; was an\n&gt; extremely painful incident in Okita&#39;s short life. (Mori, p.78) There is no\n&gt; record showing\n&gt; that Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got\n&gt; along with\n&gt; Hijikata.\n&gt;\n&gt; In 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and\n&gt; also served as a\n&gt; kenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by\n&gt; Kondo Isami to be\n&gt; the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)\n&gt;\n&gt; Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana\n&gt; called Kikuichi-\n&gt; monji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a\n&gt; wakizashi) and\n&gt; his so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo\n&gt; instead. (Oji, 96)\n&gt;\n&gt; Death\n&gt; During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of\n&gt; Keiou 4, Okita went\n&gt; into Matsumoto Ryoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a\n&gt; guesthouse\n&gt; with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate\n&gt; forces (including\n&gt; the Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region,\n&gt; Okita remained in\n&gt; Edo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May\n&gt; 30th), 1868. Later\n&gt; that night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present Tokyo),\n&gt; under his birth name\n&gt; (with Okita Souji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is\n&gt; not open to the\n&gt; public. (Oji, p.252)\n&gt;\n&gt; The information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that\n&gt; he was born\n&gt; in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in\n&gt; 1868 (or on a\n&gt; lesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and\n&gt; therefore was\n&gt; 25 by Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Trivia\n&gt; It is historical accurate that Okita loved children. Duing his time in\n&gt; Kyoto, he was often\n&gt; seen playing with children and was a baby-sitter to Yagi&#39;s sons in the\n&gt; Mibu temple. (Oji,\n&gt; p.100)\n&gt;\n&gt; He was not particularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved\n&gt; sweets.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)\n&gt;\n&gt; Aside from being treated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku\n&gt; (medicine for\n&gt; enervation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with\n&gt; Ishida Sanyaku for\n&gt; treating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)\n&gt;\n&gt; There has not been any evidence of an Okita photograph.\n&gt;\n&gt; References\n&gt; ? Mori, Makiko. Okita Soji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999.\n&gt; ? Oji, Kazuko. Walking with Okita Soji. Tokyo: Shin Chosha, 2003.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita in Fiction\n&gt; It is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with\n&gt; historical data about him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita is briefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga series Rurouni\n&gt; Kenshin, which\n&gt; takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. A character\n&gt; later on in the\n&gt; series, Seta S?jir?, was based on the Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi\n&gt; Keppuroku (and\n&gt; therefore, darker than the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in\n&gt; the anime/manga\n&gt; Peacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an\n&gt; episode of the anime\n&gt; GS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about\n&gt; the\n&gt; Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only\n&gt; of killing\n&gt; people (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the\n&gt; show&#39;s rendition of\n&gt; Hijikata.) Okita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru,\n&gt; which is a fictional\n&gt; story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (where\n&gt; Okita trains a\n&gt; young girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her father and older\n&gt; brother.) He is also\n&gt; depicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/manga series Shura\n&gt; no Toki,\n&gt; Okita&#39;s (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with\n&gt; a warrior from the\n&gt; Mutsu, a clan that supposedly practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a\n&gt; request from\n&gt; Okita himself from years before.\n&gt;\n&gt; His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man\n&gt; (sometimes a\n&gt; bish?nen). The Latin American dub of Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook\n&gt; Okita for a\n&gt; woman, and the Hijikata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the\n&gt; fangirls of\n&gt; Peacemaker Kurogane.\n&gt;\n&gt; While only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a\n&gt; flashback and as a\n&gt; possible ghost), Okita&#39;s (obviously) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an\n&gt; equally-obviously\n&gt; fictional unnamed wife) is one of the three main characters of the series.\n&gt;\n&gt; His three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are also very\n&gt; similar to the\n&gt; character Ukyo Tachibana from the video game series Samurai Shodown.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
