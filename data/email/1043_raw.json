You buy property spaces on a board and \ntry to own more than everyone else, charge them outrageous rental fees \nwhen they land on your spaces etc--It&#39;s American capitalism at it&#39;s \nfinest--or worst-- which is why it&#39;s been selling copies for half a \ncentury!!!  LOL\n\nCan you see it? Saitou glaring at you in the &quot;Go Directly to Jail&quot; \nspace, Boardwalk and Park place can be Nijo Castle and the Imperial \nPalace. The &quot;bad part of town&quot;spaces at the game&#39;s beginning can be \nShimabara. Instead of  railroads and utility companies and railroads \nthere can be a soba shop, fundoshi emporium, a branch of the Sheiken \nDojo and the Kyoto residences of Choshu, Satsuma and Tosa which of \ncourse no one would want to buy...You could even mix and match the \nvarious universes and toss in the Kamiya Dojo, the Aoiya and Katsu&#39;s \nnewspaper office...the possibilities are endless.\n\n-- \n\nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
