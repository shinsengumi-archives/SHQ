I am guessing \nthis is a modern depiction of the battle? But why do they 1) have the \nShinsengumi armed with rifles? and 2) Put the makoto symbol on the \nback of their haori?\n\nPerhaps the symbol is just meant to identify them? But I am just not \nunderstanding about the guns...\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
