I had just forgotten about it for a moment. I have a valid excuse though. I was still half-asleep. The brain wasn&#39;t working correctly yet.\n\nBut you have to remember that Miki didn&#39;t go LOOKING for Nagakura. It was a chance meeting. They just both happened to be in Kyoto at the same time and Miki spotted him.\n\nI figure they might have wrote letters if they had any sort of friendship at all. Unfortunately we have no evidence that the two of them were close even when they were in the Shinsengumi together. Remember what Serizawa told us about Saito and Okita not really being as good a friends as they&#39;re made to seem sometimes? But what I&#39;m talking about is meeting face to face. I assume the expense of travelling could have played some role in this. However with us running across constant references to Shinsengumi family members feeling as if they were under threat, I just wondered if they might have been afraid of meeting openly?\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
