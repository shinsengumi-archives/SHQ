You get to go to Aizu ^_^\nI have read of the Aizu fall festival here\nhttp://8614.teacup.com/hijikata/bbs\nif you attend the commemorative ceremony for Saitou Hajme please\nreport to us every detail!  I am very interested in the cultural or\nreligious aspects.\nFor people who are new to SHQ, Aizu has a fall festival every year\ndedicated to the bravery of the people who defended their home.  You\ncan view pictures here http://www.linkclub.or.jp/~swing/ insert the\nlink into http://www.nifty.com/globalgate if you cannot read Japanese.\n\nsecretarytocapt3\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumidb.com\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, ktamae@a... wrote:\n&gt; I think now other people have given much info about spots in Aizu.\n&gt; Personally, I&#39;m planning to go to Aizu on September at the occasion\nof the \n&gt; Aizu autumn festival and probably attending Saito Hajime\ncommemorative ceremony \n&gt; which will be hold exceptionally on 25 Sep this year.(And seeing\nKoji Yamamoto \n&gt; as Hijikata in costume parade, I hope he wears that western suit...) \n&gt; \n&gt; I wish visit most famous spots there and if I can find more info,\nI&#39;ll post \n&gt; that.\n&gt; And I&#39;ll indeed post the report here or SHQ site with photos. As for\nthe \n&gt; gravestone, I&#39;ll think over to find the best way to share with you\nguys. \n&gt; I&#39;d like to respect those people&#39;s soul and I wont forget a prayer\nwhen I&#39;ll \n&gt; visit the place, however personally I think their gravestones have also \n&gt; historical value and it would be regrettable if I wont show them for\nyou who having \n&gt; real interest in these people&#39;s lives.\n&gt; Any suggestion or opinion about this are welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa san\n&gt; I&#39;m not Aizu people, living mostly in Tokyo when I&#39;m in Japan.\n&gt; \n&gt; And more OT staff for all\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if you are watching the olympic game, but if you have\nthe chance \n&gt; to see the final of synchronized swimming, in free routine section, my \n&gt; compatriot will show the performance which has the theme of\n&quot;Bushido&quot;, apparently \n&gt; inspired by &quot;Last Samurai&quot;. It will start within one hour or so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; (still crying for NHK Yamanami)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
