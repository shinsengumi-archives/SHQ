In looking for terms for sec=\r\nretarytocapt3 to use, I went back to two articles, one on Sagara and the on=\r\ne we recently had babelfished on Suzuki --- and found a connection that app=\r\nears to be prior to the Itou Affair.  The problem is the babelfish translat=\r\nion is impossible for me to decipher WHAT is being talked about.\n \nOn Dr. F=\r\nangLang&#39;s Pavement article on Sagara (http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4081/c=\r\nolj102.html ):\n \n&quot;In 1863, he worked as a follower of Mito Clan at Tsukuba-=\r\nsan Mountain Riot.  But he had to leave Mito Clan.  Thereafter he worked as=\r\n a follower of Mr. Takamori Saigou from Satsuma Clan.&quot;\n \nFrom the babelfish=\r\ned &quot;Three Trees Saburo&quot; article (http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Cosmo=\r\ns/4774/page015.html --- I hope):\n \n&quot;But because the will chiku is exactly c=\r\nlose from the Tsukuba mountain, you worry, it meaning that circumstances ar=\r\ne not attached, as looked at the will chiku, you ask to Miki.  Entering Mik=\r\ni and Tsuchiura, when lunch is taken with the hotel, it could happen to be =\r\npresent the heaven =8B=E7 party, but ignoring, it enters to the will chiku =\r\nquickly in the basket.  It enters to the will chiku, when it is critical th=\r\nrough Kawamata of the uncle, in order to do poor ability, it requests the e=\r\nffect which comes from Edo to the feudal clan.&quot;\n \nMasayoshi & Serizawa Kamo=\r\n --- what can I offer in exchange for getting the Suzuki article translated=\r\n into understandable English????  It&#39;s hard to know what to search for on t=\r\nhis guy (Suzuki) by what babelfish spits out.\n \nphil (the confused)\n\n\t\t\n---=\r\n------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
