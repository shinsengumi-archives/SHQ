There is a VERY basic htm document in this \nfolder.  The document has only general information because...\n \n1) it will be more easy to translate into another language\n2) many sites are connected to Rurouni Kenshin, Peace Maker \nKurogane, or NHK Shinsengumi! and often the focus is not necessarily \nhistory\n\nIf anyone would like to translate the document into another language \nthen please go ahead and upload it into the folder thereby making \nyour work available to others.\n\nThe goal is to provide fans in another country a solid \n*starting*point* for their own research. \n\n-----------------------------------------\nHajimenokizu:\nLast but not the least... Does anyone know what the following videos\nare and what they are about? I&#39;ve never seen them before. Apologies\nif they&#39;ve been discussed before.\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/mg_batt/shinsenanime.jpg\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/mg_batt/oldshinsenmovie.jpg\n\nI&#39;ve seen both videos on Japanese sites before but there was no link \nto Amazon for the anime one.  If only they put names by each \ncharacter!  We can guess Okita is the one with the pacifier (^_^).\n\nI thought the oldshinsenmovie was available on Amazon.co.jp as a dvd \nset\n\n\n\n"
