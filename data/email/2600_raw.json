Two Shinsengumi, one=\r\n is clearly Okita\nSouji and another Kondou Isami? make cameo appearances in=\r\n this\nextremely episodic art film featuring multiple dimensions, vengeful\ng=\r\nhosts, images of modern wars, strong sexuality, hell and time travel\nwhich =\r\nexamines the nature of VIOLENCE and the irrationality of seeking\njustice (y=\r\nou shall be treated with screams of TENCHU often too). The\ntwo Shinsengumi =\r\nand the main character have a little scuffle on a\nmodern highway. Our boys,=\r\n completely oblivious that their magical\nappearance caused a truck to swerv=\r\ne off the road, then deliver some\ninteresting philosophical lines before gi=\r\nving the &quot;hero&quot; some trouble.\n The Shinsengumi fight scene happens to be th=\r\ne best choreographed.\nInterestingly, another scene in the film takes Izo ba=\r\nck to the\nBakumatsu where he fights hordes of black clad special ops milita=\r\nry\nmen from modern times, and in another scene Edo era cops, doshin and\nthe=\r\n hero fight in a modern setting. This film is not for everyone\nespecially i=\r\nf the only calm scene involves elementary school kids\ngiving thought provok=\r\ning definitions on nation and democracy shortly\nbefore the hero massacres t=\r\nhe school staff. Many of the &quot;aristocrats&quot;\nthe target of Izo, purposefully =\r\nresemble notorious figures in Japanese\nhistory. The film also stars NHK Shi=\r\nnsengumi&#39;s Harada Sanosuke,\nYamamoto Taro as a cleaver wielding, real estat=\r\ne selling vampire.\n\n*fortunately after seeing this film I erased the image =\r\nof gallons of\nblood from my brain with the witty masterpiece POM POKO (The =\r\nRacoon\nWArs) from STudio Ghibli\n-------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n[Tokio fans keep reading]\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq=\r\n.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\nsome new stuff\n=95  do an edit &quot;find&quot; in your inte=\r\nrent browser for &quot;diamond&quot; to see the\nschool song presented to the school b=\r\ny the Meiji Empress\n=95  do and edit &quot;find&quot; in your internet browser for &quot;p=\r\nrovisional&quot; to\nread a detailed account of Nara Women&#39;s Normal School dorm--=\r\n-Nara was\nthe sister school of Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal school, thus the schedu=\r\nle of\nboth school would be similar if not exactly the same\n=95  BRAND NEW S=\r\nECTION &quot;Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School in the world of fiction&quot;\n=95  BRAND NEW=\r\n SECTION &quot;Forbidden Books&quot;\n=95  Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School and ROKUMEIKAN =\r\nsee the chronology year\n1886 and look for the novelist ***Miyake Kaho and n=\r\note the interaction\nbetween males and females which was allowed before the =\r\nschool was\nasked to stop.
