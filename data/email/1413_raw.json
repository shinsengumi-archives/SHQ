Does Jo Odagiri have a large \npart in it?\n&gt; \n\nIf you see this movie only for Odagiri for an aim, it may very be \ntedium the first half of a movie. Furthermore, you will be irritated \nby the childishness of the heroine&#39;s words if you can understand \nJapanese. \nBut I think that Odagiri&#39;s performance is comparatively good. \nWhat he is playing is the samurai who likes the murder of the name \nof Bijyomaru. Incidentally the portion of &quot;Bijyo&quot; in a name means a \nbeautiful woman.  \nHe wears a pure white kimono, speaks about the words which a woman \nuses, and does feminine behavior. \nAlthough he does not seem to be a homosexual, he is surrounded by \nhooligans and receives indecent word. ^^;;;\nThe fight of a sword is also comparatively good. \nHowever, as I wrote before, to those who like a legitimate classic \nsword fight play, it is disreputable. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
