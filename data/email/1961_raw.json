Me = curious\nSorry. I&#39;m talking about the &quot;kinshin&quot; episode where he, Ito, and Nagakura \nwere all punished for breaking curfew. Saitou had to spend like 2 or 3 days in \nHijikata&#39;s room, persumably without talking. You might have read about that on \nthe messageboard?\n\nAh! Well in that case I imagine the entries may have looked something like:\n\nDay 1: I will finish this entry elsewhere as I cannot concentrate. Saitou-kun is sitting at the very edge of my vision and is fidgeting constantly. I swear he&#39;s doing it on purpose.\n\nDay 2: Was this meant to be punishment for Saitou or for me? I got *no* sleep last night. He was staring at me all the time. Very annoying. \n\nDay 3: Finally got rid of my unwanted tenant. Celebrated by taking out poetry book and jotting down a few haiku (couldn&#39;t do that before as he might see where I hide it). \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
