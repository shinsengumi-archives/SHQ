Yaeko\n&gt; used a rifle, and outdid everyone in &quot;masculine braveness&quot; (?),\n&gt; fighting side by side with the men. She tried cutting off her hair\n&gt; with her wakizashi (short sword), but (comment: a little weird after\n&gt; this. Not quite sure what&#39;s going on) it is said that &quot;Takagi\n&gt; Morinosuke&#39;s elder sister Tokio cut her (Yaeko&#39;s) hair&quot;.\n\n\n"
