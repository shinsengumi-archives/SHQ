This is incredible information about Saito Kazuma! It certainly \nmade=\r\n my head spin.

I=\r\n have \nnot even thought of studying on Mr. Takamine, but after this, I \nser=\r\niously want to know who this man is that trusted Saito with so \nmany confid=\r\nential areas of his life.  What was their relationship and \nwhat made them =\r\nso compatible.  Oh, if only I could be a fly on the \nwall back then, can yo=\r\nu imagine the conversations I&#39;d overhear?\n\nThank you so much for your resea=\r\nrch, and for sharing it with those of \nus who mentally &#39;live&#39; during that t=\r\nime.  This is precious \ninformation and I for one, am drinking it down like=\r\n a fish that had \nbeen out of water way too long!  Ahhhhhhh *burp*  So good=\r\n!\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Dear SHQ members,\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that perhaps the megaupload file (which en=\r\nded in .docx may \nhave\n&gt; given some of you problems in viewing the file so =\r\nI have attached \nthe\n&gt; file in its entirety below (a the very bottom).\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I would also like to present more evidence, as resaerched by Mr.\n&gt; Bakalia=\r\nn which does much to confirm our assertion that Saito Hajime\n&gt; did not have=\r\n 5 names, but 6---and that he came up with the 6th \nbecause\n&gt; he insisted o=\r\nn speaking on behalf of a friend---a very good friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; {new additional=\r\n evidence}\n&gt; &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; calls himself an Aizu samurai\n&gt; -- according to=\r\n Saito Hajime no subete, in the Meiji Era, Fujita \nGoro\n&gt; was registered (o=\r\nn records) as formerly an Aizu samurai\n&gt; \n&gt; -- the most powerful detail eme=\r\nrged from an acquaintance of mine who\n&gt; graciously provided a key word and =\r\nthat is SAitou Kazuma knew the\n&gt; Takamine family since their &quot;Sannohe&quot; days=\r\n.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sannohe is located in Northern Japan which was where hundreds of \n=\r\nAizu\n&gt; families were exiled (or travelled to--to reunite with family). \n&gt; A=\r\nmongst those samurai included Ichinohe Denpachi who soon changed \nhis\n&gt; nam=\r\ne to Fujita Goro.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sannohe is a district.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gonohe is a town.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe Kurasawa family lived in Gonohe.  The Kurasawa shared their home\n&gt; with =\r\nFujita Goro.  This is a well known fact amongst Japanese\n&gt; Shinsengumi rese=\r\narchers.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; who knew the Takamine family f=\r\nrom \ntheir\n&gt; time in Sannohe has the SAME biography as SAITOU HAJIME (FUJIT=\r\nA \nGORO).\n&gt; \n&gt; Which members of the Takamine family did &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; mee=\r\nt in\n&gt; Sannohe?  He met Takamine&#39;s mother, and brothers (who were young\n&gt; c=\r\nhildren).  Takamine Hideo (Tadayoshi) himself was a POW in \nEdo/Tokyo.\n&gt;  T=\r\nhe narrative of the Takamine family has partly been preserved in \nthe\n&gt; dia=\r\nry of a Swiss immigrant (professor of Oswego Normal School).  In\n&gt; short, &quot;=\r\nSaitou Kazuma&quot; knew the Takamine family when they faced\n&gt; incredible hardsh=\r\nip, so much so that they adopted one of their \nyounger\n&gt; sons to another Ai=\r\nzu family.  Saitou Kazuma knew this family well\n&gt; before they prospered in =\r\nthe Meiji Era.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, we feel somewhat our theory has blossomed into so=\r\nmething more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you to Mr. Bakalian for doing this work.\n&gt; As I ha=\r\nve always known, Takamine and Fujita were truly good friends,\n&gt; even though=\r\n they were 10 years apart and came from different \nbackgrounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope=\r\n they are enjoying a drink now, wherever they may be.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; THE MYSTERY OF SAITO KAZUMA\n&gt; By Armen Bakalian \n&gt; with note=\r\ns by secretarytocapt3\n&gt; \n&gt; FACTS:  \n&gt; Takamine Hideo was the cousin of Taka=\r\ngi/Fujita Tokio\n&gt; Fujita Goro very likely found employment in the Education=\r\n Museum\n&gt; (years on the job 1891-1899) through the assistance of Takamine (=\r\nwho\n&gt; had a leadership role in the Imperial Museum, and Educational Museum\n=\r\n&gt; which was affiliated with the Normal School he also managed).  \n&gt; Fujita =\r\nGoro was employed at the Tokyo (Higher) Women&#39;s Normal School\n&gt; (years on t=\r\nhe job 1899-1909) through petitions by both Takagi\n&gt; Morinusuke (his brothe=\r\nr-in-law) and Takamine Hideo.\n&gt; A mystery is unfolding.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the reminis=\r\ncences collected in: Furoku: Tsuikai Danso of/about \nthe\n&gt; educator Takamin=\r\ne Hideo, three is one reminiscence, titled &quot;Ko\n&gt; Takamine Hideo-kun&quot; (The L=\r\nate Mr. Takamine Hideo) pages 5 to 7, \npenned\n&gt; by one &quot;Saito Kazuma, forme=\r\nr Aizu retainer.&quot; This would be \ninherently\n&gt; worth something, except when =\r\nyou consider the following (note:\n&gt; Japanese kanji follow):\n&gt; \n&gt; &#25993;&#=\r\n34276;&#19968; Saito Hajime\n&gt; &#25993;&#34276;&#19968;&#39340; Saito Kazuma=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a difference of one kanji between this man&#39;s name and the\n&gt; =\r\nname of the Shinsengumi captain, Saito Hajime. Nowhere in the text, \nor\n&gt; i=\r\nn the entirety of &quot;Takamine Hideo Sensei-den&quot; (especially the\n&gt; chapter(s) =\r\non Aizu), does it have any mention of this man; and it\n&gt; certainly does not=\r\n say anything about him being of the Shinsengumi.\n&gt; However, it also doesn&#39;=\r\nt disprove his potentially being Saito Hajime\n&gt; of the Shinsengumi. Saito H=\r\najime, at the time of Takamine Hideo&#39;s\n&gt; death, used the name Fujita Goro; =\r\nhowever, let us consider the \nfacts:\n&gt; this is a collection of writings in =\r\ntribute to one of the greatest\n&gt; educators in modern Japanese history.\n&gt; Fu=\r\njita Goro was a traffic cop, museum guard, and sword appraiser to\n&gt; Takamin=\r\ne and personal friend; would the writings of such a low-\nranking\n&gt; man fit =\r\nalongside the tributes penned by Shinoda Toshihide, Yasui\n&gt; Tetsu, Baron Ku=\r\nki Ryuichi, and the women who undertook high-level\n&gt; roles in the Tokyo Wom=\r\nen&#39;s Normal School? In the modern day, would a\n&gt; book of reminiscences of a=\r\n school or university president include \nthe\n&gt; words of the gateman? Perhap=\r\ns it is just my opinion, but the answer \nis no.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, Fujita Goro d=\r\noes have a way of putting his words alongside\n&gt; everyone else&#39;s: his Aizu c=\r\nonnection. He may not have been born in\n&gt; Aizu, but he was adopted into its=\r\n community, married the daughter of\n&gt; an Aizu samurai, and spilled blood fo=\r\nr its people. He had as much a\n&gt; right as anyone to call himself an Aizu sa=\r\nmurai. Furthermore, &quot;Saito\n&gt; Kazuma&quot; does what no one else in Furoku dares =\r\nto do: brings up, at\n&gt; length, Takamine&#39;s Aizu connection, his conduct in t=\r\nhe Boshin War, \nand\n&gt; his continued devotion to his former lord&#39;s family. O=\r\nthers perhaps\n&gt; mention Takamine&#39;s origins briefly, but pass over them quic=\r\nkly; \nafter\n&gt; all, at the time of Takamine&#39;s death, Aizu was still stigmati=\r\nzed \nunder\n&gt; the false label of &quot;enemy of the throne.&quot;\n&gt; It is not until 19=\r\n28, the Imperial wedding between Matsudaira \nSetsuko\n&gt; and Prince Chichibu =\r\n(brother of Emperor Hirohito) did Aizu\n&gt; &quot;officially&quot; return into good grac=\r\nes to the national narrative.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; be, in fact, the ra=\r\nther taciturn(1) Saito \nHajime,\n&gt; writing under a slightly, yet cleverly al=\r\ntered pseudonym? Could the\n&gt; old warrior have broken his silence for Takami=\r\nne Hideo? While there \nis\n&gt; as yet no definite &quot;yes&quot; answer to that questio=\r\nn, there is also no\n&gt; definite &quot;no.&quot; However, when considering even some of=\r\n the points\n&gt; covered by Ko Takamine Hideo-kun, the facts line up a little =\r\ntoo\n&gt; neatly for this to be mere coincidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; has intimate kn=\r\nowledge of the events concerning Takamine&#39;s\n&gt; school. Fujita Goro was an em=\r\nployee of the school.(2)\n&gt; \n&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; devotes great length to praising Tak=\r\namine&#39;s art collection.\n&gt; Takamine, who relied on Saito for sword appraisal=\r\n, gave Saito\n&gt; unrestricted access to the art collection in his LOCKED stor=\r\nehouse.\n(3)\n&gt; \n&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s sons came to Tak=\r\namine&#39;s\n&gt; house for tutoring. Firstly, the Matsudaira children, as sons of =\r\na\n&gt; former daimyo, would not be taken just anywhere; secondly, \nfor &quot;Saito&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; to know of this point, regarding the still maligned Matsudaira\n&gt; Katamor=\r\ni&#39;s family, shows that he was trusted. Fujita Goro spent a\n&gt; great deal of =\r\ntime visiting Takamine&#39;s house.(4) After all, Fujita\n&gt; received the name Fu=\r\njita Goro from Matsudaira Katamori himself.\n&gt; *&quot;Saito&#39;s own oldest son, Fuj=\r\nita Tsutomu, was friends with \nMatsudaira\n&gt; Tsuneo.  Ofcourse Saito would k=\r\nnow if any one of the Matsudaira boys\n&gt; spent time at Takamine&#39;s home.  Aft=\r\ner all, his own sons probably did\n&gt; as well.  We know that Takamine&#39;s own d=\r\naughter frequently visited \nthe\n&gt; Fujita home.\n&gt; \n&gt; *&quot;Saito&quot; knows that Tak=\r\namine talked about the Matsudaira family to \nhis\n&gt; Aizu friend Kusaka Yoshi=\r\no (Onetime governor of Nagasaki and \nFukushima\n&gt; Prefectures), and &quot;shed si=\r\nncere tears.&quot; Historical records suggest\n&gt; that Takamine almost never spoke=\r\n openly about Aizu, though he was in\n&gt; charge of the former retainers&#39; asso=\r\nciation; consequently, \nfor &quot;Saito&quot;\n&gt; to know of Takamine speaking about Ai=\r\nzu, and speaking emotionally\n&gt; about Aizu, shows his level of trust. Fujita=\r\n Goro, as stated above,\n&gt; often came to the Takamine house, and when he cam=\r\ne, would always \ndrink\n&gt; sake(5). Those who know the Japanese culture of sa=\r\nke know that you\n&gt; don&#39;t just randomly invite someone to your house and let=\r\n them drink\n&gt; alone; first of all, for Fujita to be trusted to the point of=\r\n being\n&gt; allowed to *always* drink sake at the Takamine house suggests that=\r\n \nhe\n&gt; might have witnessed such discussions about the past. Fujita often\n&gt;=\r\n spoke of the past to Yamakawa Kenjiro, another prominent Aizu \nnative,\n&gt; s=\r\no it is not unreasonable to think that he may have spoken of the \npast\n&gt; to=\r\n Takamine, as well. Kenjiro&#39;s brother Hiroshi, during his tenure \nas\n&gt; pres=\r\nident of the Normal School (while Takamine was still there), is\n&gt; believed =\r\nto have been the one who recommended Fujita for employment;\n&gt; an overlap be=\r\ntween Fujita&#39;s discussions with Kenjiro and Fujita&#39;s\n&gt; discussions with Tak=\r\namine Hideo is not at all unreasonable.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Aizu natives who are on re=\r\ncord as having associated or been in\n&gt; close proximity to Takamine are all =\r\nfamilies who were high-ranking\n&gt; Aizu retainers: Yamakawa, Ibuka, Takagi, N=\r\numazawa, Iinuma, \nSaigo...for\n&gt; the sake of confirmation, I have looked ove=\r\nr the casualty lists for \na\n&gt; &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; or a relation of one, in Yamak=\r\nawa Kenjiro&#39;s Hoshu \nAizu\n&gt; Byakkotai Jukyushi-den, they include: Saito Gen=\r\ngo, Saito Yukichi,\n&gt; Saito Jinzaemon, Saito Tasaburo, and Saito Tetsunosuke=\r\n. None of them\n&gt; particularly high-ranking; none of them containing any ref=\r\nerence to \na\n&gt; &quot;Saito Kazuma.&quot;(6)\n&gt; \n&gt; Notes:\n&gt; (1)Todo Toshihisa, &quot;Saito H=\r\najime Kanren Jinbutsu Jiten,&quot; pp. 193-206\n&gt; of Saito Hajime no Subete.

Hoshu Aizu Byakkotai\n&gt; Jukyushi-den. (Wakamatsu: Aizu Chorei Gikai=\r\n, 1926), pp. 46, 94-95\n&gt; Some Pros and Cons to Consider\n&gt; 1)\t Why would FUJ=\r\nITA GORO use a pseudonym?  It&#39;s unnecessary \nisn&#39;t it?\n&gt; Mr. Bakalian raise=\r\ns and important point regarding status.  In the\n&gt; Meiji Era generally you w=\r\nould invite someone honored to speak on\n&gt; behalf of the deceased.  While Fu=\r\njita was no doubt a close and\n&gt; respected friend his position cannot compar=\r\ne to many of the other\n&gt; people who contributed to Takamine&#39;s memorial/biog=\r\nraphy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, we have to think like a Japanese living in the Meiji Era=\r\n not \nas\n&gt; someone living in 2007.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another point to consider is clearl=\r\ny the fact that Saito Kazuma is \nnot\n&gt; addressing educators, he is addressi=\r\nng people of the Aizu \ncommunity. \n&gt; Therefore the name &quot;Saito&quot; may or may =\r\nnot ring a bell with people of\n&gt; that background.  &quot;Saito&quot; would mean nothi=\r\nng to many readers.  \nSimply,\n&gt; is this the coded language that comes from =\r\nliving a bit separately\n&gt; from society due to one&#39;s past Aizu connections? =\r\n Please keep in \nmind\n&gt; that there was a lot of discrimination, favoritism =\r\nand cronyism \nafter\n&gt; 1868 which was based on one&#39;s feudal hometown.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2=\r\n)\tSo how does Saito Kazuma get to write all this stuff?\n&gt; That is the bigge=\r\nst question.  The Takamine family had several\n&gt; surviving members, includin=\r\ng Takamine Hideo&#39;s aged mother (who was\n&gt; close to Tokio and no doubt knew =\r\nFujita Goro VERY WELL), Takamine&#39;s\n&gt; 2nd, 3rd son, and 2 daughters.  Why wo=\r\nuld four members of the \nTakamine\n&gt; family let some strange person write al=\r\nl of this?  Clearly Saito\n&gt; Kazuma is someone they knew and trusted very we=\r\nll\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)\tWho else oversaw the publication?\n&gt; Yamakawa Kenjiro&#39;s name appe=\r\nars at the end of the book as likely a\n&gt; financial contributor to its publi=\r\ncation.  He was also a mutual \nfriend\n&gt; of Fujita and Takamine and a major =\r\nfigure in the post 1868 Aizu\n&gt; network.  Again we ask, if Yamakawa proofrea=\r\nd this work he had to \nknow\n&gt; who Saito Kazuma was and like the Takamine fa=\r\nmily, was &quot;ok&quot; with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4)\tWait a minute!  Takamine&#39;s book was publish=\r\ned in 1921 !  \nFujita\n&gt; Goro was DEAD ALREADY in 1915!  He could not have w=\r\nritten anything.\n&gt; This is obviously a question which needs to be answered.=\r\n  Takamine\n&gt; died in 1910, however his memorial was not published for a dec=\r\nade. \n&gt; Japanese frequently publish memorial even years after the person ha=\r\ns\n&gt; died (they do so to fall on certain Buddhist anniversaries).  It is\n&gt; n=\r\not strange for a friend to prepare statements which are published\n&gt; later o=\r\nn behalf of the deceased.  Most interestingly even some of\n&gt; Takamine&#39;s spe=\r\neches were published years after he died (for the \nfirst\n&gt; time).  Furtherm=\r\nore, the words of Saito Kazuma may in fact be the\n&gt; polished narrative assi=\r\nsted by Fujita Tokio (admittedly a very well\n&gt; educated of the feudal era A=\r\nND knew Takamine when he was still just \na\n&gt; teenager as well).\n&gt; \n&gt; Tokio =\r\nwas alive when this project had already started (she died in\n&gt; 1921). Even =\r\nthough she may have retired from the Higher Women&#39;s \nNormal\n&gt; School (we do=\r\n not have the start or end dates of her employment\n&gt; there), she was close =\r\nto campus and likely &quot;hung out&quot; there to help\n&gt; out or just be nosy. In doi=\r\nng so she could easily be found. We must\n&gt; also remember that Tokio was Tak=\r\namine&#39;s cousin and they knew each\n&gt; other since 1868 while serving in the c=\r\nastle.\n&gt; \n&gt; To prove that Saito Kazuma is NOT Fujita Goro:\n&gt; 1)\tFind a real=\r\n Aizu retainer who was named Saito Kazuma.  At \nthis time\n&gt; we have not yet=\r\n found a retainer with that name after searching\n&gt; through more well known =\r\nAizu history books (which do include lists \nof\n&gt; names).  Perhaps one would=\r\n have to go to a library in Aizu Wakamatsu\n&gt; to find this man.\n&gt; 2)\tFind an=\r\n educator, artist, scientist who was an Aizu associate \nof\n&gt; Takamine with =\r\nthe name Saito Kazuma.\n&gt; I, secretarytocapt3, have spent nearly 3 intense y=\r\nears studying\n&gt; Takamine Hideo from various research angles.  I have never =\r\nfound the\n&gt; name of an educator, Aizu connections or not, with the name &quot;Sa=\r\nito\n&gt; Kazuma&quot;.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
