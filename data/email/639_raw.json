The story \nhappens a few =\r\nyears before the Bakumatsu, although the specific time \nis not given.\n\nIn t=\r\nhose volumes, the main characters have to leave their province \nto go to an=\r\nother one, and they can&#39;t pass the check points if they \ndon&#39;t have the rig=\r\nht authorisations provided by an official. \nAlthough, it seems that you cou=\r\nld try to steal someone else&#39;s \nauthorisation or you could go through the c=\r\nheck points without \nshowing any papers if your house was located near the =\r\nborder. \n\nSuch people could hence come and go freely. Apparently, still \nac=\r\ncording to &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot;, these citizens could also try \nto help =\r\n, in exchange of money, others to cross the border, \npretending that they w=\r\nere their nephew or brother in law, and help \nthem get through the check po=\r\nints without having to provide any \npapers. But it was very risky=85\n\nBut a=\r\npparently, as long as you remained on the same side of the \nborder, no one =\r\nwould ever ask you your papers. So, the risky thing \nwas mainly the check p=\r\noints.\n\nThat&#39;s what you can see in &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot;, but I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw \nif the information is 100% reliable.\n\nMary-Ann (^-^)\n\n\n\n"
