An argument like this is like saying \n&gt;Kondo and the Shogun had slumber parties as children because there&#39;s \n&gt;no documentation saying they weren&#39;t friends, or that there weren&#39;t \n&gt;any slumber parties in Japan, yet both were in Edo during that time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t think it&#39; s poor reasoning at all. While Kondou wouldn&#39;t have \nbeen in the same &quot;social circle&quot; as the Shogun it&#39;s quite in the realm \nof possibility that he knew or knew of other prominent political \nactivists/figures. \n\nI say this because I have met quite a number of &quot;important people&quot; in \nthe writing world through various conferences and such.  No, we&#39;re not \nbest buddies and for the most part I don&#39;t talk to many of these folks \non a regular basis but the thing we share in common does bring us \ntogether as friends and companions as many times as we  have reason and \nthe resources to gather.\n\nSo I think it&#39;s quite possible for some of these people to have run in \nthe same circles at times.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n"
