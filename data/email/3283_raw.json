Fo=\r\nr example FUjita Goro would probably keep his opinions \nwithin his circle o=\r\nf close friends and some of his Aizu related \nassociates.\n\nIn our modern ti=\r\nmes you would think that we all should be comfortable \nwith tackling these =\r\nissues as long as we were careful in citing our \nresources (to prevent plai=\r\ngiarism, encourage transparency and develop a \ntraceable paper trail), refr=\r\nain from outright lying or racism etc.\n\nIn other words we thought that if w=\r\ne maintain a degree of integrity we \nwould be &quot;safe&quot;.\n\nThis is not the case=\r\n.\n\nThere is a *B*ook about the *S*hinsengumi.  { I&#39;ll call it and the \nauth=\r\nor &quot;BS&quot; for short}\n\nI cannot name the writer of the book nor the researcher=\r\n who accurately \npointed out egregious errors in that text out of respect t=\r\no both \nparties involved.  I ask this post stay here on our mailing list as=\r\n \nwell.  \n\nThe reason is because &quot;BS&quot; exerted pressure on a separate commun=\r\nity to \nensure that the errors in the text, presented in a post, were DELET=\r\nED.\n\nThis is a good day for us fans that a researcher from our ranks \nwas &quot;=\r\nhonored&quot; to garner the attention of BS in such a way!\n\nThe writer of that p=\r\nost, in an effort to protect this community also \nasked me, a mod here, to =\r\ndelete a thread.  I deleted the thread which \nhad 21 related messages attac=\r\nhed to it.  You see who knows what BS will \ndo next?  Will BS try to intimi=\r\ndate us poor consumers of manga, anime \nand movies? (^_^) \n\nWE BOUGHT BS, W=\r\nE SUPPORTED BS, WE LINK TO BS AND YET WE CANNOT \nCRITICIZE IT?  Odd.  For B=\r\nS to blatantly &quot;fanboy&quot; over the founding of \nthe Meiji Era, this person su=\r\nre acts &quot;feudal&quot;.  Ain&#39;t that ironic?\n\nIf you go to a movie, pay for the ti=\r\ncket, watch the movie, aren&#39;t you \nallowed to praise it, slam it say it was=\r\n &quot;so-so&quot;?  \n\nI had a front row seat to a case involving free speech so yes =\r\n&quot;I get \nit&quot;, the value of the speech should not be judged, just that it sho=\r\nuld \nbe allowed.  However LIES and SLANDER and RACISM should not be \ntolera=\r\nted.  Such things should be labeled as &quot;lies, slander and racism&quot; \nand not =\r\n&quot;this is my glorious free speech&quot; in other words don&#39;t elevate \ntrash to so=\r\nmething higher.  There is a time and place for everything \nand even those w=\r\nho sell pornography put it in a place out of the reach \nof minors.  In othe=\r\nr words people exercise self-censorship.\nIs it right for BS to try to censo=\r\nr someone who OWNS THE BOOK and put \nmoney in his/her pocket?  I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk so!\n\nIn this matter, the researcher NEVER LIED NOR SLANDERED BS=85instead=\r\n the \nresearcher went point by point through a section of BS.\n\nAnd yet the =\r\nreview was SUPPRESSED by BS!\n\nIn other words a little known truth or differ=\r\ning information was \nSUPPRESSED.\n\nYou see &quot;BS&quot; (and yes I chose this acrony=\r\nm on purpose) is feeling \nawfully intimidated that someone else who can rea=\r\nd Japanese was able to \nfind errors and cases of revisionism in the work.  =\r\n\n\n&quot;BS&quot; had an intro claiming that it cannot present a wholly factual \naccou=\r\nnt.\n\nSo if someone else, a researcher, found errors in &quot;BS&quot; and also found =\r\n\nconflicting information, shouldn&#39;t BS be happy that someone was able to \na=\r\ndd to the work?\n\nNope.  BS is scared.  BS even failed to use the standard b=\r\nook in \nEnglish, Conrad Totman&#39;s COLLAPSE OF THE TOKUGAWA SHOGUNATE (which =\r\n\ndiscusses Aizu, the Shinsengumi and even the Mimawarigumi).  To even \nover=\r\nlook this book shows BS is choosing what should be presented to \nfurther a =\r\ncertain point of view.  OR BS is utterly clueless on how to \ndo research.  =\r\nTOtman&#39;s work is THE BOOK you go to about the bakufu my \nfriends. The sourc=\r\nes used for BS were remarkably limited as well given \nthe fact that there a=\r\nre in fact some interesting books written on the \nShinsengumi in Japanese.\n=\r\n\nBS was never even peered reviewed.  Look carefully, a FAMILY MEMBER \nREVIE=\r\nWED THE MANUSCRIPT (BS has a different pen name---but they are \nfamily I as=\r\nsure you).  Unless that family member has a strong command \nof the history,=\r\n or language then it would be more suited for the work \nto be reviewed by h=\r\nistorians (yes there are a couple of professors who \neven specialize in the=\r\n shogunate still very much alive).\n\nWHy was BS never peer reviewed, and why=\r\n weren&#39;t these specialists \nconsulted to suggest other sources?  Can it be =\r\nbecause BS is BS?\n\nBS was so intimidated by a review by a careful researche=\r\nr he asked and \ngot the censorship he WANTED even though he should&#39;ve argue=\r\nd with the \nJapanese texts which were cited as having different information=\r\n.\n\nBS thought it was logical to &quot;SHOOT THE MESSENGER&quot;.\n\nIn the real world, =\r\nbooks are reviewed very critically.  Anyone here who \nhas read a review of =\r\na work of non-fiction or even fiction knows that \nglowing reviews are rare.=\r\n  Usually reviews are mixed.  I guess BS is \nnot part of the real world and=\r\n has never read how academics (for the \nsake of the discipline) will point =\r\nout even the smallest errors in \nanother work (that&#39;s why it&#39;s called PEER =\r\nREVIEW).\n\nBook go through multiple printings like 1st 2nd or 3rd edition an=\r\nd the \nauthor kindly notes in the intro the correction of errors.  All this=\r\n is \ncommon practice.  Authors don&#39;t go around saying &quot;Oh no!  Someone \ncau=\r\nght my screw up=85I must ask the forum owner to delete my work.&quot;  No \nprofe=\r\nssional does this!\n\nWhat do we make of all this nonsense?\n\nIt seems to me t=\r\nhat BS cannot argue with the FACTS presented in the \nreview and chose the e=\r\nasy (or rather COWARDLY) way out: and that \nis &quot;delete it please&quot;.\n\nMy frie=\r\nnds this is just a taste of the suppression, twisting of the \ntruth and rev=\r\nisionism which has plagued not only the history of Japan \nbut of all humani=\r\nty.\n\nThe more they sweep things under the carpet, the more YOU SHOULD DO \nE=\r\nVERYTHING TO break their brooms (preferably over their heads).  (^_^) \n(I&#39;m=\r\n just kidding)\n\nAgain I really had to vent about this issue publicly becaus=\r\ne I find it \nto be very fascinating.  That person cannot get mad at me for =\r\nposting \nthis unless he/she admits that the work is in fact the referenced =\r\n&quot;BS&quot; \nI noted in the rant above. HA!\n\nI&#39;d like to hear the writer insist &quot;M=\r\ny work IS BS.  I must now try to \nscare these little fans and keep them qui=\r\net for having the brains to \nprove me wrong. DEAD WRONG.&quot;\n\nShame on this wr=\r\niter from benefiting from the $upport of Shinsengumi \nfandom and then turni=\r\nng around and attacking one of us for pulling the \nmask off this book!\n\n\n\n"
