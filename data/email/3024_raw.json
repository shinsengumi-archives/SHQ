Even some people who were on record as ronin such as Kondou originally \ncame from peasant/farmer or other backgrounds.\n\np. 254 of &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; by Oishi Manabu actually has a chart answering the \nquestion you just posed, covering at least some of the more notable members. \nIn the &quot;Commoner&quot; section, under &quot;farmers&quot;, for instance, are Inoue \nGenzaburo, Kano Michinosuke, Hijikata Toshizou, Miyagawa Shinkichi, Motoi \nKazusaburo, and Yokokura Jingoro. I know, I know, Hijikata did go around \n&quot;selling&quot; stuff (merchant), but his family had peasant/farmer roots, too.\n\nInterestingly enough, there were even some former religious figures in \nShinsengumi, such as Ando Hayataro.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
