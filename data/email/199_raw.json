I -highly- recommend \n&gt; that you read the character profiles [first] because it seems to have \nbeen \n&gt; based on a manga because the profiles contain info not mentioned \n&gt; (clearly) in the movie.  PMK Maro fans (if there are any out there--\nscary \n&gt; thought)...will find an equally twisted Ohni Hime in this film.  The film \n&gt; implies sexual content. For those of us who *appreciate* gorgeous 2D \n&gt; men, this film has 4 knights of the Defense Ministry which are \n&gt; absolutely...GQ material...and they and the women in the film are all \n&gt; drawn to look Asian.  The character design is really interesting \nbecause \n&gt; it doesn&#39;t rely on what we are used to to distinguish different \ncharacters \n&gt; (hair color etc). I&#39;m pretty surprised this film is not more widely known \n&gt; because it is ELEGANT and contains an intriguing plotline. FOUR \n&gt; STARS!!!!!\n\n\n"
