I gave it 3 stars and\neverything ::shrugs::\n\naha!  I figured out why=\r\n the title was changed to include &quot;Last\nSamurai&quot; the book turns up in searc=\r\nhes related to the Tom Cruise movie* \n\nXD\n\nlove it, hate it, or completely =\r\nneutral the book will be the only\nsource of info on the Shinsengumi for yea=\r\nrs to come\n\nhence my dismay at Hillsborough&#39;s unprofessional approach to th=\r\ne\ncontroversial group.  Let&#39;s say a serious student or researcher\nsearches =\r\nfor anything with the word &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; all they&#39;ll get is\nthis book and t=\r\nhe occasional 1 sentence mentioned in some academic\njournal article.  Thus,=\r\n writers must try to be as responsible as\npossible and think beyond their o=\r\nwn personal agenda before publishing\nanything remotely related to non-ficti=\r\non.  Hillsborough ofcourse noted\nthat his work is not entirely non-fiction =\r\n(I mentioned this in my\nreview) but that doesn&#39;t mean he shouldn&#39;t give thi=\r\ns project his best\neffort.  We all know the Shinsengumi have long since ent=\r\nered the world\nof folk tales.\n\nHillsborough was missing many many good sour=\r\nces to use for his book.\n\nas I was working on some stuff for http://www.shi=\r\nnsengumihq.com I\nturned to arguably the best book on why the shogunate syst=\r\nem\nfell...after using it for a doorstop for many months\n\nTotman, Conrad. Th=\r\ne Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu 1862-1868 Hawaii:\nThe University of Hawai=\r\ni Press, 1980. ISBN: 082480614X\n\nboth the Shinsengumi, Kondou Isami and Mim=\r\nwari (Not indexed) are\nmentioned...more importantly Totman included the end=\r\n note on Kondou&#39;s\nreport given to Kyoto officials on Oct 9 1867.  \n\nThis re=\r\nport is was reproduced in Kitahara Masanaga&#39;s book SHICHINENSHI\nprinted in =\r\n1904.\n\nsee http://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm \nd=\r\no an &#39;edit&#39; and &#39;find&#39; for &quot;Oct 9&quot;\n\nThe Shichinenshi (SNS) was used by Totm=\r\nan alongside the Dai Nihon\nIshin Shiryo kohon (Manuscript of historical mat=\r\nerials on the\nrestoration) DNISK &quot;by far the greatest collection of histori=\r\ncal\nmaterials relating to the Meiji restoration but has been almost unused\n=\r\nby western scholars&quot; (Totman 549).\n\nThe Shichinenshi was the first attempt =\r\nto understand the politics of\n1868 from the shogunate&#39;s point of view, but =\r\nmore specifically the\nside of Aizu.  Totman used SNS alongside KYOTO SHUGOS=\r\nHOKU SHIMATSU\n(the story of the Kyoto Protector) written by Yamakawa Hirosh=\r\ni printed\nby Numazawa/Numasawa Shichirou adopted father of Tokio+Goro&#39;s thi=\r\nrd son.  \n\nAgain, I can only hope that both these works (used by many\nresea=\r\nrchers) discussed Aizu&#39;s most famous security group, the\nShinsengumi.  Yama=\r\nkawa Hiroshi, an Aizu samurai, was a personal friend\nof Fujita Goro (we kno=\r\nw Hiroshi best as the guy who put Goro and Tokio\ntogether).  Hiroshi&#39;s youn=\r\nger brother, Kenjiro, wrote Aizu boshin\nsenshi (several hundred pages, perh=\r\naps in collaboration with others).\n  The &quot;status&quot; of the Shinsengumi in the=\r\nse 2 works by the Yamakawa\nbrothers should reveal some interesting details.=\r\n  AFterall both\nbrothers knew a former captain of the Shinsengumi, not to m=\r\nention\nnumerous other survivors from Aizu.\n\nAizu Beyond 1868\nhttp://www.shi=\r\nnsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\nis a study of the domain&#39;s Tokyo network,=\r\n note the publication dates\nand who was still alive to read many of the wor=\r\nks...\n\n\n\n\n"
