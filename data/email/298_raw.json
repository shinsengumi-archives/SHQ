It started=\r\n out as a manga, and the\n&gt; first story arc was made into an anime. It follo=\r\nws a \n&gt; boy named Musashi (written with the kanji for 3, 6,\n&gt; and 4) from h=\r\nis birth until young adulthood, as he\n&gt; learns kendo and tries to become th=\r\ne top kendo\n&gt; practitioner in Japan. \n&gt; \n&gt; There is one flashback scene (to=\r\n the Showa era) in\n&gt; which a swordsman named Yamamoto Chujiro is practicing=\r\n\n&gt; tsuki (thrust) on an empty can hung by a string. One\n&gt; day, an old man t=\r\nries to do it. The can doesn&#39;t even\n&gt; move, so Yamamoto thinks he missed. B=\r\nut when Yamamoto\n&gt; takes a second look at the can...he sees that the old\n&gt; =\r\nman had pierced a hole in the can without even moving\n&gt; it. It turns out th=\r\nat the old man was none other than\n&gt; Saitou Hajime himself. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; As for =\r\nwhether this has anything to do with the real\n&gt; historical Saitou, I doubt =\r\nit, but I was amused to\n&gt; find yet another reference to him in a manga or a=\r\nnime\n&gt; I&#39;ve read/seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tatsuko\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Tiffany &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; There was a post on\n&gt; &gt; www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/patio/patio.cgi\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; The title of the post is &quot;Anecdote of Late Year?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is the ba=\r\nbelfish translation...telling of an\n&gt; &gt; old Saito Hajime\n&gt; &gt; appearing in a=\r\nn anime...(Usual warning about\n&gt; &gt; babelfish)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;It meaning that nam=\r\ne of Saito one appears in the\n&gt; &gt; kendo cartoon,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;sword of 634&quot;, it doe=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; As a story of former times, the alone boy being\n&gt; &gt; Kawahara, when y=\r\nou\n&gt; &gt; practice kendo, the old person coming, you say that\n&gt; &gt; try doing th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; bamboo sword.\n&gt; &gt; It was less crowded in the string and hung the can,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; practiced\n&gt; &gt; piercing, but aiming for that can, the old person\n&gt; &gt; ex=\r\ntended the bamboo\n&gt; &gt; sword.\n&gt; &gt; But, the can does not move jerkily.\n&gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nen the boy tries seeing, you say that the hole\n&gt; &gt; opened in the can.\n&gt; &gt; Y=\r\nou say that with the bamboo sword, the can was\n&gt; &gt; carried out.\n&gt; &gt; That wa=\r\ns Saito one of late year.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With it meaning that the anecdote which =\r\nis said is\n&gt; &gt; riding, it does,\n&gt; &gt; but is this how probably what?\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\n&#65533;=A4 - the &#65533;&#65533;, you question, it\n&gt; &gt; becomes.\n&gt; &gt; Penet=\r\nrating the being less crowded can which was\n&gt; &gt; hung to the string\n&gt; &gt; with=\r\n the bamboo sword how, being possible?\n&gt; &gt; As an anecdote of Saito one, suc=\r\nh a story it has\n&gt; &gt; been effective?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a reply to the pos=\r\nt along the lines that\n&gt; &gt; it is uncertain\n&gt; &gt; whether or not this story wa=\r\ns associated with\n&gt; &gt; historical S.H.
