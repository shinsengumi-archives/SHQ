I&#39;ve been really interested in the shinsengumi ever  since I caught a brief episode of peacemaker kurogane. However, I  realize that probably a large portion of the show is made up for tv  watchers but I was hoping that somebody could give me some information\n  on them. Most sites I have been to only repeat the same thing over and over. \n  \n  \n  Well... as sad as this might sound, everything else that you&#39;ve  probably read about the Shinsengumi is just about everything that is  known about them (Kondou, Okita, Hijikata, ect.)   Theres  very little info about them, which I guess makes them so  fascinating.  I myself have been looking up info about Nagakura  but can&#39;t can&#39;t anything new from whats already been mentioned all  across the net.   You can read some of the previous enteries  for this mailing list, they&#39;re very helpful to understanding the times  the Shinsengumi lived through.\n  \n  -Bunneh\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nBring words and photos together (easily) with\n PhotoMail  - it&#39;s free and works with Yahoo!
