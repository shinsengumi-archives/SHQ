Can anyone decipher any of this?\n&gt; http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?\nViewItem&category=29452&item=3945022516&rd=1\n\n\nThis is not Haori. \nCorrectly, it is Kimono called Joue. \nhttp://www5.ocn.ne.jp/~room884/joue.html\n\nFormal clothes of Yamabushi.\nhttp://www9.ocn.ne.jp/~sanjyuin/\n\nJoue was an aristocrat&#39;s everyday wear at first. \nIt is made of cotton, it is white and there is no family crest. \nIn the subsequent time, the Shinto priest and the mountain priest \n(Yamabushi) wore it.\n(Although it is not related to Shinsengumi, many Yamabushis appear \nin Taiga drama next year.) \n\nAlthough it is written that this Joue is the thing of Meiji Era, it \nis wonderful if it is true. \nAlthough it is said that Kimono remains for 100 years, it is rare \nthat it is truly existing. \n(If a material is hemp, it is still more so.) \nOf course, when expensive Kimono is preserved carefully, it remains \nfinely.\nA granddaughter is able to wear Kimono which the grandmother wore. \n\n\nIncidentally, this is Haori. \nhttp://www.craft.ne.jp/muromachi/kate1/page6.html\n\nThis store is producing the same Haori as Haori of Taiga drama.^^;;; \n\n\nThere is Happi with the clothes similar to Haori. \nIt is the clothes worn at the time of a festival. \nAlthough it resembles Haori and is very cheap, it is the clothes \nwith which a use is different. \nAlthough Happi of Shinsengumi is sold at tourist resorts, such as \nAsakusa, please do not mistake it for Haori.^^;;; \nSince Haori folds and wears a collar, it is made very finely.\n\nmomoiro-usagi \n\n\n\n\n\n"
