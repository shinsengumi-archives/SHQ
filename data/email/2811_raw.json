It is outstanding to see an\nindividual s=\r\nuch as yourself take a proactive approach to this topic,\nand the misconcept=\r\nions that arise from it.\n\nAt this time, I&#39;d like to make a request, which I=\r\n believe\nsecretarytocapt3 made earlier. Could you please tell us what books=\r\n\nyou&#39;ve been using (Japanese and English) for your Shinsengumi\nresearch? We=\r\n have a list of books which mention Shinsengumi on the SHQ\nwebsite (www.shi=\r\nnsengumihq.com, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been to\nalready), and we would be del=\r\nighted to add more titles to that list.\nThis isn&#39;t for any single person am=\r\nong us, but rather for ALL of us in\nthe non-Japanese speaking (and in some =\r\ncases also the\nJapanese-speaking) fandom, so that we can better understand =\r\nthese men\nwe are interested in.\n\nI have perused some of your articles on Wi=\r\nkipedia (especially your\nwork on the Kondou and Okita articles), and I woul=\r\nd like to applaud\nyour efforts there, as well. It often takes great courage=\r\n to be able\nto remind people to keep fact and fiction separate, especially =\r\nin a\ntopic like this one, which has been so colored and often skewed by\npop=\r\nular portrayals. However, I&#39;d like to suggest that you add a\n&quot;References&quot; s=\r\nection to both articles, so that we know on Wikipedia as\nwell, where your i=\r\nnformation is coming from. I say this in all\nhonesty-- I&#39;m curious to see w=\r\nhat other books there are out there!\n\nAlso, please allow me to say that I h=\r\nope that with such an attitude\ntoward spreading knowledge, that you conside=\r\nr writing an article or\nbook on Okita. Wikipedia is good in its own right, =\r\nbut as you know,\narticles are open to being edited or deleted at anytime. B=\r\ny writing\nsomething-- anything-- you&#39;d be a trailblazer-- to the best of my=\r\n\nknowledge, at this time there are no biographies of Okita in print form.\n\n=\r\nHowever, I&#39;d like to reiterate that if you&#39;d like to write or publish\nanyth=\r\ning related to history, any editor or publication will likely ask\nthat you =\r\nfollow industry standards in citation.  Even if you do not\nplan to publish,=\r\n when you attend school your teachers will also force\nyou to adopt a citati=\r\non format as well.\n\nThe current most widely used format in the United State=\r\ns and now at\nthe international level is MLA (or something very similar to i=\r\nt).  You\ncan learn more about this easy format here:\n\nhttp://owl.english.pu=\r\nrdue.edu/owl/resource/557/01/\n\nAn example of the format for the MLA citatio=\r\nn:\n&quot;blah blah blah bakumatsu info blah blah blah&quot; (Madison 34)\n(author last=\r\n name, page number)\n\nIt&#39;s really as easy as listing the books at the bottom=\r\n of your webpage\nlike this:\n(author last name, first name. title either in =\r\nbold or underlined.\nlocation published: company, year.)\nWith journal and ma=\r\ngazine articles, though, there&#39;s a bit of a\ndifferent format.\n\nMadison, Sco=\r\nnnie. THE GREATEST GUIDE TO SAITOU HAJIME IN THE ENTIRE\nUNIVERSE. Los Angle=\r\ns: Makoto Publishers, 2007.\n\nFor webpages we at the shinsengumihq.com actua=\r\nlly link right back to\nthe very webpage and note the person who translated =\r\nfrom Japanese to\nEnglish\n\nWe&#39;re not trying to make fandom boring/tedious ho=\r\nwever we are trying\nto acknowledge the hard work and valuable contributions=\r\n of Japanese or\nwestern scholars, and protect ourselves from plaigiarism (w=\r\nhich is a\nprosecutable offense).\n\n**********************\nNote on Wikipedia\n=\r\nWikipedia allows ANYONE to go in and edit or delete your information.\n I th=\r\nink that you can provide basic information on wikipedia and link\nto your ow=\r\nn personal website with additional information---that&#39;s\nreally a safe way o=\r\nf protecting your work.  If you write a wikipedia\narticle it is also necess=\r\nary to cite your information.\n**********************\n\nOn a personal note as=\r\n a longtime Kondou fan, I&#39;d also like to thank\nyou for pointing out that th=\r\ne &quot;Kotetsu&quot; that he is said to have\nposessed was most probably not a real o=\r\nne. The book &quot;Swordsmith\nNagasone Kotetsu Okisato,&quot; an English text written=\r\n by Yasu Kizu,\nconfirms what you pointed out: Kondou&#39;s sword was not a true=\r\n Kotetsu,\nbut instead was a sword made by Minamoto Kiyomaro, the foremost\ns=\r\nwordmaker of the shinshinto period, and roughly contemporary to\nKondou Isam=\r\ni. Apparently faked Kotetsu swords were common even during\nthe life of Kote=\r\nsu himself, and he is said to have remarked on seeing\na fake &quot;The blade is =\r\nmine but the signature is not.&quot; (from page 8 of\nthe Yasu Kizu book).\n\nLink =\r\non the Kotetsu from Kondou&#39;s page at the SHQ site...\nhttp://www.shinsengumi=\r\nhq.com/KondouIsami.htm\n\nAnd a new article: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na=\r\ngasone_Kotetsu\n\nThose who want to see a (real) Kiyomaro sword can visit thi=\r\ns site:\nhttp://perso.orange.fr/nipponto/kiyomaro.html\n\nOnce again, I thank =\r\nyou, and hope to hear more from you soon.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
