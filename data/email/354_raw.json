I wonder if they could have heard that same rumor about the dream diary and misunderstood? I didn&#39;t think about that possibility before.\n\nAbout the Seiza thing. That reminds me of a story about Rob Roy MacGregor of Scotland. He had his family help him off his death bed so he could meet an old foe who dropped by in a way that wouldn&#39;t seem &quot;weak&quot;. Perhaps that was part of what Saito was trying to accomplish? He wanted to meet death in a way that befitted a samurai? I don&#39;t mean this as a contradiction of what you&#39;re saying. I think it goes hand in hand with it rather. Just a thought.\n\n"
