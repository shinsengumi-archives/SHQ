It was the campaign through which supporters of\nthe shogunate=\r\n were &quot;punished&quot; (by murder), and by which the &quot;glorious&quot;\nMeiji &quot;order&quot; was=\r\n brought into being. However, the victims of this\ncampaign of &quot;heaven&#39;s pun=\r\nishment&quot; were by no means all &quot;corrupt\nofficials.&quot;\n\nOn the 18th of the 4th =\r\nmonth of Genji 1 (23 May 1864), one such murder\noccurred. This was during t=\r\nhe buildup to Ikedaya.\n\nNow who was killed in this attack? Was it some corr=\r\nupt tax official? A\nrepressive police inspector? A government stool pigeon?=\r\n\n\nNone of the above.\n\nSome of you may know of Prince Nakagawa-no-miya Asahi=\r\nko, one of\nSatsuma and Aizu&#39;s supporters at the court during this time. He&#39;=\r\ns also\nin Barbara Sheridan&#39;s Bakumatsu/Shinsengumi novel &quot;Mirror, Mirror.&quot;\n=\r\n\nThese victims were the mother and young child of Prince Asahiko&#39;s\nchief st=\r\neward.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder...what guilt do an old woman and a young=\r\n\nchild have in national politics? Maybe it&#39;s just my opinion, but to\nanswer=\r\n &quot;guilt by association&quot; is simply irresponsible.\n\nHere&#39;s another &quot;tenchu&quot; v=\r\nictim who died because of &quot;guilt by\nassociation&quot;: on the 6th of the 5th mon=\r\nth (June 9, 1864), an artist by\nthe name of Reizei Tamechika, who served an=\r\nother pro-Shogunate noble,\nwas assassinated by Oraku Gentaro-- the man late=\r\nr protected by\nKawakami Gensai (this act on Gensai&#39;s part was what condemne=\r\nd him to\ndeath). Reizei had known his life was in danger, and had fled to\nv=\r\narious places around the Kamigata (Kyoto-Osaka) area before Oraku got\nhim. =\r\nReizei was not only killed, his head was also displayed in a\nprominent plac=\r\ne for passers-by to see.\n\nThink of these events, if you would: an old woman=\r\n, child, and an\nartist, connected to people with the &quot;wrong&quot; sympathies-- h=\r\nunted down\nlike animals and murdered in cold blood.\n\nThe Shinsengumi were f=\r\nully aware of these events. Put yourselves in\ntheir place, raiding an inn f=\r\null of arsonists (Ikedaya). However, also\nkeep in mind that Shinsengumi was=\r\n conceived and intended to do &quot;dirty&quot;\nwork. They interrogated, even torture=\r\nd people for information. The\nleadup to Ikedaya alone saw at least 5 or 6 C=\r\nhoshu men brutally\ntortured before Furutaka Shuntaro&#39;s infamous beat-down. =\r\nShinsengumi,\nas we know, also assassinated people at times. They also had t=\r\nheir\nfair share of cruel men, swindlers, and murderers.\n\nIn closing, I&#39;d li=\r\nke to leave you with a piece of Reizei Tamechika&#39;s\nart. Remember, this is t=\r\nhe innocent man whose head was a blood-stained\nsymbol of &quot;heaven&#39;s punishme=\r\nnt&quot;:\n\nhttp://www.kakejikutaiko.com/e/e2/0605/0605-2b.jpg\n\n-M.\n\nSOURCES:\n*Ho=\r\nshi Ryoichi, &quot;Bakumatsu no Aizu-han.&quot; (Tokyo: Chuokoron-shinsha,\n2001), p. =\r\n95.\n*Oishi Manabu, &quot;Shinsengumi: Saigo no Bushi no Jitsuzo.&quot; (Tokyo:\nChuoko=\r\nron-shinsha, 2004), pp. 101-102.\n*http://comic.freespace.jp/hokko/nen.htm\n*=\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawakami_Gensai\n\n\n"
