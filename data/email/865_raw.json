I know\n&gt; I&#39;d never seen it spelled like that until this\n&gt; article.\n\n\nProbably because the author thought just like you in a\nprevious post :)\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, &quot;Sekihoutai&quot; comes from &quot;SEKIshin\nni MUKUiru TAI&quot;, the &quot;Troop of the Most Loyal/Sincere\nDevotion&quot; (something like that), therefore the &quot;hou&quot;\nhas no direct relationship to &quot;seki&quot; :)\n\n \n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;http://www1.ocn.ne.jp/~oomi/tokusyu14.htm\n&gt; And this is about the incident where Sagara Souzou\n&gt; tried to put fire in the Satsuma fief house and\n&gt; caused\n&gt; several disturbances in the city of Edo.&lt;&lt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Tried to put &quot;out&quot; the fire, right?  \n\n\nNo, no, trying to PUT the house on fire indeed,\nputting the blame on the Shogunate so that Satsuma\nwould have a good excuse to take up arms.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m curious about a couple of things... the fish is\n&gt; too vague for me to figure out.  Are they saying\n&gt; that Sagara&#39;s body is actually buried where the\n&gt; monument in Shimosuwa is?  \n\n\nIt seems so...\n\n\n&gt; And what&#39;s this\n&gt; &quot;Mitsuru&quot;?  Kojima four must be Koshima Shirou (are\n&gt; &quot;j&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; used interchangeably like &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ou&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;oh&quot; as in Saitou&#39;s name?) and they&#39;re saying he\n&gt; changed it to Sagara Souzou (&quot;entire three&quot;?), but\n&gt; I&#39;m not understanding &quot;military officer Mitsuru,&quot;\n&gt; which shows up several times in the article.\n\n\nAs Masayoshi already clarified, his previous name was\n&quot;Kojima Shirou Masamitsu&quot; (can&#39;t say &quot;Koshima&quot;,\nthough).\n\n  \nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
