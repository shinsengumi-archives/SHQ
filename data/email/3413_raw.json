The=\r\nn again many a warlord, administrator, \n&gt; Confucian scholar, daimyo and mos=\r\nt of the Imperialist guys would \nall \n&gt; line up to see this film:\n&gt; \n&gt; http=\r\n://www.angryasianman.com/2008/07/john-woos-red-cliff-finally-\n&gt; arrives.htm=\r\nl\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw the 8 minute promo reel.  You&#39;ll enjoy the scenes after 4:00 \n=\r\n&gt; onwards.  The character of Guan Yu, Kondou&#39;s fav chara, is shown \nmore \n&gt;=\r\n in the 8 min. segment too.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ll love it.  The music has some sort o=\r\nf weird Jo Hisaishi \ninfluence (I \n&gt; wonder if he worked on the film).  I t=\r\nhink there is some Japanese \nmoney \n&gt; invested in this movie clearly---and =\r\nShidou Nakamura stars in it as \nwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; And for any questions as to why =\r\nthere are female characters and if \nit is \n&gt; some sort of way to use &quot;girl =\r\npower&quot; to pull in the crowd---that&#39;s \nnot \n&gt; true.  Romance of the Three Ki=\r\nngdoms had many significant female \n&gt; characters and a few warrior women to=\r\n boot.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can understand why they made RED CLIFF, rather than the later=\r\n \n&gt; chapters of ROTK which would require them to bring in the elephants.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; If you study Chinese/Korean/Japanese history then reading ROTK or \n&gt; sum=\r\nmaries or watching these film versions will help you figure out \nwhat \n&gt; th=\r\ne heck old texts allude to.  ROTK is one of those works of \nhistorical \n&gt; f=\r\niction (although there is a historical version of the story too) \nthat is \n=\r\n&gt; *constantly* mentioned, referenced and compared to.\n&gt; \n&gt; ROTK is a peek i=\r\nnto the past, and often used as a peek into the \nfuture as \n&gt; it is believe=\r\nd to be prophesize the outcome of political crisis \nonce certain \n&gt; factors=\r\n come into play.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Secretarytocapt3\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. RED CLIFF is not a flying=\r\n/strings kung fu type movie\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
