Like cutting\nall the way like you&#39;re cutting tameshigiri? The mirror thing is\npretty cool though, something I use often to check the angle of my sword. \n\nNope not tameshigiri its something else (they were using a different\nterm but then again there can be more than one name for a cut)...the\nmore advanced students have to isolate themselves from the newbies :D\n\nmirrors are awesome...I have to check to see that the tip of my sword\nis pointing at the ceiling kind of and not Waaaaay back.  Ofcourse\nafter getting hit a few times from a guy much taller and stronger...I\nget disoriented---I look in the mirror and say &quot;which one am\nI?&quot;...then I wave &quot;hi&quot; to myself to be sure {we are all wearing the\nsame colors and dark pants} (I have no idea why people online pay for\nindigo dyed hakamas...so expensive and they are just starting)--after\nwhich the instructor says &quot;Tiffany do you need a break?&quot; LOL!  What&#39;s\nreally funny is fumbling with the gear...folding the handkerchief on\nyour head correctly and tying on the &quot;men&quot; (I realize from a previous\npost that I typed &quot;dirty men&quot; now the yaoi writers MUST&#39;ve read it\ncompletely differently)...once you&#39;re done you turn to look down the\nline and note that everyone was patiently waiting for the last 10\nminutes....Newbies in martial arts is such a goldmine for comedy...now\nwhy hasn&#39;t someone come up with a sitcom yet?\n\n\n"
