She is the child of Kohana, a geisha\nthat Okita knows.  Yuki&#39;s father is a samurai and would not/could not\nmarry Kohana because of her status.  Yuki actually thinks of Okita as\nher father as he helps take care of her and her mother.  \n \nViz has been doing a good job oh KH so far in Shojo Beat - the first\nfour chapters were preceded by articles outlining the history of the\nShinsengumi and of Japan during the period; and it even made the cover\nof the November issue with an interview with the Watanabe Taeko and a\n&quot;get this look&quot; article, which even outlined how to make an\napproximation of a traditional women&#39;s hairstyle!  I can&#39;t speak much to\nthe accuracy of the translation, however, but it seems in line with\nother translations I have seen.\n \nThe first collected volume should be out around New Years with the first\nfive chapters, it will retail for $8.99 in the US.  \n \nViz&#39;s site on KH:  http://shojobeat.com/manga/kh/  \n \n-SafetyGirl\n \n \n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: SHQ@yahoogroups.com [mailto:SHQ@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nHirotada Tokugawa\nSent: Wednesday, October 26, 2005 10:59 PM\nTo: SHQ@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [SHQ] Kaze Hikaru released by Viz\n\n\n\nAwesome!
