For those of you who have wondered about okita&#39;s swords \nplease dont=\r\n worry too much about what happened to them but wonder if \nthe swords he ha=\r\nd was his. I found a website talking about Okita&#39;s \nswords and what happene=\r\nd. I shall qoute the paragraphs.&quot;Reproduction \nof Souji Okita&#39;s Sword\n\nSour=\r\nces: Please insert the links below into: babelfish.altavista.com \nand click=\r\n translate from Japanese to English:\n\nOther sources:http://www.jaxion.com/s=\r\namurais.net/sword.htm\nhttp://www.jaxion.com/samurais.net/katana/hm15.htm\nww=\r\nw.n-p-s.net/kiyomitu.htm \nwww.shinsengumihq.com\nwww.miburo.com\n\n(IMG:http:/=\r\n/img14.imgspot.com/u/05/97/16/kiyomitu102.jpg)\n\nIn fact, a famous sword Oki=\r\nta used at Ikeda-ya (one supposedly made \nby Kojiki Kiyomitsu) is said to h=\r\nave broken. This is the sword I&#39;ve \nseen on most websites being sold as &quot;Ok=\r\nita&#39;s favorite&quot;.\n\nAccording to some sources, after that sword broke, he use=\r\nd a sword \nmade by Yamatonokami Yasusada. The sword was 2.2 shaku long \nacc=\r\nording to a source at www.n-p-s.net/aitoh.htm , but my \nphotocopied page fr=\r\nom a swordbook (name of book lost long ago) says \nit was 2 shaku, 3 sun, an=\r\nd 6 bu long.\n\nOn a side note, OishiKuwajiro (known by the nickname&quot; \nhitoki=\r\nrikuwajiro) also used a sword made by Yamatonokami Yasusada \nthat was 2 sha=\r\nku 5 sun in length according to this site \nwww.bakusin.com/jiten41.html\n\nOk=\r\nita&#39;s most famous sword, though, was the &quot;Kikuichimonji&quot;, which \nwas 2 shak=\r\nu 4 sun 2 bu in length. There is some speculation as to \nwhether he actuall=\r\ny owned such a valuable sword, but we will \nprobably never know if he reall=\r\ny owned it since it was supposedly \nlost after he died. If you are interest=\r\ned in reading more about it, \nI recommend Shinsengumi Keppuroku by Shiba Ry=\r\notaro.\n\nAs far as the swords being accurate, for sure Hijikata&#39;s is \naccura=\r\nte. Unfortunately the model on that page is the &quot;affordable \nmodel&quot;. The ex=\r\nact replica which is listed on Ozawa swords Japan is \nquite a bit more. \n\nO=\r\nkita&#39;s replica is in what they call handachi (han-dachi)mounts, \nliterally =\r\n&quot;half tachi&quot; mounts, which come from the pre-edo periods \nwhere there was a=\r\n transition from tachi to katana. Unfortunately, \ni&#39;ve seen conflicting dat=\r\na on if his Ichimonji blade was mounted in \nhandachi mounts. He owned one o=\r\nther sword besides the Kiku Ichimonji \nand that one could have been the one=\r\n mounted handachi style.&quot; I hope \nthis will help you think better and to te=\r\nll ya we might not ever \nfind his swords. Thanks for reading this and I hop=\r\ne that someone \nwill find them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
