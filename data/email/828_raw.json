However, as the birth of the \nEmperor&#39;s heir approaches, political intrigue and jealousy will lead \nto the most dangerous betrayal from within the Onmyoji.\n\nAngrybee&#39;s note:  I&#39;ve seen the trailer for this, and it looks \nutterly spectacular.  Might be good &quot;research&quot; for anyone wanting to \nexplore the &quot;magic&quot; themes in PMK in fics.\n\nSamurai7 - http://www.samurai-7.com/\n\nSamurai7 is based off of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Seven Samurai, but set in \nthe -future-.  \n\nAngrybee&#39;s Note:  There&#39;s a good article on Samurai7 in the June/July \nissue of &quot;Anime Insider&quot;.  Of course, it&#39;s being done by Gonzo, \nwhich...I believe, are also the ones who did PMK.  \n\nSamurai Champloo: http://www.samuraichamploo.com/\nGallery: http://www.samuraichamploo.com/Gallery/index.html\n\nSamurai Champloo, while an odd name, is the first work of Shinchiro \nWatanabe since Cowboy Bebop.  It is set to air in Japan starting May \n19th.\n\nHope you have enjoyed this list of coming attractions!  Now, if only \nmy local PBS would air the Shinsengumi Drama....\n\nAngrybee.\n\n\n"
