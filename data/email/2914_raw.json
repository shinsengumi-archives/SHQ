Based on this, people have reasoned\n&gt; that\n&gt; had it not been for Kinmon-no-Hen (for which\n&gt; Ikeda-ya\n&gt; has been credited as one of the direct causes),\n&gt; Choshu\n&gt; would have risen up earlier. \n&gt; \n&gt; There is also the notion that Ikeda-ya (or\n&gt; Kinmon-no-Hen rather) actually speeded up the\n&gt; Bakumatsu: had it not been such a catalyst for\n&gt; Choshu\n&gt; to take action, then their rebellious politics might\n&gt; have festered for much longer before coming to the\n&gt; boil. \n&gt; \n&gt; Either way, it was a matter of a few years earlier\n&gt; or\n&gt; a few years later. Hope this helps. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best Wishes, \n&gt; \n&gt; Mio. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- slvrgriffn &lt;meredith_hartley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know this is an old topic, but I&#39;m new and was\n&gt; &gt; catching up on old posts.\n&gt; &gt; First -- I AM in Utah in the Asian Studies program\n&gt; &gt; at a different\n&gt; &gt; university. There are MANY students in the program\n&gt; &gt; here who have\n&gt; &gt; become VERY interested in samurai of all periods.\n&gt; &gt; And, if you mention\n&gt; &gt;   Shin sen gumi in a room of Asian Studies Majors,\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll get a\n&gt; &gt; joyously heated discussion. IT IS ALIVE AND WELL\n&gt; IN\n&gt; &gt; UTAH. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, it&#39;s one subject of my abbreviated thesis\n&gt; &gt; (a series of\n&gt; &gt; shorter, 8-10 page papers written as an addendum\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; a Grad School\n&gt; &gt; Application and authorization to pursue\n&gt; publishing).\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been work\n&gt; &gt; with the works of Hillsborough, Keene, Jansen,\n&gt; &gt; Craig, and Totman\n&gt; &gt; mainly, but I&#39;d love ANY help y&#39;all can give. I\n&gt; &gt; speak fluent Thai, but\n&gt; &gt; my Japanese is still hideously rudimentary. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If y&#39;all could:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve run into claims that the &quot;Ideda&#39;ya affair\n&gt; &gt; extended the war by two\n&gt; &gt; years at least&quot; more than 5 times, but I HAVEN&#39;T\n&gt; &gt; found an intelligible\n&gt; &gt; explanation of that claim. Hillsborough doesn&#39;t\n&gt; seem\n&gt; &gt; to buy it, and\n&gt; &gt; devotes a few paragraphs to it. The claim is\n&gt; &gt; popularly accepted, but\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like a data-based analysis of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any ideas or sources, folks?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; Meredith\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt;\n___________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Try the all-new Yahoo!
