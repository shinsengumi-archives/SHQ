My fav films from him are THE KEY \nand\n&gt; &gt; BURMESE HARP...Kon Ichikawa has a background in animation so \nthis \n&gt; film\n&gt; &gt; must&#39;ve been fabulous\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Kiichi Nakai does the voice of Hijikata Toshizo!\n&gt; &gt; For those of you who haven&#39;t seen MIBUGISHIDEN...Kiichi Nakai is \nthe\n&gt; &gt; actor who portrays Yoshimura Kanichiro (I spelled the name wrong). \n&gt; &gt; Maybe this actor is a closet Shinsengumi fan:)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why oh why is this film not available for purchase!!!!\n\n\n"
