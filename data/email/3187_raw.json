The last 3 are really the most common.  But I know \nthat sometimes fill=\r\ning out the order page on Amazon.co.jp can be \nreally hard.  Is there an on=\r\nline Japanese bookstore in your country?  \nThey can order these books for y=\r\nou.  In regards to Kan Shimosawa you \nhave to take his info at &quot;face value&quot;=\r\n...some details are hard to trace \nto a source and you have to make a judgm=\r\nent call on some of his \nresearch.  He represents a truly early attempt at =\r\ngathering \ninformation in this field (so his job was really difficult).\n\n--=\r\n- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Akimiya&quot; &lt;melianeth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone =\r\nknow where I can buy online the following books in \njapanese:\n&gt; \n&gt; Yamamura=\r\n, &quot;Shinsengumi Shougenroku&quot;\n&gt; Michio Hirao, &quot;Shinsengumi shiroku&quot; (and othe=\r\nrs)\n&gt; Kan, Shimosawa, &quot; Shinsengumi Shimatsu&quot; (and others)\n&gt; nakagura, &quot; sh=\r\ninsengumi tenmatsuki&quot;\n&gt; Shimada Kai records\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess perhapst in some s=\r\npezialised shops!!
