Tama just sent me a pic she took with her\n&gt; cell phone of the\n&gt; parade featuring NHK Hijikata Koji Yamamoto it&#39;s in\n&gt; the photos section\n&gt; in the first file = Aizu Festival\n\n\nIt was very nice ^^ Though I arrived a bit late and\nmissed the homage to the deceased and the bow\nshooting, I managed to see the Byakkotai kenbu, the\ncannon shooting and the beginning of the parade. Lots\nof women trying to take pictures and touching the\nthree NHK dorama actors who took part in the parade :D\n\n\nThe parade itself had fewer people than I had\nexpected. But it was great nonetheless.\n\nI couldn&#39;t take many pictures (most were blurred -_-).\nPerhaps Tama-san was able to get better pictures than\nI. I am trying to upload three pictures I took from\nthe parade in the Photos section. They are a bit heavy\n(about 750k each), so be warned. \n\nThis Saturday, I intend to go to Saito Hajime&#39;s\nmemorial service, which will be held at his grave.\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
