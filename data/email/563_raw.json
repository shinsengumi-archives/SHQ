The day Kondou Isami was executed by \nthe Ishin. I think it would be appropriate for everyone to take a \nmoment to reflect on this great man&#39;s life. After all, he WAS the \nCommander of the group we&#39;ve all come to love and admire. Without \nhim, the Shinsengumi would never have existed. To some he was a \nteacher and a friend. To others he was a leader and a source of \ninspiration. To many he was an enemy not to be taken lightly. But in \nthe end he was just a man who never surrendered his ideals and was \nwilling to die for what he believed. For that he has my deepest \nrespect always.\n\nMay your memory never fade from this world, Kondou-sama.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
