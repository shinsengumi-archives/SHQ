I know I&#39;d never seen it spelled like t=\r\nhat until this article.\n\n&gt;&gt;As it seems that there is an interest in the\nSek=\r\nihoutai in this list, I did a quick search at\nGoogle and found these that m=\r\nay be of interest:&lt;&lt;\n \nMany thanks... I hadn&#39;t gotten as far as checking Ja=\r\npanese sites (stubbornly avoiding the evil fish and the gist of gist until =\r\nI couldn&#39;t stand it any longer).  If you didn&#39;t know it before, now you do =\r\n--- Sagara is an obsession of mine equal to the one I have for Saitou (and =\r\nI&#39;ve avoided Japanese sites with him, too).  I&#39;ve always been curious as to=\r\n the Shinsengumi connection with Suzuki (not politically or anything, just =\r\nthat a wolf found a place in the Sekihoutai) and I have reason to be partic=\r\nularly thankful he ended up with Sagara... Shinsengumi fans are definitely =\r\nthe best when it comes to tracking things down and sharing!\n \n&gt;&gt;http://www.=\r\ngeocities.jp/hayasenagaru/sekihou/nenpyo.html\nThis is a timetable comparing=\r\n Sekihoutai&#39;s actions to\nthe Imperial Army&#39;s (&quot;Soutokufu&quot;) actions.&lt;&lt;\n \nCan=\r\n anyone tell me why this site is coming up in gibberish instead of kanji?  =\r\nBecause of that, babelfish can&#39;t translate it (apparently).  Anything I can=\r\n do from my end to get it to load correctly?\n \n&gt;&gt;http://www1.ocn.ne.jp/~oom=\r\ni/tokusyu14.htm\nAnd this is about the incident where Sagara Souzou\ntried to=\r\n put fire in the Satsuma fief house and caused\nseveral disturbances in the =\r\ncity of Edo.&lt;&lt;\n \nTried to put &quot;out&quot; the fire, right?  He was a Satsuma reta=\r\niner by then and this would be the incident MissB included where the bakufu=\r\n set fire to the Satsuma villa in retaliation? \n \nI&#39;m curious about a coupl=\r\ne of things... the fish is too vague for me to figure out.  Are they saying=\r\n that Sagara&#39;s body is actually buried where the monument in Shimosuwa is? =\r\n And what&#39;s this &quot;Mitsuru&quot;?  Kojima four must be Koshima Shirou (are &quot;j&quot; an=\r\nd &quot;sh&quot; used interchangeably like &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;oh&quot; as in Saitou&#39;s name?) a=\r\nnd they&#39;re saying he changed it to Sagara Souzou (&quot;entire three&quot;?), but I&#39;m=\r\n not understanding &quot;military officer Mitsuru,&quot; which shows up several times=\r\n in the article.\n \n(babelfish): &quot;Entire watch Kojima four =98Y military off=\r\nicer Mitsuru (changed name Sagara entire three)&quot;\n \n&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, both li=\r\nnks are in Japanese :-/&lt;&lt;\n \nYeah, I&#39;d say that&#39;s unfortunate for morons lik=\r\ne me... :-D  Still, as with the Shinsengumi and Saitou sites secretarytocap=\r\nt3&#39;s been digging up, it is a little more than we had previously, even if w=\r\ne often end up speculating on the babelfish translation and then *begging* =\r\nyou and Masayoshi for a real translation.  And it does give me hope that st=\r\nruggling with babelfish may be worth it for Sagara.  I&#39;m really grateful, S=\r\nK.\n \nphil (who really isn&#39;t ready to set up a Sagara site, but thinking may=\r\nbe it&#39;s time to get this stuff organized for Japanese-language-challenged i=\r\nnterested parties... )\n \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo=\r\n!?\nFriends.
