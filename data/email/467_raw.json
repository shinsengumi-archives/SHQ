Yahoo says they&#39;re working on the problem, but \nhave no estimate of how long it&#39;s going to take.  (And, yes, I turned \noff getting mail from all of my lists, haven&#39;t opened any unexpected \nattachments (as a strict rule, I don&#39;t), scanned all attachments I&#39;ve \nopened from friends, and done virus scans on my computer... it&#39;s a \nproblem somewhere within Yahoo.) Not only do I get multiple copies of \neverything (including updates from Yahoo - ha!), it&#39;s started to \nbounce messages back and sends me multiple copies of the mail \ndelivery failure. Apparently it&#39;s even beginning to fail to deliver \nmessages into my inbox. I give up!  :-D\n\nAnyway, do **NOT** send me any email to the spiritus_saitou account.  \nIf you should need to contact me, even if it&#39;s to tease me, send \nmessages to philalexandros@... .  I should be able to read list \nmessages, probably even continue to post, just by logging on to \nYahoogroups, but I&#39;m not going to be surprised if I can&#39;t.  If I go \nsilent, you have to know I can&#39;t get onto the list site --- when have \nI ever been able to shut up???  Anyway, it doesn&#39;t mean I &quot;vant to be \nalone.&quot;\n\nSince I haven&#39;t heard of any problems from others, I&#39;m hoping that \nmeans it&#39;s just *me* who is having the problem.\n\nphil (who&#39;s nursing her wounds by watching her fave RK episodes, \nmostly the really silly ones)\n\n\n"
