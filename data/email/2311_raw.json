(Real name Yukiko) Screen Name\nfor everything: KoujiDaisuki76   (Yea yea you all know\nwhat it means. ^_^x) Or you can call me the name\nsecretary calls me. \n\n2) How did you discover the Shinsengumi?\n\nI was watching Good Will Hunting I think. My sister\nknowing I was obsess with Japanese History and Rurouni\nKenshin switched the channels and what you know\nShinsengumi !\n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?\n\nHai! My Favorite Shinsengumi member is Hijikata\nToshizou becasue I admire his personality and I can\nrelate to him in certain ways. He became my favorite\ncharacter when I found out that he was once a farmer\nand how he worked hard to be part of history. Kondo\nIsami did the same I know but Hijikata to me is more\ninteresting. \n\nFor ceratin reasons I don&#39;t like Okita Souji as much\nas the other members. My other second favorite\nShinsengumi Member is Yamanami Keisuke or Saitou\nHajime (Can&#39;t decide) and My third favorite would be\neither Harada Sanosuke or Todou Heisuke.\n\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\n\nUm. Nhk Shinsengumi. One episode of Shinsengumi\nkepproku(Sry if I spelled it wrong) I would liek to\nwatch Gohatto. Peace Maker Kurogane, Rurouni Kenshin.\n\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film\n(or series) do you \nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and\nwhy?\n\nUh huh, Nhk Shinsengumi best captured Hijikata\nToshizou and Yamanami. If you compare the pictures, to\nme Hijikata looks like the orignal one. I can&#39;t really\nsay Nhk best captured Yamanami though, since I haven;t\nread much about him. But I do love Hijikata in NHK.\nKouji Yamamoto did a great job protraying him.\n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you\nabout any \nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?\n\nAfter Kondo died, what excatly did Hijikata do? I know\nhe went up North and died by a bullet shot but are\ntheir any details about it?\n\nKoujiDaisuki76\n\n\nI Love Kouji\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
