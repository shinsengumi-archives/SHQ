Before that\n&gt; work was set to \n&gt; anime, most Japanese boys were playing baseball.^^ \n\n\nI see ^^ Well, no wonder, since baseball is one of the\nmost popular sports in Japan ^^\n\n\n\n&gt; Recently, there were many children who were\n&gt; influenced by &quot;Hikaru no \n&gt; go&quot; and began the game of go. \n\n\n&quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; stirred some interest in anime fans\nhere and several have tried learning the game. But\nstill, it&#39;s an obscure game here, compared to chess\nand checkers.\n\n \n\n&gt; Although I have read and noticed their diary, now\n&gt; present Brazil is \n&gt; winter. Since Brazil had a hot image, I was\n&gt; surprised that they are \n&gt; writing that that is cold.\n\n\nBeing a continental country, in the southern parts it\nactually snows in the winter ^^ (demo Nihon no nanbu\nwa Okinawa dakara chotto &quot;minami no kuni&quot; te iu image\nto chigau desho? ^^;;)\n\n\n \n&gt; Tokusatsu is popular among the mothers who have\n&gt; small child in the \n&gt; latest Japan. Although it is shown to children, in\n&gt; fact, they are \n&gt; absorbed in Tokusatsu. lol\n\n\nI see ^^ A cousin of mine who&#39;s living in Japan is one\nof such cases ^^ I though it was only her, though\n&lt;laugh&gt;\n\n\n&gt; Is Kageyama the person who sang the song of\n&gt; &quot;DragonBall&quot; and &quot;Saint \n&gt; Seiya&quot;? \n\n\nActually, the theme of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; (Cha-la\nHead-cha-la) and the 2nd opening of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;\n(Soldier Dream)\n\n\n&gt; Although only it is not the cause, DVD of the new\n&gt; episode of &quot;Saint \n&gt; Seiya&quot; has come out now. \n&gt; Many of my friends were the fans of Saint Seiya at\n&gt; their school \n&gt; days. Although not excited like before, several\n&gt; persons buy DVD. \n\n\nSeveral people here are excited about that, and they\nare wondering if Toei will produce more Saint Seiya\nstuff. It was very popular here in the early 90&#39;s, so\npeople do still remember it.\n  \n\n&gt; Incidentally, there is an opinion that Serizawa Kamo\n&gt; (not you) had \n&gt; trouble with his syphilis, truly. \n\n\nI have read this somewhere too.\n\n\n&gt; If syphilis advances, a patient&#39;s brain goes crazy\n&gt; and it becomes \n&gt; impossible for him to understand anything.\n&gt; Researchers explain that \n&gt; Serizawa drank alcohol and rioted in order to\n&gt; beguile the sick fear. \n&gt; The Japanese of that time was threatened by syphilis\n&gt; and \n&gt; tuberculosis. \n\n\nAnd &quot;hashika&quot; and &quot;korori&quot;, right? ^^\n\n \n\n&gt; Is a short play performed there at the time of\n&gt; &quot;cosplay&quot;? \n\n\nHere the short play is optional. Those who want to\npresent such play sign up for it ^^\n\n\n&gt; Since comic market is the place which sells\n&gt; doujinshi, cosplay is a \n&gt; supporting player. I do not know about the event of\n&gt; only cosplay. \n\n\nHere is the opposite. Cosplay draws a much greater\nattention than doujinshi. So far, we have nothing like\nKomiketto, and no Odaiba presentation hall (laughs)\n\n\n&gt; &quot;Gohatto&quot; thinks that it was disreputable to the\n&gt; fans of \n&gt; Shinsengumi. The angry person was also in my\n&gt; surroundings. \n&gt; I am interested in how you have recognized\n&gt; Shinsengumi on that \n&gt; movie. \n\n\nWell, coming from Oshima Nagisa, couldn&#39;t expect a\n&quot;normal&quot; movie... but it is far from the jidaigeki I&#39;m\nused (?) to watch.\n\n \n&gt; About RK, I sensed that it was very strange. \n&gt; When RK caused Shinsengumi boom, it differed from\n&gt; the former boom. \n&gt; Although the fans in novel or drama of the boom till\n&gt; then were \n&gt; centers, RK called in the fans of manga or anime. \n&gt; And although Okita, Hijikata, and Kondou of the boom\n&gt; till then were \n&gt; the leading roles, the leading role at that time was\n&gt; Saitou Hajime. \n\n\nHere, it was RK that made Shinsengumi famous among\nanime fans here, and therefore, it&#39;s Saitou Hajime the\nmost known person from the Shinsengumi. Some people\nknow Sanosuke or Okita, but they are in a few number.\n\n \n&gt; She said. &quot;The Shinsengumi member whom I got to know\n&gt; at the very \n&gt; beginning was also Saitou Hajime.&quot; ^^;;\n\n\nCan&#39;t deny that I knew Shinsengumi first by reading RK\n^^;;; Only then I read &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; and &quot;Shinsengumi\nKeppuroku&quot;.\n \n\n   \n&gt; &gt; I remember I took years to understand what it\n&gt; meant\n&gt; &gt; ^^;;;\n&gt; \n&gt; Possibly, was Ikkyu-san broadcast even in Brazil?\n\n\nNo, it wasn&#39;t, although many old anime were broadcast\nhere ^^\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Have you watched &quot;Jigoku no Koshien&quot;? Odagiri Joe\n&gt; &gt; appears in that work too, as Yakyu Jubee, if I&#39;m\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; mistaken ^^\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, the actor of &quot;Jigoku Koshien&quot; is not Odagiri. \n&gt; He is an actor named Sakaguchi Taku.\n\n\nWhoops... sorry for my mistake -_-\n\n\n&gt; Shikashi Kamo san kuwashisugi desu. Brazil no Anime\n&gt; fan wa minasan \n&gt; soudesuka? ^^;;;\n\n\nEh? Sonna ni kuwashiku arimasen ^^ Tada ikkai no &quot;fan&quot;\nto shite Shinsengumi wo medeteru dake desu ^^ \n\nAs for other kinds of info, there are some people who\nare way more knowledgeable than I am here in Brazil.\nThere are people who have an incredible knowledge on\nthe old series that were aired here, like Ultraman,\nUltraseven, Paa-man (Super Dinamo), Magma Taishi,\nTetsujin 28go, Cyborg 009, Heiji, Ribon no Kishi and\nmore ^^ And plenty of people who have got deep\nknowledge of 80&#39;s series like Macross (Robotech),\nYamato (Starblazers), Jaspion, Changeman, Flashman.\nAnd, of course, the die-hard fans of Saint Seiya,\nDragon Ball, Yu Yu Hakusho and others ^^\n\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
