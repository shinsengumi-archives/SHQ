The bit below \nis my combination of pages 96-97, as well as information I&#39;ve previously \nposted here about Kondou and Nagai Naoyuki.\n\nOkay, so Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigns on the 9th of December, 1867. On the \nevening of the 12th, Yoshinobu, Matsudaira Katamori, and Matsudaira Sadaaki \nleave for Osaka. The Shinsengumi gets assigned to guard duty at Nijo \nCastle-- and while there, gets the Mito domain annoyed. Thus, rather \nconveniently-- Nagai Naoyuki gets ready to leave for Osaka, and takes the \nShinsengumi with him on the 14th. Shinsengumi sets up temporary headquarters \nin Osaka at the Tenmangu Shrine, and on the 15th, is ordered to duty at the \nFushimi-bugyosho (Fushimi Magistrate&#39;s Headquarters), near Kyoto, in \nFushimi.\n\nSO...to make a long story short-- Yoshimura Kanichiro (of &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; \nfame) and Yamazaki Susumu go on ahead of the main force to set things up in \nFushimi, and the main body of Shinsengumi arrives on the 16th.\n\nWhile Shinsengumi was there, Kondou continued to make business trips to Nijo \nCastle. However, on the 18th, on his way back, he was attacked and shot by \nthe remnants of Ito Kashitaro&#39;s Goryoeji faction, under Abe Juurou. Thus, \nKondou was sent to Osaka and cared for by the Shogun&#39;s physician, Matsumoto \nRyojun (who later went to Aizu). As a result, Hijikata was the one who \ncommanded Shinsengumi at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
