There is a chance this person may not \nbe able to clarify this myst=\r\nery.  If that is the case then what you \nhave is our most sincerest effort.=\r\n\n\nThe work was translated and written by A. Bakalian in collaboration \nwith=\r\n secretarytocapt3 who provided some bits of text and who dragged \nhim (kick=\r\ning and screaming into the Meiji Era) and into the study of \nTakamine Hideo=\r\n.\n\nIn a few days, there will be yet another anniversary to mark the \ndeath =\r\nof Fujita Goro.  In 1915, he lived through his last September.  \nThe month =\r\nalways held great meaning to him.  It was in September of \n1868 his time as=\r\n a Shinsengumi fighting in Aizu came to an end.\n\nPerhaps the purpose of why=\r\n he sat in seiza (position) before death \nwas to maintain his mental lucidi=\r\nty and clean from his mind that \nfateful month from his youth and all ties =\r\nwhich bind him to this \nworld: hate, love, revenge, even joy.  He yearned t=\r\no destroy his ego \nin an attempt to find freedom.\n\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\nMinor Detail:\n\nI also wanted to submit=\r\n to members here a photograph of a garden \nwhere Fujita Goro once spent alo=\r\nt of time in.  I know it&#39;s not \nthe &quot;coolest&quot; photo but please bear in mind=\r\n that many things in Tokyo \nwas completely destroyed in 1923 Kanto Earthqua=\r\nke, and more \ndestruction during WWII.  This photo was taken in between tho=\r\nse \ncatastrophic events.  Thus, to even have this photo is remarkable.  \nIt=\r\n was preserved outside of Japan.  So yes, over 2 decades before the \nphoto =\r\nwas taken---Fujita Goro was here (I assure you on this fact).\n\nhttp://1happ=\r\nyturtle.com/T-sensei/gardenatTakamineEstate.jpg\n\n\n\n\n"
