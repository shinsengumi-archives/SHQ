I normally go by the name WhiteRabbit/ Bunneh anywhere I go, but seeing as how common this is I ended up using the name Eeni for just about everything I do online now a days.\n\n2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi?:\nFirst saw them on Rurouni Kenshin and wondered for the longest time wether the lil character called &quot;Okita&quot; was a girl (I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only who ever thought this).   A few years later, I started doing a lil research for my Kenshin fanfic and I ran across the Shinsengumi once again.   Being the ignorant person I was, I was amazed to find out that they in fact were a real group of people.   I read a lil more about them and was even more amazed.   So to this day, I&#39;m still trying to read as much about them as I can.\n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?:\nSerizawa Kamo and Okita Souji.   Oktia because he&#39;s always said to have been a guy who would rather have a good laugh then be serious ^_^   As for Kamo, I was reading about him on the Kamo biography page and just thought, this guy didn&#39;t take shit from anyone.   Kondou forgot to count him into the number of people staying at an inn, it&#39;s ok with him... but if he can&#39;t sleep comfortably, no one else will.   BONFIRE!!!!\n \n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?:\nRurouni Kenshin (manga/anime), NHK Shinsengumi!, and PeaceMaker (manga only)\n\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think captured your favorite members(s) the best and why?:\nI have no idea... \n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular Shinsengumi members or events?:\nHow did Saitou end up marring the daiymo(sp?)&#39;s sister.   From what I understand he was a no one by birth and a pretty much the inside hitman of the Shinsengumi... so what were the politics (if any) behind this marrage???? \n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
