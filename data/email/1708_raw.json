I still can&#39;t get over how handsome the real actor is...omg... *drools* XD\n\ndarkmalik &lt;jcolburn1@...&gt; wrote:Here&#39;s a question which version (anime, manga, live action) of each \ncharacter is best. Here&#39;s my vote:\nHajime Saitou: PMK version, RK one is nice too but the PMK version is \nmore softer and I like that.\nSouji Okita: PMK version hands down, I don&#39;t liket he way they \nportrayed him in PK as a stupid looking little kid.\nSusumu Yamazaki: PMK I&#39;ve only seen him in this particular series so \nI vote this version best.\nKeisuke Yamanami: PMK again as I&#39;ve only seen him in this series I \ncan only vote for this version of him.\nIsami Kondou: PMK I don&#39;t liek the way he&#39;s sometimes portrayed as \nold and fat in live action so I choose PMK for the liveliness they \ngave him in it.\nSanosuke Harada: PMK because of the comedy factor totally.\nToshizo Hijikata: PMK I don&#39;t like how they prtray him as an \noverpowering jerk with no sense of humor in the live actions I&#39;ve \nseen so I have to vote for the cool one in the anime PMK.\nShinpachi Nagakura: PMK for the comedy routine he, Sanosuke and \nHeisuke get into.\nHeisuke Toodou: Is he even real? Oh well since I&#39;ve only seen him in \nPMK I vote for the PMK version.\nWell here&#39;s my votes, what&#39;re yours?\n\n\nSaitoh Worship\n~Anime Mystique~\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/Anime-j-pop_music_hosterz/\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/Noir_Yuumura_Mireille_Altena_Chloe/\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
