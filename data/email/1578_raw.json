Newbie here &lt;bows&gt; Glad to have joined, there seem to be such a lot =\r\nof knowledgeable people around.\n \nAs such, I have a few questions, or rathe=\r\nr a few things I&#39;d like to have confirmed/dismissed, on what I&#39;ve read so f=\r\nar about Hijikata&#39;s early life. (I have a special fondness for him - all th=\r\ne Shinsengumi boys are interesting, but this one&#39;s special!)\n \nThis is what=\r\n I&#39;ve found so far:\n-Full name: Hijikata Toshizou Yoshitoyo. (Anyone know i=\r\nf he had another childhood name, or if he ever changed it later in life?)\n =\r\n\n- He was the youngest of 6 children, and had 3 brothers and 2 sisters. The=\r\n younger sister&#39;s name was Onobu (she later married Sato Hikogorou). I read=\r\n somewhere that the oldest brother&#39;s name was Kiroku, and the Shinsengumi! =\r\nNHK series gives another brother&#39;s name as Tamajirou. \n \n- According to one=\r\n site, both his parents died when he was very young (IIRC it even said that=\r\n his father was already dead by the time Toshizou was born). The older of h=\r\nis sisters also died early.\n \n- Toshizou was raised first by his brother Ki=\r\nroku, then moved to Onobu&#39;s home at the age of 11. This was also the time h=\r\ne lost his first job, through being disrespectful to his employer.\n \n- I un=\r\nderstand he got to know (the future) Kondou Isami when they were both in th=\r\neir late teens. Sources differ on whether he joined the Tennen Rishin ryuu =\r\nat this time, and simply didn&#39;t become a *resident* student until later, or=\r\n if he didn&#39;t in fact join until he was 28 (I think that&#39;s the right age).\n=\r\n \n- He lost another job at 17, this time he was working at a clothing store=\r\n, and got fired for sleeping with one of his female co-workers. It was afte=\r\nr this that his brother in law helped him set himself up as a medicine pedd=\r\nler. \n \nSo... right, wrong, what?\n \nOh, and a bonus question &lt;grins&gt; Does a=\r\nnyone know much about the relationship between Hijikata and Okita Souji? Mo=\r\nst sources I&#39;ve found mention how the original Shieikan four were &quot;like bro=\r\nthers&quot;... but two people I&#39;ve debated with (admitted, people who really dis=\r\nlike the way Shinsengumi manga/anime tend to turn those two into a couple) =\r\nclaim that it&#39;s &quot;well known&quot; that Hijikata and Okita didn&#39;t get along. Whic=\r\nh, granted, isn&#39;t exactly antithetic to their being foster brothers - you s=\r\nhould see my family! - but I wondered if anyone could shed some light on th=\r\ne topic.\n \nLinda/Enma-Ou\n\n\nH=F6strusk och gr=E5 moln - k=F6p en resa till s=\r\nolen p=E5 Yahoo!
