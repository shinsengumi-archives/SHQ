I think some undergrads in teh field would be very g=\r\nrateful \n&gt; for this opportunity to submit their work.  You may also state v=\r\nery \n&gt; clearly (several times) on the site that the work remains the proper=\r\nty \n&gt; of the author etc.  Also universities have cultural centers which are=\r\n \n&gt; interdisciplinary and can bring in people from different fields to \n&gt; e=\r\nxplore samurai history from different angles...example the science \n&gt; of &quot;m=\r\nartial arts&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you tried to contact some of the older professors i=\r\nn teh field and \n&gt; gotten their take on this project?\n&gt;\n\n\nI have friends in=\r\n the Japanese history department at the University of\nHawaii who are inform=\r\ning the staff, and once we get things really\nrolling we hope to involve Dr.=\r\n Paul Varley in the process (he was the\nthesis advisor of one of my friends=\r\n). I also have a friend at the\nUniversity of London who is doing the same. =\r\n I have a few more\ncontacts at Harvard and some west coast universities, bu=\r\nt I can&#39;t\nhonestly expect much from harvard (a harvard student would probab=\r\nly\nhave to stoop pretty low to submit a paper for publication in a\nnon-acad=\r\nemic journal :D), but that is the extent of my connections,\nalthough I do k=\r\nnow &quot;a few people who know people&quot;, so it probably\nwould be a good idea to =\r\nlook to them for input.  I am encouraging\nanyone in a history program to in=\r\nform the staff of their respective\nuniversities.\n\nWe have indicated on the =\r\nwebsite that the authors retain their own\ncopyright, but like you said, I s=\r\nhould probably really highlight that.\n Also, I like the word &quot;interdiscipli=\r\nnary&quot; - that was the intent of\n&quot;free to approach from whichever discipline =\r\nyou wish&quot;, but\n&quot;interdisciplinary&quot; is a great word to use, I&#39;ll fix it up w=\r\nith my\nnext update. I am really interested in the interdisciplinary concept=\r\n,\nand also to really go after the topics that &quot;regular&quot; academics and\njourn=\r\nals avoid, i.e. biography, military history, and narrative\nhistory. I find =\r\ndry meta-analysis boring, but narrative histories that\nbring the history to=\r\n life has always been my favorite.\n\nThe initial ideas for articles that I&#39;v=\r\ne heard so far have been\ninteresting and encouraging (including a person wh=\r\no is using medical\ndatabases and research to examine the cause of death of =\r\nsome Sengoku\nera Daimyo based on the various symptoms listed in primary sou=\r\nrces).\nIt should be all around interesting. I&#39;ve been translating the early=\r\n\n17 century text &quot;Shinchokoki&quot; (record of Oda Nobunaga), so my first\npart w=\r\nill go into the first issue.  I&#39;m also really fascinated with\nNagakura Shin=\r\npachi&#39;s journal, so I hope to translate some of that for\nthe future.  The m=\r\nain thing at the moment is to really get the word\nout about the journal and=\r\n get the submissions. I have a good group of\neditors, as well as some &quot;info=\r\nrmal&quot; editors in the UH Japanese history\nPhD program, so I&#39;m hoping for a p=\r\nretty high quality product.\n\nNot to mention, I have to admit I like the con=\r\ncept of the copyright\nlaws that protect published material far better than =\r\nthe spotty laws\non &quot;publishing&quot; on the internet - I think this is the logic=\r\nal next\nstep. I can publish my translations and make them available, and\nfr=\r\nankly not have to worry about them being copied and pasted into\nwikipedia o=\r\nr other random web pages.\n\n\n"
