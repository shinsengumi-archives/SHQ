But that&#39;s\n&gt; all ^^;;;\n&gt; \n&gt; As I&#39;ll be there till February, I want to visit some\n&gt; famous spots there ^^\n\nI have traveled Aizu only once. \nI went to Wakamatsu castle, Kondou&#39;s grave, Saitou&#39;s grave, Iimori \nmountain, the remains of Shimizuya-inn, and Nyoraidou. \n(Incidentally, I stayed at the Higashiyama hot-spring village.)^^ \n\nWakamatsu castle was destroyed in Boshin war. \n(Now, it is restored.) \nThe source materials of the time are in the museum of the castle. \n\nKondou&#39;s grave is in Tennei-ji (Tennei temple) near the Higashiyama \nhot-spring village.\nHijikata who got injured in the Utsunomiya war went to the \nHigashiyama hot-spring village for three months. \nHe received the bullet in the leg. \nAnd he built Kondou&#39;s grave, doing a hot-spring cure at this hot \nspring. \nKondou&#39;s grave is in the inner part of a mountain. \nThere is a very steep slope there on the way. \nDid Hijikata go up that slope on inconvenient one leg? \nI considered such a thing and went up the slope. \n\nHowever, will Kamo-san attend Aizu in February? \nThe time, Japan is midwinter. \nIf there is much snow, you may be unable to go there. \n\nIn passing, Aizu-bukeyashiki (Aizu Samurai house) is between the \nHigashiyama hot-spring village and Tennei-ji. \nThis is the house in Saigou Tanomo which was Aizu&#39;s minister. \nSasaki Tadasaburou&#39;s grave is in a site. \n\nSaitou&#39;s grave is in Amida-ji (Amida temple) beside the Nanukamachi \nstation in Aizu Line. \nSince it is in the very conspicuous place of the temples, you can \nfind it immediately. \n\nAn Iimori mountain is the place where the boys of Byakko-tai \ncommitted suicide. \nTheir grave is located in the mountain side of a mountain, and you \ncan sense their despair for a view from this place. \n\nA Byakko-tai memorial hall is located in the bottom of it. \nHere, the personal effects of Hijikata or Saitou is exhibited. \nAnd Takizawa-honjin is near this. \n(I forgot to go there.)^^;;; \n\nThere is Shimizuya-inn, if you walk along the road in front of Amida-\nji. \nHijikata stayed here. \n(The signboard only stands now.) Regrettable! \n\nNyoraidou has separated a few from Aizu Wakamatsu. \nIf you believe a map and walk, you will repent. \nNyoraidou is in a paddy field. \nAnd a building is the old hut which is completely valueless. \nHowever, about 20 Shinsengumi members who made Saitou the captain \nhere fought with the enemy. \nThe enemy&#39;s number changes with data. \nSince an enemy&#39;s number was written to be about 300 persons, I was \nvery much surprised at the book which I read first.^^;;; \nSaitou is truly lucky. \n\nIncidentally, Bonari Pass is located in the direction of the \nInawashiro lake. \nIt is far from Aizu Wakamatsu. \nIf you can drive a car, you can go there. \n\n\n&gt; Tama-san and Momoiro Usagi-san: anata tachi wa Aizu\n&gt; chihou ni osumai deshouka? ^^;; Moshi sou deshitara\n&gt; aeru koto ga dekiru deshouka? ^^\n\nI live in Tokyo. \nHowever, I can attend Aizu in about 5 hours from Tokyo. \nIf the day when you come to Aizu is known, I can go there. \n\nTokorode watashi ha Nihongo sika hanasemasen.\nSoredemo daijyoubu desuka?\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
