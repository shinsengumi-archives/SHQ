Someone needs to look at the organic evolution of the corps.\n------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n\nHillsborough&#39;s tone in his texts can=\r\n be improved---however I think if \nhis works were personal essays expressin=\r\ng his personal opinion \nthen .fine. As a professional journalist and author=\r\n he should know the \nimpact of his product.\n\neven he admits that his work i=\r\ns not 100% history (which we all agree is \npart of the Shinsengumi legacy)-=\r\n--however it is possible to \ncategorize &quot;iffy&quot; details as folktales and sol=\r\nid evidence (documents \nrelating Aizu and the Shinsengumi for instance) int=\r\no real history and \nproceed with a study of some sort.  Details which canno=\r\nt be confirmed \ncan easily be footnoted/endnote etc etc (but not abandoned)=\r\n\n\nthis also goes for his other non-Shinsengumi books which are very \npopula=\r\nr ... he and many other researchers are just one step away from \nmaking som=\r\ne historical figures messianic [Mori Arinori is a good \nexample](which in f=\r\nact damages the humanity of the figures they study \nby undermining their co=\r\nmplexity)\n\nan organic view of the corps would be interesting given the inte=\r\nresting \nmix of martial lineages represented in the group\n\nthis was our bra=\r\ninstorm\n\nBlood and Makoto:\nThe Story of the Shinsengumi Told in Three Volum=\r\nes \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/BloodandMakoto.htm\n\nwe await the fan, non-=\r\nfan alike to make this project their own\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
