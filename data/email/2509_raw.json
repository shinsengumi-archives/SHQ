I can&#39;t really make too much of the\ntranslations I&#39;m getting, and the museum&#39;s English site is welcome,\nbut not very informative.  From what I can tell you can&#39;t order from\ntheir museum store online.  Check out the cover to one of the exhibits\nbooks at\nhttp://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/kabuki/closeup/CU20040703A/shinsengumi002.jpg\nIt looks like it might have a lot of photos and information - and the\nEdo Tokyo museum is known to be unusually English friendly.\n\nDoes anyone know anything else about this exhibit?\n\nThanks yo,\nMichael\n\n\n\n"
