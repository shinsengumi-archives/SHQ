That is what I understand from Shinsengumi history (shrugs).\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jon Mesina&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Hey all, this is a question to those who have seen episode 26. And to \n  anyone who knows a lot about Shinsengumi history. This has been on my \n  mind ever since I saw the ep. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; S\n  &gt; P\n  &gt; O\n  &gt; I\n  &gt; L\n  &gt; E\n  &gt; R\n  &gt; \n  &gt; S\n  &gt; P\n  &gt; A\n  &gt; C\n  &gt; E \n  &gt; \n  &gt; The whole incident with the Osaka official Uchiyama Hikojiro is shown in \n  this episode. Now my question is, did this really happen in history? I&#39;m \n  wondering since I never heard anything about this before. If anyone can \n  answer this it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; ~Okita \n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
