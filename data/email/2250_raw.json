I have also seen \ndoz=\r\nens of pics of girls in schools, with long hair, and factory \nworkers all w=\r\nith long hair in a bun too.\n\nTokio may have harbored a mild interest [or] s=\r\nimply adopted the \nfashion of progressive women.  As soon as I can find a r=\r\neally really \ngood quote on women and bank accounts (the amount in the bank=\r\n accout \nis *insignificant)...the opening of bank accounts in their name wa=\r\ns \nalso considered to be RADICAL. Keep in mind that Aizu women in \ngeneral =\r\nwere pretty active in various societies e.g. mentored by \nYamakawa Sutemats=\r\nu (who was very much restrained by her marriage to \nIwao Oyama). Literate w=\r\nomen wrote poems and discussed literature \n(specifically in the Bunkyo area=\r\n, residential areas near Tokyo \nUniversity from my readings on Higuchi Ichi=\r\nyo).  Keep in mind that \nTokio, from a samurai family, shared the harsh exp=\r\nerience of many \nAizu people in the north...she worked until her hands beca=\r\nme rough \nand callous so she may have agreed with the progressive movement.=\r\n\n\nsee pic of mentioned *radical* hair cut  (^_^)\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/ma=\r\nkoto/Meijihaircut.jpg\n\nSievers, Sharon L. Flowers in Salt \nStanford:Stanfor=\r\nd University Press, 1983. ISBN 0804711658\n\n***read this book if you want to=\r\n learn about the female anarchist \nKanno Suga who planned to assasinate the=\r\n Meiji Emperor...she was \nhanged\n\npage 14-15\n&quot;But as more and more Japanese=\r\n men adopted short hairstyles, \nindicating their desire to join the country=\r\n&#39;s march to progress, \nsome women decided to join them, by bobbing their ha=\r\nir.  An \nassociation advocating shorter and more practical hairstyles for \n=\r\nwomen was organized in 1871, in support of the kinds of changes in \nthe gov=\r\nernment was advocating for the male population.  The \ngovernment&#39;s response=\r\n to this uninvited and spontaneous development \nwas immediate.  At first it=\r\n merely called for an end to the new \ncustom of bobbed hair among women, bu=\r\nt in 1872 it made short hair \nfor women illegal.  Even older women who for =\r\nhealth reasons had to \nwear a shorter hairstyle were required under the 187=\r\n2 order to \nobtain a license from the Meiji government before they could ha=\r\nve \ntheir hair cut.  Informally, the government explained that it \nfavored =\r\nan end to the blackened teeth and shaved eyebrows married \nwomen had adopte=\r\nd from an earlier age, but that hairstyles should \nnot be changed.  The Mei=\r\nji Empress made a public appearance in 1873, \ndeomonstrating the correct &quot;l=\r\nook&quot;: long hair, with natural-looking \neyebrows and teeth.  Still, the gove=\r\nrnment&#39;s effort to keep Meiji \nwomen from abandoning the elaborate hairstyl=\r\nes symbolic of the \ngeisha could not be enforced.  Women could always cut t=\r\nheir hair at \nhome, and a number of women active in the struggle for women&#39;=\r\ns \nrights did just that....women cutting their hair can be viewed as a \nrea=\r\nl, if spontaneous, attempt to join the progressive forces trying \nto create=\r\n a new Japan, the government&#39;s denial of their right to do \nso was also a d=\r\nenial of their right to participate and contribute \nactively to that change=\r\n.&quot;\n----------------------\n*imagining* + with some exaggeration\n\nFujita Goro=\r\n and Tokio (head covered by a wrap/hood) stop by the \nBunkyo Ward police st=\r\nation.
