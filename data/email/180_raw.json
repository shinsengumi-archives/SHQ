(takes off white gloves)\n\nThis is my &#39;subdomain&#39;\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/index.html\nbasically I set up a template and stuff...the links should work but no\ncontent yet...it took me a long time to figure out how to reduce the\nfile size for the pics and I had to put filters on many because for\nsome reason the scanner I used just wasn&#39;t doing a great job...so the\npics on the right hand side look &quot;artsy&quot; even though I intended to use\nthe images in their original form.\n\nokay...I have scans from books I want to put up...now would it be\n&quot;safer&quot; to keep uploading pics here in SHQ or put them on a public\nwebsite (but cite the book/author/isbn etc right on the pic)...I just\ndon&#39;t want to get sued :)  I purposefully used pics from Nobori\nNakajima because I figure that there is no copyright on them (at least\nI hope not)...but I will put a disclaimer thing on the bottom of all\npages.\n\nNote:  I would be more than happy to combine this site with any other\nShinsengumi site out there (SHQ site or Shimazuryu&#39;s) mainly because I\nbelieve in one super Shinsengumi headquarters which can address the\n&quot;needs&quot; of this community.....once construction is done you change\nyour password to the account and I no longer have access...I did this\nbefore for a non-profit org and it was a good arrangement.  I only\nwork with html/dreamweaver non of that fancy stuff so once I&#39;m done\nyou can easily change/update content as need be...you have my email.\n\n\n"
