The mixture of new fiction and articles\nexamining the group from different angles have caused Shinsengumi\nenthusiasts to mistaken the novels as revealing new info (posts go\nsomething like this &quot;I read xxxx in the newspaper novel is this true?\n I never heard of this before&quot;.\n\n***there was an interesting post that mentions Japanese politicians\ndiscussing the Shinsengumi on the floor of the Diet or something like that\n\n***there is a book out which babelfish translates as &quot;Shinsengumi\nRevelations&quot; \n\n***the ladies at 3-hajime.com also write &quot;amateur novels&quot;=fanfiction:)\nthe most interesting post at 3-hajime.com is about how this one person\nloves Yamaguchi Jiro/u so I replied trying to ask if she felt that\nYamaguchi Jiro/u was ~different~ from Saitou or if Yamaguchi Jiro/u\nwas featured in some manga or anime.  Can it be that there is an\nentire set of different info (fiction/historical) on Yamaguchi Jiro\nfor this person to be attracted to him, Yamaguchi J., rather than his\ntime in the Shinsengumi?  In any case I found it to be fascinating how\nthe appeal of historical Saitou Hajime comes from the way he\nlives...that is his 3 &quot;bodies&quot; as babelfish put it (I think they are\nonly counting S.H, Y.J., and F.G) and leaving out Denpachi Ichinohe.\n\nLooks interesting...I haven&#39;t had time to babelfish it though\nhttp://www.tamatsukuri.or.jp/shinsen-hp/index.htm\n\nJapanese site w/ fanart and flash animation\nhttp://members10.tsukaeru.net/mach25/makoto/mein.htm\n\nTheir own fanart of Saitou Hajime\nhttp://members10.tsukaeru.net/mach25/makoto/e2/13.htm\n\n\n"
