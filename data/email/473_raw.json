Thi=\r\ns channel 35 is not\npurely Japanese, but there&#39;s also Chinese, Korean, and =\r\nVietnamese\nlanguages and shows at different times (all asian, in short).  I=\r\nf\nanybody else lives in Southern CA and can tell me if it&#39;s the same tv\nsho=\r\nw as the one on NHK, I would greatly appreciate it!
