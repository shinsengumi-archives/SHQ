I&#39;m a \nstudent of Japanese history in college, so I&#39;ve read authoritative sources \non the topic. Death garb is usually white because white is the Buddhist \ncolor of death. However, everyone thinks the Shinsengumi haori was blue \nbecause of the 47 Ronin&#39;s seppuku kimono. This is incorrect, as the blue \nseppuku kimono for the 47 ronin comes from kabuki plays, as does the black \nhaori with the white triangles. So Shinsengumi were inspired more by the \nkabuki 47 ronin than the real ones-- because as you said, dating back to the \nChinese origins of that custom, death colors are white, not blue.\n\nAs much as the 47 ronin are heroes, their history is as murky as that of the \nShinsengumi if not murkier. Another thing to consider about the 47 ronin is \nthe black uniform, brand-new armor, etc. that they&#39;re always portrayed with. \nIt makes no logical sense for 47 men with no income from a liquidated domain \nto be able to afford all of that.\n\nPlease let me know if you have  any additional questions.\n\nThanks.\n\n--Masayoshi\n\n\n\n"
