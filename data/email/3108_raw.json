As to the fan work, \nshould t=\r\nhe work be (example would be art) of the Shinsengumi member \nonly in Shinse=\r\nngumi garb, or can it be different, such as in AU \nroleplays, ML challenges=\r\n, etc.?   \n\n\nCharo Goldstein\nHarrisburg, PA\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nsecretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear SHQ members, recently I b=\r\necame acquainted with a programmer \nwho is\n&gt; willing to assist in the insta=\r\nllation of a database to the website \nto\n&gt; increase its functionality.\n&gt; Th=\r\ne new look of the site, designed by http://www.ai-dax.com will not\n&gt; change=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is one of many ongoing projects at the SHQ which include:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n1) addressing the backlog of history related updates contributed by\n&gt; Hirot=\r\nada Tokugawa\n&gt; 2) updating the site with more info (contributions by \nsecre=\r\ntarytocapt3\n&gt; and also Michael, again there is a backlog of info I have to =\r\nupdate)\n&gt; 3) ofcourse any new contributions from the public and members of =\r\n\nthis\n&gt; community\n&gt; 4) continue to install the new ai-dax layout to each an=\r\nd every page \non\n&gt; the site (this is a labor intensive process which I have=\r\n still not \nyet\n&gt; completed)\n&gt; and now we have this new technical based mat=\r\nter which presented \nitself\n&gt; \n&gt; the programmer is not charging a huge amou=\r\nnt for labor costs (she is\n&gt; not charging a per hour rate or anything) and =\r\nI have explained the\n&gt; circumstance\n&gt; of SHQ...we are all just fans, comple=\r\ntely not for profit and run by\n&gt; volunteers and we have NO BUDGET (other th=\r\nan what we force Barb to \npay for\n&gt; us ^_^).\n&gt; \n&gt; However she is going to u=\r\nse some and software and perhaps acquire \nnew\n&gt; software to make the proces=\r\ns easier (again we aren&#39;t paying for that\n&gt; either\n&gt; and she uses a univers=\r\nity computer lab to do her work).\n&gt; \n&gt; I myself will be assisting in the co=\r\nnstruction of a database which\n&gt; will power the search engine and therefore=\r\n have to devote my free \ntime\n&gt; in summarizing, through keywords, each and =\r\nevery single page. That \nis\n&gt; why the cost is kept low.\n&gt; \n&gt; SHQ&#39;s mission =\r\nis fan based but we clearly also have a deep interest \nin\n&gt; this history. A=\r\ns we&#39;ve slowly gained a better understanding of the\n&gt; Shinsengumi&#39;s world w=\r\ne realize how rare this information is in \nEnglish.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you may ask &#39;ho=\r\nw can I help?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; You can help by contributing any fanwork (fiction, art,=\r\n parody,\n&gt; multimedia) you wish.\n&gt; Volunteer to help list keywords for some=\r\n page.\n&gt; \n&gt; OR\n&gt; \n&gt; contribute to the flat rate of this project.\n&gt; \n&gt; The c=\r\nost of the installation of the database is $40. However, I hope\n&gt; to contin=\r\nue to have a professional relationship with her so that she\n&gt; can help solv=\r\ne other technical issues which may arise in the future\n&gt; and so forth. So I=\r\n feel that the amount is justifiable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will be paying an additional c=\r\nost on my own to her because I have\n&gt; sat down\n&gt; with her gone through the =\r\nsite with her already. Basically she has \nand\n&gt; will be putting in alot of =\r\ntime.\n&gt; I would pay the $40 on my own however I was unemployed at the end o=\r\nf\n&gt; December (but now I am only underemployed) and I cannot handle the\n&gt; fi=\r\nnancial burden on my own. So if people would like to contribute \nany\n&gt; amou=\r\nnt please paypal [shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com]. For the sake of\n&gt; complete tr=\r\nansparency, I can also\n&gt; provide a receipt from this programmer who can ver=\r\nify that she has\n&gt; received payment from me as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; shinsengumihq(a)y=\r\nahoo.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
