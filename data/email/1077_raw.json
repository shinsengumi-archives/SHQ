The yakuza laughed a lot\nbut Nagakura was willing to let go. However, his\ngrandson got enraged and yelled &quot;what do you think you\nare doing to my grandpa?!&quot; to the yakuza, who, in\ntheir turn, got enraged and said in a menacing voice,\n&quot;who do you think you are, shrimp?!&quot;. The boy got\nfrightened and hid himself behind Nagakura. The\nyakuzas said, &quot;out of the way, old man, or else you\ntoo will suffer the consequences!&quot;. Then, Nagakura\nraised his eyebrow, tossed the walking stick away,\nstraightened up his back and, without saying anything,\nglared in such a manner to the yakuza that they got\nfrightened and ran away. Then, Nagakura calmly got his\nstick from the ground, curved his back again and he\nresumed the stroll with his grandson.\n\nBy far, this is my favorite story on Nagakura (though\nthere are many interesting stories about him) ^^ And\nit reminds me of Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid :D\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
