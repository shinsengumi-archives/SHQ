What&#39;s\nthe difference btwn classical Japanese and the language today?\n\nClassical Japanese, or &quot;Bungo&quot; (&quot;Literary-language&quot;), as it&#39;s called,\nbasically uses an incredible amount of kanji and kana (syllabary\ncharacters) that have been dropped as of 1868. Also, the type of\nspoken bungo depended on what social class the person was from. So, a\nfarmer would talk differently than a samurai, the shogun would talk\ndifferently than a ronin, and the Emperor&#39;s bungo was so archaic that\neven when Showa Tenno (Emperor Hirohito) delivered his surrender\nspeech over the radio in 1945, most of the people had no idea what he\nwas talking about.\n\nBy the way, the word &quot;Bungo&quot; in this case is not to be confused with\nthe former province of Bungo (now Oita Prefecture) in Kyushu...\n\n--M.\n\n\n"
