As I don&#39;t have a clue what the titles all refer to, there&#39;s no way of knowing what would be most promising.  I bow to M&#39;s knowledge of Japanese and Tama, who is currently reading a book on Sagara (Tama, is your book one of those on the list?)  Also, being in Japanese won&#39;t do me much good at this point.  HOWEVER, it&#39;s information to create a readily accessible bibliography for those who can read Japanese (or for when I hit the lottery... *smirk*)\n \nI&#39;ve transfered the unique titles to the main entry and on the GJ journal, posted a comment transfering the information on all the editions of the Hasegawa book that came up in your search.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;for Phil, just in case you missed this post\nhttp://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm26.showMessage?topicID=7.topic &lt;&lt;\n \n:-D  Yes I saw it... and I jotted the URL down *somewhere* at the time.  Kind of auspicious, maybe, that Sagara was born not too long (1839) after Oshio&#39;s &quot;save the people&quot; rebellion (1837)?  Thanks for finding the information and providing the quote. Paints an even more interesting picture.  Book information and link to the mb message have been added.\n \nI&#39;ve also added linked banners to the main SHQ site and the mb on the Info Pages of the Sagara and Sekihoutai journals (both GJ & LJ).\n \n&gt;&gt;**when you do research try searching for the more well known friends \nof the person whom you are interested in&lt;&lt;\n \nOne of the main reasons I&#39;ve started reading about Tokugawa Nariaki.  :-D  MissB&#39;s reading of Ravina&#39;s Saigou biography has also provided info.  It&#39;s out there, even in English... just scattered.\n \nThanks *everyone* for all the help!\nphil \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
