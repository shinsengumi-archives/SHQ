Toyohisa Matsue was the son of an Aizu samurai w=\r\nho was exiled \nto Tonami after 1868.\n\nAfter Aizu was defeated in the Boshin=\r\n war of 1868 many samurai \nfamilies were sent up north to survive on their =\r\nown, amongst them \nwould be Yamaguchi Jiro (Ichinohe Denpachi or Shinsengum=\r\ni Saitou \nHajime). (footnote) Some young samurai were sent to Edo/Tokyo and=\r\n \nremained in kinshin generally until 1871---so not all Aizu people \nended =\r\nup in the icy wasteland.\n\nMatsue grew up listening to his father recount th=\r\ne extreme hardship \nthey suffered in Tonami. Therefore he was sympathetic t=\r\no the German \nofficers (during WWI) under his charge. Matsue later became t=\r\nhe \nmayor of Wakamatsu (Fukushima Prefecture--which as basically \nformerly =\r\nAizu-han)\n-------------------------------------\n[Germans + Aizu Connection]=\r\n\nNow going back to 1868, Aizu *did have a German connection too!  The \nSchn=\r\nell brothers sold weapons to Aizu (Thomas Glover was the arms \ndealer to Sa=\r\ntsuma). We have a friend on this list who is reading an \narticle in German =\r\non the Schnell brothers and their activities \nduring the Boshin War.\n------=\r\n-------------------------------\n[Matsue&#39;s Organization Style]\nMatsue ran th=\r\ne prison camp in a somewhat similar way to pre-1868 \nhangakko (samurai scho=\r\nols for domains) which influenced Meiji era \ndorms for men and women.  That=\r\n style is translated roughly as &quot;self-\ngovernance&quot; where the students (in t=\r\nhis case prisoners) disciplined \nthemselves.  Self-governance was used in d=\r\norms connected to the \nWomen&#39;s Normal School (different variations on the n=\r\name depending on \nyear) where Takagi/FUJITA Tokio worked.\n\nThus, from this =\r\nfascinating connection you can see how war \nexperiences affect more than on=\r\ne generation.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;k kobayakawa&quot; &lt;kobaya635@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe some people never heard this movie.\n&gt; &quot;Bart no gakuen&quot; is =\r\nbased on historical fact.\n&gt; &quot;Plot Outline: German soldiers are transported =\r\nto a prisoner-of-\nwar camp in\n&gt; Japan after the First World War&quot;\n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.imdb.com/title/tt0484095/\n&gt; \n&gt; The prison treated prisoners with humanit=\r\ny because the prison \ndirector\n&gt; Col.Matsue was son of Aizu samurai.\n&gt; So n=\r\now we know why.\n&gt; \n&gt; This page has pictures of filming the movie in Aizu.\n&gt;=\r\n There scenes that Aizu people were heading to Tonami.\n&gt; \nhttp://www.city.a=\r\nizuwakamatsu.fukushima.jp/j/kanko/baruto/04aizuroke.\nhtm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2006/6/=\r\n24, k kobayakawa &lt;kobaya635@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It says the old man with whit=\r\ne mustache is Saito Hajime.\n&gt; &gt; The picture was taken at a wedding party in=\r\n early Taisho period.\n&gt; &gt; The blog owner is the 14th head of Aizawa family,=\r\n descendant of\n&gt; &gt; Aizu-han-shi since Takato-han.\n&gt; &gt; The last post says he=\r\n/she gave the picture to him and able to \nidentify\n&gt; &gt; each persons.\n&gt; &gt; He=\r\n/She has other Fujita related pictures and references that \nconnected to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the movie &quot;Bart no Gakuen&quot; http://www.bart-movie.jp/\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s really in=\r\nteresting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2006/6/24, secretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;    \nhttp://www.aizu.com/shinsengumi/archives/2005/05/post_16.html#commen=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the information really really really needs to be tran=\r\nslated\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can someone please hellllppp????\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) somethin=\r\ng about *another photo of Fujita Goro (and his \nfamily) at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aizu?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) NEW information on YAMAGUCHI JIRO?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) someone posted=\r\n saying that he/she was able to identify \nhis/her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ancestor in the pho=\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah alot of Shinsengumi info is more hard to find becuase\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; everything is being blogged and replies don&#39;t get &quot;bumped up&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I had a very very long week, including my laptop which has some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; n=\r\notes to use for the timeline DYING (my laptop is named Toshi \nby the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nway---Toshiba Satellite)...but I managed to retrieve some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff...whe=\r\nw!...there is some data loss but nothing to angst \nover\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (too much)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message hav=\r\ne been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
