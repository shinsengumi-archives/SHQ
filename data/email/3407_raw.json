He was looking over all \nthe =\r\nJapanese paraphenelia I have at my cubicle and asked if I spoke \nor read Ja=\r\npanese. Unfortunately I read none and my speech is well \nenough to get me a=\r\nround but not fluent.\nHe said that back in the 60&#39;s he had purchases a Haba=\r\nchi in Japan for \n$20. The drawers were all swollen shut from the humidity.=\r\n When he had \nfinally dried the desk out and was able to open the drawers h=\r\ne found \ninside a box and inside that box was a scroll. He hired a translat=\r\nor \nbut the language was too old for the translator and all he could \ntrans=\r\nlate was the writing on the box that said Commodore Perry.\nAt this point my=\r\n jaw dropped to the ground. And I tried not to laugh \nwhen he said that tha=\r\nt dated the scroll back to the 1700&#39;s lol. I \npolitely corrected him. :)\nSo=\r\n the reason he was asking me if i read Japanese was he wanted to \nsee if I =\r\ncould translate it. I couldn&#39;t but my bestfriend&#39;s mother \nmight. Her mothe=\r\nr grew up in a Buddhist Temple and is very interested \nin her history. \nSo =\r\nhe&#39;s going to bring the scroll in and have my friends mom \ntranslate it. I&#39;=\r\nm so excited!! I can&#39;t wait to actually touch a peice \nof history that I lo=\r\nve so much.\nI&#39;ll keep everyone informed when i get it. I&#39;ll take pictures a=\r\nnd \npost them somewhere for all to see. \n\nKira\n\n\n"
