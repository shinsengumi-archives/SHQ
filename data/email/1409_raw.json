I don&#39;t know all \nthe \n&gt; &gt; details, but here&#39;s a small summary i found on it\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a famous samurai of Shinsengumi, Soji Okita as a woman, \n&gt; Toshizo \n&gt; &gt; Hijikata and Ryoma Sakamoto rival for her affections.\n&gt; &gt; Director Mitsuyuki Yakushiji \n&gt; &gt; Cast Ken Watanabe / Riho Makise / Tetta Sugimoto \n&gt; &gt; Running time 105min \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunetly i haven&#39;t found any place where they&#39;re selling it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ohh i just found a better summary\n&gt; \n&gt; In the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, there was a cute \nwarrior, \n&gt; Souji Okita, who belonged to the armed police of the shogunate in \n&gt; Kyoto. Very few knew that Souji was not a boy, but a woman. Souji \n&gt; loved the vice-leader of the armed police, Toshizou Hijikata. Souji \n&gt; suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and coughed up blood during a \n&gt; battle. Toshizou helped her but said that he did not care for the \n&gt; girl with a smell of blood. Souji had a real talent for \nswordsmanship \n&gt; and no one but Ryouma Sakamoto could compete with her. Ryouma was a \n&gt; liberal intellectual and tried to carry out a revolution without \n&gt; blood. However, the bloody Meiji Restoration broke out and Souji \n&gt; killed Ryouma who lost his dream. Because a friendship had sprung \nup \n&gt; between Toshizou and Ryouma, Toshizou got angry and slashed at \nSouji \n&gt; with a sword. Unwillingly, she unsheathed her sword and thought \nthat \n&gt; she might get love if she was killed by the man she loved.\n\nYes I do remember this one... Actually for the group Barb did a \nfilmography and this was included... Check out other films at \nwww.shinsengumihq.com/film.htm and you can also check out \nwww.shinsengumidb.com and search for films. What else... Thanks for \nthe additional info, I&#39;ll update the movie in the db.\n\n\n"
