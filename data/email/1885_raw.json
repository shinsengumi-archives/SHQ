Father&#39;s name was Gensuke and mother&#39;s name was Taki. Taki was \nthe daughter of 11th generation of Shinohara familly.\nShinohara go to Edo at the age of 31 and met Ito through his friend Kano.\nIn Shinsengumi, he was &quot;Shoshi shirabe yaku ken Kansatsu&quot; (same function \nas Yamazaki which consists of &quot;Shoshi shirabeyaku&quot; intelligence agency \nfor the outside and &quot;Kansatsu&quot; inspection of activities of the members, \nso investigation of inside.)\nAnd he was also a Jujutsu teacher.\n\nHe married twice. The first wife was called Hagino and probably he might \n  marry before 1863 as their son has 5 years in 1867.\nShinohara called Hagino and son to Kyoto later when he joined to \nShinsengumi.\n\n( I didn&#39;t mention here about Ito and Goryo eji as some facts are \nalready known)\n\nAfter Aburano Koji affair(18 nov), Shinohara escaped and hide in the \nhouse of a person related to an Imperial prince called Gyoubu Ozaki. \nShinsengumi come to search him in the morning or 19 but they couldn&#39;t \narrest Shinohara as they didn&#39;t dare force someone related to Imperial \nfamily.\nSo Shinohara could move to Satsuma clan&#39;s mansion and joined to  Miki there.\n\nHagino felt an uneasiness in the early morning of 19, and she came out \nto the outside still dark though, then a servant came to see her and \nsaid simply, &quot;There was a trouble!&quot;, and run away soon.\nShe headed to Gesshin in, Goryo eji&#39;s quarter but nobody was there.\nThen she went to the house of someone she knew in Miyagawa town( that&#39;s \nsupposed to be Ito&#39;s mistress&#39;s house) . While she was in that \nhouse,Shinsengumi came to search her and she heard they saying to the \nmaster that they had seen Shinohara&#39;s wife entered that house and asking\nto hand her over to them.\nMeanwhile, Hagino escaped from the back door and went to Ozaki&#39;s house \nalong the river bank. As Ozaki told her whereabouts of her husband, she \nwent to Satsuma mansion and could see him again in the noon of 20. She \nwas also joined by Ito&#39;s mistress and Tadao Arai&#39;s wife there.\nLater Shinohara and his wife were sheltered in the Satsuma mansion in \nFushimi and Hagino.\nAfter Shinohara attempted to shoot Kondo with the others, Hagino had to \nchange move different places to hide.\n\nI think writing something more short at the beginning but that become \nhorribly long so, to be continued...( when I have time)\n\n(This is the resume from Shinohara&#39;s bio from &quot;100 anecdotes of \nShinsengumi&quot;, and &quot;Rekishi dokuhon &quot; Shinsengumi and women&quot; special issue.)\n\nTama\n\n\nsecretary wrote:\n\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; Pic\n &gt; http://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/shinohara.jpg\n &gt;\n &gt; Book ISBN 4056032831\n &gt;\n &gt; Can someone please refresh my memory as to Shinohara&#39;s position in\n &gt; the Shinsengumi (did skim Serizawa Kamo&#39;s bio)...and the Sekihoutai\n &gt; connection???\n &gt;\n &gt; Thanx\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; Yahoo!
