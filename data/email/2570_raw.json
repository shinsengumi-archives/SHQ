Perhaps all three.)\n\nI got my copy yesterday and have read a few bits and pieces of it so far.\nIt&#39;s quite good and has a lot of information in it.  It also has a lot of\nthe author&#39;s opinions, but the distinction between what&#39;s fact and what&#39;s\nbiased opinion seems to be fairly clear for the most part.  It seems\nwell-written and very readable.  Anyway, I&#39;m so glad it finally came out and\nwe finally have a source in English for a lot of this history.\n\n\n\n"
