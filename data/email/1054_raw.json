I don&#39;t think RK \nSaitou would actually go home and &quot;inspect&quot; the house if it is to his \nliking. But if he did, Barb captured the Hajime x Tokio moment for me.\nAt home I think RK Saitou would probably be dong as he just did at \nwork and have an ashtray full of cigarette butts... Then Tokio will \nget crosses on her forehead as she smells him smoking inside the \nhouse again... She&#39;ll go into their study room but RK Saitou would \nknow right away that he&#39;s busted so he either hides the ashtray into \nthe drawer (under the table or behind some books) to avoid an \nargument... or make it even more messier and wait for Tokio to come \nin so they can start &quot;bantering&quot; (that&#39;s if he&#39;s feeling humorous... \nNow all this would be set at night when every door is closed and Mrs. \nSaitou has given instructions not to wake the children by going \noutside and such... because I really do think RK Saitou would be nice \nenough to smoke outside, even if he is a baddie...\n\nAh well.... Come on and give us your Saisa version Phil...  &quot;Futae no \nKiwami&quot; isn&#39;t enough. ^_^\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; :-D  Barb, you come up with some screamers!  I think someone should \ndo a doujinshi including stuff like this... the trials and \ntribulations of being married to Saitou Hajime.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Putting this in a SaiSa mode, while I consider Sanosuke to be \nrelatively neat for all his ruffian ways, can you imagine Saitou \nbeing like that with Sano???  Can you say, &quot;Futae no kiwami!&quot;?  :-D\n&gt;  \n&gt; One thing I&#39;ve always liked about RK Saitou... his general laid \nback nature and his little &quot;rebelling&quot; at not wearing his jacket \ncompletely buttoned-up... kind of like his agreeing to work for the \nMeiji government (because they need him, obviously), but he&#39;s going \nto hold out on being a *completely* proper Meiji cop as a way of \nretaining some independence.  How neat can he be when he lets \ncigarette ash fall all over the place and at least in the manga, \nfills ashtrays to overflowing?  Ah, but I guess that&#39;s Tokio&#39;s \nresponsibility, even if she probably did have a maid to do the \nhousework.\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Warg3791@a... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Can you imagine Saito doing that to Tokio?!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Tokio---&quot;Fine.
