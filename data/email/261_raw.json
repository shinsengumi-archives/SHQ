(Author&#39;s note: Real historical fact)\nDo you realize\nthat the country was at peace?\n\nYou see a sword\nand smell murder.\n\nI see a sword\nand see the extension of a soul.\n\nThe word &quot;samurai&quot;\nmeans &quot;one who serves&quot;.\nThey lived with war\nso others wouldn&#39;t.\nThey lived in harmony\nwith nature.\nWhatever was taken from\nthe earth in those daysd\nwas returned to it.\nIn the days of the shoguns\nthe water\nfrom the Sumida River\nin Edo was clean enough\nto brew tea with.\nNot any more!\nAre the samurai so bad,\nso vile and vicious?\n\nYou see a murderer,\nI see a protector.\n\nYou smell blood,\nI see falling cherry blossoms.\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu\nbrought the nation\nout of centuries of war.\nDo you think he&#39;s evil for that?\nGranted, the Tokugawa\nruled with an iron fist--\nbut would it have been better\nfor the country to have\nstayed in perpetual strife?\n\nYou smell blood\nI smell toil.\n\nYou see a sword\nI see a code.\n\nAre they so evil?\nAre they so cruel and heartless?\nYou speak of haiku--\ndo you so easily forget\nthat Matsuo Basho himself\nwas a samurai of Iga province?\nAre the 47 loyal retainers\nevil for avenging their lord?\nYou say that their period, the Genroku era,\nwas the high point of Edo culture.\nWas that not also\nthe most corrupt part\nof the Tokugawa era?\n\nYou see a sword\nI see a spirit.\n\nYou see murder\nI see fidelity in revenge.\n\n----------\n\n\n"
