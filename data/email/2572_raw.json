It certainly isn&#39;t the noble version\nof history that the taiga tries to portray.&quot;\n\nThe Taiga drama is definately just an inspirational drama. I know what\nS is talking about, &quot;noble version of history&quot; is really just a dream.\nPerhaps that is the value of fiction, to allow people to define on\ntheir own what is &quot;good&quot; which may be difficult if nearly impossible\nto find in reality. So in the end perhaps we just internalize what is\nheroism and look to ourselves for that ideal.\n\nFirst the prize:  Brand new copy of Romulus Hillsborough&#39;s book\nshipped right to your door from Amazon. Or, one brand new Shinsengumi\nrelated dvd. ***see bottom for other possible prize\n\nHow to win: write the most awesome, compelling essay to justify the\npragmatics of attacking Aizu you have to be a 110% hardcore advocate\nfor the Imperialists. Nobody is going to shred your argument---however\nthey must be sound/logical/organized and backed up with atleast 5\ntextual sources (no websites/online encyclopedias).  Your essay will\nbe donated to shinsengumihq.com but will remain your property under\nyour name.  file will be posted as a adobe pdf.\n\nAs it stands, the northern alliance was actually the last stronghold\nfor the bakufu.  Enomoto had other plans.  \n\nReason:  The most ideal way of studying this era is to examine it in\n&quot;teams&quot;.  EAch team handles a domain such as Tosa, Satsuma, Choshu,\nAizu, Imperial FAmily, Shogunate and freeby foreign powers. EAch team\nshould be an advocate for his or her domain and use only the reasons\nor &quot;evidence&quot; available to people at that time. Get in a room and\nargue it out.\n\nUnfortunatley, we&#39;re just a bunch of fans---we don&#39;t have all day to\nstudy all sides of the issue.  But we know that more than one side\nneeds to be studied.\n\nHence, this contest is a &quot;shortcut&quot; for just compiling facts.  \n\nLength of paper---as long or short as you want.  We just want the\nfacts.  If your paper ends up being 50% the philosophical motivations\nof the Imperialists then you need to look more carefully at the\nhistorical details.  Short sentences are good.\n\nNote: you must be careful in citing your sources, use footnotes and a\nbibliography using MLA format----paraphrasing someone else&#39;s words too\nclosely also constitutes plagiarism.\n\nDeadline NOvember 18\n\nIf the essay is SO truly jaw-droppingly awesome to convert a\nShinsengumi fan to the side of the imperialists then you may win a\nShinsengumi haori made in Japan.\n\nThis is an exercise in going to the &quot;other side&quot;. \n\nsecretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com\n\n\n\n"
