I guess thats another difference in JSA, how in kendo you\nhit, and in iai you cut. It feels really weird to go through kata\nwhere I continuously cut through/into your opponent and then go to\npartner prractice where I have to stop short of hitting my partner.\nCourse to hit or cut in reality it doesn&#39;t matter since as long as you\nreach your opponent with the weapon, thats all that matters in the\nend. Do you by chance have a training manequin(sp)? When I was at my\nformer iai school that also happened to teach kendo, they used to\nbring out a sort of training dummy (vs each other) for cutting\nexercises for the new students.   \n\n***reaching your opponent in an efficient and timely manner is really\nREALLY hard because the proper kendo walking technique is always\nenforced...your right foot pushing off with left foot in mind and your\ntrying to move fast is hard...but kendo &quot;walking&quot; best on smooth\nwooden floors is not necessarily used in old kenjutsu lineages I\nunderstand.\n\n***only the more advance students seem to understand the value of\n&quot;follow through&quot; when they aren&#39;t practicing on an opponent because\ne.g. how at the end of the motion your head tends to tilt slightly\nforward and the teacher tries to keep correcting this error and there\nis the whole issue of shinai&#39;s tip almost hitting the floor.  There\nare definate advantages and disadvantages to practicing on an opponent\nand on your own...the mirror is pretty cool to work with ^_^ so you\ncan check to see if the sword tip is pointed at your throat and your\nfeet are straight (without having to looke &quot;down&quot;---you have no idea\nhow funny when some of us are looking down at are feet and saying &quot;are\nmy feet okay I don&#39;t want sore ankles&quot;)\n\n***we don&#39;t have mannequins I guess due to the small number of\nstudents in the club but during the class (for credits) they use\nvolleyball net/poles wrapped with mats and I&#39;ve seen students practice\non these.\n\n***all newbies such as myself are okay when we are practicing on our\nown and the instructor says our posture is good...but when we practice\non each other we end up messing up on footwork and our left wrists\nstart rotating under the shinai hilt...which got me thinking that its\ndue to our lack of stamina and the length of practice in hot/humid\nconditions as well as what I call the &quot;sloth&quot; factor--we get\nlazy...now for samurai or any medieval warrior back in the day on the\nbattlefield how in the world did they take on multiple opponents and\nconserve strength and maintain efficiency in movement is simply beyond\ncomprehension.\n\n\n"
