Her father(?) was an instructor in gunnery...and the whole bit\nabout cutting hair is because she and other women had to disguise\nthemselves as men\n\nI can&#39;t believe I found this link from reading a humorous/silly fanfic\ninvolving Yamaguchi Jiro wearing a western uniform at Aizu (all the\nmen around him noticed how handsome he looked wearing it) and learning\nhow to use a gun...and just about every guy (including Hijikata)\naround him chasing after him @_@\n\n\n"
