The tw=\r\no of them have lived extensive periods in Japan, and actually one of them i=\r\ns still actually living there after having just finished her thesis, involv=\r\ning the Meiji period, precisely.\n \nHaving said this, you can imagine that w=\r\ne were SLIGHTY irked at the liberality shown by the writers of the drama co=\r\nncerning the &#39;everybody had met everybody and had been pals just before the=\r\n actual revolution&#39;. We had two choices: stopping watching it altogether, o=\r\nr make abstraction of the said historical horrors.\n \nWe chose the second pa=\r\nth. You see, the reasoning behind it is the same why we enjoy fanfiction. I=\r\nt&#39;s fiction, playing with actual history.\nBattousai never existed, right? S=\r\noujirou never killed Okubo, or am I wrong? \nBut even then, we can enjoy Wat=\r\nsuki&#39;s work. At least, I know I do. They key in this is knowing the actual =\r\nfacts, and separating them from fiction. I know that due the massive impact=\r\n the media have over viewers, the inaccurate handling of the facts have a r=\r\nepercussion in how they perceive the real facts later. An example: take The=\r\n Alamo. It&#39;s historically more accurate than the J. Wayne  version. However=\r\n, it was its downfall. People hated it because of the darker aspects of the=\r\n real history.\nThis is not happening in Japan though, with this drama. In f=\r\nact, the ratings are lower than other samurai dramas of similar length, jus=\r\nt because of these inaccuracies. \n \nObviously, outside Japan, it can affect=\r\n how viewers perceive the unfolding of the real events, but I believe that =\r\neven the most naive viewer would shake his/her head knowing that it&#39;s kind =\r\nof impossible that all the main characters knew each other previously. mayb=\r\ne they KNEW each other swordsman&#39;s reputation, the name of their dojos, hav=\r\ne crossed in challenges, etc. But certainly they didn&#39;t foster friendships.=\r\n JMO.\n \nI think I understand why they (the writers) choose this path. Both =\r\nparties wanted essentially the same: to be independent , to avoid the horro=\r\nrs of Western dominance in neighboring China, and to become a strong, devel=\r\noped nation. The means and path to follow were what they clashed. After all=\r\n, the bearers of the &#39;expel the foreigners, revere the Emperor&#39; were ironic=\r\nally those who opened the doors to the contact with the West. But what thei=\r\nr tactics allowed Japan to do it more or less in its own terms. Trying to k=\r\neep Japan absolutely closed to the world would have prompted  a reaction ve=\r\nry similar to what China suffered during and after the Opium Wars. I think =\r\nthe Shogunate had this in mind during the turbulent times that lead to the =\r\nBakumatsu, and that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t act with the haste required by the Ch=\r\nosuu party. And obviously, there was a social/cultural decadence that requi=\r\nred a social reform too. If you watch the drama, you&#39;ll see that they hint =\r\nat least twice that both\n parties had common points and ideas. Personally, =\r\nI think the scenario where the members of both parties are shown socializin=\r\ng is a symbolism, a way to make people understand that both wanted a better=\r\n, stronger and independent Japan. Also, you&#39;ll see the social barriers and =\r\ntenets that time required to be changed. Now, to understand this, I think i=\r\nt&#39;s necessary to grasp a basic knowledge of the actual history...\n \nMy advi=\r\nce is to take it all with a grain of salt (a BIG one), and do serious resea=\r\nrch. The fabulous recourses in this ML and the associated sites are a good =\r\nstart. Newbies can consult the list or recommended readings in this ML to h=\r\nave a wider vision. Consider the drama as a big, big and expensive fanfic, =\r\nshowing chapters every week.\n \nNow, Alan, if you can&#39;t enjoy it like this, =\r\nit would be better to stop watching it ASAP, because you&#39;ll surely find you=\r\nrself very frustrated, as I was in the beginning.... JMO, by the way.\n \nSee=\r\n you all!\nFiruze.\n \n \n-------Mensaje original-------\n \nDe: SHQ@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\nFecha: 08/28/04 19:52:58\nPara: SHQ@yahoogroups.com\nAsunto: [SHQ] Re: Hi=\r\n\n\n \nThis is very poor reasoning.
