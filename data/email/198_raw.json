I -highly- recommend \nthat you read the character profiles [first] because it seems to have been \nbased on a manga because the profiles contain info not mentioned \n(clearly) in the movie.  PMK Maro fans (if there are any out there--scary \nthought)...will find an equally twisted Ohni Hime in this film.  The film \nimplies sexual content. For those of us who *appreciate* gorgeous 2D \nmen, this film has 4 knights of the Defense Ministry which are \nabsolutely...GQ material...and they and the women in the film are all \ndrawn to look Asian.  The character design is really interesting because \nit doesn&#39;t rely on what we are used to to distinguish different characters \n(hair color etc). I&#39;m pretty surprised this film is not more widely known \nbecause it is ELEGANT and contains an intriguing plotline. FOUR \nSTARS!!!!!\n\n\n"
