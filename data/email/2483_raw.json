(Vol 6 is due to be released in September.)  It&#39;s the third of those\narcs that deals with the Bakumatsu and includes the Shinsengumi.  The series\nas a whole follows the practitioners of a particular unarmed fighting style\ncalled Mutsu Enmei.  Each arc is about a different character and it jumps\ngenerations between the arcs.  In fact, it jumps nearly 200 years between\nthe second and third arcs, so there&#39;s no characters in common there, and the\nonly plot association between them is that the earlier arcs helped establish\nthe Mutsu Enmei style as legendary.  With such a loose association between\narcs, there&#39;s no problem with starting at the beginning of any one of them.\nIf you want to begin with the Bakumatsu arc, you should start at the\nbeginning of volume 4:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0008FPIMM/\nThe link Secretary provided above is actually to Volume 5, which continues\nthis arc.  (Although strangely, the Amazon listing doesn&#39;t specify its\nvolume number).\n\nThe third arc is excellent.  Aside from including the Shinsengumi (which of\ncourse is what drew me to the series in the first place) it presents the\nbest view of the history of the period I&#39;ve seen attempted in an anime.  The\nlead character, Mutsu Izumi, becomes close friends with Sakamoto Ryoma, and\nit follows his endeavors throughout the revolution.\n\nThe first two arcs are also fun to watch, but they&#39;re not nearly as\nimpressive as the Bakumatsu arc, probably because they aren&#39;t dealing with\nsuch a turbulent historical era.  (They take place about 20 years apart,\nboth in the early years of the Tokugawa shogunate, in order to pit the lead\ncharacters against first Miyamoto Musashi, and then Yagyu Juubei.)\n\nBecause the Amazon listings are sort of confusing (such as not consistently\nincluding volume numbers), here&#39;s which is which:\nVolume 1 (cheaper version):\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002ZYE78/\nVolume 1 (expensive version):\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00076OMZG/\nIt&#39;s not clear from the descriptions why there are two different versions of\nthe first volume.  Presumably the more expensive of the two is probably a\nspecial edition or maybe includes a series box or something, but I don&#39;t\nreally know what its extra features are.\nVolume 2: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00068NWI8/\nVolume 3: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00076OMZQ/\nVolume 4: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0008FPIMM/\nVolume 5: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0009G3BLU/\nVolume 6: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000A2XA6O/\n\n\n"
