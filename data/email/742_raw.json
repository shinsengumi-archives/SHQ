I know that taking photos back then was not an instant\nprocess as it is today but some of those guys looked like they didn&#39;t\neven care.  What&#39;s up with the guy+fan anyways.\nOh, almost forgot again...3-hajime in the first forum one of the\nladies said something along the lines that photos from/related to the\nSeinan Wars still illicits alot of emotions/feelings from people...I\nthink this is different from the American Civil War because as someone\nborn+raised on the WEST coast it just seems that people aren&#39;t\nconnected to the Civil War while people in the Midwest+East Coast may\neven live near battlefields or their direct ancestors fought in the\nwar have a totally different view.\n\n\n"
