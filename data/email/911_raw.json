I guess if someone asks momoirousagi about\n&gt; those actors, most probably she&#39;ll know all of them\n&gt; :D\n&gt; \n&gt; ***I listed some old Japanese films I saw and their\n&gt; directors and\n&gt; momoiro insists that in Japan it is actually\n&gt; difficult to purchase old\n&gt; films and they aren&#39;t shown on TV as much\n&gt; (especially chambara which\n&gt; fell out of favor a couple of decades ago)....\n\n\nThat seems to be true, unfortunately. Except on few\nchannels (like Toei TV Channel, which has a section\nexclusively on chambara movies), it&#39;s hard to see a\nchambara movie. And somehow it&#39;s hard to find them\nvideos available. I remember that I had some hard time\ntill I found that Mifune Toshiro&#39;s movie on the\nShinsengumi.\n\n\n&gt; Serizawa, I&#39;m sorry to hear about your teacher&#39;s\n&gt; passing.  You have my\n&gt; deepest sympathy. Take Care.\n\n\nOh, no, no, sorry for the confusion &gt;_&lt; My master has\npassed a few years ago (three, to be more accurate),\nit&#39;s nothing recent.
