Japanese history, like all history around the world, is a bloody mess.\n\n2. History is written by the victors. Why do you think the Shinsengumi is so \nhard to research, much less write serious papers on? I know this for a \nfact-- I wanted to write my senior thesis on them, but I&#39;ve had to &quot;enlarge&quot; \nmy topic because Shinsengumi is too &quot;small&quot;. I&#39;m going to write about Aizu \ninvolvement in the Bakumatsu, which will include Shinsengumi and \nMimawarigumi, but even that will run into some problems, because we still \nlive in a world where Katsura, Takasugi, and Miyabe are the &quot;great men&quot;, \ninstead of everyone in that era being individually judged for their own \nworth.\n\n3. People from a culture generally know their own history the best. Trust me \non this-- if you&#39;ve learned something from the very very beginning of your \nlife, and if you&#39;ve learned it as part of your identity, then you are \nDEFINITELY going to know it better than someone who starts learning it from \nthe outside and later.\n\n4. The best avenue for historical discussion is calm, logical, preferably \nfriendly, and preferably light-hearted debate. Why scream at each other? Try \nto keep things in perspective, and remember-- it&#39;s HISTORY. It happened, and \nyou can&#39;t change what happened. However, just because it happened doesn&#39;t \nmean it&#39;s over. History is being rewritten all the time-- this group is \nliving proof of it.\n\nI&#39;d like to extend my thanks to each and every member of this group for \nproviding me, probably the only historian in the East Asian Studies major on \nmy campus, with an avenue for expression. This group is priceless for \nme...here, I have all the peers and discussion partners in Japanese history \nthat I almost never had before.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
