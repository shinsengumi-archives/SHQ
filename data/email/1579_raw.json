I&#39;ll answer these questions for you.\n\n&gt;-Full name: Hijikata Toshizou Yoshitoyo. (Anyone know if he had another \n&gt;childhood name, or if he ever changed it later in life?)\n\nNot that I know of...he was Hijikata Toshizou Yoshitoyo pretty much all the \nway throughout life.\n\n&gt;- He was the youngest of 6 children, and had 3 brothers and 2 sisters. The \n&gt;younger sister&#39;s name was Onobu (she later married Sato Hikogorou). I read \n&gt;somewhere that the oldest brother&#39;s name was Kiroku, and the Shinsengumi! \n&gt;NHK series gives another brother&#39;s name as Tamajirou.\n\nHe was actually the youngest of nine children, although maybe only six \nsurvived to adulthood...Onobu&#39;s original name was Otoku-- and she indeed \nmarried Satou Hikogorou, who was Toshizou&#39;s first cousin. The siblings I \nhave the names of are Kiroku, Tamejirou, Daisaku, Shuu (maybe I&#39;m reading \nthe kanji wrong-- it&#39;s the same &quot;Shuu&quot; as in &quot;Kondou Shuusuke&quot;), and \nOnobu/Otoku.\n\n&gt;- According to one site, both his parents died when he was very young (IIRC \n&gt;it even said that his father was already dead by the time Toshizou was \n&gt;born). The older of his sisters also died early.\n\nIIRC?\n\nHijikata Izaemon indeed did die before Toshizou was born. At age 5, Toshizou \nlost his mother, Etsu. Following that, he was brought up by his formerly \nseparated (comment: might be �estranged�, but I don�t know�) elder brother \nKiroku and his wife.\n\n&gt;- I understand he got to know (the future) Kondou Isami when they were both \n&gt;in their late teens. Sources differ on whether he joined the Tennen Rishin \n&gt;ryuu at this time, and simply didn&#39;t become a *resident* student until \n&gt;later, or if he didn&#39;t in fact join until he was 28 (I think that&#39;s the \n&gt;right age)\n\nI think they might&#39;ve known each other in their childhood...but I&#39;m not \nsure.\n\n&gt;- He lost another job at 17, this time he was working at a clothing store, \n&gt;and got fired for sleeping with one of his female co-workers. It was after \n&gt;this that his brother in law helped him set himself up as a medicine \n&gt;peddler.\n\nI can&#39;t remember who it was, but I read somewhere that Hijikata indeed \nworked in a kimono shop at some point, and was kicked out for having an \naffair with one of the (female) customers. Watsuki Nobuhiro-sensei \nelaborates on this, using it as (or so I&#39;ve heard) the historical basis for \nwhy Shinomori Aoshi looks so much like Hijikata.\n\n&gt;Oh, and a bonus question &lt;grins&gt; Does anyone know much about the \n&gt;relationship between Hijikata and Okita Souji?\n\nThere&#39;s some stuff in this regard that I&#39;m not quite sure on, but I&#39;m trying \nto sort...Okita&#39;s sister, Mitsu, was married to Rintarou, who was adopted \ninto the Okita family, although he was originally, like Kondou and Hijikata, \na farmer from Tama. His original family name was Inoue-- possibly pointing \nto a family connection between Okita and Inoue Genzaburou...although I&#39;m not \nsure. Hijikata, as it&#39;s commonly known, probably did have a brotherly \nrelationship with Okita, though, and I think he even visited him in the \nhospital in Edo before the Shinsengumi retreated to Aizu.\n\nIf there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like to know, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE* \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
