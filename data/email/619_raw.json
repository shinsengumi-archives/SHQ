In\nthe 1st year of the Genji Era, he joins the\nShinsengumi, along with his elder brother.\n\nAt this time, both change their names: the elder\nbrother names himself as Kashitarou and the younger\nbrother as Mikisaburou.\n\nHe was the Captain of the 9th Division and was also\ninvolved in the Intelligence.\n\nHaving the fief of Satsuma as their supporter, he\nbecomes a Kinri Goryo Eji.\n\nAfter the murder of his elder brother, on November\n18th, he stays at the fief house of Satsuma, planning\nthe murder of Kondou.\n\nOn December 9th, he is one of the people who shoots\nKondou while Kondou was walking at Sumizome, in Kyoto,\nbut they manage only to wound Kondou, without killing\nhim.\n\nAfter taking part in the War of Toba and Fushimi, he\nbecame the Captain of the 2nd Division of the\nSekihoutai.\n\nHe tried many things to exact revenge upon the\nShinsengumi, but he found himself in the new era\nwithout fulfilling his wishes.\n\nHe became a policeman in the Meiji Era, and when he\nwas an Officer at the Tsuruoka police, he spent all\nhis money to build a hospital (hospitals?)\n\nAfter that, he spent the rest of his life in Ishioka,\nhis homeland, living till the 8th year of the Taisho\nEra, dying at the age of 83.\n\n------------\n\nThat&#39;s more or less what the fishy part says...\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
