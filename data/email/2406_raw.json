This post contains some spoilers. \n\nI think I&#39;ve told already about this manga, but I&#39;m not sure if I posted here \nor not.\n\nI&#39;m talking about the manga of Misaki Saitou about Shinsengumi &quot;Hinata no \nOokami&quot;(Wolves in the sunshine) that I&#39;ve just read the 2nd volume recently come \nout.\n\nI put the links to amazon.jp for volumes published for those who might have \ninterest.\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4344804538/ref=pd_bxgy_text_2/249-972\n5298-2705928\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/434480533X/qid=1112364620/sr=1-1/ref=\nsr_1_10_1/249-9725298-2705928\n\nAnd here is the link for the artist&#39;s site.\nhttp://www.linkclub.or.jp/~misaki-2/shinsengumi/hinata.html\n\nI guess many of you can&#39;t accept the character design, especially for \nstrangely effeminate look Hijikata.\nYes, the guy with long straight hair on the cover isn&#39;t other than him. \nMyself, when I saw the image for the first time, I thought the guy would be Okita.\nBut he isn&#39;t. Okita, who is usually described as a bish, is a tall and \n&quot;flatfish like&quot; face guy in this manga, and that would be more real. \nAnyway, the artist said she has changed deliberately the design of Hijikata, \nthat meant she didn&#39;t care the famous photo or historical look of him.\n\nThe other main characters you know well having rather modern hairstyle and no \none has shaved hair or topknot.\nHowever, after being shocked by those character designs, I can notice that \nthis manga is not so eccentric as Shinsengumi manga.\nI can say this one is rather &quot;classic&quot; of the genre, I mean more &quot;historical \n&quot;or serious than what we can imagine from the first impression.\nThere are many well known episodes and details like the fire at Honjo juku on \nthe way to Kyoto, Serizawa and Oume etc.\nCurrently, the Roushitai has arrived at Kyoto and Shieikan people and \nSerizawa group decided to stay despite Kiyokawa&#39;s plot.\n\nThat is by no means yaoi type manga ( I think) , however seeing Serizawa \ndrunken asking Hijikata to sit on his lap, or that same Serizawa commenting on \nHijikata who has killed a man for the first time, that he (Hijikata) looked like \na young girl who had just lost her virginity, made me laugh a lot.\nThe story become strangely fascinating after all and now, after recent \ndisappointment with PMK which has been unfortunately stopped, I have another \ninteresting Shinsengumi manga to be continued. \nAnd I&#39;m looking forward to see appearance of some characters from now on. ( \nSome of you could guess who)\n\nTama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
