I am \nreally interested in learning all I can about the Shinsengumi and its \nmembers, and I&#39;ve heard this is THE PLACE to get and share info in English.\nJust as an intro, I&#39;ll give a quick rundown of what I&#39;m into, ne?  Let&#39;s \nsee, my fav. member is Saitou Hajime, although Peacemaker Kurogane has \ngotten me quite curious about Harada Sanosuke as well.  As for anime, I&#39;ve \nseen Kenshin and PMK and I am digging for more.  In manga, I&#39;ve read a \nbunch of PMK and I have a bunch of scanlations sitting on my computer \nwaiting for attention.  As for live action stuff, this is where I am \nhorribly deficient, but I hope to fix that soon!\nI&#39;ve also taken two years of Japanese and would be going into my 3rd year \nif it weren&#39;t for the fact that I&#39;m going to Tanzania this fall.  I love \nlearning about other aspects Japanese history outside of the Shinsengumi \nand the areas I&#39;m most interested in include the Sengoku jidai (age of \ncivil wars), the Edo period, and the Meiji Restoration.\nAlso, I&#39;m currently working on a full Shinsengumi uniform (minus the armor, \nbecause that would be really hard to make) to wear to this year&#39;s Otakon in \nBaltimore, so any tips on such would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWell that&#39;s about it!\nI look forward to many more e-mails wrought with Shinsengumi goodness!\n\nTootles!\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
