My mind when with you as you described\nthe=\r\n scene. I only can imagine the feeling one would get to actually walk\nupon =\r\nthe same ground that your feet touched knowing that in history, the\nmen of =\r\nthe Shinsengumi had been.  Oh what a feeling!  You are very\nfortunate to ha=\r\nve experienced it all.  And we are fortunate to be given\nthe opportunity to=\r\n share some of it with you by all the wonderful\npictures you brought back. =\r\nI can&#39;t thank you enough!

Awesome photos. I have a question.\n&gt; &gt; Swerizawa&#39;s Quarters, was that=\r\n where he was killed?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you look at this image:\n&gt;\nhttp://www=\r\n.flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/2375667420/in/set-721576043212&#92;\n44361/\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThe entrance on the left is the entrance to Hirayama and Serizawa&#39;s\n&gt; quart=\r\ners. I&#39;ll see if I can explain it - Directly inside is the\n&gt; genkan, with a=\r\n low hanging spear-rack. Once you get inside the entire\n&gt; building is maybe=\r\n 40 feet long, all tatami, and then at that time\n&gt; there was a partition wh=\r\nere Hirayama Goro was (the partitions are now\n&gt; gone, but the low hanging b=\r\neams that held them are only about 6.5 feet\n&gt; above the floor. His &quot;room&quot; w=\r\nas about 8 feet long and maybe about\n&gt; that wide, and then another partitio=\r\nn, where Serizawa was. Serizawa&#39;s\n&gt; &quot;room&quot; had direct access to the garden =\r\n- and by &quot;garden&quot; I mean a\n&gt; really small area that looks like a typical &quot;J=\r\napanese garden&quot;.\n&gt; Someone here would know better than I how the attack pla=\r\nyed out, but I\n&gt; do remember from the guide that Serizawa stumbled onto the=\r\n wooden\n&gt; walkway before the garden, and took a left into the Yagi&#39;s sleepi=\r\nng\n&gt; quarters where he was killed. There is a cut in the top of the\n&gt; doorw=\r\nay there, supposedly from a sword slash from that night. No\n&gt; pictures were=\r\n allowed inside or in the garden, unfortunately. But it\n&gt; is all a pretty s=\r\nmall area. It was pretty interesting walking through\n&gt; these rooms that I&#39;d=\r\n read about.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I have time, I&#39;ll add more pictures tomorrow - I still =\r\nhave about\n&gt; 100 more to go. I got some great pics of Osaka castle and else=\r\nwhere.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
