Just \nso you know dissertations (their are at least dozens dealing with \nevery aspect of the Meiji Era) are available in PDF form via \ndissertation databases (available at all college/university library \ndatabases).\n\nI had this paper for several months now but I would like someone to \nconsider summarizing pages 159 to 206 which deals with the \nTokugawa &quot;Benevolent Prisons&quot; and Meiji Era prison system (there is \nalso a chapter at the end called Hokkaido as a space for exodus). \n\nJust like the police system many aspects of the Tokugawa era are \ncarried over into the &quot;modern&quot; period and I guarantee that you will \ncome across some very interesting information.\n\nIf you are in junior high or high school *please DO NOT be \nintimidated the reading is VERY VERY easy and this is your chance to \nexpose yourself to the kind of writing advanced students do.\n\n*as you guys know I am researching the Meiji Era police system just \nbecause....I&#39;m weird (and I find it to be a good &quot;template&quot; for \nunderstanding the rise of the modern nation state for other \ncountries, I specialize in Thailand actually) oh and I think we can \nactually follow the careers of Miki and Fujita G. in an organized \nmanner.\n\nfile size = 10mb \nhttps://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/policeandprison.pdf\n\nand yes you can download it without actually summarizing the prison \npart for us (-_-) I&#39;m hoping someone will *volunteer* though (^_^).  \nPOOR Nagakura...he needs a loyal fangirl.\n\nsecretarytocapt3\n\n\n\n\n"
