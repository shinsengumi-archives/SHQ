I rea=\r\nlized over that time, that it was become a very popular subject for modern =\r\nculture/entertainment. \n\nI have read/watched many different representations=\r\n of the Shinsengumi. I really have enjoyed them all. Then I found this: \n\nh=\r\nttp://www.mangafox.com/manga/shinsengumi_jingishou_asagi/\n\nThis manga seems=\r\n really great. I like that they address life as the Shinsengumi was forming=\r\n & coming under the leadership of Kondo-san, Hijikata-san, & Yamanami-san. =\r\n\nThis manga seems to have been dropped as a project for English translation=\r\ns. I know it has 5 volumes published in Japan, but I can&#39;t seem to find any=\r\n way to get my hands on this manga. \n\nI hope that this post complies with t=\r\nhis community&#39;s posting regulations. If not, please let me know. \nIf anyone=\r\n does have news on this manga, I would really be grateful! I&#39;m always looki=\r\nng for new material, even in Japanese. :)\n\n\n\n\n"
