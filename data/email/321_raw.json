I will spend money at least to just get \nthat DVD. Fortunately though... I have the entire series when it \nfirst came out as fansubs. A friend of mine, who proudly calls \nhimself an Otaku gave me not only his streamload collection but his \nhard disks. I&#39;m certain I have this... I will let you guys know how \nit is! AHHHHH!!!!!!\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;spiritus_saitou&quot; &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Ah, but you underestimate some Saitou fans&#39; obsessions.  ;-)  If I \n&gt; had the money right now, I&#39;d go after it.  Thanks for the \n&gt; information... filing it away for the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; phil (the obsessed)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;tatchan1024&quot; &lt;tatchan1024@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I got some time to check, and Saito makes his cameo appearance in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; anime in Episode 19 (&quot;Yuke! Yuke! Toccha Nippon Ichi!&quot;) and in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; manga, he appears in Volume 2, page 234-235 of the bunko version \n&gt; (in \n&gt; &gt; the chapter called &quot;Mougeiko Kaishi no Maki&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope that helps. But it really is only a small appearance. I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; know if it would be worth spending all that money on a DVD just \nfor \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; short appearance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tatsuko\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;tnamwong@w...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The volume with Saitou in it?!? :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am searching everywhere...found the super expensive \ndvds...but \n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is no way to determine which dvd this flash back appears or \nwhich\n&gt; &gt; &gt; volume in the manga he appears...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hirotada Tokugawa&quot; \n&lt;patriot014@h...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t believe I forgot-- I have a volume of &quot;Musashi no \n&gt; Ken&quot;!! \n&gt; &gt; If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you guys \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want, I&#39;ll scan some pictures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --M.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n\n\n"
