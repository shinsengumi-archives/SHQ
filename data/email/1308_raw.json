I mean, sheesh, if you have ever been around a group of mothers with infants... &quot;Well, my son can already eat meat&quot; &quot;Oh, really?  Well my Jimmy can open pickle jars with his two teeth.&quot;  Said infants really don&#39;t care and are busily making bubbles with drool.  Know what I mean?)\n \nIt is the poor kids like (SHOOT... I forgot which shogun M mentioned... you know who I mean) who it really would not apply to.  Imagine telling a month-old 2-year-old to &quot;act your age!&quot;?  LOL  I guess that is when shoe size would be more applicable.
