I&#39;ve been readi=\r\nng more about the \nIchimura brothers.  \n\nThere are a few theories in regard=\r\n of Ichimura Tetsunosuke&#39;s death date, while many \nbelieve that Ichimura jo=\r\nined Saigo Takamori&#39;s army and died during the Satsuma Rebellion \nin 1877, =\r\nsome believe that he died from an illness in 1873. \n\nThe uploaded scans sup=\r\nport the latter theory.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nRather than saying =\r\nthat the Shinsengumi has a connection with yakuza era, I&#39;d say that \nthere&#39;=\r\ns a connection between the ultranationalists from the samurai class and the=\r\n yakuza.  \nI recommend\n\nJAPAN&#39;S DARK BACKGROUND 1881-1945\nhttp://www.fortun=\r\necity.com/tatooine/leiber/50/bds1.htm\n\n\n~Seven\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@...=\r\nm, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you to Seven for upl=\r\noading those scans for the community\n&gt; \n&gt; To answer the questions...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n   1. Why Shinsengumi choosed the word &quot;makoto&quot; ?\n&gt; A very very general ess=\r\nay on &quot;makoto&quot; is here\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/definitionsofmakoto.h=\r\ntm\n&gt; \n&gt; Makoto to one&#39;s lord (boss)\n&gt; Makoto to one&#39;s land (han/domain/feud=\r\n)\n&gt; Makoto to one&#39;s teacher (either martial, educational, art, \n&gt; philosoph=\r\nical or one who has given you a means to make a living such \n&gt; as someone w=\r\nho teaches you how to be a swordsmith)\n&gt; Makoto to one&#39;s self\n&gt; Sincerity i=\r\ns water which flows from one&#39;s heart, it is inexhaustible \n&gt; and gives life=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve never read a step by step account as to how Kondou Isami or \n&gt; =\r\nother prominent figures in the Shinsengumi may have concluded to \n&gt; adopt t=\r\nhis term---however keep in mind that people across the \n&gt; political spectru=\r\nm also drew on this word frequently such \n&gt; as &quot;loyalty/sincerity to the em=\r\nperor&quot;.\n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   3. Does Shinsengumi has a con=\r\nnection with yakuza era ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Shinsengumi and Yakuza connection is mention=\r\ned here please click \n&gt; on &quot;Books Which Mention the Shinsengumi&quot;\n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; You may say &quot;NO WAY, the Shinsengu=\r\nmi should not mess with those scum!&quot;\n&gt; however, way way way in the past...y=\r\nakuza have existed for a very \n&gt; long time serving as almost its own social=\r\n class which ends up being \n&gt; an economic safety net for ronin, social misf=\r\nits and outcasts.  \n&gt; Yakuza not surprisingly rose in power alongside the m=\r\nerchant class \n&gt; during the end of the Edo Era.  There were also divisions =\r\nand \n&gt; specific labels for yakuza as well.  The term &quot;yakuza&quot; is very \n&gt; ge=\r\nneral.\n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, yakuza ran the red light district for a long =\r\ntime \n&gt; before the Shinsengumi were even born.  When you think of yakuza tr=\r\ny \n&gt; not to picture &quot;modern&quot; yakuza.  Ofcourse historically, there were \n&gt; =\r\nflashy dressing thug yakuza on the street too.  HOwever, the ones who \n&gt; ha=\r\nd &quot;real&quot; power acted....like RESPECTABLE SAMURAI OR MERCHANT \n&gt; FAMILIES (*=\r\n_*).  Some people colleted artwork depicting samurai \n&gt; (often actors portr=\r\naying samurai)---some also collect artwork \n&gt; depicting famous yakuza who b=\r\necame &quot;folk heroes&quot;---thus from a social \n&gt; point of view, yakuza were at t=\r\nimes viewed as Robin HOod type \n&gt; figures.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I think that -if- the Shi=\r\nnsengumi had more deeper ties with the \n&gt; yakuza it would be because yakuza=\r\n are information brokers.  If the \n&gt; Shinsengumi wished to be successful in=\r\n their jobs they would try to \n&gt; be on good terms with the yakuza and even =\r\nbuy information from the \n&gt; yakuza.  From the Edo Era, Meiji and modern era=\r\n, yakuza and law \n&gt; enforcement have sought a strange &quot;balance of power&quot;.  =\r\nIf that \n&gt; delicate arrangement is disturbed one or the other side would ta=\r\nke \n&gt; action.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend Yakuza: Japan&#39;s Criminal Underworld, Expande=\r\nd Edition \n&gt; by David E. Kaplan (Author), Alec Dubro\n&gt; Yakuza are also ment=\r\nioned here http://www.shinsengumihq.com/NSNR.htm\n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt;   4. Is it wrong if  I say &quot;makoto&quot; was Shinsengumi way of life /=\r\n \n&gt; philosophy?\n&gt; \n&gt; You can say it was an ideal the group adopted---but li=\r\nke all &quot;ways of \n&gt; life&quot; ultimately the individual decides how he can inter=\r\npret it.\n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   5. ( Just for the people who=\r\n love Shinsengumi ),, Would you ( if \n&gt; you don&#39;t mind ) give me your priva=\r\nte reasons why you love them ?\n&gt; \n&gt; I grew interested in the Shinsengumi fr=\r\nom the anime/manga Rurouni \n&gt; Kenshin.  Later I became fascinated with the =\r\nhistorical Saitou Hajime \n&gt; (Fujita Goro) and the larger Aizu narrative.  \n=\r\n&gt; I owe alot to the Shinsengumi for teaching me about bias:  \n&gt; 1) from peo=\r\nple who are pro Ishin and Meiji revisionist texts\n&gt; 2) from Shinsengumi fan=\r\ns who romanticized the Miburo and try to white \n&gt; wash them\n&gt; 3) people who=\r\n confuse history with fiction and the subsequent \n&gt; disillusionment with al=\r\nl things \n&gt; 4) I like the &quot;free&quot; expressions of creativity I see in Shinsen=\r\ngumi \n&gt; fandom---I especially like original works\n&gt; 5) I&#39;ve never really re=\r\nsearched stuff like this before---so I picked \n&gt; up alot of neat little tri=\r\ncks to find stuff in the library etc etc\n&gt; \n&gt; Although now I focus on histo=\r\nry (because I cannot afford manga/anime) \n&gt; I still do alot of fanfic writi=\r\nng and drawing although I don&#39;t \n&gt; subject the public to those efforts (^__=\r\n_^)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
