The mentioned it all of two or three times! They mentioned the 47 \nRonin, but then said that their mass suicide was the act of revenge! \nI thought their suicide was their punishment for their revenge?! Am I \nwrong?! They also mentioned (just barely) the fall of the Shogunate, \nbut not only did they not say anything about the Boshin War, they \nmade no reference to Saigo, Okubo, or Katsura! They mentioned \nTakasugi of all people!!! So basically if you missed the program, you \ndidn&#39;t miss anything the group hasn&#39;t already discussed. -sigh- And I \nwent and got my hopes up for nothing...\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
