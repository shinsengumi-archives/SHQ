I&#39;d like \nto share it with a few PMK communities (if it already hasn&#39;t been \nput there.)\n\nI&#39;m sorry, I do not understand this text. However, I cannot release \nthe manga in a network. I do not have skill and I am a Japanese. The \nact is a crime certainly by a law of Japan^^;;;\nIt is possible if it is that I explain a story. \n\n\n&gt; Well, there is Burai - but that too is still plodding along.  Mmm. \nPerhaps we should all harass Watsuki-sensei to pick up his \nShinsengumi manga idea after all.  \n\nBurai was stopped by command of the chief editor of a magazine. The \nmagazine which Burai serialized took the plan which eliminates \nHistory manga. Since it was a Shinsengumi boom last year, Burai \nannounced some short stories with the magazine different from it. \nBurai is the good work with which the story is built well. \nTherefore, judgment of this chief editor is very regrettable.\n\nShinsengumi mangas are unpopular and there are many works which are \nstopped. Ordinary manga readers are not interested in Bakumatsu. And \nthey sense the complicated social situation of Bakumatsu \ntroublesome, and do not read those mangas.\n\nPMK was very popular rare Shinsengumi manga. I think that about \n400,000 people are disappointed in Japan because this work was \nstopped. \n\nI also want to see Shinsengumi manga which Watsuki-sensei draws^_^\n \n\n\n&gt; I did mention this, but there isn&#39;t much to discuss at the \nmoment.  The bad news about Viz is their turnaround time from serial \npublication into graphic novel format.   Regardless, I remain \nhopeful that Viz will stick with its commitment to KnH, unlike the \nother manga companies which have dropped titles after publishing one \nvolume of a series.   In the U.S., it is one of the most stable and \nlong-existing publication companies around.\n\nSince I did not come to SHQ recently, I have not noticed^^;;;\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
