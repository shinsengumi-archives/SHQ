There are MANY students in the program here who have\nbecome VERY interes=\r\nted in samurai of all periods. And, if you mention\n  Shin sen gumi in a roo=\r\nm of Asian Studies Majors, you&#39;ll get a\njoyously heated discussion. IT IS A=\r\nLIVE AND WELL IN UTAH. \n\nIn fact, it&#39;s one subject of my abbreviated thesis=\r\n (a series of\nshorter, 8-10 page papers written as an addendum to a Grad Sc=\r\nhool\nApplication and authorization to pursue publishing). I&#39;ve been work\nwi=\r\nth the works of Hillsborough, Keene, Jansen, Craig, and Totman\nmainly, but =\r\nI&#39;d love ANY help y&#39;all can give. I speak fluent Thai, but\nmy Japanese is s=\r\ntill hideously rudimentary. \n\nIf y&#39;all could:\nI&#39;ve run into claims that the=\r\n &quot;Ideda&#39;ya affair extended the war by two\nyears at least&quot; more than 5 times=\r\n, but I HAVEN&#39;T found an intelligible\nexplanation of that claim. Hillsborou=\r\ngh doesn&#39;t seem to buy it, and\ndevotes a few paragraphs to it. The claim is=\r\n popularly accepted, but\nI&#39;d like a data-based analysis of it.\n\nAny ideas o=\r\nr sources, folks?\n\nThanks!\nMeredith\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretar=\r\ny&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I decided to make some phone calls.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 1) The reason why I was unable to locate the author was because title\n&gt; =\r\nof the book &quot;Samurai in Salt Lake&quot; is incorrect---it is &quot;SamuraiS in\n&gt; Salt=\r\n Lake&quot; ISBN:0965116395\n&gt; ****I spoke to the author, Prof. Collinwood and he=\r\n said this book was\n&gt; expanded but not yet published, he highly recommends =\r\nthe follow up\n&gt; book which will be a great work on the Iwakura Mission (187=\r\n2)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) No, he did not write a thesis on the Shinsengumi -BUT- HE WANTED=\r\n\n&gt; TO!!!! Like many scholars he got distracted and had to pursue other\n&gt; st=\r\nuff and so forth so it never happened (T_T)\n&gt; \n&gt; What does this mean? And w=\r\nhy is it important that &quot;scholars&quot; get\n&gt; interested?  Because they write, p=\r\nublish and preserve.  They do the\n&gt; nerd work which needs to be done.  And =\r\ntheir writing is the source for\n&gt; fandom products (pop-culture etc).\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nn other words---it is up to us fans to make the Shinsengumi so\n&gt; significan=\r\nt that they finally will look into studying them. It is up\n&gt; to us (*_*).  =\r\nThe cycle between academia and culture must be nurtured\n&gt; otherwise in a fe=\r\nw decades the Shinsengumi will simply slip back into\n&gt; &quot;cliche&quot; when as we =\r\nknow they were very fascinating.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope anyone here who is in college =\r\nwill consider speaking to\n&gt; graduate students or professors who specialize =\r\nin this field and ask\n&gt; them about their interests. Do not be surprised if =\r\nthey have never\n&gt; heard of the Shinsengumi (remember they are considered to=\r\n be basically\n&gt; insignificant to many) or even AIZU (which is totally scary=\r\n seeing how\n&gt; Satsuma and Choshu battled it out with this domain).  It woul=\r\nd be\n&gt; helpful if you get a basic understanding of this era rather than ask=\r\n\n&gt; them to tell you everything they know (^_^)---but really you will find\n&gt;=\r\n many of them to be friendly people who are willing to help you.\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI have to bring up this topic again because it is super super\nimportant.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; There exists out there a SHINSENGUMI THESIS that&#39;s right a JAPANESE\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; scholar who saw their historical significance and got his degree from\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; studying them ~seriously~ and he had advisors thus his work is going\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to be decent AND in English (^_^).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there anyone here part of o=\r\nur mighty Shinsengumi network who lives\n&gt; &gt; -IN- Utah and can make phone ca=\r\nlls?  See I&#39;d do this myself except I\n&gt; &gt; maxed out my phone card. And the =\r\nperson who promised to help me\n&gt; &gt; must&#39;ve forgotten or something.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n This is the info I have\n&gt; &gt; 1) author was formerly an employee at the Japa=\r\nnese Cultural Center at\n&gt; &gt; Weber State\n&gt; &gt; 2) author wrote &quot;&#39;Samurai in Sa=\r\nlt Lake&#39; and available at the Weber\n&gt; &gt; State bookstore for around $5.00\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 3) I don&#39;t have a name, year or anything!!! or whether it was an MA\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhesis or undergrad thesis or Phd whatever---however it was\n&gt; &gt; &quot;published&quot; =\r\nfor the school records\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -but- I have been searching, searching, sea=\r\nrching all databases\n&gt; &gt; available to me his thesis is just not showing up =\r\nanywhere which means\n&gt; &gt; that if someone can call http://library.weber.edu/=\r\n and ask the\n&gt; &gt; librarian who handles this sort of thing we may be able to=\r\n read it.\n&gt; &gt; The best way to go about it is to find his or her &quot;Samurai in=\r\n Salt\n&gt; &gt; Lake&quot; and get their full name to do a search.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why must w=\r\ne pursue yet more nerdy work?  Because anyone who read Mr.\n&gt; &gt; Hillsborough=\r\n&#39;s work knows that it is far from comprehensive and\n&gt; &gt; possibly alot of st=\r\nuff was left out---this thesis may help us fill in\n&gt; &gt; the &#39;gaps&#39;.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"
