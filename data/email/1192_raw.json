Very few \nknew that Souji was not a boy, but a woman. Souji loved the vice-leader of the \narmed police, Toshizou Hijikata....&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101403/\n\nOriginally written as a stageplay by Kouhei Tsuka, this film casts also Ken \nWatanabe in the role of Ryoma who fell in love with Soji.\nI&#39;ve never seen this film until now for some reasons, but finaly I&#39;m getting \nto like it.\nAlthough the story is slapstick, it shows symbolically some historical \naspects, I think.\nActors are good and we can see fangirls screaming to Okita, Hijikata writing \nhis famous love poetry, sharpnesse of Kotetsu giving satisfaction to Kondo,and \nan interesting charactor of Izo Okada etc...\nIf you have a chance to get this film, I can recommend it.\n\nYou can see the cover of DVD and some photos here,\nhttp://www.kadokawa.co.jp/dvd/HP/bakumatu/\n\nTama\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
