Maybe after WW2 during the occupation the \ndivision\n&gt; &gt; had to redefine itself so that it could continue to exist.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Public Security Division perhaps *transformed* into Public \nSecurity\n&gt; &gt; Investigation Agency (PSIA) officially &quot;founded&quot; in 1952?  Just \nan\n&gt; &gt; idea....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/PSIA/psia-01.html\n&gt; &gt; http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/japan/koancho.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Surely, the public security division was inaugurated in 1952. \n&gt; It seems that however, there was the same organization as it from \n&gt; Kawaji Toshinaga time, and main members did not change also after \n&gt; dissolving by GHQ. \n&gt; (Probably, it will be better not to say unnecessary things, since \nI \n&gt; am ignorant about this.) \n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, although this is that even many Japanese have \nmistaken, \n&gt; Kawaji&#39;s first name is not &quot;Toshiyosi&quot; but &quot;Toshinaga&quot;.\n&gt; I also got to know just recently.^^;;; \n&gt; \n&gt; Saitou&#39;s posterity believed that his art-of-fencing style was \nIttou-\n&gt; ryuu. \n&gt; However, Akama Shizuko sensei who is  Saitou Hajime&#39;s researcher \n&gt; announced that his style was Mugai-ryuu.\n&gt; She said that she found it from the data of the police. \n&gt; Probably, I think that there is a rumor from the episode.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a strange talk about Saitou&#39;s sword style. \n&gt; Nagakura was teaching the art of fencing to one time which became \n&gt; Meiji Era in the Tennenrishin-ryuu exercise hall which Kondou&#39;s \n&gt; nephew inherited.\n&gt; The student of the exercise hall has questioned Nagakura about \n&gt; Saitou&#39;s style. \n&gt; Nagakura&#39;s answer.\n&gt; &quot;Since I and Saitou-kun seldom talked, I do not know it.&quot;\n&gt; Though association of Nagakura and Saitou is only the Shinsengumi \n&gt; age, it is for five years. \n&gt; Didn&#39;t Nagakura care about a strong swordsman&#39;s sword style like \n&gt; himself? ^-^\n&gt; \n&gt; momoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
