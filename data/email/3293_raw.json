Why bakufu allowed a peasant to become their troop ? (Roshigumi case)\n\nThe shogunate needed manpower, and anyone who could hold a sword counted.\nThink about it: Serizawa was in *jail* and he was allowed to join.\n\n2. When the bakufu government about to collapse, are the daimyou still doing\nsankin koutai\nor other bakufu laws ?\n\nSankin-kotai was revised (essentially eliminated) in the early 1860s. Not\neveryone stopped obeying the shogunate all at once...for instance, when\nSatsuma had their ronin terrorizing Edo in early 1868, the shogunate ordered\nShonai, Kaminoyama, and other domains to surround the Satsuma yashiki, and\nShonai (and the others) obeyed.\n(See: Totman, Conrad. Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu. Honolulu: University\nof Hawai&#39;i Press, 1980)\n\n3. Yamanami Keisuke no jutsuryuu wa Hokushin Ittouryuu or Tennen Rishin Ryuu\n?\n( cause both is exist in different book )\n\nYamanami Keisuke-san no ryuuha wa Hokushin Ittouryuu darou? (Isn&#39;t\nYamanami&#39;s sword tradition Hokushin-ittoryu?) Do a search in our message\narchive for Yamanami-- I&#39;ve mentioned a theory before about his origins and\nhow they connect to Hokushin-ittoryu.\n\n4. What did Kiyokawa do when Kondo and Serizawa (and their team) chosed to\nstay in Kyoto instead follow him ? Didnt he make any execution ? (since he\nwas the leader of Roshigumi)\n\nKiyokawa&#39;s unit left soon after the split (see Oishi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; and\nKikuchi Akira&#39;s books).\n\n5. Hows the real relation between Kondo (or Hijikata) with Yamanami Keisuke\n? I know theyre friend. But in Oishi Manabu (Shinsengumi. Saigo no bushi no\njitsuzou), why Kondo was so happy when Yamanami will commit seppuku ? (or\nits just me who cant read the kanji)\n\nI have no comment on this right now.\n\n6. May I know what do you think about Shinsengumi beliefe ?\n\nWhat do you mean by Shinsengumi&#39;s beliefs? You mean &quot;makoto,&quot; or martial\n(budo) skill, or (gasp) homosexuality, or what?\n\n-M.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
