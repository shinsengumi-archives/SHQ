Will scan soon, but all I \nhave to say is WOW.\n\nKondou- Ferocious, muscular, young but not too young...utterly cool in \narmor.\nHijikata- A lot like Kondou but more handsome in his own way.\nOkita- NOT a pretty boy, for once, though he is kinda childlike.\nHarada- HUGE guy with a HUGE sword and a HUGE spear.\nMatsubara- Usually nonexistent in other depictions, this time you see him in \naction with his naginata.\nInoue- Kinda weird-looking, but he&#39;s important.\nYamazaki- NOT a ninja, for once! Seems to like playing &quot;go&quot; with Shimada.\nShimada- Like Harada, a HUGE guy with a HUGE sword. The ending of the \nIkedaya attack is at the start of the manga, and maaaaaan...\nNagakura- Perpetually smoking a Japanese-style metal pipe, even when he \nfights! Really cool sideburns, too...and he&#39;s not an uber-chibi short guy!\nSaitou- Dark, brooding type with a scar on his left cheek.\nYamanami- Looks like he&#39;s about to cry most of the time, but still rather \nhandsome.\nSasaki Tadasaburo and the Mimawarigumi-- These guys make me think we were \nright in our guess...a turf war is a HUGE factor in this volume. Oh, and why \ndo all the Mimawarigumi guys look alike, I wonder?\nThere&#39;s also an Aizu retainer named &quot;Shiba&quot; something...\n\nEach volume&#39;s cover features a key member of the Shinsengumi-- this one had \nHarada, and inside the jacket flap, has a mini-bio. Turns out his father&#39;s \nname was Nagatsugu...all this time I&#39;d guessed it&#39;d be &quot;Sa-&quot; something, like \n&quot;Saemon,&quot; which would be in keeping with sons taking characters from their \nfathers&#39; names...\n\nAnyway...I&#39;m looking forward to getting ahold of more of that and Kaze \nHikaru when I finalyl make it to Japan in a couple weeks.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
