I was wondering if you could pos=\r\nt\n&gt; questions here simultaneously with what is going on in your group. \n&gt; H=\r\nOwever answers may not be so quick because yes, we will if possible\n&gt; likel=\r\ny find a answer in a text.  In doing so we hope to have people\n&gt; walk away =\r\nwith some evidence (ofcourse we do know texts can be faulty\n&gt; but atleast w=\r\ne know where details come from).  \n&gt; \n&gt; Also it has been my past experience=\r\n that it is good to state up front\n&gt; in a discussion that an answer posted =\r\nby a person (let&#39;s take for\n&gt; instance a quote from a book) may not always =\r\nreflect the personal\n&gt; opinion of the poster.  \n&gt; \n&gt; If the bigger picture =\r\nof the Bakumatsu will be discussed, then that\n&gt; would be awesome.  I know t=\r\nhat some people on this list may have\n&gt; information which has never been me=\r\nntioned in western texts before. \n&gt; The posting of those details may be a b=\r\nit jarring to many people who\n&gt; have been exposed to just the Imperial narr=\r\native etc so I don&#39;t want\n&gt; people to take things personally or take offens=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; Will you also summarize the discussion after it is over as well?  T=\r\nhat\n&gt; would be a good reference for people.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can link to the discuss=\r\nion thread and announce it on our blog and\n&gt; on our updates page if you&#39;d l=\r\nike.\n\n\nSince my only available &quot;location&quot; to hold the research/discussion i=\r\nn\na private &quot;room&quot; in my forum, it&#39;s pretty tough to coordinate with\nthis g=\r\nroup in real time (and inaccessible to people who aren&#39;t signed\nup as a mem=\r\nber of the discussion), but I will definately post the\nquestions here - I&#39;l=\r\nl figure out a way to work it out. When it&#39;s done,\nI&#39;ll summarize the whole=\r\n thing, but based on prior discussion groups,\nwe could be looking at a doze=\r\nn pages of text, so I&#39;ll probably put it\ntogether into a PDF or something.\n=\r\n\nThis time around, the focus is just the Shinsengumi, as few people\nseem to=\r\n know much about them, and I try to keep the groups focused on\nsomething sp=\r\necific (prior discussions have been on Kofun (burial\ntombs) and the 47 Roni=\r\nn).  The bakumatsu in general would be too big,\nbut since it is the backdro=\r\np, the events are important.\n\nAnd as for stating that posted information fr=\r\nom sources doesn&#39;t\nnecessarily reflect the position of the person posting i=\r\nt, I agree -\nsometimes, for whatever reason, these things can get personal =\r\n(much to\nmy chagrin) but most people tend to accept that a lot of history i=\r\ns\nperception.\n\n\n"
