Then again many a warlord, administrator, \nConfucian schola=\r\nr, daimyo and most of the Imperialist guys would all \nline up to see this f=\r\nilm:\n\nhttp://www.angryasianman.com/2008/07/john-woos-red-cliff-finally-\narr=\r\nives.html\n\nI saw the 8 minute promo reel.  You&#39;ll enjoy the scenes after 4:=\r\n00 \nonwards.  The character of Guan Yu, Kondou&#39;s fav chara, is shown more \n=\r\nin the 8 min. segment too.\n\nYou&#39;ll love it.  The music has some sort of wei=\r\nrd Jo Hisaishi influence (I \nwonder if he worked on the film).  I think the=\r\nre is some Japanese money \ninvested in this movie clearly---and Shidou Naka=\r\nmura stars in it as well.\n\nAnd for any questions as to why there are female=\r\n characters and if it is \nsome sort of way to use &quot;girl power&quot; to pull in t=\r\nhe crowd---that&#39;s not \ntrue.  Romance of the Three Kingdoms had many signif=\r\nicant female \ncharacters and a few warrior women to boot.\n\nI can understand=\r\n why they made RED CLIFF, rather than the later \nchapters of ROTK which wou=\r\nld require them to bring in the elephants.\n\nIf you study Chinese/Korean/Jap=\r\nanese history then reading ROTK or \nsummaries or watching these film versio=\r\nns will help you figure out what \nthe heck old texts allude to.  ROTK is on=\r\ne of those works of historical \nfiction (although there is a historical ver=\r\nsion of the story too) that is \n*constantly* mentioned, referenced and comp=\r\nared to.\n\nROTK is a peek into the past, and often used as a peek into the f=\r\nuture as \nit is believed to be prophesize the outcome of political crisis o=\r\nnce certain \nfactors come into play.\n\n~Secretarytocapt3\n\nP.S. RED CLIFF is =\r\nnot a flying/strings kung fu type movie\n\n\n\n\n\n"
