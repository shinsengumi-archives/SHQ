Koichi Sato (Mibugishiden Saitou)\nis Bandai the young, rich and famous club owner who is in ALOT of\ntrouble...\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/gonin.jpg\nKoichi Sato is OUTSTANDING (Pssst fangirls there is an onscreen kiss\ntoo hehehe but it may not be what you expect, oh and he tries to speak\nEnglish)\n2) Phil, Beat Takeshi (Gohatto Hijikata) is in it...with a supporting\nrole...I guess this film will inform him for the yaoish role in Gohatto\n3) Naoto Takenaka (Mibugishiden TV Series Saitou...the dancing guy in\nSHALL WE DANCE) is also in this movie...he is a dynamic actor...he\nalso dances in Gonin but for a completely different reason... \n*see this post is not so off topic eh?\n\nFor those of you who want great cinematography and story this movie is\ntotally awesome...the film is like a Quentin Tarantino movie that\nmakes sense and done with good taste thus you can expect violence but\nnot merely for the shock value. I have to mention something else in\nthe movie, a female character named &quot;Nammy&quot; is supposed to be Thai, in\nfact the actress does say a couple of sentences in Thai but the\nsubtitles messed up the translations (they seemed to shuffle up the\norder of the sentences)...the bit with passports is common knowledge\nfor people who study the sex industry basically women who travel\nabroad for this business usually have their passports and all other\nidentification confiscated by their pimps/yakuza. Finally a gangster\nfilm which doesn&#39;t insult your intelligence (please watch it\nCAREFULLY)...I am thoroughly impressed with the A+ caste and top notch\nstory!!!!! Flawless....\n\n*I also rented GONIN 2...but this time its about a bunch of\nwomen...unlike GONIN, GONIN 2 has minor flaws in terms of its\npace...slick action/dialogue suddenly degenerates into stagnant\nmeditation on human suffering \n\n\n\n"
