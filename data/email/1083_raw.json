The yakuza laughed a lot\n&gt; but Nagakura was willing to let go. However, his\n&gt; grandson got enraged and yelled &quot;what do you think you\n&gt; are doing to my grandpa?!&quot; to the yakuza, who, in\n&gt; their turn, got enraged and said in a menacing voice,\n&gt; &quot;who do you think you are, shrimp?!&quot;. The boy got\n&gt; frightened and hid himself behind Nagakura. The\n&gt; yakuzas said, &quot;out of the way, old man, or else you\n&gt; too will suffer the consequences!&quot;. Then, Nagakura\n&gt; raised his eyebrow, tossed the walking stick away,\n&gt; straightened up his back and, without saying anything,\n&gt; glared in such a manner to the yakuza that they got\n&gt; frightened and ran away. Then, Nagakura calmly got his\n&gt; stick from the ground, curved his back again and he\n&gt; resumed the stroll with his grandson.\n&gt; \n&gt; By far, this is my favorite story on Nagakura (though\n&gt; there are many interesting stories about him) ^^ And\n&gt; it reminds me of Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid :D\n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
