At the Aikido dojo my sensei trained at in Osaka \nthere were teachers from 4 groups of classical Heiho, of which \nTennen Rishin Ryu was only one.  He ended up training in Yagyu \nShinkage Ryu, which is what he brought back with him and I train in \nnow.  However, because he was in so tight with Yoshida Sensei he got \nthe chance to learn some of TRR&#39;s kihon (which he often reminds me \nins&#39;t much).\nTennen Rishin Ryu uses very thick, heavy bokken.  Much larger than \nother styles like Jigen Ryu or Jikishinkage Ryu (the bokuto we use \nin Yagyu Ryu is a twig by comparison).  It&#39;s techniques are very \nindicative of the &quot;Beater&quot; styles that became popular at the end of \nthe Edo Jidai.  Most of the techniques seem to involve bashing the \nopponent&#39;s sword aside and thrusting into his throat.  The style was \ndescribed to me as something to get people reasonably good with a \nsword very fast.  \nBy contrast Yagyu Shinkage Ryu can best be described as a &quot;Baiting&quot; \nstyle, where you offer up an apparent opening to get an opponent to \nattack the way you want him to and cut him down when he does.  Can \nbe very formidable once you have it down, but you&#39;re not going to \nget it fast at all.\n\nI&#39;ve been a lurker here for a while and have enjoyed all the obscure \ninfo dug up here.  Thanks all for the warm reception.\n\n-Chris\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n&gt; Just wanted to say hello the folks who have responded so far. \nAkaiken Hogo, \n&gt; &quot;K&quot; :D, and Chris welcome to the group!
