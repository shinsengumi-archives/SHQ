However, let&#39;s \n&gt; say if I were to =\r\nsubmit an article on the Meiji Educational system as \n&gt; it relates to the p=\r\nerversion of bushido and rise of fascism (yes as \n&gt; early as 1890s...predat=\r\ning good ole Italian model but it&#39;s evident in \n&gt; the many works dealing w/=\r\n the topic)...your staff may not be able to \n&gt; provide a peer evaluation.  =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Would you seek qualified guest editors to assist in oversight of the =\r\n\n&gt; scholarship (even if it is from someone not traditionally part of the \n&gt;=\r\n field?).  Have you approached maybe the young up and coming open minded \n&gt;=\r\n professors to assist in this effort?  \n\n&quot;Peer Review&quot; is a tough one.  I&#39;m=\r\n trying to cover the bases with the\nofficial staff, but like you said, ther=\r\ne are some holes. The major\nadvantage of having people who know the history=\r\n read it is that they\ncan notice inconsistencies and questionable sources, =\r\netc. I hadn&#39;t put\na large amount of thought into it, but I do know enough p=\r\neople who\nknow other people to hopefully cover all the bases. It will be on=\r\n a\ncase by case basis - I don&#39;t forsee a big problem, but I hope to get\napp=\r\nlicable papers to at least one relative expert before okaying\nanything for =\r\npublication. I haven&#39;t approached any upcoming professors\nper se (yet), but=\r\n I do have a fair pool of Graduate level historians\nwho are qualified to ei=\r\nther help directly with the process, or point\nme in the right direction. I =\r\ndon&#39;t expect to be ready to publish the\nfirst issue until february or march=\r\n of next year, so that should give\nme enough time to get everything squared=\r\n away.\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) how will SA-JJH sustain itself?  I am worried because I f=\r\neel that \n&gt; it&#39;s tough if you guys have to pay out of pocket.  Have you acq=\r\nuired a \n&gt; grant?  If so then perhaps a grant to back you on this project w=\r\nill \n&gt; also help this magazine be distributed to research libraries in the =\r\n\n&gt; USA.  My concern is, from my own experience many magazines after a \n&gt; ce=\r\nrtain number of issues do have to close down and in the process the \n&gt; meti=\r\nculously written work ends up becoming a rarity for students to \n&gt; find/rea=\r\nd. Aside from the online format which everyone can read and I \n&gt; assume the=\r\n print formatting, will you consider CD formats for libraries \n&gt; too?  Will=\r\n you try to get this publication onto library databases \n&gt; (which can subsc=\r\nribe to you or link to articles?).  Ofcourse the online \n&gt; format will be m=\r\nost accessible however students in school would feel \n&gt; more comfortable if=\r\n perhaps their library&#39;s East Asian bibliographer \n&gt; has approved of the jo=\r\nurnal as a source of info as well---and with the \n&gt; qualifcations of your s=\r\ntaff I&#39;m sure they would be able to devise a \n&gt; good strategy for penetrati=\r\nng academia and make this a valuable \n&gt; resource.\n\n\nTo make a long story sh=\r\nort, I&#39;m in the process of creating my own\npublishing company (so I&#39;ll be d=\r\noing more than just this journal) - I\nhave a &quot;print on demand&quot; distributor =\r\nwith rates that are extremely\naffordable, and the journal would be made ava=\r\nilable immediately on\namazon.com (and the canada and UK version) and barnes=\r\nandnoble.com). I\nwill also have the option of e-books. Basically, since the=\r\nre are no\n&quot;bells and whistles&quot; (no editors, no designers, no getting them o=\r\nn the\nshelves in bookstores, pretty much nothing- they publish what I give\n=\r\nthem), all they do is publish and distribute, so it is extremely\naffordable=\r\n, and there are no limits to how many issues they publish. I\ncan also buy t=\r\nhem very cheaply to distribute myself. Which means that\nI would have to go =\r\nto bookstores personally (or my other staff\nmembers) to get them on the she=\r\nlves or in libraries.  Another friend\nof mine has already done this, and I =\r\nwas extremely impressed with the\nservice and the finished products, so I am=\r\n more than confident in the\ndistributor. But like I said, aside from online=\r\n sources, the rest is\nup to myself and the staff.  So, on the one hand, it =\r\nis very\naffordable, but on the other hand, it is up to us to market.  Havin=\r\ng\nit on the various amazon.com and B&N sites is a huge help though. \n\nI hav=\r\ne looked at grants from the government, nothing really is\napplicable. Frank=\r\nly, I don&#39;t *need* a grant, but it would be very\nnice. I&#39;m not entirely sur=\r\ne where to look.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; what are the long term goals of this magazine?  wil=\r\nl it exist years \n&gt; from now?  part of why JAS/MN are held in high esteem i=\r\ns that they are \n&gt; very stable and authors feel that their work will be pre=\r\nserved for \n&gt; decades...do you have a back up plan for your magazine if som=\r\neone \n&gt; should need to take a break from it?  For the SHQ we are just \n&gt; vo=\r\nlunteers so we don&#39;t have to worry about it really.  But your journal \n&gt; is=\r\n a very ambitious effort and I was concerned with its stability.\n&gt;\n\n\nBasica=\r\nlly (and this could be a problem), we can only keep it going for\nas long as=\r\n we get quality submissions.  That aside, the book will be\navailable online=\r\n for as long as I&#39;m willing to pay $12 per year per\nissue. The goal, of cou=\r\nrse, is to build a base of both readers and\ncontributors, and hopefully it =\r\nwill become self sustaining. I plan to\nwait until I have enough papers for =\r\na year of issues (4 issues) - they\nwill be in book form, rather than &quot;magaz=\r\nine&quot; form, and I also have the\noption of hardcover or softcover, whichever =\r\nI prefer, although I&#39;m\nplanning on paperback.  I also intend to republish 1=\r\n9th century books\non Japan, written by sailors and academics and diplomats =\r\nto help\nsustain the business.  I actually have a book coming out within a\nc=\r\nouple months - &quot;Japan and Her People&quot; by Anna Hartshorne, edited by\nmyself =\r\nand my publisher friend, so that should give me some indication\nof the mark=\r\net for that type of book. Here is the link to that:\nhttp://www.typeandcultu=\r\nre.com/?page_id=3D36\n\nLian Hearn (Author of the Tales of the Otori series) =\r\nwas kind enough\nto write the introduction to this edition.  \n\nSo, right now=\r\n I just have an ambitious plan. Hopefully by the end of\nthis year it will c=\r\nome together.\n\nThanks for the input, I appreciate it!\n\n\n"
