I&#39;m glad that this ML is alive and still very \nactive. I=\r\n&#39;m a recent fan of the Shinsengumi and was instantly \nenamored b/c of NHK&#39;s=\r\n Shinsengumi! series. I&#39;m mostly interested in \nYamanami Keisuke&#39;s characte=\r\nr but all in all, I like them all \nespecially Kondou Isami and Saitou Hajim=\r\ne.\n\nBut first and foremost, Yamanami intrigues me the most. There aren&#39;t \na=\r\nny photos of him and not much sources about him as well. In \nHillsborough&#39;s=\r\n book, he was mentioned but not much information was \ngiven. I was told tha=\r\nt since he wasn&#39;t present during the Ikedaya \nJiken (when the Shinsengumi&#39;s=\r\n &#39;fame&#39; started) and b/c he didn&#39;t live \nthat long to be recognized, not mu=\r\nch information is available about \nhim. \n\nSince this group is filled with S=\r\nhinsengumi fans, I hope I can get a \nfew things about Yamanami (and about o=\r\nther Shinsengumi members too). \nAnd at the same time, share something of wo=\r\nrth in this ML. That&#39;s \nfor a brief introduction. Yoroshiku onegai shimasu!=\r\n:P\n\nmoeru\n\n\n"
