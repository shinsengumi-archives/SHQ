Warning to Hijikata fans, this film contains a\nvery unflattering portrayal.  Kev&#39;s pdf file which has the excerpt\nfrom the novel reveals that a tiny but significant part was cut from\nthe movie involving Hijikata.  You just have to compare the 2 versions. \n\nBased on Momoiro&#39;s post about Grampa Nagakura...\nIf you were grandson/daughter who would you choose to spend your\nSundays with\n\na) Grampa Nagakura Shinpachi...every now and then during the movie\nhe&#39;ll ask you what the heck is going on in the plot (his memory/vision\naren&#39;t so good anymore)...its either the same movie over and over\nagain or the same story about the Shinsengumi over and over\nagain...you choose your own form of torture ^_^\n\nb) Grampa Nakajima Nobori (who died young so he probably didn&#39;t even\nsee his grandkids)...who will have you repotting/fertilizing his\nbeloved plant collection [or] look after his firearms store (it&#39;s\nnever too early to have kids learn how to run an arms business)...on\nthe bright side you may get drawing lessons...be prepared to use lots\nof red paint\n\nc) Grampa Saitou...after a cup/saucer of sake maybe he&#39;ll tell you how\nto deal with criminals who don&#39;t &quot;cooperate&quot;...and neat little tricks\nfor covert operations/espionage missions...heck if Grandmother Tokio\nisn&#39;t around maybe you&#39;ll get a special tour of the museum after hours\nusing the special set of keys he duplicated so long ago...but without\nthe sake he just does the laundry and doesn&#39;t say much...\n\nd) Grampa Miki who will instill in you a deep hatred for surviving\nmembers of the Shinsengumi *especially* for that Nagakura who got away\n(grrrrr) Nagakura probably said &quot;go after Saitou or should I say\nFujita Goro&quot;...then you&#39;ll have to put up with his -alternate- history\ninvolving Sagara\n\ne) or how about the guy who converted to Christianity...church church\nand Sunday school (he probably won&#39;t get any votes)\n\nf) Grampa Shimada Kai...frequent trips to the candy store ^_^\n\nIn the series Hatchobori 7...the officers use a neat little weapon\nwhich is shaped like a &quot;U&quot; but with one leg of the &quot;U&quot; much longer\nthan the other...it basically looks like a weird fish hook with a red\ntassle.  I&#39;ve seen much bigger versions as a Chinese weapon...the\nofficers use it to catch/hook swords and slash at criminals so I&#39;m\nassuming it was designed to be non-lethal as Aoyama keeps saying to\ncatch criminals alive...the officers carry it in their waistband like\na sword.  It is a pretty small weapon too as the officers have to get\nvery very close to their opponents.\n \n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bsher213&quot; &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Sword of Doom a/k/athe movie Miss B and I Always come into too\n&gt; late when it&#39;s on tv is now available for buying!
