I \n&gt; can do without the rest of the song ;)\n\nSorry, it understood. \nTo be sure, it is an interesting refrain. \n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Yes it is strange.  In the fake picture all the men sit very close \nto\n&gt; one another.  \n&gt; Emperor Meiji and Saigo disliked the photograph?  Emperor Meiji and\n&gt; Saigo abhorred the photograph because of superstition or \ntraditional\n&gt; belief?\n\nI do not know why they disliked the photograph. \nWhen the photograph was imported to Japan, there was rumor that soul \nwas sucked up by it. \n(Although Kondou has hidden both hands in the photograph, it is said \nthat that is behavior not to take a soul.)\nThere was a custom which exchanges the Royal Family&#39;s photograph in \neach country at the time. \nAlthough Emperor Meiji took the photograph in Meiji 6, he did not \ntake a photograph at all for 15 years after that. \nAnd the request came from the foreign country, saying &quot;We desire His \nMajesty&#39;s latest photograph.&quot; .\n\n \n&gt; In the same exact time period in the kingdom of Siam the king Rama \nV\n&gt; (King #5 Chakri Dynasty) loved the photograph for friendliness \nwith a\n&gt; foreign country.  Opposite of Emperor Meiji ^_^\n\nAlthough I do not know the history of Thailand at all, it is \nremembered that the king Rama V was the person respected as a wise \nking who promoted modernization of Thailand. \nUnlike Japan of a maritime power, it is surmised that friendly \nrelations with a foreign country were probably important for \ncontinental Thailand. \n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n&gt; Simple mistake? Or could he have thought no one would bother to \nremember poor Toshizo anyway and wanted to be remembered as being \nmore handsome than he really was? ^_~ \n\n&quot;Simple mistake&quot; means not being a political intrigue. \nfor me, it is a big mistake (probably, you too).\nProbably, people of Meiji Era would not imagine the photograph with \nwhich Hijikata of Shinsengumi wore the France military uniform. \n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Serizawa Kamo &lt;serizawakamo@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider\n&gt; Saigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also\n&gt; plenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo\n&gt; Takamori, who could have understood the plea of\n&gt; Yamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed\n&gt; in\n&gt; Edo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were\n&gt; good men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin\n&gt; side,\n&gt; as well as bad men in both, IMHO :)&lt;&lt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And just possibly Saigou is an example of how a man\n&gt; could be both good AND bad... a human condition.\n\nThis is the fact which must be accepted although I dislike Saigou. \nAlthough the Chosyu side wanted to surely execute Tokugawa \nYoshinobu, Saigou is the talks with Katsu and it promised to help \nYoshinobu. \nProbably, the Tokugawa side continued resistance more, if Saigou \nasserted execution of Yoshinobu strongly. \n(Katsu was actually making the preparations which burn down Edo.) \nProbably, it must have developed into Britain and the proxy war of \nFrance. \nBritain sided with Satsuma and Chosyu and France was siding with the \nTokugawa government. \n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, ktamae@a... wrote:\n&gt; I say hello to momoiro-usagi san!\n&gt; It&#39;s very encouraging to see another Japanese member here.\n&gt; I appreciate so much your comments on here and  on the message \nboard, as I \n&gt; can usually post media related stuffs rather than historical \nthings.\n\nKonnichiwa Tama san! \nI think it very strange to speak to you in English. \n(Watashi no mechakucha na eigo wo anata ga akireteiru nodehanaikato \ndokidoki shite imashita.) \nAlthough I am not going to write the information on false, it is a \nfact that information is also a little partial. \nSince you who are a Japanese Shinsengumi fan are, I am very \nrelieved. \n\nDoes Tama san live in the Tama area? \nIt is imagination from a name. \n(Tokyo ni sundeiru kata desu yone?)\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
