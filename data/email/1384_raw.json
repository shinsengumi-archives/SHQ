But the \nfamily refused, preferring just to stop making the drug to altering the \nformula. At least that&#39;s what the sites I&#39;ve been to seem to indicate. Am I reading \nthat right?\n\nYes, that&#39;s exact, only this one happend after WW2. The government changed \nthe Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, and Hijikata family producing the medicine until \n1953 or so, abandoned then.\nStill they have continued to use it in the family, and even at 40&#39;s of Showa \n(after 1965), someone visited the family and asked if they had the stock, \nsaying only Isida San&#39;yaku was effecacious for this person.\n\nA little thing that I noticed about Yamazaki.\nAlthough Yamazaki is described very differently, younger or older, ninja boy \nor not, he keeps at least his Osaka area dialect and accent when he speaks, in \nPMK or NHK and in other media as I remember.\n\nTama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
