That was the first pdf file I have ever\nmade so I apologize to everyone for the two page\nformat. That was the way I xeroxed it and scanned it.\nWhen I originally xeroxed it I didn&#39;t know I would be\ndoing this. I don&#39;t have time right now, but either\nlate tonight or tomorrow when I get home I will do\nanother version of it that is just one page at a time\nthat will be easier to read while zooming 100%. So,\nexpect a better version of it tomorrow afternoon. I\nhave a few more I want to send to the group\neventually. I will see what I can do about finding the\nnotes on that article as well this week, but like Phil\nsaid from what I saw those specific references were\nJapanese sources so they probably won&#39;t help too much\nother than telling us where the author got his\ninformation.\n\nKevin\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
