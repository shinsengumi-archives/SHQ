E. von, 1849-1913. Awakening Jap=\r\nan: the diary of a \nGerman doctor: Erwin Baelz, edited by his son, Toku Bae=\r\nlz; \ntranslated from the German by Eden and Cedar Paul. \n\n*I think people w=\r\nho study Meiji Era Japan would find this book worth \nits weight in gold bec=\r\nause you will be exposed to alot of &quot;insider&quot; \ninformation not to mention D=\r\nr. Baelz&#39;s sincere attempts at \nincorporating jiujitsu+kenjutsu into a phys=\r\nical education program \n(summarized in this article here http://www.ao-denk=\r\nou-\nkai.org/new_page_6.htm)\n\n*he was not an adventurer, mercenary or missio=\r\nnary, but a \nprofessional with alot of money and access to people in power.=\r\n..but \nat the same time curious and humble in his observations of Meiji Era=\r\n \nJapan\n\nDr. Fukuzawa and Yamakawa Kenjiroo see [post \nhttp://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/SHQ/message/2023]\nwere not the only ones who were fascinated with=\r\n the mysteries of the \nhuman mind\n(written by someone who *OBSERVED* Dr. Ba=\r\nelz treating a \npatient...deals with fox possession and religious ecsctasy.=\r\n..and the \ncommentary at the end is a bit odd since Dr. Baelz&#39;s treatments =\r\nare \nbased on science)\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelzfox1.jpg\nhttp=\r\n://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelzfox2.jpg\n---------------------------\n\n(s=\r\nelf-control)\nPage 122\n*Hana, Dr. Baelz&#39;s wife, lost her 12 year old adopted=\r\n daughter\n*Dr. Baelz frequently compares the Japanese to Roman stoicism\n&quot;So=\r\nmetimes Hana&#39;s self-control makes me uneasy.  Those who do not \nknow the de=\r\npths of her feelings and the tenderness of her heart \nmight regard her as c=\r\nallous.  They would make a great mistake!&quot;\n\nPage 118\n*I certainly HOPE that=\r\n a certain member of the TMPD called upon to \nprovide security of the Queen=\r\n Mother, on more than one occasion \nwould =96not- be subject to this form o=\r\nf treatment (^_^)\n&quot;An evening or two ago I was invited to a Japanese supper=\r\n at the \npalace of the Emperor&#39;s mother.  The court ladies pressed &quot;sake&quot; o=\r\nn \nme, intending to amuse themselves by making me rather drunk.  I was \nequ=\r\nal to the occasion, however, having a fairly strong head.&quot;\n\n*Dr. Baelz also=\r\n treated, and saved the life of Emperor Meiji&#39;s real \nbirth mother, Nii no =\r\ntsubone.\n\n(plain clothes policeman)\nPage 83\nMori Arinori was the Minister o=\r\nf education I think=85Mori made very \nmany important contributions during t=\r\nhe era but many western \nscholars will mention that Mori wanted English to =\r\nbe the official \nlanguage of Japan (it is sad that a person&#39;s most radical =\r\nbelief \nends up defining him historically)  \n&quot;As soon as Mori entered the r=\r\noom, Nishino sprang on him and stabbed \nhim in the belly with a great kitch=\r\nen-knife.  A plain clothes \npoliceman (the minister&#39;s constant attendant), =\r\narmed with a Japanese \ntwo-handed sword disguised as a swordstick, drew his=\r\n weapon and \ninstantly clove Nishino&#39;s skull.  For some obscure reason it w=\r\nas \nthree hours before professional help could be secured for Mori, who \nby=\r\n that time was unconscious from loss of blood.&quot;\n\n*I have read 2 accounts of=\r\n Mori Arinori murder and this is the \n*first time that I have heard of Mori=\r\n&#39;s bodyguard=85.interesting how \nmuch time passed before he was given medic=\r\nal aid\n\nTreated Okuma, the minister of foreign affairs after assassination =\r\n\nattempt\nDr. Baelz was also the trusted physician of Yamagata Aritomo and \n=\r\nNUMEROUS other important figures (e.g. Viscount Enomoto, crown \nprince =3D =\r\nemperor Taisho)=85 and often called upon to treat important \nforeign dignit=\r\naries=85.essentially this German doctor knew many people \non a professional=\r\n and personal basis.\n\n*a Matsudaira plays polo\n----------------------------=\r\n-\nPICS (there is a pic of his daughter Uta who died young...it was \nextreme=\r\nly depressing to read his diary entries during that period)\nhttp://1happytu=\r\nrtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelztitle.jpg\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelz1.=\r\njpg\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/DrBaelz/drbaelz2.jpg\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/Dr=\r\nBaelz/drbaelzfamily.jpg\n*Dr. Baelz frequently mentions his BELOVED wife aft=\r\ner the birth of \ntheir son...I believe that entries regarding the courtship=\r\n of Hana \nwere omitted by the folks who published the book because Dr. Bael=\r\nz \nhad the tendency to write down just about -everything- in his \npersonal =\r\ndiary....he took a great interest in the status of \nwoman...and he was very=\r\n much a down to earth normal young man\n\n*secretarytocapt3*\n\n\n\n\n\n"
