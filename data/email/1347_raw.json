So basically we have Fujita Goro in a\nplay and in a novel.  Furthermore if you nifty\nhttp://www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/bbs_06.cgi and check out the reply\nto my post the name NAGAKURA SHINPACHI shows up very clearly in her\nreply. Although the translation isn&#39;t clear (is it EVER?) it means\nthat the writer of either the play [or] novel had the 2 meet ^_^\nawesome fanfiction we can&#39;t read.\n\nI was reading some more Seinan War stuff and found that the soldiers\nhad 2 major complaints.  Keep in mind that much of the hard fighting\nwill occur after the month of February and southern Japan supposedly\nhas hot/humid conditions AND often these guys had to climb\nhills/mountains.\n1) uniforms were too hot\n2) leather boots/shoes extremely uncomfortable and finally the\nofficials allowed their guys to go back and wear good old straw sandals...\n*if you examine the pic http://www.3-hajime.com/syouzou2.html\nthe sitting next to Fujita Goro was wearing straw sandals \n\nWar coverage\nThere was a strong desire by the government to cover the war in\ndetail, hence the newspaper article we have which mentions F.G. not\nsurprisingly the articles may not be 100% accurate, because the gov.\nwanted people in the cities to stay optimistic (people were wondering\nwhy it was taking soo long to supress the rebellion---reasons will\nappear in my write up).  While the war was going on in the south,\nTokyo was experiencing a series of mysterious fires and arson was\nsuspected.  Basically people in the city had very good reason to fear\nthat rebel sympathizers were retaliating.  Furthermore, before the\nSiege of Kumamoto castle/garrison (in February) there was an earlier\nnight attack on the same garrison where 300 policeman were killed (I\nbelieve the number includes injuries? 300 is a very high number the\nnumber of rebels is not clear)...regardless of how many were killed\nwhat is clear is that many bodies were found still in bed which\nreveals the true nature of the attack...it was an inside job AND some\nofficers, it is BELIEVED by  writers, let the rebels inside the\ngarrison. Kumamoto had policemen who were natives of Satsuma as well.\n  This news once it entered the major cities started a whirlwind of\nrumors amongst the population. In the month of March the gov.\nattempted to implement &quot;western/modern&quot; strategies which were\nineffective or incompatible to the rough terrain.   \n\n\n"
