Nagakura had not even taken on his adopted name yet. They were still sorting out the organization of the police department in that year. No one could have had the time to track down one former Shinsengumi member for Miki. And you miss the bigger point: WHY go after NAGAKURA?! If he could track someone down then WHY NOT SAITO? After all, at that point he was no one important to the police department. It&#39;s not like Kawaji would have gone &quot;But Miki, I think I might need that guy some day!&quot; And somehow I doubt Miki was with the police then either, considering that the Sekihoutai had just been betrayed the year before. \n\nIf you&#39;ll recall in our chat session eariler this month, Serizawa even termed it a &quot;chance meeting&quot;. People bump into each other all the time in the strangest places. It&#39;s not that amazing to me that Miki could be walking down the street and suddenly go &quot;Wait a minute! That&#39;s Nagakura over there!&quot;\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
