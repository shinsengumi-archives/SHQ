Of course the cops end up going after him for murder. He appeals to Kondou to help him get away and Kondou end sup taking him to Serizawa who both had met during that earlier encounter. Kondou suspects Serizawa had a hand in aiding the escape of some of those involved in the assassination at the Sakurada Gate so he finagles him into using hs connections to get Saitou out of town. \n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
