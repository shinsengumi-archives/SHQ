In 1877, eleven years after the close of the war of \nthe \n&gt; restoration, a rebellion broke out in the south which required a \n&gt; considerable expenditure of blood and money for its suppression.  \n&gt; When the new war began, these two ladies presented a petition to \nthe \n&gt; government, in which they begged that they might be allowed to \nmake \n&gt; amends for their former position of opposition to the Emperor, by \n&gt; going with the army to the field as hospital nurses.  At that \ntime, \n&gt; no lady in Japan had ever gone to the front to nurse the wounded \n&gt; soldiers; but to those two brave women was granted the privilege \nof \n&gt; making atonement for past disloyalty, by the exercise of the skill \n&gt; and nerve that they had gained in their experience of war against \nthe \n&gt; Emperor, in the nursing of soldiers wounded in his defense.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *perhaps these two Aizu women had husbands or brothers who like \nmany \n&gt; former Aizu samurai joined the police force and the army during \nthe \n&gt; outbreak of the Seinan War (SAtsuma Rebellion)\n&gt; \n&gt; She also writes about the warrior training of samurai women, and \n&gt; ofcourse the information was from her Aizu friends.  Thus the book \nis \n&gt; not merely a general snapshot of women in Meiji Era Japan, but \nwomen \n&gt; during the end of feudalism and provides valuable insight into the \n&gt; lives of those who lived in Aizu.  There is even a painting of a \n&gt; woman using a chain and sickle against another woman wielding a \n&gt; naginata.\n\n\n\n\n"
