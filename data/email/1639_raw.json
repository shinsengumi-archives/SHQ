Therefore, it is not strange even \nif Aizu has him.Incidentally, from formation of Shinsengumi in 1863 \nto disappearance of Shinsengumi in 1869, only two persons, Shimada \nKai and Ozeki Masajirou, were on the register in Shinsengumi, and \nlived to Meiji Era.) \nAccording to the photograph of Dvc00610, my answer seemed to be the \ncorrect answer.^^ \n\nThank you for the again lovely photographs. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
