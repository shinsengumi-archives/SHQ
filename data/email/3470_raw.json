I know that it seems very boring to work at a museum but in the Meiji =\r\nera they were fascinating places because the modern nation state tried to d=\r\nevelop and image and history to present to its citizens in the capital by u=\r\nsing these museums.\n\nWhat is so confusing is that the museum moves, and get=\r\ns renamed in the Meiji Era (-_-).\n\nMy email is secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.=\r\ncom\n\nHopefully by finding all these bits and pieces we can incorporate thes=\r\ne details into the e-book which can be a great resource for everyone who wa=\r\nnts a really really in depth bio on Saitou in English.\n\nThanks for your hel=\r\np Bonnie!\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Bonnie Johnston &lt;bonnielala@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, Secretary!\n&gt; \n&gt; My husband works at Texas A&M, and their librar=\r\ny has a copy, according to\n&gt; the online catalog.  I&#39;d be happy to check it =\r\nout -- will email you when I\n&gt; get my hands on it, and you can ask me all t=\r\nhe questions you want.  I have a\n&gt; scanner, too, so could send you scans of=\r\n pics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bon\n\n\n"
