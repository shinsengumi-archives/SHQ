This post contains some spoilers. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think I&#39;ve told already about this manga, but I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure if I posted here \n&gt; or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m talking about the manga of Misaki Saitou about\n&gt; Shinsengumi &quot;Hinata no \n&gt; Ookami&quot;(Wolves in the sunshine) that I&#39;ve just read\n&gt; the 2nd volume recently come \n&gt; out.\n&gt; \n&gt; I put the links to amazon.jp for volumes published\n&gt; for those who might have \n&gt; interest.\n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4344804538/ref=pd_bxgy_text_2/249-972\n&gt; 5298-2705928\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/434480533X/qid=1112364620/sr=1-1/ref=\n&gt; sr_1_10_1/249-9725298-2705928\n&gt; \n&gt; And here is the link for the artist&#39;s site.\n&gt;\nhttp://www.linkclub.or.jp/~misaki-2/shinsengumi/hinata.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess many of you can&#39;t accept the character\n&gt; design, especially for \n&gt; strangely effeminate look Hijikata.\n&gt; Yes, the guy with long straight hair on the cover\n&gt; isn&#39;t other than him. \n&gt; Myself, when I saw the image for the first time, I\n&gt; thought the guy would be Okita.\n&gt; But he isn&#39;t. Okita, who is usually described as a\n&gt; bish, is a tall and \n&gt; &quot;flatfish like&quot; face guy in this manga, and that\n&gt; would be more real. \n&gt; Anyway, the artist said she has changed deliberately\n&gt; the design of Hijikata, \n&gt; that meant she didn&#39;t care the famous photo or\n&gt; historical look of him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other main characters you know well having\n&gt; rather modern hairstyle and no \n&gt; one has shaved hair or topknot.\n&gt; However, after being shocked by those character\n&gt; designs, I can notice that \n&gt; this manga is not so eccentric as Shinsengumi manga.\n&gt; I can say this one is rather &quot;classic&quot; of the genre,\n&gt; I mean more &quot;historical \n&gt; &quot;or serious than what we can imagine from the first\n&gt; impression.\n&gt; There are many well known episodes and details like\n&gt; the fire at Honjo juku on \n&gt; the way to Kyoto, Serizawa and Oume etc.\n&gt; Currently, the Roushitai has arrived at Kyoto and\n&gt; Shieikan people and \n&gt; Serizawa group decided to stay despite Kiyokawa&#39;s\n&gt; plot.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is by no means yaoi type manga ( I think) ,\n&gt; however seeing Serizawa \n&gt; drunken asking Hijikata to sit on his lap, or that\n&gt; same Serizawa commenting on \n&gt; Hijikata who has killed a man for the first time,\n&gt; that he (Hijikata) looked like \n&gt; a young girl who had just lost her virginity, made\n&gt; me laugh a lot.\n&gt; The story become strangely fascinating after all and\n&gt; now, after recent \n&gt; disappointment with PMK which has been unfortunately\n&gt; stopped, I have another \n&gt; interesting Shinsengumi manga to be continued. \n&gt; And I&#39;m looking forward to see appearance of some\n&gt; characters from now on.
