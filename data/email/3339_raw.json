Han=\r\nnah not only enters into\ndangerous surroundings but also finds herself in t=\r\nhe middle of an\nunlikely love triangle between two samurai.  \n\nLet&#39;s just s=\r\nay the other man in the story is not too happy with his\nlover&#39;s newly acqui=\r\nred &quot;barbarian&quot; pet.\n\nOverall this is a very strong work that is both roman=\r\ntic and thrilling\n at the same time.\n\nI leave you with a quote from the eve=\r\nr hard to please Mrs. Giggles, a\nwell known reviewer of romance novels:\n\nHa=\r\nnnah&#39;s &quot;free show leads to her being bought by one of the men in the\naudien=\r\nce. ...Hannah is not a happy property and she bites too, not\nthat Katsu is =\r\ntoo unhappy about that.&quot;\nquoted from http://www.mrsgiggles.com/ebooks/sheri=\r\ndan_captive.html\n\nCheck out the cover here:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/2qgwwr\n\nSo i=\r\nf you are above 18 and looking for some \nmxf, fxf and samurai x samurai set=\r\n in pre-modern Japan head over here:\nhttp://www.loose-id.net/BSSaCaex.aspx\n=\r\n(there is a sample excerpt on this page too)\n\nLearn more about the book her=\r\ne:\nhttp://b-sheridan.livejournal.com/41350.html\n\nTidbit:  The character of =\r\nKatsu is supposed to look like major star\nHiroyuki Sanada (^_^)\n\n\nI know th=\r\nat e-books may be a bit new for some people but I always\nfound them to be v=\r\nery convenient when I had a borrowed laptop.  You\ncan always balance out co=\r\nmputer work with a quick break by reading a\nchapter or two in an e-book.  L=\r\noose-id is a great site with an easy to\nuse and secure shopping cart.  So i=\r\nf you&#39;ve never bought an e-book\nbefore then let Samurai Captive introduce y=\r\nou to this new medium for\nliterature.\n\n\n"
