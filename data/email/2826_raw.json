(I believe s=\r\nome mistakes to be human errors \nor/and typos.) \n\n-------------------------=\r\n--------------------\nsecretarytocapt3\nNlf7, believe me, we do double check =\r\n(when possible), as I tried to \nexplain already sometimes book &quot;A&quot; says som=\r\nething and book &quot;B&quot; says \nsomething\n\n***if there is a conflict or discrepen=\r\ncies between two authors then \nwe put {BOTH} texts, and quotes side by side=\r\n \n---------------------------------------------\nNLF7\n&gt; Also, make sure your=\r\n &quot;historical references&quot; are actually in the \nhistory section and are not \n=\r\n&gt; categorized as (historical) fiction. For example, many regard the \ntrilog=\r\ny by Shimozawa Kan \n&gt; as &quot;historical references&quot; but in fact, his Shinsengu=\r\nmi books are \ncategorized as (historical) \n&gt; fiction. \nhttp://www.shinsengu=\r\nmihq.com/bibliography2.htm\n\n--------------------------------------\nsecretar=\r\nytocapt3\n\nAre you confusing us with another site?\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq=\r\n.com/bibliography.htm\ncontains historical texts and we have never listed Sh=\r\nimozawa Kan&#39;s \nwork there\n\nHOWEVER\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliograph=\r\ny2.htm\ndoes contain fiction or non-fiction Japanese texts clearly marked in=\r\n \nthe right hand column\n\nthanks for your suggestions\n----------------------=\r\n----------------\nNLF7\n&gt; &gt; and about Okita&#39;s birthday\n&gt; &gt; have you seen his =\r\nupdated page?\n&gt; &gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; I was =\r\nNOT talking about his birthday earlier today.  \n---------------------------=\r\n-----------\nsecretarytocapt3\nI used his birthday as an example that I&#39;m try=\r\ning to catch up with \nyou\n\nas I mentioned before I am not an expert on Okit=\r\na\n\nTHUS, when you are done revising and combining your wikipedia Okita \ninf=\r\normation with what we have now..just email and I will get it \nuploaded ASAP=\r\n\n\nsecretarytocapt3 =3D monkey who manages the site (^___^)\n\nI don&#39;t own the=\r\n site, I just volunteer when possible, I am only \nresponsible for my contri=\r\nbutions not the entire site actually\n--------------------------------------=\r\n\nNLF7\n&gt; I&#39;ve already given you a list of books.  However, I haven&#39;t used \nq=\r\nuotes in regard of the \n&gt; Shinsengumi. \n-----------------------------------=\r\n---\nsecretarytocap3\n\nMy point is this:  I can give you hundreds of books on=\r\n the Bakumatsu \nright now and say &quot;those are my sources&quot; however you have t=\r\no \n*specifY* sources.  You cannot say &quot;I got my fact from one of those \n10 =\r\nbooks&quot;.  I&#39;m not arguing with you or anything but that is just \nhow things =\r\nwork (not at the SHQ) but now many websites are adopting \nbasic standards t=\r\no strengthen their fandom...as I mentioned before \nif you are in school--yo=\r\nu should be aware that even basica 5 \nparagraph essay requires you to do th=\r\nis\n--------------------------------------\nNLF7\n&gt; fans of the Shinsengumi/Ok=\r\nita don&#39;t have access to SHQ nor want to \njoin it. (To tell you \n&gt; the trut=\r\nh, it took me a while before I decided to join this group.)\n\n--------------=\r\n------------------------\nsecretarytocapt3\n\nI don&#39;t know what you are referr=\r\ning to...this is a public \ngroup...there are many Shinsengumi fandoms, some=\r\n based on certain \nuniverses such as PMK, RK and so forth...we are very gen=\r\neral \n--------------------------------------\nNLF7\n&gt; In addition, I suggest =\r\nthat we merge the Okita Soji article at \nWikipedia and the Okita article \n&gt;=\r\n at SHQ.\n--------------------------------------\nsecretarytocapt3\n\nI agree! =\r\n You can do this, like I said just tell me when you are \ndone please.  Ever=\r\nything remains your work and you will be the \nauthor.\n---------------------=\r\n-----------------\nNLF7\n&gt; Nevertheless, the Wikipedia&#39;s linked to library ne=\r\ntworks so \nimproving articles at  at \n&gt; Wikipedia is certainly more than wo=\r\nrthwhile. (At least, that&#39;s \nwhat I tell myself when I feel \n&gt; like giving =\r\nup.) \n--------------------------------------\nsecretarytocapt3\n\nWhy would yo=\r\nu think of giving up? Currently Wikipedia is not \nacceptable in terms of ci=\r\ntation.  The reason is that the internet is \nalways in &quot;flux&quot;.  The reason =\r\nwhy books dominate academia is because \nthe text is &quot;frozen&quot;.  Although Wik=\r\nipedia has a time stamp on \ncommentary, it is still hard to determine autho=\r\nrship.  Books however \nhave clear cut editors and authorship--again for the=\r\n purpose of \ncitation.  I can post something to shinsengumihq.com right now=\r\n, and \nchange it in 5 minutes--this causes confusion unlike a book which \nr=\r\nemains &quot;static&quot;---or undergoes a revision and becomes a new edition.\n------=\r\n--------------------------------\nNLF7\nAs anyone could see from the history =\r\nof every article on the \nShinsengumi, I&#39;ve done many \n&gt; corrections and whe=\r\nnever there was any conflicting info, my \nversion would always end up \n&gt; on=\r\n top (since my edits could be backed up with research and \nhistorical refer=\r\nences.)\n--------------------------------------\nsecretarytocapt3\nCurrently t=\r\nhere are no resident historians (you can get a degree in \nhistory and speci=\r\nalize but there is no licensing ^_^) at Wikipedia \nto oversee your work---y=\r\nour corrections are at the top because they \nare the most recent.  Your edi=\r\nts are backed by books---but again \nyour citation method is still too gener=\r\nal.\n\nPromise you aren&#39;t mad at secretarytocapt3?  I am giving \nsuggestions.=\r\n..I am a student of history and I study the development \nof social institut=\r\nions---I am familiar with various methods of \nstudying history---I don&#39;t wa=\r\nnt to make the study of the shinsengumi \nboring at all---I write silly fanf=\r\nic, do fanart and videos too it&#39;s \njust that we must put our best foot forw=\r\nard when it comes to history\n\n\n\n\n"
