Dairi hanjou de kuge andou. \nTokoyononaka you ga ishou&quot;\n\nIt was written shortly after Aizu kicked Choshu out of Kyoto, and it means \n&quot;Lord Aizu Higo (no Kami) is the Protector of Kyoto. The Palace is safe, the \nnobles are unharmed. Peace and order have returned to the world.&quot;\n\n---\n(Commentary)\n\nFor the record, though I&#39;ve only read part of &quot;Samurai Sketches,&quot; I have \nnever trusted Romulus Hillsborough-- a man who, despite having never been \ntrained in critical historical analysis, has the pretense to write &quot;history&quot; \nbooks which, like your review said, are essentially in support of his own \nheroes. I have less of a problem with him than with Stephen Turnbull, \nthough-- a man who, though trained as an historian, writes books (including \na whole chapter in one of them about Aizu) with GAPING inaccuracies.\n\nAs I am currently working on a full-length (50 or so pages) paper about the \nAizu domain in teh Bakumatsu period (including Shinsengumi), I feel the need \nto point out some things that I have noticed.\n\nHillsborough is essentially of the Marius Jansen school-- the school of \nthought which says &quot;Aizu=Tokugawa partisans to the end, end of story.&quot; The \nfact of the matter is that Aizu was the only domain bound in writing to obey \nthe Shogunate to the last, but that even so, the internal dissent against \ngoing to Kyoto was so extreme that Saigo Tanomo and Tanaka Tosa, two of the \nsenior councilors, went all the way to Edo to beg Katamori to reject it. But \nmen like Matsudaira Shungaku (this is mentioned in Conrad Totman&#39;s book \n&quot;Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;) basically gave Katamori a guilt trip, \nsaying that the Aizu founder Hoshina Masayuki would have taken the job in a \nheartbeat. Katamori, being adopted, must have felt guilty, so knowing full \nwell the impact it would have on his domain&#39;s peasants, but also knowing \nfull well that he had his hands tied in every way imaginable, went to Kyoto. \nIn the Boshin War, Katamori had long since given up on Yoshinobu, and he and \nEnomoto Takeaki, far from wanting to reinstate the Shogun, kept begging for \nmercy and making proposals for peaceful settlements (this is mentioned in \nthe book &quot;Young Japan&quot;). Katsu Kaishu was also working hard for a peaceful, \ngenerous settlement for the Tokugawa-- but as in Kyoto with the &#39;extreme&#39; \nChoshu faction that was attacked by Shinsengumi at Ikedaya-- in Edo, the \nShogitai-- the REAL &quot;Tokugawa Partisans&quot;-- who I would go so far as to \ndescribe as &quot;rabid&quot; partisans-- attacked the forces of the new government \nand thus dashed any hopes for peace.\n\nThe Northern Alliance (Oetsu Reppan Domei) is also seen by the Jansen school \nas being &quot;pro-Tokugawa,&quot; when in fact most of its members were &quot;outer&quot; \n(tozama) lords, with only a handful of Tokugawa vassal (fudai) domains and a \ncouple of Tokugawa-branch domains, probably only Aizu and Moriyama or Miharu \n(not sure which one). Their intentions? As stated in their statement to the \nforeign powers, &quot;We will destroy the offenders (Satsuma/Choshu). Those who \nfly before us we shall not pursue; but we will reconquer Japan, that the \nEmperor may indeed reign over it.&quot; (from &quot;Young Japan&quot;) Thus, it wasn&#39;t a \nmatter of Shogun vs. Emperor, it was a matter of a grudge that Choshu had \nagainst Aizu for sponsoring the anti-Choshu expeditions and fighting against \nthe Choshu &quot;activists&quot; in Kyoto. Hence the reason why Katamori begged for \nmercy but was not heard-- he was operating under the assumption that what \nwas going on concerned the Emperor, when in fact it was simply between him \nand Choshu, and with Choshu surrounding the Emperor (as Aizu had done \nbefore),ï¿½@there would be no answer to his pleas.\n\nNeither was Rinnoji no Miya, the Imperial prince who led the Northern \nAlliance, a &quot;second Emperor&quot; like the Northern and Southern Courts \n(Nanbokucho) era. Though the Northern Alliance adopted a new reign name \n(Taisei instead of Meiji), Rinnoji no Miya was never referred to as \n&quot;tenno&quot;-- &quot;Emperor,&quot; though he did take the name of Tobu.\n\nYes, there was extortion and forcible appropriation on both sides. This too \ndeserves to be studied more closely in order for both sides to be studied \nproperly. The actions of the Shogitai are particularly unfortunate, in my \nopinion.\n\nHowever, what amazes me is that even when Enomoto was in Hokkaido he still \npractically begged for mercy and a peaceful settlement, saying &quot;We pray that \nthis portion of the Empire (Hokkaido) may be conferred upon our former \nmaster, Tokugawa Kamenosuke (Yoshinobu&#39;s adopted son and successor), and in \nthat case, we shall repay your benificence by our faithful guardianship of \nthe northern gate.&quot; (&quot;Young Japan,&quot; page 241) Naturally, however, having \nendured the campaigns in Echigo, Aizu, and Mutsu/Dewa, and the unfortunate \nepisode of the Shogitai, the new government was in no disposition to listen \nto such a request, and moved to attack Hokkaido.\n\nThe bottom line is, in the words of General William Tecumseh Sherman, that \n&quot;war is Hell.&quot;\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
