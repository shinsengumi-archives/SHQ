Hadn&#39;t had the time (and\nmoney!) to do so T_T\n\nI have seen several Shinsengumi mangas, but none got\nreally my attention.\n\n\n\n&gt; Kamo-san no kotodakara iroiro yondeisou....\n&gt; &quot;PAPUWA&quot; toka &quot;Gintama&quot; toka made shitteitara\n&gt; watashi wa\n&gt; kanari odoroki masu.^^\n\n\n\n&quot;PAPUWA&quot; wa kiita koto ga arimasuga, yonda koto ga\narimasen ^^;;; &quot;Gintama&quot; wa Jump dakara shitte imasu.\nDemo yonde imasen ^^;;; Shinsengumi-ppoi chara ga deru\nkoto wa shitte imasu ga, sore dake desu. ^^;;;\n(demo Shinsengumi kara deta chara nante Yamato datte\naru shi ne ^^;;;)\n\n\n&gt; &gt; (seen also in Bakumatsu Fuunroku Makoto),\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, did you also read this? \n&gt; Is this Manga which Koudansya published? \n\n\nYup, it is ^^ 5 volumes, if I am not mistaken.\n\n\n&gt; In fact, I am not reading this Manga.\n&gt; Is this interesting? \n\n\nNot that much. It&#39;s interesting how the author\nportrayed Serizawa-Hijikata interaction, but the art\nis below average and the story isn&#39;t that appealing,\nnot to mention that they don&#39;t use the famous\nShinsengumi uniform ^^;;;\n\nIt really seems that it was ended because of\n&quot;uchikiri&quot;.\n \n\n&gt; I think that &quot;Getsumeiseiki&quot; has set up Kondou&#39;s\n&gt; character very \n&gt; well. \n&gt; Other Shinsengumi works value Hijikata and Okita and\n&gt; recognize \n&gt; Kondou&#39;s existence small in many cases. \n&gt; Especially Manga has many the tendencies. \n\n\n\nThat&#39;s true enough. Kondou tends to play rather a\nsecondary role in most manga.\n\n\n&gt; There is assassination of Serizawa in the 5th\n&gt; volume. \n\n\no.o I haven&#39;t seen the 5th volume yet... I have to\nsearch for this...\n\n\n&gt; I have not seen Serizawa sadder than this Manga. \n\n\nSerizawa is a good character in this manga. Though,\nthe BEST Serizawa so far is still that Serizawa from\n&quot;Shinsetsu Shinsengumi&quot;, IMHO ^^;;; Mechakucha kakkoii\ndesu.\n\n\n&gt; The episode of Ikedaya started with the magazine\n&gt; (Young Sunday). \n&gt; Masuya was arrested by Shinsengumi this week. \n\n\nI haven&#39;t checked this week&#39;s YS yet. I have seen only\nthat it was the beginning of the Ikedaya incident.\nThese days I was too busy checking Pluto, so... ^^;;;\nbtw, Pluto is a HIGHLY recommended manga, though it\nhas NOTHING to do with the Shinsengumi ^^;;; It&#39;s\nabout Astro Boy ^^;; Urasawa Naoki rules *_*\n\n\n&gt; By the way, although it got cold in Tokyo suddenly,\n&gt; how is Aizu? \n\n\nA bit cooler (about 15C). But mostly cloudy, which is\na pain. But at night, the Tsurugajo Castle is very\nnice ^^\n\n\n&gt; It is better to take care about condition, since it\n&gt; will get cold \n&gt; still from now on. \n\n\nThanks!
