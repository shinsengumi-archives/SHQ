I would \n&gt;love to see it for myself. Can anyone direct me? \n&gt;thanks Logan,\n\nLogan -  If you are up to the task of purchasing or renting (through your local Chinese/Korean/Japanese retail market-rental), there is a DVD release of the Shinsengumi drama.  The legal release is put out by Geneon(Pioneer) and is purchasable at websites like YesAsia.\n\nVolume 1 (I believe of 2) is YesAsia Catalog No.:1003916602. Volume 2 should also be listed.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a good connection, you may download fansubs using bittorrent.  See http://d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php for the list of torrents, and their corresponding FAQ if you are unfamiliar with the p2p client Bittorrent.\n\n From my understanding the available torrent is taken from a screengrab of the subtitled  English version that aired in some select places in the U.S.  The subtitles are embedded , not softsubs.\n\nThere have been a few &#39;regionless&#39; editions that have shown up on Ebay.  Most likely, unless they state that they are Region 2, Geneon releases these are pirated versions.  I do not know if they are copies of the legal releases, or are HK versions (with questionable English subtitles) or pressings of the fansub versions. Buyer beware.  \n\n\nS\n\n*red-bird.org*\n\n\n\n\n"
