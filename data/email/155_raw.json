Also, the type of\n&gt; &gt; spoken bungo depended on what social class the person was from. \n&gt; So, a\n&gt; &gt; farmer would talk differently than a samurai, the shogun would \ntalk\n&gt; &gt; differently than a ronin, and the Emperor&#39;s bungo was so archaic \nthat\n&gt; &gt; even when Showa Tenno (Emperor Hirohito) delivered his surrender\n&gt; &gt; speech over the radio in 1945, most of the people had no idea \nwhat he\n&gt; &gt; was talking about.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, the word &quot;Bungo&quot; in this case is not to be confused \nwith\n&gt; &gt; the former province of Bungo (now Oita Prefecture) in Kyushu...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --M.\n\n\n"
