The keyword\nis &quot;most&quot; of the paintings.\n\nSo I placed all the pics on this temporary page\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NN2.html\nmy goal is to fix it up and then it will be moved into its permanent\nhome at http://www.shinsengumihq.com\n\nOkay, now I know Nakajima N. totally went all out with his work...we\nhave 26 of his paintings and there were 3-4 archive.org could not\nretrieve making the possibility that he painted a total of 40! very\nhigh...he must&#39;ve had some serious time on his hands. I mentioned that\nthere was a seminar planned to show all of his work and his descendant\nwas going to give a lecture...one of the Japanese sites said the\nlecture was cancelled and it was going to be a full house too...all\npossible seats were taken.\n\n[PLEASE please HELP----problem]\n1) I made thumbnails of the portraits and made it so that a new window\npops up with an enlarged version of the image...I must&#39;ve messed up\nthe javascript or something because the homepage ALSO pops up...I&#39;m\n~really~ tired...if anyone understands code please help I thought I\ntyped everything correctly.  Just visit the site and click on\nthumbnails you&#39;ll know what I mean.\n\nI know just a couple of you can read Japanese and if you are\ninterested I did get the Japanese which came with the\nportraits...however the webmaster didn&#39;t include text for every single\nimage...oh and for those of you to ~afraid~ to deal with the fish I\ndid prebabel text for you too...you can download the file at\nhttp://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3\nfile name:NakajimaN (SMALL files on word~fast download 362kb)\npassword:makoto\n\n***there is a high possibility that somewhere along the lines I may\nhave switched someone&#39;s name...it is because I&#39;ve been working on this\nfor 2 days...during work 15-20 min breaks...so it was tough\n\n\n"
