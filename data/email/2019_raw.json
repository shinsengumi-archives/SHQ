At first we&#39;d planned to go in mid-May to early June, but now because of various factors, I&#39;m having second thoughts.\n\nSo my question for those who&#39;ve been to Japan (I know there are a few) is: What time would you think is best for the trip? May-June as above, or early autumn (probably September)? Mostly in terms of weather and chance to catch interesting festivals and such (we&#39;ll be travelling all over Japan) but also prices/chances of getting hotel rooms, and so forth.\n\nOh, and if you really feel like helping out, you can answer another burning question... is there such a thing as public laundromats in Japan?\n\nThanks for any answers!\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
