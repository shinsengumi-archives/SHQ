For example, a fan with an\n&gt; interest in British involvement will be surprised that by following\n&gt; British diplomats during the Bakumatsu, they will be reading about\n&gt; bakufu troop movements in the North (which is ofcourse comprised of\n&gt; Shinsengumi). Or perhaps someone who studies Korea and is interested\n&gt; in Satsuma will be able to focus on Saigo Takamori in the early 1870s\n&gt; and really gain an understanding of the motivations of winners of the\n&gt; Boshin War.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;k kobayakawa&quot;\n&gt; &lt;kobaya635@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am reading Wikipedia Shinsengumi section andI am really surprised\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; power of pop culture.\n&gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsengumi\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Depictions in Media&quot; is so detailed but description about\n&gt; Shinsengumi\n&gt; &gt; itself is quite simple.\n&gt; &gt; Especially &quot;End of the Shinsengumi&quot; is too simple while there is a\n&gt; &gt; description about porn Shinsengumi game on &quot;Depictions in Media&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t it weird?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
