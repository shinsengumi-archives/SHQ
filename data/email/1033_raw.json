Apparently Matsudaira Katamori was \nyelling at Hijikata to go get reinforcements from Shonai (a neighboring \ndomain), so Hijikata took a group (don&#39;t know how large) of Aizu samurai and \nleft. After he left, he heard that Shonai had fallen, so he instead went to \nSendai and joined up with Enomoto, who was on his way to Hokkaido.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
