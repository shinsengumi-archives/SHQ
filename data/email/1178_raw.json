(And just where was the alcoholic little brother, I wonder...  was Suzuki already under the table (if that was even possible)?)\n \n&gt;&gt;4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider\nSaigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also\nplenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo\nTakamori, who could have understood the plea of\nYamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed in\nEdo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were\ngood men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin side,\nas well as bad men in both, IMHO :)&lt;&lt;\n\nAnd just possibly Saigou is an example of how a man could be both good AND bad... a human condition.  Unless you can give me some good evidence to the contrary (and you&#39;re probably one person who can), I will go on thinking he had a role in Sagara Souzou&#39;s demise.  And certainly there is no offense meant on my part... the times were incredibly difficult, confusing, and deeply emotional.  It&#39;s amazing to me just how much more deeply I feel about certain people and ideas during the bakumatsu and Restoration than I feel for my own country&#39;s revolution.  It&#39;s weird.\n\nphil (Itou & Saitou drinking together??? If you can&#39;t trust your drinking buddies, who can you trust?  :-D)\nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
