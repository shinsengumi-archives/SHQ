I think someone should do a doujinshi including stuff like this... the trials and tribulations of being married to Saitou Hajime.\n \nPutting this in a SaiSa mode, while I consider Sanosuke to be relatively neat for all his ruffian ways, can you imagine Saitou being like that with Sano???  Can you say, &quot;Futae no kiwami!&quot;?  :-D\n \nOne thing I&#39;ve always liked about RK Saitou... his general laid back nature and his little &quot;rebelling&quot; at not wearing his jacket completely buttoned-up... kind of like his agreeing to work for the Meiji government (because they need him, obviously), but he&#39;s going to hold out on being a *completely* proper Meiji cop as a way of retaining some independence.  How neat can he be when he lets cigarette ash fall all over the place and at least in the manga, fills ashtrays to overflowing?  Ah, but I guess that&#39;s Tokio&#39;s responsibility, even if she probably did have a maid to do the housework.\n \nphil\n\nBarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nWarg3791@... wrote:\n\n&gt;Can you imagine Saito doing that to Tokio?!\n&gt;\nTokio---&quot;Fine.
