Thanks!\n\nIf it&#39;s Tanihara you wish to admire and/or drool over you MUST get one \nof his early films---Fudoh. Sky High is also quite good with freaky cool \nparanormal elements. he was also very good in a small part in Sleepless \nTown and I&#39;m sure Ms. Phil and Sec & Tama will agree that if you can get \nhold of Deborah the Rival you&#39;ll be thrilled and amazed. ^_^\n\nHe&#39;s also done quite a few J-Dramas.\n\nAnd any film or drama you come across with Koichi Sato (Serizawa)is also \na good bet.\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nhttp://www.dragonsdisciple.com\n\n"
