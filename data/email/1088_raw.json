However, as the birth of the \n&gt; Emperor&#39;s heir approaches, political intrigue and jealousy will lead \n&gt; to the most dangerous betrayal from within the Onmyoji.\n&gt; \n&gt; Angrybee&#39;s note:  I&#39;ve seen the trailer for this, and it looks \n&gt; utterly spectacular.  Might be good &quot;research&quot; for anyone wanting to \n&gt; explore the &quot;magic&quot; themes in PMK in fics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai7 - http://www.samurai-7.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai7 is based off of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Seven Samurai, but set in \n&gt; the -future-.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Angrybee&#39;s Note:  There&#39;s a good article on Samurai7 in the June/July \n&gt; issue of &quot;Anime Insider&quot;.  Of course, it&#39;s being done by Gonzo, \n&gt; which...I believe, are also the ones who did PMK.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Champloo: http://www.samuraichamploo.com/\n&gt; Gallery: http://www.samuraichamploo.com/Gallery/index.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Champloo, while an odd name, is the first work of Shinchiro \n&gt; Watanabe since Cowboy Bebop.  It is set to air in Japan starting May \n&gt; 19th.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you have enjoyed this list of coming attractions!  Now, if only \n&gt; my local PBS would air the Shinsengumi Drama....\n&gt; \n&gt; Angrybee.\n\n\n"
