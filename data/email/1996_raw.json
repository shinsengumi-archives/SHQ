There is a new film featuring our \n&gt; favorite boys in blue called: Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage. \n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen it, but from what I can understand it is not a \n&gt; strictly historical movie, it&#39;s a fiction where Satsuma sends five \n&gt; Kunoichi to spy on the Shinsengumi. Apparently, it also involves \nsome \n&gt; supernatural events. I&#39;m under the impression that it is not really \na \n&gt; masterpiece, but if you are interrested, more info can be found \nhere:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.dvdlister.com/title.dvd/66d19V6634fs433aceT/\n&gt; \n&gt; Mary-Ann\n\n\n\n\n"
