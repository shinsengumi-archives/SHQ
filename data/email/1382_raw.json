To be \ncontinued... so.\nThey experiment to compare, with and without Sake normaly added to Isida \nSan&#39;yaku and also drunk when taking this medicine, because of eventually effect of \nit. \nThey chose the Sake which is come from Hino area, made by same method of \nthose time in order to have approximate one used by Hijikata or Satou family.\n( This Sake called &quot;Genroku&quot; is produced by Sawanoi brewer: \nhttp://www.sawanoi-sake.com/)\n\nAnd the site tells the effect of Isida San&#39;yaku was attested by Ryojun \nMatsumoto\nin Meiji to have the admission. Because Meiji government prohibited this kind \nof &quot;old wives remedy&quot;, especially charred one like Isida San&#39;yaku. \nThey say also, it&#39;s difficult to think Ryojun attested it with only his \nsympathy for Shinsengumi, considering the political situation of the period.\n\nTama\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
