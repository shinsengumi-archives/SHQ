Ofcourse there should be the &quot;reverse&quot; that is Aizu official \n&gt; records =\r\non the Shinsengumi as well.\n&gt; - Aizu accounts by Yamakawa Hiroshi and Yamak=\r\nawa Kenjiro (whose book \n&gt; does mention the shinsengumi---no shock there bo=\r\nth brothers knew \n&gt; Saitou)---yet both books would have a MULTITUDE of info=\r\nrmants, \n&gt; endless voices but edited and compiled into one book with no cle=\r\nar \n&gt; label who told them what and when\n&gt; \n&gt; In all the items listed above =\r\nthere will be first hand accounts and \n&gt; also second hand accounts actually=\r\n mixed in.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is an example:  Kondou in a letter said that it seem=\r\ns that \n&gt; homosexual activities are being practiced amongst his men.  Did h=\r\ne \n&gt; hear or see this first hand?  Or did someone tell him?\n&gt; \n&gt; For exampl=\r\ne Yamazaki may have heard of something and noted it in his \n&gt; book---but wh=\r\nat did he SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES? But it is still a \n&gt; *primary resource if =\r\nyou follow the definition that it is a &quot;source \n&gt; of information that was c=\r\nreated at or near the time being \n&gt; studied&quot;[wiki article].  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thus wha=\r\nt is important is evaluating sources.  Off the bat it is \n&gt; difficult at ti=\r\nmes to even to ***categorize sources---we just know \n&gt; to exercise caution.=\r\n  We don&#39;t know who is more correct than the \n&gt; other we should however tra=\r\nck who is saying what, to whom and when \n&gt; and if they have a personal inte=\r\nrest in saying certain things.  \n&gt; \n&gt; As Nlf7 and Kitsuno found=85there wil=\r\nl be conflicting info.\n&gt; \n&gt; However a book with a few errors may not be *en=\r\ntirely* innaccurate.\n&gt; For instance if you open any book on the Meiji era..=\r\n.it will likely \n&gt; say that it was during the Meiji era when paper money wa=\r\ns issued.  \n&gt; That is absolutely wrong.  However the book may have other pe=\r\nrtinant \n&gt; facts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t toss the incorrect information yet=85just note=\r\n it all.  \n&gt; For example you can say\n&gt; Samurai Z was born this year (in res=\r\nource A)\n&gt; However (resource B) says otherwise and (resource C) gives even =\r\nmore \n&gt; different information.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have found in my own studies that ove=\r\nr time you will figure out \n&gt; *why there are errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the bottom of =\r\nthis page are some words of wisdom from a really \n&gt; stellar resaercher who =\r\nhas &quot;seen it all&quot; in regards to Meiji Era \n&gt; revisionism which has negative=\r\nly affected the study of the Bakumatsu\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/shins=\r\nenresearch.html\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
