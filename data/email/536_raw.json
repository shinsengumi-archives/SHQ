Since I don&#39;t think these\nprisoners were the type to sit down in a classroom and learn how to\nread and write...martial arts seems to be a good way for them to get\nsome exercise and have law&order and discipline beaten into them if\nneed be.  A perceptive guard can also gauge the\nattitude/character/ability of his students/prisoners as well(weed out\ntroublemakers and do some serious will breaking).  I don&#39;t have any\ninfo on this prison where N.S. worked at...was it a prison of 100%\npure &quot;street&quot; felons or political prisoners who would be released\nafter a while anyways?  In any case,  from the later rebellions and\nconflicts abroad I figure the government wouldn&#39;t mind having men of\n&quot;draftable&quot; age fit and ready to fight.  I&#39;m sure the guards had\nrifles handy so even if it does seem counterproductive to instruct\nthem in martial arts I&#39;m sure the guards in the towers were ready to\nshoot.\n\nhighly recommended in assisting us from getting into the &quot;male&quot;\nswording wielding mind\nhttp://www.e-budo.com\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Oh no the fish shields nothing from you.
