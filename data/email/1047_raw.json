You buy property spaces on a board \nand \n&gt; try to own more than everyone else, charge them outrageous rental \nfees \n&gt; when they land on your spaces etc--It&#39;s American capitalism at it&#39;s \n&gt; finest--or worst-- which is why it&#39;s been selling copies for half a \n&gt; century!!!  LOL\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you see it? Saitou glaring at you in the &quot;Go Directly to Jail&quot; \n&gt; space, Boardwalk and Park place can be Nijo Castle and the Imperial \n&gt; Palace. The &quot;bad part of town&quot;spaces at the game&#39;s beginning can be \n&gt; Shimabara. Instead of  railroads and utility companies and \nrailroads \n&gt; there can be a soba shop, fundoshi emporium, a branch of the \nSheiken \n&gt; Dojo and the Kyoto residences of Choshu, Satsuma and Tosa which of \n&gt; course no one would want to buy...You could even mix and match the \n&gt; various universes and toss in the Kamiya Dojo, the Aoiya and \nKatsu&#39;s \n&gt; newspaper office...the possibilities are endless.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
