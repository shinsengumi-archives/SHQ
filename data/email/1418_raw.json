How on earth did so many of us end up \nin the same RK RPG?\n&gt;  \n&gt; At least I don&#39;t have to come up with a reason why my character is \nstill alive and give him a new persona in this one.  Bringing Sagara \nback to life in rk_onigokko is too cool, but exhausting. (So if I&#39;m \nflirting with Seta over on onigokko, is Saitou going to be flirting \nwith Seta in this one? &lt;wink&gt;  And to think, I never liked Seta... ) \n&gt;  \n\n\nI have no idea how THAT happened. Actually I&#39;ve gone ahead and asked \nKaoru who sent out the invites. I think it&#39;s going to be fun. \nActually I&#39;ve been itching to post again but you and the others are \nstill stuck in the morning. I can&#39;t have Souji &quot;miraculously&quot; appear \nthere. I&#39;m pushing for it though maybe in the afternoon. Hehehehe... \nFlirt with Souji --- ro (You know why I took him right? Okita Souji - \nSeta Soujiro) to your hearts content. Want to scare them a little? ^_^\n\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;On another note if you are going to watch more Chinese films try \nout Fong-Sai-Yuk and Fong-Sai-Yuk II...&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve never been a big fan of Hong Kong films but I love mainstream \ncinema from the People&#39;s Republic and Taiwan (geez... just thought \nabout that... is Taiwan politically correct?), usually those that are \nperiod pieces (like director Zhang Zhimou&#39;s work... spelling probably \noff... the actress Gong Li is usually always in his films... &quot;Raise \nthe Red Lantern&quot; and &quot;Ju Dou&quot; come immediately to mind) or that \nexplore current society.  The only martial arts films I&#39;ve really \nliked were the old samurai films (and probably the new ones when I \nget a chance to see them).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interested enough in cinema history in general, though, that \nI&#39;ll watch the festival, especially the documentary.\n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n\nTo be honest, if you placed a HK or Chinese or Taiwan movie in front \nof me, I won&#39;t be able to tell ^_^*\n\nAs for samurai films it&#39;s only now that I started watching them \nthey&#39;re pretty good although I DO miss the action from the old Kung \nFu movies. I watched them when I was a kid though so maybe they \nweren&#39;t really as good... - Again not sure if those Kung Fu movies \nwere HK/Chinese or what...\n\n\n\n"
