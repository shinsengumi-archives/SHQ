There are \n=\r\nmany &quot;little&quot; treasures and artifacts right in Memorial Union from the \nMei=\r\nji Era and some Wisconsinites had interesting connections to 19th \ncentury =\r\nJapan. \n\nYou may all have already asked yourselves...&quot;well WHAT happened to=\r\n \nSHQ.com?&quot;\n\nEarlier this year, the SHQ hosting company must have experienc=\r\ned a \ntechnical glitch which erased an html file which is basically where a=\r\nll \npages of the website are stored (a database pulls info from this html \n=\r\nfile).  The html file was deleted and it&#39;s not clear what happened.  \nFOrtu=\r\nnately Barbara Sheridan had a back up file of everything and from \nthis fil=\r\ne an e-book will be written.\n\nThe e-book will be designed to be user friend=\r\nly for people new to this \nslice of history and yet written and cited in su=\r\nch a way to make it a \nhelpful research resource.  The e-book will be in a =\r\npdf format for easy \ndownload and should any new additional information be =\r\nadded, it will be \nmentioned on an update page.\n\nFrom examining the SHQ ser=\r\nver, it was obvious to me that new visitors \ntended to dwell on popular pag=\r\nes and never visited the really really \ndetailed timeline (if one studies i=\r\nt the Shinsengumi narrative emerges).  \nHopefully by writing an e-book, vis=\r\nitors will be able to have everything in \nfront of them and will be able to=\r\n understand the Shinsengumi and their \nworld better.\n\nIt took all of us man=\r\ny years of growth, research and reflection on not \nonly the Shinsengumi but=\r\n Aizu-han as well to realize that our fansite can \nbe a helpful starting po=\r\nint for people who have just discovered the \nfascinating/notorious/controve=\r\nrsial Shinsengumi.\n\nThe site will move to a new server and will continue to=\r\n host fanwork, \nart, vids, stories etc.\n\nThis summer, 2008, a first draft o=\r\nf the book will be completed and \nundergo an editing process.\n\nWe would als=\r\no like to throw a &quot;re-opening&quot; party if possible and look \nforward to recon=\r\nnecting with everyone.\n\n~secretarytocapt3\n\n\n"
