LOL!!!\n\nI really enjoyed how this document is evi=\r\ndence of Shinsengumi using guns.\n\n[1864] The Shinsengumi March showing rifl=\r\nes and cannons\n\n[1865] (reference point) The Choshu Kiheitai and their mode=\r\nrn weapons\narticle will mention Kido Takayoshi, Tosa and Thomas Glover\nhttp=\r\n://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/earns/meiji.html\n\n[1867]  &quot;...several  Shins=\r\nengumi absconded from Kyoto because of their\nresentment at \norders to adopt=\r\n firearms. Three days later a serious confrontation\noccurred in the city \nb=\r\netween about two hundred pike-carrying city patrols (Mimawari) and\nperhaps =\r\na battalion \nof infantry (hohei) armed with rifles. After several hours of =\r\ntension\nthe deployed forces were \nquieted and no serious damage was done...=\r\nThe Shinsengumi was one of\nthe most vigorously \nloyal patrol groups in Kyot=\r\no, and its men were fiercely proud of their\nfunction and capacity.&quot; \n(Totma=\r\nn 359)\n\n[1868.2] Hijikata obtains &quot;state-of-the-art breech-loading rifles&quot; =\r\nfor the\nShinsengumi. (Hillsborough Shinsengumi 143)\n\n[1868] E. Schnell (thi=\r\nnk of him as the Thomas Glover of the bakufu forces)\nhad sold weapons to Ai=\r\nzu and allies of that domain.  Aizu samurai were\nalready trained\nto use gun=\r\ns and canons earlier.  The Yamamoto family history clearly\nshows that pro-b=\r\nakufu\nforces were interested in this technology.  I think Hirotada Tokugawa=\r\n\nhad mentioned the Nagaoka rifle unit.\n\n[1868 end of summer early fall]  Sa=\r\nitou Hajime (now Yamaguchi Hajime)\nsaved Oshima Torao, \nduring his retreati=\r\nng, using small arms fire.\n\n[1868] ofcourse at Hakodate, under Hijikata Tos=\r\nhizo, the Shinsengumi\nalso used guns/cannons etc\n\nSo if you read a text tha=\r\nt says that samurai abhorred the use of guns,\nthink of these\nexamples.  Eve=\r\nry side which could afford guns used them.  Going much\nfarther back in time=\r\n,\nfeudal warfare in Japan, China and Southeast Asia has always\nincorporated=\r\n these tools.\n\n---------------------------------\nshinsengumihq.com was rece=\r\nntly hacked.
