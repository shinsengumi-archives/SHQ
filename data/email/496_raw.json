It would&#39;ve \nbeen \n&gt; so cool to see Shinpachi and Soujirou as main characters, but most \nof \n&gt; all I&#39;ll still have more RK Saitou goodness to read... Remember \nAoshi \n&gt; said Saitou was in Hokkaido... *cries* I wonder how Watsuki \nwould&#39;ve \n&gt; portrayed Shinpachi, his relationship with Saitou and all that \n&gt; goodness. \n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t believe he chose to deviate from writing historical \nmanga... \n&gt; I mean yeah it&#39;s been discussed before and many times that the his \n&gt; following mangas were not &quot;par&quot; with RK. Didn&#39;t he for once think \n&gt; that &quot;I will be the King of Historical Manga&quot;. Why oh why did he \n&gt; stopped...\n&gt; \n&gt; ~wounds\n&gt; \n\n\n"
