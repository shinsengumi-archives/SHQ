They did not patrol the entire capital.  Please see the map \nin our &#39;photos&#39; section provided by our member Masayoshi.  Simply, \nthey were kind of a task force however we do know for sure that one \nof the captains Saitou Hajime did capture a burglar (this appears on \nhis timeline in a translation of the Japanese website http://www.3-\nhajime.com, which I&#39;m assuming was your run of the mill burglar and \nnot some anti-government guy.\nTo me it would make sense that if they ran across \nanything &quot;suspicious&quot; they would respond just because anti-\ngovernment activity can take many forms.  If they see some guys \nsnooping around at night they would have to stop them for \nquestioning at the very least. So they would run across a variety of \nbad guys...\n\nTiffany/secretarytocapt3\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nana_41175&quot; &lt;nana_41175@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello!\n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering if anybody knows the extent of the responibilities \nof \n&gt; the Shinsengumi in policing Kyoto from 1864-1865? Were they also \n&gt; tasked to handle crimes that seemingly do not concern or threaten \nthe \n&gt; Shogunate? \n\n\n"
