Apparently *would have* adopted Okita as his successor, \nthough this never happened and I&#39;m not even sure about the truth of that \nstatement.\n\nHijikata Toshizo-- originally from the same region as Kondo (Ishida village, \nin Tama)\n\nOkita Souji-- brother in law Rintaro (adopted into Okita house) was \noriginally from the Inoue family-- same Inoue as the 2 brothers \nGenzaburo/Matsugoro\n\nInoue Genzaburo-- Brother of Inoue Matsugoro (never in Shinsengumi, but \nrelated). Uncle of Inoue Taisuke (Kondou&#39;s page). Related to Inoue (Okita) \nRintaro.\n\nTani bros (Mantaro, Sanjuro, Shuuhei/Masatake)-- Taught yari (spear) to \nHarada Sanosuke. Masatake was adopted by Kondou Isami and became Kondou \nShuuhei.\n\n---\n\nThat&#39;s all I can think of at the moment. Just wanted to do a little bit of \nmy part for the time being over here. ^^\n\nAt any rate, as we can see, many of these people already knew each other or \nwere related to each other waaaaaay before the Kyoto years.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
