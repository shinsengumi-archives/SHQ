The poor guy.. he deserved it anyway.\n\n \n\nThere were also some notes on the page asking readers to consider of Hijikata was being too mean (?) and if the laws of the Shinsengumi \nwere just (?).\n\nTells about his story then suddenly questions his principles and motives? Anou... ^^;; that&#39;s odd. He was harsh, but for good reason. He was only trying to instill discipline amongst his comrades using the principles that their own people have made. Those were dangerous times, the country was on the brink of collapse. Sometimes leniency will only breed more trouble than what they already have in their hands. There may have been a few bad apples, but I think Hijikata-san only did what he did because he didn&#39;t want any more worms.\n \n \nWell, that&#39;s just my two cents ^^\n\n\n\n \n \nK.\n \n------------\n \n&quot;Sashimukau kokoro wa kiyoki mizukagami.&quot; ~ Hijikata Toshizou\n(The heart facing mine is a clear reflecting pool.)\n \n&quot;Ugokaneba yami ni hedatsu ya hana to mizu.&quot; ~ Okita Souji\n(If they don&#39;t move, they&#39;ll be separated by darkness: the flower and the water..)\n\n \n \n \nKaneyoshi\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/~kaneyoshi\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
