They are \napproximately $9 each I&#39;m not sure what the economy shipping is but the \n2-5 day express shipping is approximately $30\n\nStop gasping in shock. I know Masayoshi got the first book in NYC \nsometime ago and I think he said it was $20 so the cost kind of evens \nout in the end.\n\nHere&#39;s some info on ordering courtesy of Tama:\n\nVol.1\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/414923339X/qid=1090143316/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/250-3197124-5159453\n\nVol.2\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4149233403/qid=1090143316/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/250-3197124-5159453\n\nIf you have already an account on amazon.com it&#39;s available to all \namazon of the world,and the purchase step is same. About the language \nproblem, this site would be useful.\nhttp://imaginatorium.org/books/aj.htm\n\nFYI--the imaginatorium person does not clue you in  to the set up new \naccount box that reads &quot;Furigana&quot; apparently it means E-mail address \nbecause it worked once I put that in since it seemed to match what was \nasked for on the US site.\n-- \n\nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
