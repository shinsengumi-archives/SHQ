This is based on the \n&gt; idea that if the any members of Mimawarigumi and Shinsengumi were \n&gt; involved then it wouldn&#39;t have been a secret and just official police \n&gt; business. There wouldn&#39;t be a reason to cover it up or be secret \n&gt; about it. I just thought I would mention this...take it for whatever \n&gt; it is worth...\n&gt; \n&gt; This is taken from Mitsuo Kure&#39;s Samurai book:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Who was responsible for the killing of Ryoma? Under the Kyoto\n&gt; shugo there were two police organizations, the Shinsengumi and \n&gt; Mimawarigumi. When Matsudaira Katamori, the lord of Aizu, was \n&gt; appointed as shugo his soldiers were based at the Komyoji Temple. The \n&gt; Mimawarigumi stayed at a branch temple of the Komyoji and executed \n&gt; their duties around the temples of the city. Ryoma was regarded as a \n&gt; criminal because he had killed one of the police raiders with his \n&gt; revolver during the attack on him at the Teradaya inn; so it would \n&gt; not be strange if he was a police target. According to the memoir of \n&gt; Teshirogi Suguemon, an inspector of the Shinsengumi who served under \n&gt; Matsudaira Katamori, it was Katamori who ordered Ryoma&#39;s \n&gt; assassination, and Suguemon is a credible source. But if Ryoma was a \n&gt; criminal why did the Mimawarigumi resort to assassination? Legitimate \n&gt; police activity did not have to be kept secret. \n&gt; \n&gt;  If it was not a simple matter of police revenge, then who profited \n&gt; most from Ryoma&#39;s death? The answer must be that the men who\n&gt; wanted to unleash military violence against the bakufu broke from the \n&gt; spell of the most influential voice speaking against the civil\n&gt; war.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (Samurai: An Illustrated History, Kure, p. 139)\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n\n\n"
