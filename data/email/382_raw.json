I was \nmerely speculating if he was related then why not the other group. \n\nAs for his father being a ronin, it was also a rumor (I really should \nstop doing this). I read somewhere that Saitou&#39;s origins were obscure \nand there are several theories like he was a son of a ronin, or son \nof a bakufu official or son of the 12th shogun (highly doubt). I \ndon&#39;t really know which is true. Do you know what is definite? Thanks.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;spiritus_saitou&quot; &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;If he was related to Mr. Sasaki, wouldn&#39;t it have been easy? Or \nwas \n&gt; it because his father was a Ronin that it would be preposterous for \n&gt; him to join the other patrol group who were composed of &quot;higher \n&gt; blood/lineage/ etc&quot;. &gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wait... I&#39;m confused.  Do we know that Saitou was related to \nSasaki?  \n&gt; I thought it was still a &quot;rumor&quot; he was related to &quot;someone&quot; within \n&gt; the Mimawarigumi...\n&gt; \n&gt; And where does the info that Saitou&#39;s father was a ronin come \nfrom???\n&gt; \n&gt; phil (feeling out of touch with things...)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; You saw this on a livejournal?  I saw it on a Japanese \nmessageboard\n&gt; &gt; (it is very painful trying to find the page I saw this using \n&gt; babelfish\n&gt; &gt; for yahoo.co.jp)...He may have just stayed on with the Shinsengumi\n&gt; &gt; because he is &#39;secure&#39; he knows his men, he has some respect, he \nis\n&gt; &gt; trusted by the management etc...if he went to the Mimawarigumi \nthen\n&gt; &gt; sure he knew the management but these police/para-military groups\n&gt; &gt; function as a team somewhat and you need to have the &quot;respect&quot; of \n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; team---people were watching each other&#39;s back when they did\n&gt; &gt; raids/patrols etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;I did come across another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting rumor from a livejournal somewhere (can&#39;t remember \n&gt; right \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now)... Saitou seems to be related by blood to Mr. Sasaki? I \n&gt; know.. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; know... All I ever bring to the tables are rumors, just like \nthat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other woman of Saitou-sama... But really? This just sparked my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interest because, Saitou joined the Shinsengumi why did he not \n&gt; join \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Mimawarigumi? &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way... You can find more photos on the shinsengumi and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sasaki&#39;s grave at this site...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.fc.a-vst.jp/location_library/shinsengumi/sasaki.html\n\n\n"
