No idea where this\n&gt; is, but it&#39;s probably the picture that was in the lower area of the\n&gt; photo of the display with his haori in it).\n\n***Masayoshi is referring to this pic here...we&#39;re assuming this is\nthe pic in question\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/SH5.jpg\nzoomed....http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/SH5zoomjpg.jpg\n\n&gt; \t--The character of &quot;Saitou&quot; in the manga &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is\n&gt; tremendously different from the real Saitou Hajime. \n\n***see if people feel this way then they should explain ^_^  I would\nlike to know the differences too (yes but I&#39;ll always be an RK Saitou fan)\n\n&gt; \t--He went with Itou&#39;s splinter group as a spy for Kondou and\n&gt; Hijikata, although there is no evidence to this end (comment: huh?). A\n&gt; surviving aide of Itou said &quot;Saitou himself stole money in order to\n&gt; support a woman.&quot; He believed this even after the Restoraton.\n\n***you know I read somewhere on a Japanese site (not\n3-hajime/1to5.net) that he &quot;acting like a husband&quot; to a woman or some\nweird babelfish phrase...perhaps this is what Toshizo.com is referring\nto...\n\n&gt; \t--Whenever he sat, he would sit straight up in seiza position,\nalways keeping aware, so that if attacked he could react instantly.\n\n***yeah, but some people sit seiza with their big toes\ncrossed...sitting seiza allows you to kind of hop up fast to defend\nyourself versus getting up from sitting in a cross-legged\nposition...geez he was like this even amongst friends/family (old\nhabits are hard to break I guess)\n\n--While Saitou was in Aomori (comment: specifically, in the Shimokita\n&gt; Peninsula), before having married Tokio, he married a woman named\n&gt; Yaso, who was 4 years older than him.\n\n***nothing about the &quot;unpleasant&quot; stuff huh?\n\n&gt; \t--At the Battle of Aizu, Yamamoto Yaeko (sister of Yamamoto\nKakuma,and later, the wife of Niishima Jo (famous Japanese Christian\nand founder of Doshisha University)) left with Saitou for the front.\nYaeko used a rifle, and outdid everyone in &quot;masculine braveness&quot; (?),\n&gt; fighting side by side with the men. She tried cutting off her hair\n&gt; with her wakizashi (short sword), but (comment: a little weird after\n&gt; this. Not quite sure what&#39;s going on) it is said that &quot;Takagi\n&gt; Morinosuke&#39;s elder sister Tokio cut her (Yaeko&#39;s) hair&quot;.\n\n***can you clarify this point Yamamoto Yaeko was the wife of Niishima\nJo?  So she survived the battles ^_^...interesting...Fujita Goro could\n on his rare occasions speak about the battles at Aizu to Tokio and\nmention Yamamoto Yaeko and I imagine Tokio saying &quot;wait...I know her I\ncut her hair that day!&quot; M. I think you just unleashed a new wave of\nfanfiction\n\n\n\n"
