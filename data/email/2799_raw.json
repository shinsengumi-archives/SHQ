The name \nof the inn IS actually listed in the anime (Eventhough I coul=\r\nd not read that, I could read \n&quot;Ikedaya.&quot;) Also, Kenshin does NOT have the =\r\ncomplete cross-shape scar till Dec (lunar \ncalendar), 1864. In addition, on=\r\ne could also get several clues from the conversation at the \ninn.\n\nThe Iked=\r\naya Affair took place in June (lunar calendar) 1864. However, the Shinsengu=\r\nmi \ndidn&#39;t have 10 units until 1865 (Saito wasn&#39;t the captain of the 3rd sq=\r\nuad and Okita wasn&#39;t \nthe captain of the 1st squad till then.) \n\nFrom DVD V=\r\nol 7: \n&quot;Apparently, goverment army members are pouring into Kyoto mainly fr=\r\nom Satsuma and \nChoshin.&quot;\n\nArmy members from Satsuma went to Kyoto in Octob=\r\ner (lunar calendar) 1865 and in \nNovember (lunar calendar) 1867. They weren=\r\n&#39;t around Kyoto in June (lunar \ncaleander) 1864. (The Satsuma army was arou=\r\nnd a month after the Ikedaya Affair though.) \n\nI&#39;ve been wondering whether =\r\n&quot;Choshin&quot; could be &quot;Chushu&quot; (or could include Chushu). If so, \nthen we all =\r\nknow that the alliance between Satsuma and Choshu was formed in January \n(l=\r\nunar calendar) 1866. \n\nIn addition, there would be no camellia around in Ju=\r\nne (lunar calendar.)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
