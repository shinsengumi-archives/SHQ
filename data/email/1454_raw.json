So \n&gt; the school had a dormitory for students but in the translation it is \n&gt; mentioned that students can stay at her home too or just to visit \n&gt; her home?  \n&gt; \n&gt; It means that Tokio let some students live at her house.  I don&#39;t \n&gt; know the system of dorm at that time, but I think not everybody had \n&gt; to live in dorm.\n&gt; \n&gt; [secretarytocapt3 thinks]  Poor inspector Fujita, after a long hard \n&gt; day at work catching criminal scum, writing reports he had to come \n&gt; home to a house full of....girls LOL!\n\n\n"
