The world is a very big place and poll options limited, so there are two polls: one for the Americas/Asia/Australia and the other for Africa and Europe.  If your specific country isn&#39;t listed, please don&#39;t feel slighted.  No offense was intended.  Also, no infomation is collected or recorded in regards to answers, and all features of the SHQ Yahoogroups site are available *only* to members, so no one will be able to determine where you&#39;re coming from.\n \nThe polls are set to be open indefinitely so that new members can contribute and I encourage everyone to check back periodically to see results.  They can be accessed at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq .\n \nI hope you&#39;ll take a minute or two and help us learn a little more about our community!\n \nphil\n(Co-moderator)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
