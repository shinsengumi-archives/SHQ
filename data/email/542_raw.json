Well the board must be counting the times it is viewed... I \nmean I usually spend quite a lot of time on the board... Re-reading \npost, answering post (albeit not too intelligently), etc... The \n30min to 1hr will go by with only 1 or 2 guest at most, oh sometimes \nno guest so... It&#39;s improbable that we have THAT much traffic (don&#39;t \nkill me). Plus I visit the board on average 2-3 times per day so we \nonly have 12 members and suppose we all visit 4 times a day... Well \nstill far for the 7K...\n\nEither way, just want to say thank you to the five of you for \nputting the board up. I like it and I really think it&#39;s much better \nthan the yahoo mailing list (albeit no chat, database, files).\nOh... I&#39;m talking about the MBs navigation and ease of reading here, \nnot the content. Although the content is not bad at all on the \nmessage board.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Either we are each logging on dozens of times a day or we have many\n&gt; people who stop by our board and aren&#39;t biting the hook (even with \nthe\n&gt; historical looking banner as bait for possible academics).  As a \nboard\n&gt; admin.  there is no way for me to determine if it is members or if \nthe\n&gt; board is just counting &quot;views&quot;.  At the bottom of the page it says\n&gt; Total Visits: 7968?\n&gt; \n&gt; I did designate mods/admin way back but for some reason the names\n&gt; aren&#39;t listed in the columns.  Presently I have the time to patrol \nthe\n&gt; board but just so you all know:\n&gt; Barbara=Moderator\n&gt; Shimazuryu=Admin\n&gt; Spiritus_Saitou=Moderator\n&gt; May they be just in wielding their powers.\n&gt; \n&gt; I posted a link to our board at http://www.hino-shinsengumi.com \nwhich\n&gt; seems to be one of -the- most active Shinsengumi branches in Japan.\n&gt; 3-hajime.com which has very friendly gals and they know we exist\n&gt; (babelfish their comments)\n&gt; and a couple of other sites I can&#39;t recall.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the GREAT fish allows I&#39;ll try to post on the official Fu-un\n&gt; Shinsengumi site -if- I can figure out if they allow for \nadvertising.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know from meeting with international students before that a \nmajority\n&gt; of younger Japanese have pretty darn good English comprehension\n&gt; skills.  Many have studied English since elementary school 0_o and \ncan\n&gt; read/write basic English so that is the rational behind my \nobjectives\n&gt;  we need to reach out across to the Pacific to our brothers and \nsistas\n&gt; who are -even- more serious about their Shinsengumi than we are:) \nWe\n&gt; also would like Japanese agents to give us a heads up on anything\n&gt; Shinsengumi related in the media/manga etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; We need Pro-Ishin ShiShi folks....it&#39;s just not the same without\n&gt; opponents...just feel so obsolete.  Remember, as an anime fan I \nhave\n&gt; no problem with more RK, PMK fans but we have to try to lure in \nother\n&gt; folks too so we can -use- them errr learn from them to enrich\n&gt; fanfiction I mean contribute to our understanding of the\n&gt; history/politics of the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone knows about an upcoming convention with Shinsengumi\n&gt; cosplaying team or something just invite them to join.  Or if \nanyone\n&gt; knows someone on the &quot;inside&quot; of a convention which can get us some\n&gt; free advertising lemme know too.  I think we did more than enough \nto\n&gt; &quot;season&quot; the board with amazing threads and I bow deeply to \neveryone\n&gt; who has taken the time to post...I just have the fate of\n&gt; www.Saitou-hajime.com in the back of my mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n&gt; www.shinsengumimb.com \n&gt; Temple to the Omnipotent All Knowing Goldfish\n\n\n"
