So I&#39;m pretty ticked off you \nbooks don&#39;t even mention this ^_^\n\nI guess my library books are detailed...it even lists field \ncommanders almost all of them were specifically under TMPD.  Since \nTMPD&#39;s training was more intense and the officers were more \nexperienced from previous wars they were use all over the place in \nthe Seinan wars. An estimated 6,000 police officers.  Each book will \nhave a different &quot;break down&quot; of the numbers.\n\nToday&#39;s &quot;Menu During a Seige&quot; as we wait for other police troops to \nshow up...\nmillet gruel\nvegetable gruel which looks like bird droppings\nhorsemeat (lets hope one of our steeds get shot today)\nsoup made from crushed horse bone\nyummy\n\ncan&#39;t stand the menu?  Then its time to open the gates and find \nhelp...\n\nI&#39;m not going to give away spoilers to my write up...but when they \nsay &quot;intense fighting&quot; they mean it...some of the tactics were \ndownright scary...police battalions were quiet small and designed \nthat way for fast maneuvers...the rest of the peasant conscripts \n(basically anyone who was not a police officer) served almost back \nup purposes unless there was a major confrontation.  Note, the \nvarious texts I&#39;ve read will constantly mention Satsuma as taunting \nthe Imperial Forces as &quot;peasants&quot; etc again a class distinction was \nvery evident and I thought Satsuma wanted to end feudalism hmm....\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n\n&gt; Acutally, neither the very recent Mark Ravina book or the other \nSamurai book I have (which has a chapter about the SW War right \nafter the chapter on Aizu) make much mention of them at all. I did \nsee &quot;police troops&quot; mentioned once, so I tend to think they just \nlump them all together as &quot;government forces&quot; with no distinction of \nwhat part of the government they were working for. The main focus is \nSaigo and his rebels. \n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin\n\n\n"
