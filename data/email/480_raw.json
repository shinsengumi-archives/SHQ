I didn&#39;t translate the =\r\n\nfirst half of it, as the focus was more on Watsuki&#39;s work as an \nassistant=\r\n during his teenage years. The second half is what really \nmatters.\n\nIt&#39;s t=\r\nrue that it&#39;s sad, for Shinsengumi fans, that some ideas \nexpressed here ne=\r\nver were concretise, but=85 reading some of Watsuki&#39;s \nanswers, I wonder if=\r\n finally, it&#39;s not a good thing. \n\nWell, I let you be judge. The notes at t=\r\nhe bottom are the ones of the \nFrench version, so &quot;he is now about to do it=\r\n&quot; refers to last summer.\n\nMary-Ann\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n&quot;I want to dr=\r\naw a hero who evolves along with the series&quot;\n\nQ- To sum up, Rurouni Kenshin=\r\n was your first manga, and at first, you \noften said that you preferred Sho=\r\njo, but during the Kyoto Arc, you \ndiscovered how interesting drawing Shone=\r\nn was. Which kind of manga \nwill you choose to draw next?\n\nW- I will repeat=\r\n myself, but since I discovered the joys of drawing \nShonen, I just want to=\r\n draw more. As Kenshin was the kind of \ncharacter who is strong from the st=\r\nart, in my next manga, I want to \npicture a hero who will become stronger a=\r\nnd wiser as the time goes \nby. For that, he will have, of course, to win ba=\r\nttles, but it will be \nclose calls.\n\n&quot;And now that Rurouni Kenshin is over=\r\n=85?&quot;\n\nQ- Does that mean that the hero of your next manga will be a young \n=\r\nboy?\n\nW- Everything is not decided yet, but yes it will be a young boy of \n=\r\nabout thirteen or fourteen years old. I will also create another type \nof c=\r\nharacter, which I couldn&#39;t picture in Rurouni Kenshin: the strong \nand powe=\r\nrful heroine.\n\nQ- Doesn&#39;t Kaoru and Misao belong in that category?\n\nW- More=\r\n or less. I would want to picture someone even stronger, at an \nequal stand=\r\n with the hero=85 I would also like to create dumb \ncharacters, as Banjin o=\r\nr Cho, who are pleasures to draw. This time, I \nwould want to have them as =\r\nmain characters. (laughs) In Rurouni \nKenshin, the characters were a little=\r\n too deep, they had internal \nconflicts, a side of their personality they w=\r\nere hiding and that they \ndidn&#39;t want to show to others, etc. This time, I =\r\nwould prefer \ncharacters who are easy to understand and who, without all of=\r\n those \ncomplex character traits, would be better. (laughs).\n\nQ- In which e=\r\nra would this story take place? In modern days?\n\nW- Yes, I&#39;ll stop drawing =\r\nhistorical mangas for now. If one day, I \nwant to draw historical mangas ag=\r\nain, I will do it, but until then, I \nonly wish to draw stories that happen=\r\n in today&#39;s world.\n\nQ- You already draw one, &quot;Meteor Strike&quot;, no?\n\nW- Yes. =\r\nThere&#39;s that one. (laughs). When I drew it, I was taking two \nweeks off Rur=\r\nouni Kenshin and the planning was really tight. There \nare many things in t=\r\nhat manga that I would have like to change, and \nwhen I read it back, I can=\r\n see that it was a very moronic story, but \nit&#39;s not that bad. (laughs). At=\r\n least, they didn&#39;t let me write a \nstory where Kenshin was hit by a meteor=\r\n. (laughs).\n\nQ- The episode shown at the end of the Kenshin Kaden vol. 2, i=\r\ns \nofficially ending the series, but do you have any regrets, or \nsomething=\r\n you would have want to draw, but couldn&#39;t?\n\nW- In fact, whoever reads the =\r\nend of the Kyoto Arc understands that \nSoujiro leaves for Hokkaido. At the =\r\ntime, I wanted to draw another \narc later on, located in that area, and whe=\r\nre Soujiro would have been \non the Kenshingumi&#39;s side.\n\nQ- Are you talking =\r\nabout the Hokkaido Arc that so many people wanted \nto read? [1]\n\nW- Yes. I =\r\nalso wanted to introduce a new character during that arc: \nShinpachi Nagaku=\r\nra, the Shinsengumi second division&#39;s captain, in \naccordance with the poss=\r\nibilities. But I thought about it a lot, and \nI preferred ending the series=\r\n with the Revenge Arc, so the Hokkaido \nArc never saw the day.\n\nQ- Was the =\r\nHokkaido Arc a darker or a more hopeful arc?\n\nW- It was a happier arc. I ha=\r\nd envisioned it as a kind of Western. \nThe government&#39;s army would have bee=\r\nn the cavalry, Hokkaido&#39;s new \ninhabitants and the samourai-peasents [2] wo=\r\nuld have been the \nsettlers, people without a precise goal and who would ha=\r\nve wander \nuntil then would have been the outlaws and, finally, the natives=\r\n \nwould have been the Indians=85 And the Kenshingumi would arrive in the \nm=\r\niddle of all of that.\n\nQ- It seems to be very different from what we saw so=\r\n far in the rest \nof the manga, no?\n\nW- Well=85 we can&#39;t always draw the sa=\r\nme kind of things. (laughs). \nAlso, with the end of the Revenge Arc, the ma=\r\nin theme of Rurouni \nKenshin had come to an end: what marked Kenshin&#39;s char=\r\nacter the most, \nhis culpability, his search for an answer, for a way of ex=\r\nplaining \nthe crimes he committed. That&#39;s why the following arc should have=\r\n \nbeen completely different, if not, it wouldn&#39;t have made sense. \nThat&#39;s w=\r\nhy I had imagined a sort of western. (laughs). It would be \nvery funny to s=\r\nurprise the readers with a wagon full of American&#39;s \nsettlers appearing rig=\r\nht in the middle of all of that. (laughs).\n\nQ- Aside from Soujiro, which ot=\r\nher characters did you wanted to re-\nuse for this Arc?\n\nW- I would have lik=\r\ne to re-use Fuji. It could have been interesting \nto make him intervene pre=\r\ncisely when Kenshin was in danger. I thought \nthat Fuji looked very cool wh=\r\nen he was digging the fields in \nHokkaido. Anji is also imprisoned in Hokka=\r\nido, so I would have made \nhim reappear. As he is the only character who ha=\r\nven&#39;t been \nspiritually &quot;salved&quot;, it bothered me, and I finally wanted to o=\r\nffer \nhim a second chance in life.\n\nQ- You already had a clear idea of the =\r\nplot, don&#39;t you think that \nmany readers would want to read that arc now th=\r\nat you&#39;re telling us \nmore about it?\n\nW- Hum=85 Yes, but no. I prefer using=\r\n the ideas I got for that arc in \nmy next manga.\n\nQ- Really. (laughs). Then=\r\n, let me ask you when are you going to start \nworking on that new manga? [3=\r\n]\n\nW- I&#39;m only working on the main lines of the plot right now, so I \nreall=\r\ny don&#39;t know. I wish to start really working on it by the middle \nof next y=\r\near.\n\nQ- Will it be very different, in style and spirit, from Rurouni \nKens=\r\nhin?\n\nW- Yes, I would like to create an as interesting story, but from a \nd=\r\nifferent perspective. That said, I&#39;m still the same author, hence I \nthink =\r\nthat the basis of both stories will be very similar. Of course, \nI will use=\r\n what I learned from Rurouni Kenshin.\n\nQ- Rurouni Kenshin being your first =\r\nseries, you must have learn a lot?\n\nW- Enormously. There were some passages=\r\n where I lost focus and there \nare a lot of hiccups, but aside of that, it&#39;=\r\ns true that I learned a \nlot while working on that manga. It brought me a l=\r\not, I think.\n\nQ- Which was the most important thing to you during those fiv=\r\ne years?\n\nW- My readers&#39; support. Drawing manga is my job, yes, but being a=\r\nble \nto draw what I really want, and to realise that the public loves it, \n=\r\nis very satisfying. Every time a reader told me that he liked this or \nthat=\r\n in my manga, it gave me a boost of energy. The readers are \neverything to =\r\nan author.\n\nQ- Do you have something to say to the readers who have follow =\r\nyour \nwork until now?\n\nW- Thanks, thanks to all, thanks a lot. That&#39;s mostl=\r\ny what I want to \nsay. If they also want to read my next manga, I will be v=\r\nery happy. I \nwill do my best, so see you!\n\nQ- I would like to thank you fo=\r\nr the time you took for this very long \ninterview.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n[1] : There ha=\r\nd been a short report in Shonen Jump about the Hokkaido \nArc, which finally=\r\n never saw the day, as the series ended with the \nRevenge Arc. Many Shineng=\r\numi fans were disappointed by this decision, \nalong with Soujiro fans.\n\n[2]=\r\n : Due to financial problems, those samurai were peasants, but in \ntimes of=\r\n conflicts, they were ready to take up arms in case the \nborder had to be d=\r\nefended against Russia.\n\n[3] : The Kenshin Kaden vol. 2 has been published =\r\nat the end of 1999 \nin Japan, so this interview also took place by the end =\r\nof that year. \nThe manga which they are talking about hence is &quot;Gun Blaze W=\r\nest&quot;, \nwhich has been published in Shonen Jump but suddenly stopped after \n=\r\nonly three volumes. Since then, Watsuki hasn&#39;t draw anything, but he \nis no=\r\nw about to do it.\n\n\n\n\n"
