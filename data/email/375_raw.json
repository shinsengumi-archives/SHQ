Samurai detained in various camps were even allowed\nto leave the camp to but medicine for example as long as they were\n&quot;good&quot;/trustworthy and according to the book many samurai had too much\npride to just run away (perhaps part of the &quot;rules&quot; of engagement if\nthere any really)\n\n*Tonan=Tonami Shimokita, the translator explained...thus he was\ndetained here and then moved\n\n*I really wanted to ask her more but she seemed busy and I didn&#39;t want\nto annoy her that is all the info I could get :)\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I guess I don&#39;t really understand... So Saitou was accomodated at \n&gt; Tera-machi, under a different name... Oh how many names can there \n&gt; be? :O)What does this best behavior meant?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@s...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Temple Sooji-ji where Hajime Saitoo (Denpachi Ichinose) was on his\n&gt; &gt; best behavior&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (Address: 1-7-22 Tera-machi, Jooetsu-shi, Niigata-pre)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can see Sooji-temple opposite to the city assembly hall at 1-7-\n&gt; 22\n&gt; &gt; Teramachi if you get off at Takada station on the main line between\n&gt; &gt; Nagano and Niigata, take a way toward south, and turn to right at a \n&gt; T\n&gt; &gt; corner.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After Boshin-war , samurais of the old Aizu  Clan who fought against\n&gt; &gt; Meiji government outside of Aizu-wakamatsu castle were on their best\n&gt; &gt; behaviors at Tera-machi of Takada.  According to (1)Takada Omote\n&gt; &gt; On-azukari Hitobito Betsu in (2) Takada Kinshinchuu Zakki that lists\n&gt; &gt; people who were put them on their best behaviors, Hajime Saitoo is\n&gt; &gt; recorded as Denpachi Ichinose among Suzaku  menbers who were\n&gt; &gt; accommodated in Temple Sooji-ji.   According to (3) Aihan Hokuetsu\n&gt; &gt; Takada Kinshinnin Mei, (4) Echigo Takada Tsume Myoosai Yuujin Choo,\n&gt; &gt; and (5) Aizu-han Takada Yuushuu Meibo, while he was on his best\n&gt; &gt; behaviors, he is recorded as his false name, Denpachi Ichinose \n&gt; again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is confirmed by the list that puts the names of people who\n&gt; &gt; immigrated to Tonan in 1869, that Hajime Saitoo used the name, Goroo\n&gt; &gt; Fujita when he moved to Tonan.  He moved to Goko after he changed \n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; name from Denpachi Ichinose to Goroo Fujita, and became a Tonan \n&gt; citizen.\n\n\n"
