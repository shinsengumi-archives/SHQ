It seems that, till 1948,\n&gt;the Hijikata family still made that medicine. My only\n&gt;doubt is the name of the herb: I thought it was\n&gt;&quot;gyukawa-so&quot;, but in the article says &quot;mizosoba&quot;. I\n&gt;wonder if they are the same thing...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Serizawa Kamo\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve actually been trying to learn more about Ishida Sanyaku and I&#39;ve come across the same thing. I&#39;m pretty sure that they are one and the same now. There was a site set up by a museum in Kyoto that was in English (no longer available) that also gave the name as &quot;Mizosoba&quot; or &quot;Persicaria thunbergii&quot;. A close up picture of the leaf looks exactly like the ones I&#39;ve seen on some sites that translate the other name as &quot;cowhide grass&quot;. I also did a search on Yahoo for &quot;mizosoba&quot; and found some pics of the flowers. It&#39;s a beautiful plant when it blooms!\n\nMore interestingly, someone recently conducted an experiment to evaluate the powder&#39;s effectiveness. I couldn&#39;t tell what the outcome of the experiment was though. The site is in Japanese of course and sadly the translation software is only capable of so much. Here&#39;s the site:\nhttp://www.tpa-kitatama.jp/shinsengumi/shinsengumi_index.html\n\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
