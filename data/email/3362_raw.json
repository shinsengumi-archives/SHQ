Around 4 PM they saw Satsuma men rolling\ncannons into position=\r\n around Gokomiya, a shrine which had a good\ncommanding view of the other Ba=\r\nkufu forces&#39; encampment. It seemed that\nwar was about to start and could co=\r\nme suddenly, so [the Shinsengumi\nmen] prepared to be deployed at a moment&#39;s=\r\n notice. That night at\naround 7, the cannons at Gokomiya erupted. Every bui=\r\nlding in Fushimi\nbecame a target. The Magistrate&#39;s office also took about 1=\r\n0\nhits...vice-commander Hijikata, sensing that this was it, gathered the\nme=\r\nn in the courtyard and ordered an all-out offensive. First they\nbrought out=\r\n the cannon that was assigned to the magistrate&#39;s office,\nand then pointing=\r\n it at the Satsuma positions at Gokomiya, began to\nfire. The Satsuma forces=\r\n saw this and zeroed in, unleashing a\nwithering barrage of fire. After abou=\r\nt half an hour the cannonade\ncontinued, and so Nagakura&#39;s 2nd Unit was deta=\r\nched as an assault team\nand ordered to disrupt the enemy positions.\nNagakur=\r\na and his sergeants Shimada Kai and Ito Tetsugoro led the men\nover the eart=\r\nhen wall and charged the Satsuma camp. Swinging their\nswords, Nagakura and =\r\nhis men bravely struck the enemy, Satsuma men\nunder Nozu Shigekatsu, who we=\r\nre forced to retreat. They gave chase for\nabout three cho, and then found t=\r\nhat the houses on both sides of the\nroad were aflame, and no advance was po=\r\nssible. Out of options,\nNagakura and his men withdrew to the earthen wall o=\r\nutside the\nmagistrate&#39;s office, intending to return inside. However, Nagaku=\r\nra&#39;s\narmor was heavy and he could not climb over the wall, so his sergeant\n=\r\nShimada Kai extended his rifle, and pulled it up over the wall with\nNagakur=\r\na hanging off. Those who saw were shocked at the extent of his\n[Shimada&#39;s] =\r\nstrength.&quot;\n\nNagakura, Shinsengumi Tenmatsu-ki, pages 158 to 159.\n\n---------=\r\n\n\nBeen awhile; hope you all are doing well.\n\nI find it interesting that Shi=\r\nnsengumi saw the cannons later used for\nthe surprise attack, being rolled i=\r\nnto place at Gokomiya. Some of us\nknow the story of Nagakura being pulled u=\r\np over a wall at\nToba-Fushimi; apparently this is it. For the longest time =\r\nI thought it\nwas a spear Shimada used, but apparently it was a rifle.\n\n\n"
