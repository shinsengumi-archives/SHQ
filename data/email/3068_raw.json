This year, the Lunar New Year =\r\nis also February 18 (which \nhappens once in 19 years.)\n\n~Seven\n\n\n--- In SHQ=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Kitsu=\r\nno, Seven and Hirotada Tokugawa, thanks for reviving the \n&gt; list.\n&gt; Happy N=\r\new Year everyone and...Happy B-day Saitou\n&gt; Saitou &quot;yeah sure whatever&quot;\n&gt; T=\r\nokio &quot;some people are grumpy the whole darn year...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I just wanted to =\r\ncomment that indeed many social classes were greatly \n&gt; blurred in 19th cen=\r\ntury Japan.  Although on one hand it seemed to be a \n&gt; mark of distinction =\r\nto obtain the samurai status, economically speaking \n&gt; many people, includi=\r\nng the samurai themselves, knew that the money can \n&gt; be found in the purpo=\r\nrtedly &quot;lower&quot; classes.  For example during the \n&gt; Meiji era a survey of fa=\r\nmilies who sent their daughters to a public \n&gt; school---across the board cl=\r\naimed samurai descent, but many *before \n&gt; 1868 had engaged in clearly merc=\r\nhant class businesses (this flies \n&gt; against the widespread abhorrance of s=\r\namurai to engage in such work).  \n&gt; By far the most econommically dynamic c=\r\nlasses were the upper peasant \n&gt; and merchant classes.  What killed the sam=\r\nurai class was their obsolete \n&gt; role and drain on the economy---samurai no=\r\n longer and never did \n&gt; produced &quot;anything&quot; unlike the lower classes, alth=\r\nough as we now they \n&gt; fulfilled critical administrative roles.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have=\r\nn&#39;t finished this page yet but when I&#39;m done I&#39;ll upload it to \n&gt; shinsengu=\r\nmihq.com:\n&gt; \n&gt; Before Boshin 1868: A Survey of the Feudal System\n&gt; http://1=\r\nhappyturtle.com/Hosting/BakumatsuBackground.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s really important =\r\nto note this article\n&gt; The Farmers of Edo and the Warriors in Kyoto \n&gt; http=\r\n://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Because the Shinsengumi, for=\r\n the first time are mentioned in a non-\n&gt; warrior context, were right smack=\r\n in the middle of the social pyramid \n&gt; blur---they were close friends/asso=\r\nciates/adopted siblings to ELITE \n&gt; PEASANTS, WELL EDUCATED PEASANTS.  Thus=\r\n people like Kondou and Hijikata \n&gt; had a deep understanding of what was go=\r\ning on because they valued these \n&gt; social relationships and clearly, in no=\r\n way abandoned their associates \n&gt; after attaining that feudal &quot;dream&quot; of s=\r\namuraihood so to speak.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did pose the question to Mr. Hillsborough of=\r\n whether or not he would \n&gt; address what was going in Tama at the time and =\r\nif he would discuss in \n&gt; depth the social background of these figures.  Sp=\r\necifically, rural Edo \n&gt; where many members from the Shinsengumi call home =\r\nhas been studied by \n&gt; scholars specifically for all that social blurring. =\r\n During the Meiji \n&gt; Era that region produced incredibly politically active=\r\n farmers who \n&gt; pushed for *real democratic change and surprisingly opposed=\r\n some of the \n&gt; victors of 1868.  Hillsborough asked if I was a sociology m=\r\najor.  I&#39;m \n&gt; not---just a concerned and curious member of his audience, bu=\r\nt the \n&gt; point was ... it is absolutely important to get into the &quot;mindset&quot;=\r\n of \n&gt; Kondou and Hijikata.  Because they did see things differently, after=\r\n \n&gt; all, travelling from rural Edo to Kyoto was an eye opening \n&gt; experienc=\r\ne...trying to navigate the capital&#39;s bureaucracy must&#39;ve been \n&gt; rather dif=\r\nficult for a bunch of &quot;nobodies&quot;.  They were fish out of \n&gt; water and treat=\r\ned as such.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether or not their later success contributed to their &quot;t=\r\nheir \n&gt; conviction of self-importance and their unyielding will to power&quot; \n=\r\n&gt; (Hillsborough 147) and so forth is a possibility, but a slightly \n&gt; diffi=\r\ncult abstraction to gauge accurately by any historian.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then again, lus=\r\nt for power is a universal, human trait, not something \n&gt; the Shinsengumi m=\r\nonopolized.\n&gt; Hillsborough probably has not studied the aftermath of 1868 i=\r\nn great \n&gt; detail.  His heroes are the most shockingly ruthless men to hold=\r\n and \n&gt; maintain, political, social, military and educational power.\n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; As for t=\r\nhe social classes, it looks\n&gt; &gt; like they got pretty hazy near the end of t=\r\nhe Edo period. Thanks for\n&gt; &gt; the clarifications.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
