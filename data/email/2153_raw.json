Apparently there was a book or a series of some sort \n&gt; about Hijikata when he was growing up in Ishida (about 15 years \nold) \n&gt; called &quot;Baragaki&quot;. He was supposed to be a real brat in it. It must \n&gt; have not gone over so well. Anyway, I finally found some reference \nto \n&gt; the thing here:\n&gt; http://rau.milkcafe.to/makoto/itadaki/book/baragaki.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, it seems there must be (or there was) some sort of \nShinsengumi \n&gt; card game out there:\n&gt; http://rau.milkcafe.to/makoto/itadaki/card.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; This site had some pretty good fanart. Some of it was Takasugi and \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure who the other guys were. The Hijikata pictures (# 3, \n4, \n&gt; and 7) were very well done. I think 3 edges the other two out a bit \n&gt; though just from an emotional standpoint. Here&#39;s the url:\n&gt; http://bankara.hp.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatsu.gel.html\n&gt; \n&gt; And finally I came across reference to something called Hijikata \n&gt; Toshizo: Shiru no Kiseki. Is this an anime or what?! One pic is \n&gt; definitely Hijikata in Hakodate. There&#39;s no mistaking him:\n&gt; http://www.catsuka.com/interf/forum/viewtopic.php?t=691&start=72\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately it is not in English or Japanese.\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
