Anyways I keep telling her/him to \njoin.\n\n****so if we pose questions regarding translations and what not on \nshinsengumimb.com try to be clear because momoiro keeps saying that \nhe/she is happy to help...the problem is momoiro has NO IDEA what \nshe&#39;s getting into....\n\nI don&#39;t have time to edit and some stuff we know but momoiro&#39;s \nopinions are pretty neat.\n---------------------------------------------\n[I mentioned Sagara, Phil]\n\nIn Japan, although Saigou, Okubo, and Katsura are famous, almost all \nmen do not know Sagara. \nOf course, RK made him famous partly. However, for most Japanese, he \nis obscurity.\nI got to know him with the book which I read by chance at the time \nof a high school student. \nI thought that it was a very merciless talk. \n \nIn Japan, the style of a text has changed to Meiji Era considerably. \nFurthermore, the text style has changed also after WW2. \nJapanese people cannot read the text of the Edo period in many \ncases, either. Please do your best, although I think that there are \nmany Japanese sites which cannot be translated.\n \n[mentioned Romulus Hillsborough&#39;s previous work and future book on \nthe Shinsengumi]\nI read a part of the site. \nIs &quot;RYOMA-Life of a Renaissance Samurai&quot; a novel? \nIt seems to be interesting as long as I look at a reviews. \nIs it Shinsengumi which assassinated Ryoma with this book? The \nreview has said it. \nThe culprit who assassinated Ryoma is still unknown. \nSurely, there is an opinion which makes Shinsengumi a culprit. \nHowever, opinion that Sasaki Tadasaburou of Mimawarigumi \nassassinated is leading now. But this is testimony of the friend who \nwas Mimawarigumi, after Sasaki dies. This testimony has many opaque \nportions and Saigou Takamori is related. Therefore, there is an \nopinion of a true culprit in Saigou. The fact does not clarify \n\n[The Last Samurai]\nI was surprised very much by TLS. I think that many Japanese were \nsurprised. TLS was wonderful Jidaigeki although there were many \nmistakes and strange scenes. Can the present Japanese movie make the \nmovie which tells Bushido as wonderfully as TLS? \nIt cannot reply to me. &quot;Twilight Samurai&quot; was a long run in Japan. \nHowever, I do not so like it. \n\n[Jin Roh:The Wolf Brigade]\nThe work of Oshii Mamoru with what I looked at is only &quot;Jin-Roh&quot;. \nWhat kind of image do Americans have in wolf? \nIn Japan, there is the image &quot;loneliness&quot;, &quot;the strongest animal&quot;, \nand &quot;the ruined animal&quot; .\nA long time ago, wolfs was in Japan. They were the strongest animals \nin this island country. \nThey did not build a group but it liked acting alone. They were \nruined by man after all. \nI think that various images are mixed to &quot;Jin-roh&quot;. \n \n[Hiroshi Kurogane&#39;s Shinsengumi book and the animated film directed \nby Kon Ichikawa]\nDVD is not released. \nThe work makes Manga of Kurogane Hiroshi the original. \nI have read Manga. \nThe fan who wants to see handsome Hijikata and handsome Okita seldom \nreads. However, among the favorite fans of a historical fact, it is \na popular work. \n \nManga of Shinsengumi is planned and announced by some magazines this \nyear. \nSome are likely to become a long series although many are short \nstories. \nThe day when you read these works may come. \nIncidentally, manga which I like is this. \n \nhttp://www.youngsunday.com/rensai/comics/getsumei.html\n \nGetsumeiseiki -sayonara Shinsengumi-\n \nThis manga is good at depiction of the scene using a sword. \nNow, only two volumes are put on the market. \nI think that a series should just continue for a long time. \n\nAs for the old &quot;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&quot;, DVD will be released in July \nand afterwards. \nThis work built the foundation of the present Shinsengumi \npopularity. Therefore, there are many old fans. \nThe actor who played Hijikata with this work is playing the elder \nbrother of Hijikata&#39;s blindness in the Taiga drama. \n(In fact, Hijikata had the elder brother of the blindness on 24 \nyears old.) \nI saw &quot;Die a Samurai&quot; (Shinsengumi shimatsuki), &quot;TABOO&quot; (Gohatto), \nand  &quot;Mibugishiden movie&quot; .\nAlthough &quot;TABOO&quot; was disrepute at the fan of Shinsengumi, it was \npopular to other people. (Kondou and Hijikata age too much.) \nThis movie is created based on two pieces of short tales \nin &quot;Shinsengumi keppuroku&quot; which Shiba Ryoutarou wrote. \nAlthough this movie is a fiction, it is the truth that there was a \ndisturbance of homosexuality in Shinsengumi. \n\n&quot;Mibugishiden&quot; also has TV drama besides a movie. \nWatanabe Ken was performing Yoshimura Kanichirou. \nAlthough it is a good work, Saitou of Satou Kouichi or Odagiri Joe \n(The actor of Taiga drama) cannot be recommended to a favorite \nperson. \nFrightful Saitou is appearing. (Do you know Takenaka Naoto?)\n\n[momoiro is referring the actor from SHALL WE DANCE...the funny guy \nnot Koji Yakusho]\n \nAbout Satou Kouichi (KOICHI SATO)\nHave you seen the movie of Shinsengumi in which Mifune Toshirou \nperformed Kondou Isami? \nThe actor (Mikuni Rentarou) who is performing Serizawa Kamo with \nthat work is Satou&#39;s father. \nMikuni is an actor very famous for Japan. And Serizawa which he \nperformed is also famous. \nTherefore, Satou desired to perform Serizawa. \n\n[Japanese film buffs will recall that Rentaro Mikuni starred in such \nclassics as BURMESE HARP, Harakiri/Seppuku, KAIDAN and more]\n\n***Rentarou Mikuni is Koichi Sato&#39;s father...cool...\n \n\n\n"
