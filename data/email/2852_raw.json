I don&#39;t doubt the possibility of another Okita Rinta=\r\nro-- and in this case, the name \n&gt;that you&#39;re reading as &quot;Genji&quot; is probabl=\r\ny &quot;Motoharu&quot;, which, with one character being \n&gt;the same as &quot;Mototsune&quot;, wo=\r\nuld indeed suggest a common family background with \n&gt;Rintaro Mototsune. How=\r\never, I can find no mention of an &quot;Okita Rintaro Genji&quot; in this \n&gt;text, so =\r\nI was hoping that you could possibly point to a website where this name is =\r\n\n&gt;mentioned.\n\n?????????: Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune\nHe was Mitsu&#39;s=\r\n husband.\n\n???????: Okita Rintaro  Genji(???)/Motoharu(???)\nHe was Mitsu an=\r\nd Soji&#39;s step-father; it&#39;s believed that he was their mother&#39;s second \nhusb=\r\nand.\n\nIn case the Kanji characters don&#39;t come up, I&#39;ve left a note on the O=\r\nkita Rintaro discussion \npage at Wikipedia.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta=\r\nlk:Okita_Rintaro\n\nI&#39;ll upload book pages from both Oji and Mori&#39;s books wit=\r\nhin a few hours.\n\n&gt;Also, I can find no mention of &quot;Okita Rintaro Genji&quot; whe=\r\nn it comes to\n&gt;the adoption of Rintaro Mototsune. Rintaro Mototsune is list=\r\ned in\n&gt;Shinchogumi records as &quot;Son of the late Okita Katsujiro, retainer of=\r\n\n&gt;Lord Abe Noto no Kami&quot;. (Kikuchi, p. 26) \n\nNo, this isn&#39;t a fact.  It&#39;s a=\r\n theory or a possible explanation why Okita&#39;s listed as the \n&quot;second&quot; son. =\r\n(In regard of this, I did attach a question mark, didn&#39;t I?)\n\n~Seven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"
