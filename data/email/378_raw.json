I saw it on a Japanese messageboard\n(it is very painful trying to find the page I saw this using babelfish\nfor yahoo.co.jp)...He may have just stayed on with the Shinsengumi\nbecause he is &#39;secure&#39; he knows his men, he has some respect, he is\ntrusted by the management etc...if he went to the Mimawarigumi then\nsure he knew the management but these police/para-military groups\nfunction as a team somewhat and you need to have the &quot;respect&quot; of your\nteam---people were watching each other&#39;s back when they did\nraids/patrols etc.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;I did come across another \n&gt; interesting rumor from a livejournal somewhere (can&#39;t remember right \n&gt; now)... Saitou seems to be related by blood to Mr. Sasaki? I know.. I \n&gt; know... All I ever bring to the tables are rumors, just like that \n&gt; other woman of Saitou-sama... But really? This just sparked my \n&gt; interest because, Saitou joined the Shinsengumi why did he not join \n&gt; the Mimawarigumi? If he was related to Mr. Sasaki, wouldn&#39;t it have \n&gt; been easy? Or was it because his father was a Ronin that it would be \n&gt; preposterous for him to join the other patrol group who were composed \n&gt; of &quot;higher blood/lineage/ etc&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone have any ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way... You can find more photos on the shinsengumi and \n&gt; Sasaki&#39;s grave at this site...\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.fc.a-vst.jp/location_library/shinsengumi/sasaki.html\n\n\n"
