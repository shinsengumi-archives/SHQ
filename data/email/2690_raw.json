The beginning of their \nassociation, as best as I can tell, is when Nagai arranged for a meeting \nbetween Kondou Isami and Goto Shojiro of Tosa, in September of Keio 3 \n(1867).\n\nToward the end of their time in Kyoto, Shinsengumi (as Conrad Totman&#39;s \n&quot;Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;) will attest, were on duty at Nijo Castle. \nHowever, through some reason that I don&#39;t entirely understand, they had \nantagonized the Mito domain (Serizawa Kamo&#39;s hometown), and this could have \nled to serious problems. It be remembered, I hope, that Ito Kashitaro&#39;s \nfaction was made up of men connected to Mito-- including Ito and Suzuki \nMikisaburo themselves, who were from another domain in Hitachi Province.\n\nWho came to the rescue?\n\nNagai Naoyuki.\n\nHe reassigned Shinsengumi to Fushimi-- which means he was the one who had \nthem finally leave Kyoto-- and thus spared them from further antagonizing \nMito, which was not only a major Tokugawa collateral domain, but also the \nbirth clan of the shogun, Yoshinobu.\n\nSo-- Shinsengumi is reassigned to Fushimi, but Kondo still makes trips to \nNijo Castle for business. On returning from one of those trips, he was shot \nat by Abe Juurou and some of the other survivors of the Ito faction, and \nbarely made it back to Fushimi in one piece.\n\nIt was at this point that-- it&#39;s said-- the Shogun Yoshinobu himself came in \nperson to see the injured Kondou, and gave the Shinsengumi commander the \nservices of his personal physician, Matsumoto Ryojun. Kondou was apparently \nso happy that he cried.\n\nHOWEVER.....there is a rumor that it was not Yoshinobu, but Nagai Naoyuki, \ndisguised as Yoshinobu, who came to Kondou&#39;s bedside and brought Matsumoto \nRyojun with him.\n\nRight now I think that the latter possibility is more likely, especially \ngiven that the Shogun never really seemed to have met anyone face to \nface...and that Kondou was in Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s charge, not Yoshinobu&#39;s \n(even though Shinsengumi HAD become hatamoto-- retainers of the Shogun-- in \nlate 1867).\n\nIf it was indeed Nagai Naoyuki, then I am deeply impressed and greatly moved \nby his double act of compassion.\n\nLater, Nagai went north with Enomoto&#39;s fleet, and he and Nakajima Saburosuke \n(former Uraga Magistrate, and also said to be the first Japanese official \nwho rowed out to Perry&#39;s black ships) were chosen as Hakodate Magistrates by \nthe new Ezo Republic under Enomoto Takeaki, Matsudaira Taro, Ootori Keisuke, \nand....Hijikata Toshizo.\n\n(sources: http://www.mirai.ne.jp/~jkj8/bakusin.html, \nhttp://bakusin.jp/eiketu/nagai.html)\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
