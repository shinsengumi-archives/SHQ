My apologies.  \n\n~Seven \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, Isami&#39;s nephew Miyagawa Yugo=\r\nrou became his heir. (In 1876, Yugorou married \n&gt; Isami&#39;s daughter, became =\r\nthe fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, and changed his \n&gt; name to Kondo=\r\nu Yuugorou.) \n&gt; \n&gt; I suppose that Souji&#39;s son could be Souji&#39;s heir. Yoshij=\r\nirou could also be the head of the \n&gt; family after Souji and before Souji&#39;s=\r\n son. My guess is relevantly based on the Okita \nfamily \n&gt; history through =\r\nfour generations.    \n&gt; \n&gt; Ten years after Rintarou Kanemasa&#39;s death, Yoshi=\r\njirou died in 1895, at age 43 (by East \n&gt; Asian age reckoning.) His grave i=\r\ns next to Souji&#39;s, by the way. Yoshijirou&#39;s heir/eldest \nson \n&gt; Juji (sp?) =\r\ndied in 1910, at age 23 (by East Asian age reckoning.) After Juji&#39;s death, =\r\nhis \n&gt; younger brother became the head of the Okita family.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Souji had=\r\n started a branch family, is that considered a separate\n&gt; &gt;family altogethe=\r\nr, or does that put Rintaro and his family in an\n&gt; &gt;inferior position withi=\r\nn Souji&#39;s family?\n&gt; It&#39;s considered a branch family that doesn&#39;t put Rintar=\r\no and his family in an\n&gt; inferior position within Souji&#39;s family (I think..=\r\n.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zhusanna&quot; &lt;wsehome@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and =\r\nhe took the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;name Kondou when he became the 3rd master of the Tennen R=\r\nishin-ryu \n&gt; &gt; &gt;in 1830. Therefore, Kondou Isami was first adopted as a Shi=\r\nmazaki \n&gt; &gt; &gt;before he took the name Kondou sometime after 1858.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, wait.....if Kondou Isami had adopted an heir, this he=\r\nir would \n&gt; &gt; have to be adopted first as a Miyagawa, then as a Shimazaki, =\r\nthen as \n&gt; &gt; a Kondou??  How much time had to pass between adoptions?  Didn=\r\n&#39;t all \n&gt; &gt; this adopting get confusing?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou co=\r\nuld have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;birth (but that&#39;s n=\r\not the point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the head of the Okit=\r\na family for a short time (possibly less than a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;year) before Rintarou=\r\n Kanamasa became the head of the family. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only =\r\ngoing to remain as the head of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;family until Souji got married.  H=\r\nad Souji lived longer, Rintarou \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s son Yoshijirou would proba=\r\nbly have become Souji&#39;s heir \n&gt; &gt; &gt;and would likely have married Souji&#39;s el=\r\ndest daughter.) I suppose \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;=\r\ns son married Rintarou \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s daughter instead.  However, conside=\r\nring that Souji&#39;s son \n&gt; &gt; &gt;would&#39;ve been quite a few years younger than Ri=\r\nntarou Kanamasa&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this would&#39;ve been=\r\n the case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If Rintaro Kanamasa was only &quot;holding&quot;=\r\n the heir position for Souji \n&gt; &gt; until he got married, why wouldn&#39;t Souji&#39;=\r\ns son (if he had had one) be \n&gt; &gt; Souji&#39;s heir?  What would Rintaro&#39;s son h=\r\nave to do with anything \n&gt; &gt; now?  Because Rintaro was holding that positio=\r\nn, did that make Souji \n&gt; &gt; obligated to him?  Couldn&#39;t Souji have done wha=\r\ntever he wanted since \n&gt; &gt; he would be head of the family?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;Souji can start &quot;Bunke&quot;, a branch family of Okita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Souji received =\r\nBakushin status in 1967 so his Okita line could be \n&gt; &gt; &gt;higher than Rintar=\r\no&#39;s Okita line.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If Souji had started a branch family, is that=\r\n considered a separate \n&gt; &gt; family altogether, or does that put Rintaro and=\r\n his family in an \n&gt; &gt; inferior position within Souji&#39;s family?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --Wanda\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
