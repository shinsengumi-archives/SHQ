I am momoiro-usagi. \n\nAlthough I was not going to come here, there is something to tell \nabout this subject. \n\nThis photograph is entire imitation. \nAlthough sold at the tourist resort in Kagoshima as a photograph of \nBakumatsu shishi, investigation shows that they are the samurais of \nthe Saga domain in fact. \nSince the foreign teacher who was present in Nagasaki went to Edo, \nthe students held the farewell party. \nThis is a photograph at that time. Bakumatsu shishi is completely \nunrelated.\nThe Ryoma Sakamoto memorial hall in Kochi city has concluded that \nthis is imitation. And the ryozen museum in Kyoto is the same \nanswer. \n\nhttp://www.e-adept.net/bakumatu/sinbun.htm\nhttp://www.kochi-bunkazaidan.or.jp/~ryoma/faq1.htm\n\nhttp://www.ryozen-museum.or.jp/1102page.htm\n\nThen, I become silent. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; And in this corner, the Shinsengumi&#39;s opponents...\n&gt;  \n&gt; From a Japanese hotel site, a group photo from 1865 of the Satsuma \ngang, including Kawaji, Saigou, Ookubo, Katsura, Kaishu Katsu, Ryoma \nSakamoto... and Barb, is the emperor pictured Komei?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Good luck picking them out!  :-D\n&gt; http://www.hakusuikan.co.jp/esite/gallery/007.htm\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New and Improved Yahoo!
