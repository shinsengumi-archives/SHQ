It has to be *the* source for information on him and all its secrets are locked away from me until I learn to read Japanese.  As if I needed more motivation... Saitou-san was enough.\n \nThe 1943 edition (which may be the first it was published) has several pages of plates, which appear to be missing from subsequent editions.  (Tama... this is what is missing from your edition that I asked you about.)  I have no idea what they&#39;re all about other than image 2 to the right has to be an early picture of the main stone memorial at the Sakigaki-zuka/Sagara-zuka in Shimosuwa that the Meiji govt. allowed Ochiai Akira to set up in Meiji 3/1870  (and is that Suzuki&#39;s fan to the left or someone else&#39;s?) and the man in image 9 is Saitou Nobuyuki.  Would love to know who the sour-looking man in image 8 is... *please* don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s *HIM*.  :-D\n \nThe images are HUGE, so be patient in allowing the pages to upload AND (especially) if they become temporarily unavailable (they&#39;ll reappear within the hour... just these images eats up over 7MB... they&#39;re stored in their own space).  I was too anxious to make them available to immediately work on resizing or any other space saving tricks.  There are 15 images spread over 2 pages.  Anyone willing to translate captions, I&#39;d love to include those with the images.  (I do have zooms of some of the captions if they&#39;re unreadable, but they seem pretty clear... good job, Sec).  The pages are linked to each other, but the separate URLs are:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/hasegawa1943_1.htm\nhttp://www.geocities.com/sekisinhokoku/hasegawa1943_2.htm\n \nBibliographic information for this edition:\nHasegawa, Shin, Sagara Souzou to sono doushi. Tokyo: Shin Shousetsusha, 1943.\n \nInformation on subsequent editions is available here:\nhttp://www.greatestjournal.com/users/sagara_sozo/1444.html?thread=676#t676  (The 1981 edition is in 2 volumes... jokan & gekan)\n \nphil\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
