Example---\n&gt; was there a top \n&gt; school or style of swordsmanship used by those  in\n&gt; the Aizu area?\n\n\nSome fiefs had the so-called &quot;otome ryugi&quot;, that is, a\nstyle of martial arts that were to be kept hidden in\nsecrecy, without being spread out to other places. In\nthe Aizu area, it was the Mizoguchi-ha Itto ryu. In\nTosa, the Muso Jikiden Eishin ryu (battojutsu style).\nIn Satsuma, the Jigen ryu. And so on.\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Photos: High-quality 4x6 digital prints for 25ï¿½\nhttp://photos.yahoo.com/ph/print_splash\n\n"
