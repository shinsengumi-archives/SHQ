Yes, background checks are standard \nprocedure however the force would much rather prefer a &quot;right&quot; \nleaning person politically over a &quot;left&quot; leaning person.  This \nattitude is right out of the Meiji era in which the police+yakuza \nwere used to crack down on liberal activists.  *Note left/liberal \nlabels do not match 100% our modern American definition but it does \ncome prettyclose.  Yakuza bosses also find it to be a good idea to \nlet go of their underlings into law enforcement careers should, in \nthe future, they have to deal with the police.  Yakuza poetry is \npopular amongst cops and law enforcement publications are widely read \nby the yakuza...speaking of media the yakuza not only have ties in \nthe entertainment business....they PRODUCE many films...the names of \noyabun appear right in the credits.  Toei has made over 200 yakuza \nfilms many backed by the underworld...in fact one boss said that no \nmajor actor during the golden era of Japanese cinema has not \nsomehow &quot;benefited&quot; from their influence.\n\nthe low crime rates in Japan may in fact be partially due to not only \ncompetant police...but also their tacit agreements with the \nunderworld...yakuza are part of the eyes and ears of the police as \nthey do tip off authorities when rogue criminals enter into their \nturf...the yakuza way of seeing things is that they &quot;absorb&quot; rogue or \nexcessively violent criminals\n\nthe book I mentioned in the previous post by David E. Kaplan and Alec \nDubro (Yakuza: Japan&#39;s Criminal Underworld) examine the yakuza during \nfeudal times when there was a 5 year period when oyabun (local \nbosses/godfathers) were granted the right to wear 2 swords and a \nsurname.  Oyabun were also deputized by local police (which I&#39;m \nassuming are like the guys you see in Hatchobori 7).\n\nsecretarytocapt3\n\n\n\n\n\n"
