Is this an anime or what?! One pic is \n&gt; definitely Hijikata in Hakodate. There&#39;s no mistaking him:\n&gt; http://www.catsuka.com/interf/forum/viewtopic.php?t=691&start=72\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately it is not in English or Japanese.\n\nThe conversation is in French. \n\nI went through it and apparently, while talking about Studio 4C \nlatest production, someone mentionned &quot;Hijikata Toshizo : Shiru no \nKiseki&quot; saying that it is a a 32 minutes long OAV. He says that it \nwas made by Chie Uratani, a person who worked on : Kiki&#39;s Delivery \nService, Memories, Princess Arete and Animatrix.\n\nThen the person mentionned the official website \nwww.hijikatatoshizou.com saying that you can find a summary and \ncharacters&#39;s descriptions there. Also, it is said that you can pre-\norder the DVD via the website. I do not know if they took the \ndifferent zones into consideration when saying this...\n\nApparently, the DVD comes with a bonus: &quot;Sore ike Kanesada-kun !&quot; \n(25 minutes) and 10 minutes of other bonus.\n\nThe first picture is the DVD cover, but there are no descriptions of \nthe following images.\n\nThen, the conversation shifts and &quot;Hijikata Toshizo : Shiru no \nKiseki&quot; is not mentionned again.\n\nMary-Ann\n\n\n\n\n"
