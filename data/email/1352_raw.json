If you have seen Kurosawa&#39;s film then\nyou&#39;ll know that it means shadow warrior or body double (stand in) for\nthe important person.  Okita&#39;s friend knows Saitou (that is the\nmystery part) and I thought yaoi mangas did not have good stories!  In\nany case Soshite Saitou is very well designed (okay I&#39;ll say it he&#39;s\n*adorable*) and perhaps the few characters in the series -not-\ninvolved in the yaoi activities ^_^\n\n*if you are blessed with dsl then download the scanlations\n\n\n"
