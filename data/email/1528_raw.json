An argument like this is like saying \nKondo and the Shogun had slumber parties as children because there&#39;s \nno documentation saying they weren&#39;t friends, or that there weren&#39;t \nany slumber parties in Japan, yet both were in Edo during that time.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;momomanjyuu2004&quot; &lt;momomanjyuu2004@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Bruno Strovsky &lt;brunoern@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   Hi. My name is Bruno Ern and I am a new member from this \ngroup. \n&gt; I am 17 and I&#39;m from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n&gt; &gt;   I am member since 3rd August, but is the first time I write.\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; --&gt;  I&#39;m writing in order to know if there is any member from \n&gt; Brazil and to ask if Kondo Isami and Choshuu samurais like Katsura \n&gt; Kogoro and Sakamoto Ryoma were friends, as it is shown on \n&gt; Shinsengumi taiga drama. Sorry my poor english =/\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bruno  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello, Bruno-san.\n&gt; I am momoiro-usagi. \n&gt; I am also poor English. \n&gt; Please allow, even if I write strange English. \n&gt; \n&gt; The setup from which Kondou, Sakamoto, and Katsura became friends \nis \n&gt; the fiction of Taiga drama. \n&gt; However, it is the fiction which may be a true story. \n&gt; When they live in Edo, there is no information that they were \n&gt; friends. \n&gt; But there is also no information that they were not friends. \n&gt; When the dramatist of a drama proposed this setup, the researchers \n&gt; who do history historical investigation were perplexed. \n&gt; It was a setup which is likely to be severely criticized by the \n&gt; serious Shinsengumi fan. \n&gt; However, they confirmed the contents of the scenario and issued \nO.K. \n&gt; To be sure, this is a fiction.\n&gt; However, Kondou, Sakamoto, and Katsura were in Edo rightly as a \n&gt; historical fact in 1854 set as the 1st episode. \n&gt; There is no proof that they were not friends. \n&gt; They are not unable for them to meet in somewhere in Edo city, and \n&gt; to become friends. \n&gt; (But people of 1,500,000 lived in Edo city of Bakumatsu. \n&gt; I think that it is quite difficult for them to meet in it.)^^;;;\n&gt; This Taiga drama is the fiction of the boundary which is not \n&gt; impossible. \n&gt; \n&gt; Incidentally, as for a setup of an acquaintance of Katsura and \n&gt; Kondou, Taiga drama is not the first.\n&gt; I regard it as &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; of Shiba Ryotarou having been the \n&gt; beginning. \n&gt; (This is a novel and, of course, a fiction.) \n&gt; When a Dojyo challenger comes to Shieikan, Katsura is called in \n&gt; order to play a game in a substitute. \n&gt; In fact, when the Dojyo challenger came to Shieikan, Kondou called \n&gt; strong sword man from other neighboring Dojyoes, and had him do an \n&gt; acting game.\n&gt; It is not known whether Katsura came to Shieikan. \n&gt; However, Katsura was a student&#39;s representation in big Dojyo \ncalled \n&gt; Renpeikan. \n&gt; \n&gt; momoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
