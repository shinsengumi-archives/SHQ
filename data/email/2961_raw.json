SHQ is\nalso grateful to other contributrs such as Seven as=\r\n well.\n\nWe are fortunate that alot of Shinsengumi info is now\nonline---howe=\r\nver, it is becoming a very dangerous trend to &quot;translate&quot;\nor &quot;transcribe&quot;? =\r\nand post without noting in detail the original\nJapanese source.  Translatio=\r\nn without noting the source is also\nplaigiarism.  \n\nLook at books on Japane=\r\nse history, if the western writer is quoting\nand translating stuff, he or s=\r\nhe footnotes exactly the Japanese book\nand page. This prevents translating =\r\nor quoting out of context (because\nreaders can double check the work) or th=\r\ne translator adding *more* to\nwhat was originally said.  \n\nThe reader needs=\r\n to know where the accurate translation ends, and\ntranslator commentary beg=\r\nins. It doesn&#39;t matter if we are just fans,\nwe can be just as transparent a=\r\nnd careful as researchers too (when we\nare discussing history).\n\nIt is hard=\r\n to determine the validity of the work if there are\nparagraphs of text all =\r\ntranslated/transcribed but you don&#39;t know which\nsentences and facts came ou=\r\nt of the Japanese text.\n\nIn my own experience, translators even go to the t=\r\nrouble of explaining\ncertain phrases in footnotes or provide the exact phra=\r\nse in that\nlanguage as well to offer other interpretations.\n\nsecretarytocap=\r\nt3 \npromises to shut up now\n\n\n\n\n\n"
