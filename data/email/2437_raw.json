Right now am lurking for the basic, first by Shisengumi and now am at lurking for Hijikata and Sauji.The first one well am been impress for what I had seen am not discarting checking out for his hometown and key places. Um, I was wondering what do you study?\n\nOh. Thanks for asking :) .  In terms of what I study -- I&#39;d probably say I generally focus in on meta-issues like culture and politics.  \n\nMy interest in the more political and historical side of Japan probably was fueled by a lot of Sec&#39;s posts here. :)  Since Sec and others on this list have focused on the Shinsengumi and due to the availability of materials in English in various libraries, I elected to pursue materials on the Choshu han who was influential in shaping the Meiji era.  I see this as a complementary approach to better understanding the environment that shaped much of the Bakumatsu.\n\nIn terms of research style, I tend to work from book to book and abstract things that I find randomly interesting or that I remember that others have a passion for.   At the moment, I am still working on dealing with materials on Katsura Kogoro/Kido Koin-Takayoshi, although I became sidetracked by a biography on Yoshida Shoin, who was both a mentor to Katsura, as well as a personal headache to him.   :-D\n\nUnfortunately, I&#39;m much slower than the others on this list in finding stuff and then in redistributing it. I have still yet to finish reading the diaries, but am posting various snippets of things I dig up at my website (http://red-bird.org).  Sec recently added a link from the SHQ webpage for the curious.  At the moment, I only have the beginnings of Katsura and Shoin stuff.  (Hopefully *cough* I can goad someone into putting up the Takasugi materials in short order.) \n\nIn terms of your original interests - remind me to scan the covers and special images from the Pichi manga line featuring Hijikata and Souji .  Aside from the history stuff, I have a not-so-secret weakness for manga and fanart. -_-;\n\nS\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
