I keep meaning to do that and get sidetracked.  (wow... what a surprise!)\n \nWell, because I forgot to check I missed the earlier showings, but there&#39;s still one more showing this weekend of &quot;The 47 Ronin, Part 1&quot; on IFC (Independent Film Channel).  It comes on at 3:00 a.m. in my area (Mountain/Pacific time), so look for it early in your area.\n \nFollowing is the Samurai Saturday on IFC fare for next week to August 21:\n \nJuly 31st -- The 47 Ronin, Part 2\nAugust 7th -- Kill!  (Kiru!)\nAugust 14th -- Sanjuro\nAugust 21st -- Samurai Spy\n \nYou can check out IFC&#39;s schedule at http://www.ifctv.com/ifc/index .\n \nThough it&#39;s not Japanese, but may be of interest, on July 31st IFC is having a &quot;Chop-Socky Fest&quot; in the evening... 2 films and a new documentary examining the history of the Hong Kong martial arts film tradition.  The films will be &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; (Jet Li) and &quot;Project A&quot; (Jackie Chan).\n \nphil\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
