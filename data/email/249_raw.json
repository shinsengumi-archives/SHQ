Did you see the film at some festival or university\narchive?  I really want to see a dramatized version of Ito Affair\n(&quot;Mibugishiden&quot; and &quot;Band of Assasins&quot;-starring Mifune doesn&#39;t really\ngo into detail as much as I&#39;d like them to).  So does the Intrepid\nCaptain of the Shinsengumi depict Saitou? \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Kevin Closson &lt;k_closson2001@y...&gt; wrote:\nNot too long after this movie they played in\n&gt; a trilogy based on the story you know as &quot;Sword of\n&gt; Doom&quot; with Kataoka playing the mad swordsman and\n&gt; Nakamura playing the young avenging brother.\n\n&gt; Eventually they deal with the Ito Kashitaro group\n&gt; defection and the movie ends near the battle of Toba\n&gt; and Fushimi. There are some love interests in the\n&gt; story for both the main characters and I remember that\n&gt; near the end the group burns the Makoto flag as a\n&gt; symbolic ceremony of their group ending.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n\n\n\n"
