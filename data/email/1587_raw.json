Aizu no Kamen Rider wa\n&gt; shodai Kamen Rider deshouka? ^^ (&quot;Semaru Shocker /\n&gt; Jigoku no gundan...&quot; no Kamen Rider?)\n\nIt had not written on e-mail which &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; it was. \nProbably, the landlady of the kimono store thinks that she cannot \nunderstand it. \nIt is a red eye and there is a tactile sense....Although she is \nwriting so, it is applied to almost all &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;. \n\nhttp://www.rakuten.co.jp/aizu/447910/516875/\n\nThere was such a page. \nIt is the photograph of the Aizu autumn festival in 2003.\n\n\nBy the way, when Kamo-san comes to Japan, I want you to confirm. \nProbably, since you will come to Japan by an airplane, if you arrive \nat an airport, please confirm what kind of smell there is. \nIs there the smell of soy sauce? \nThere is an American dish investigator who plays an active part in \nJapan, and she appeared in this front television and said such a \nthing. \nShe says that there is the smell of soy sauce in the airport in \nJapan.\nI know that she does not have malice to Japan. \nAnd I am not unpleasant even if a foreigner says that there is the \nsmell of soy sauce in the airport in Japan. \nHowever, I thought that it was a very strange talk. \nTherefore, I want to ask very much the foreigner who comes to Japan. \nPlease confirm at an airport whether there is the smell of soy sauce.\n\nKamo-san ga syouyu no nioi wo kirai de nakereba yoi no \ndesuga.....^^;;; \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
