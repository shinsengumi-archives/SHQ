What is the sleeveless jacket-type garment \n&gt;called... the part of the uniform that was red & lined with grey?  And the \n&gt;headband or bandana (is one English term more appropriate?) that they & \n&gt;others wore, does it have a more proper term?  If it doesn&#39;t have an \n&gt;official label as part of a uniform, what would be the Japanese word for \n&gt;it?\n\nThe headband is called a hachimaki. If it has a strip of metal, like the \nShinsengumi one, it&#39;s called a jinhachimaki or a hachigane.\n\nThe sleeveless jacket is called a jinbaori-- &quot;war-haori&quot;-- since, in full \ntraditional garb, it would be worn over a suit of armor.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE* \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
