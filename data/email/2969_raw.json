(1833? - February 6, 1868) was a Shinsengumi\n&gt; officer and spy\n&gt; (Kansatsu.)\n&gt; He was a ronin from Osaka and an expert in Katori Ryu. In 1864, Yamazaki\n&gt; and Shimada\n&gt; Kai were assigned by Kondo Isami to investigate the situation which led to\n&gt; the Ikedaya\n&gt; Jiken on July 8. However, there is a theory that Yamazaki&#39;s participation\n&gt; in the Ikedaya\n&gt; Jiken is merely fiction by Shimozawa Kan and Shiba Ryotaro.\n&gt; Yamazaki was said to be excellent in literary and military arts. His\n&gt; scholastic talent was\n&gt; necessary when discussing politics with a court noble.\n&gt; In 1865, he accompanied Kondo to Hiroshima. It is believed that Yamazaki\n&gt; did not return\n&gt; to Kyoto with Kondo until the next year in order to further investigate\n&gt; Choshu&#39;s status.\n&gt; Yamazaki studied medicine under Matsumoto Ryoujun. According to Matsumoto,\n&gt;\n&gt; Yamazaki was a gentle and taciturn man.\n&gt; During the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in 1868, Yamazaki was severely injured\n&gt; and died on\n&gt; February 6. The exact location of his death is debatable. He had Kondo and\n&gt; Hijikata\n&gt; Toshizo&#39;s full confidence and was one of the most faithful member of the\n&gt; Shinsengumi till\n&gt; the very end.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yamazaki in Fiction\n&gt;\n&gt; Yamazaki is featured in Peacemaker Kurogane (anime/manga), Kaze Hikaru\n&gt; (manga),\n&gt; Getsumei Seiki (manga) and Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi (video game\n&gt; series.)\n&gt; Han&#39;nya from the anime/manga Rurouni Kenshin is loosely based on Yamazaki.\n&gt; Although his anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a trained\n&gt; ninja, the real\n&gt; Yamazaki was not a ninja.\n&gt;\n&gt; References\n&gt;\n&gt; Rekishi Dokuhon, December 1997 issue &quot;The Ten Captains of The Late\n&gt; Tokugawa Period&#39;s\n&gt; Strongest Shinsengumi&quot;\n&gt; Shinsengumi Chronicle.
