These things might have been historically inaccurate, but\nhere we have an opportunity, as I am so desperate to find, to see that\nhistorical figures are just as human and real as us. In this case, we\nsee Shinsengumi as 47 ronin fanboys. After all, by Nagakura&#39;s\nrecollection they started out with just 13, so they needed something\nto inspire them. And being from peasant backgrounds, they would have\nseen the kabuki, which samurai born as samurai were discouraged to\nattend. Hence the reason for their choices.\n\nAs Miyamoto Musashi said, one must &quot;study the Ways of all\nprofessions.&quot; We must appreciate all perspectives, in order to, as\nLeopold von Ranke said in his great work of historiography, to &quot;show\nthings (as close to) as they were&quot;\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n\n"
