I&#39;m assuming that yes they would want to know where he\nwas coming from--from a martial arts P.O.V...the answer can be found\nif the history of kendo itself is examined.  Mainstream kendo books\n-do- mention its early days in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police\nDepartment & Army but no dates are given (some say 19XX was when the\ngov. actually invited a couple of lineages to come up with a\ncurriculum)...if the tournaments utilized modern rules/regulations I&#39;m\nnot sure if the school/lineage of the practitioner was important.  I&#39;m\nrepeating what I&#39;ve heard over and over again on martial arts boards\n(so I deeply apologize if I&#39;m wrong) but distinctions are always made\nbetween modern kendo (categorized as a sport with rules and scoring\nsystem) and kenjutsu (its relative/ancestor). So perhaps the\ntournaments and kendo in general within the police dept. may have\nserved as a unifying element it&#39;s kind of like saying &quot;wherever you\nguys are from you will now play by a new set of rules&quot; at least as far\nas the tournament is concerned.  Like I said a closer examination of\nthe history of kendo itself is needed (sigh)\n\n*even by the time he participated in his first tournament he was no\nlonger just a cop on the beat...but already an assistant inspector [1877]\nthe tournament takes place in [1882] at least 5 years after getting\nthe position...so I&#39;m assuming somewhat respected in his dept.  I\nthink out of courtesy they wouldn&#39;t try to pry into his background if\nhe already held a respectable position in the dept....I&#39;m personally\nsurprised he didn&#39;t participate *more* or -not- at all\n\nWarg3791 http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm\nonly has hirotaka suzuoki&#39;s voice work?...man I love his voice\n\nWarg3791 However, they also state that he didn&#39;t join the police force\nright away. They\nlist the year he became a policeman as 1877. But we know he joined\nsooner than\nthat. \n\n*yep, on the 3-hajime.com basic chronology 1877 is mentioned as the\nfirst year connecting S.H. to the police [but] in other places of her\nwebsite such as the mystery of the 1st wife -1871- the webmaster\nspeculates this mystery woman may have had a hand in his affiliation\nwith the pol. dept. which pushes the policework timeline way back.  To\nme S.H. may have had alot of side jobs and travelled which prevents\nnosy historians from finding a definate paper trail\n\n-MissBehavin (Hands out Tylenol to everyone trying to track Saito-sama&#39;s\nmovements.)....I prefer sake thank you\n\n\n"
