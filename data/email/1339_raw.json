You mean the NHK drama that&#39;s been running\nall year?  It does air on Saturdays in California (with subtitles--lucky\nCA people) and the regular NHK airing is Sundays. The Sunday Japanese\nbroadcast is about 6 weeks or so ahead of the subtitled version.\n\n--Uh yeah, sorry. That drama series.\nIt&#39;s supposed to be airing right at this moment, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s been \nreplaced with something about drums. o.O\nAny idea why?\n\nThen, the guide from my reciever/dish tends to be really screwy, so perhaps \nthey&#39;ll be airing it later on.\n\nMiser Bellatrix\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIs your PC infected?
