It&#39;s made by taking a polishing stones and grinding them up. This process shouldn&#39;t be done too often on blades since it&#39;ll dull the polish and mar the details in the metal. Course in the old days this didn&#39;t matter as the upkeep as a weapon mattered more than perservation as a piece of art.  \n\nCheck this link for images. \nhttp://johndswordpolishing.com/swordaccessories/\n\n\nJon\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: spiritus_saitou \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, April 15, 2004 5:56 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Stupid question about sword care\n\n\n  In so many samurai movies I see swordsmen caring for their swords by \n  applying *something* with a *puff-ball* type thing.  Uh... what \n  exactly are they doing and what is the proper terminology?  (Yeah, I \n  can just see myself writing a quiet scene of Sano watching Saitou \n  care for his katana... &quot;Saitou raised the puff-ball thing and \n  gracefully tapped it, applying something from hilt to tip...&quot;)\n\n  phil (in samurai heaven watching &quot;Kill!&quot;)\n\n\n\n  visit \n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n  our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
