Even if it is which, as for Tetsu, \nposterity doe=\r\ns not exist.) \nThe posterity of Tatsunosuke preserved data detailed about t=\r\nhe \norigin of the Ichimura family. \nIt was guessed from there why the Ichim=\r\nura brothers joined \nShinsengumi. \nFurthermore, one of posterity was Okita =\r\nSouji&#39;s passionate fan. \nShe gave Souji and a name to the own son. \nHowever=\r\n, they did not know that their ancestor was a Shinsengumi \nmember. \nResearc=\r\nhers visited and they got to know it for the first time. \n\n\nSince Shinsengu=\r\nmi attracted attention in the Taiga drama this year, \na quite special resea=\r\nrch document came to be published. \nI think that there continues to be good=\r\n discovery.\n\n\nmomoiro-usagi \n\n\n\n\n\n"
