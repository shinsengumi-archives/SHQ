This is the first \ntime I&#39;ve seen the manga in its original format and I&#39;m running into \nthings that either I hadn&#39;t noticed before or had forgotten.  I don&#39;t \nremember the men in the Tokyo jail gossiping about who Fujita really \nis.  Reminded me of discussions we&#39;ve had about whether or not people \nin the department knew his true identity.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;ve uploaded that portion of page 19 from chapter 218 \n(volume 25) of the manga into the Photos section.  Wasn&#39;t sure if it \nwas appropriate to any of the folders, so it&#39;s just sitting there on \nits own.  Sweet little scene.\n\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/shq/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=rk_fu\njita_who_he_really_is.jpg&.view=t&.done=http%\n3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/shq/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%\n26.view=t\n\nphil\n\n\n"
