You say that Sadakichi\n&gt; was Shusaku&#39;s \n&gt; brother? But I saw one website that listed him as\n&gt; his nephew. To make \n&gt; matters even more confusing, Hillsborough states\n&gt; that Sadakichi was \n&gt; the master of one of the &quot;three greatest fencing\n&gt; schools in Edo&quot; and \n&gt; Ryoma was the &quot;head&quot; of this school. \n\n\nTama-san explained that better than I :)\n\n\n \n&gt; The problem is that if you look up these two,\n&gt; Shusaku&#39;s Genbukan Dojo \n&gt; is listed as one of the &quot;three greatest&quot; in Edo.\n&gt; [The other two were \n&gt; Shunzo Momonoi&#39;s Shigakukan Dojo (Kyoshin Meichi\n&gt; Ryu) and Saito \n&gt; Yakuro&#39;s Renpeikan Dojo (Shindo Munen Ryu).] \n\n\n\nYes, that&#39;s right. And sometimes, Iba dojo of\nShingyoto Ryu is also included in the list, making the\n&quot;four greatest&quot; in Edo.\n\nBy the way, it&#39;s &quot;Shinto Munen&quot;, not &quot;Shindo Munen&quot; :)\nDang Japanese names :D\n\n\n\n&gt; This\n&gt; might fit since \n&gt; Hillsborough calls the other two dojo by the names\n&gt; of the \n&gt; swordmasters rather than their official name. (He\n&gt; calls \n&gt; them &quot;Momonoi&quot; and &quot;Saito&quot; schools.) But then Ryoma,\n&gt; to be &quot;head&quot; \n&gt; of &quot;Chiba Dojo&quot; would have had to study under\n&gt; Shusaku rather than \n&gt; Sadakichi?! \n\n\n\nNo. &quot;Chiba dojo&quot; could either mean Chiba Shusaku&#39;s and\nChiba Sadakichi&#39;s. Ryoma was the &quot;jukutou&quot;, the &quot;head\nstudent&quot;, who represented the dojo, but the real\n&quot;owner&quot; of the dojo, so to speak, was Chiba Sadakichi.\n\n \n&gt; Another curious thing, I note that on Serizawa&#39;s\n&gt; site it is stated \n&gt; that Yamanami studied at the Genbukan? So it becomes\n&gt; more likely then \n&gt; that Ryoma and Yamanami would have known each\n&gt; other?! Even if it -was-\n&gt;  another school, they would have met each others\n&gt; students I would \n&gt; assume?\n\n\nAs Tama-san did put it, it is possible that they had\nmet, but not certain, unfortunately. The same goes\nwith Toudou Heisuke. Likewise, it is possible, but not\nlikely, that Nagakura met Serizawa before the\nShinsengumi and all.\n\nAs for the chrysanthemum dolls that appeared in a\nprevious post, they are NOT from Bange, AFAIK. Bange\nis a place next to Aizu Wakamatsu, but not famous by\nits dolls. The &quot;kikuningyo&quot; is from Nihonmatsu and its\nneighborhood.\n\nhttp://p133.pcsn.co.jp/~nihonmatsu/kiku.html\n\n\n\n=====\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
