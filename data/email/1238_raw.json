So this title is confered to aristocracy if \nanything in the past.\n\nIn Kaimyo, Kanji from one&#39;s liftime name are included frequently, and can put \nsome kanji which evokes one&#39;s achivement or personality.\nFor exemple, Kondo&#39;s kaimyo indicates his loyality.\n\nThat&#39;s what I can say about kaimyo for the moment. may be I&#39;ll give more \ndetails later.\n\nTama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
