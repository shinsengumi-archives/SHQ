Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! Tells me so much more about what Sagara was up to prior to the formation of the Sekihoutai.  I knew he was responsible for attacks on bakufu offices in an attempt to disrupt the administration, but this is much more detail than I had.\n \nHowever...\n\nwarg3791 &lt;Warg3791@...&gt; wrote:\n \n&gt;&gt;Those of you who read Remembering Aizu will recall that there were rumors of attacks in Edo. It was most likely these assaults by the Sekihoutai they were hearing about. It seems likely to me that after all was said and done, someone came to Saigo and said, &quot;Now would you care to explain just what the #### happened\nin Edo?!&quot; And the lying snake just shrugged and said &quot;Ask Sagara.&quot;&lt;&lt;\n \nThese attacks in 1867 are PRIOR to the formation of the Sekihoutai, which was created around the time of Toba-Fushimi, when the Imperialists felt confident they had control.  The Sekihoutai was supposed to be an advance troop sent to send word back to the main army what they were getting into before they reached it (they scoped out the mood in order to warn the Imperialist Army if they could expect problems) and to dessiminate information (like the halving of land taxes) to the rural areas.  They were apparently not meant to be an offensive fighting unit of any kind.  (The Sekihoutai was made up mostly of farmers & merchants, too, not ronin... though, obviously, there were a few.)\n \nI think Saigou was far more devious, his motivation even stronger/more determined to rid himself of Sagara, in his ordering the creation of the Sekihoutai and then, if not directly ordering it (which I *think* I&#39;ve read somewhere he did), publically supporting the halving of land taxes... the very thing they nailed Sagara on.  I can certainly see him using the situation in Edo as fodder for the fire, though.  Nasty man, that Sagara...  He had the audacity to follow Saigou&#39;s orders...\n \nUltimately, I still hold to the theory the Sekihoutai was a solid plot to create faith and trust in the Imperialists, who needed all the support they could get, by sending Sagara out there with a lie and saving the people from him.\n \n&gt;&gt;It&#39;s really irritating that there are only TWO references to him in the entire book, esp. since it fails to mention that he was with the Sekihoutai or that he was executed by the new government Saigo helped set up.&lt;&lt;\n \nHey!  At least he got mentioned... and twice!  :-D  That&#39;s more than in most information on the period I&#39;ve come across.  THAT&#39;s what gets frustruting.\n \nIf the book is pro-Saigou in any way, I don&#39;t expect them to go into much detail about Sagara.  If it really was what my gut reaction has been, it&#39;s an extremely black mark against Saigou.  There is also, unfortunately, the very real possibity that records were destroyed either at the time or later, or other Imperialists who knew/realized it really didn&#39;t want it to be preserved for posterity.  Something must&#39;ve survived since the government issued an official apology many, many years later (ironically at the same time they &quot;made peace&quot; with Aizu).\n \nMissB and to everyone else here who has been keeping an eye out for me... thank you so much for sharing what you find on Sagara.  I&#39;m glad he had a wolf in his company to allow him some measure of remembrance here at least.\n \nphil (with new things to think about... yummy!)\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
