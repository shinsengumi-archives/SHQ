This is indeed a ton more then I&#39;ve been able to find on the internet.   Now I have to get my lil paws on that book to see what else I can get out of it...\n \nYa, anyways, as far as the Mimawarigumi, I don&#39;t believe that there has been any discription of a unifrom (if any at all).   The best thing you could probably do is make them wear a the same color hakama and/or gii.   The gii would probably have a distinctive pattern on it (common, but distinctive).   Mmm... thats the best thing you can do ^^;;;;\n \n -Gladys \n       (Bunneh)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
