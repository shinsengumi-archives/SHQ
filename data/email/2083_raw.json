And famous sword woman Sanako Chiba, who was the fiance of \nRyoma was the oldest daughter of Sadakichi.\nhttp://www.hpmix.com/home/seiunzi/E3.htm\nRyoma stayed in Chiba-dojo since 1856 to 58.\n\nAs for Yamanami, the only source which mention about his relationship \nwith Chiba-dojo is Nagakura&#39;s memoir.( If my memory is correct)\nAnd according to Nagakura, Yamanami would be in Chiba Shusaku&#39;s dojo \n(Genbukan or Oochiba &quot;Big Chiba&quot; dojo) in Otamagaike.\n\nSo, Ryoma and Yamanami are in different establishments. However there \nwould be some interchange between those dojo and it isn&#39;t completely \nimpossible even if they have ever met.\n\nToudou Heisuke would be also in Chiba-dojo before joining to Ito-Dojo.\n(It&#39;s not either certain about him) But those three are all Hokushin \nItto school and they might have some relationship between those \nestablishments.\n\nTama\n\n\n\nwarg3791 wrote:\n\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; Sec, I do not see that file you said you uploaded on Chiba Dojo the\n &gt; other day. I do know that Hillsborough also says that Ryoma studied\n &gt; there under Chiba Sadakichi. He does not go beyond that to state what\n &gt; this Chiba&#39;s relationship was to Shusaku.\n &gt;\n &gt; This is where I get confused. You say that Sadakichi was Shusaku&#39;s\n &gt; brother? But I saw one website that listed him as his nephew. To make\n &gt; matters even more confusing, Hillsborough states that Sadakichi was\n &gt; the master of one of the &quot;three greatest fencing schools in Edo&quot; and\n &gt; Ryoma was the &quot;head&quot; of this school.\n &gt;\n &gt; The problem is that if you look up these two, Shusaku&#39;s Genbukan Dojo\n &gt; is listed as one of the &quot;three greatest&quot; in Edo. [The other two were\n &gt; Shunzo Momonoi&#39;s Shigakukan Dojo (Kyoshin Meichi Ryu) and Saito\n &gt; Yakuro&#39;s Renpeikan Dojo (Shindo Munen Ryu).] This might fit since\n &gt; Hillsborough calls the other two dojo by the names of the\n &gt; swordmasters rather than their official name. (He calls\n &gt; them &quot;Momonoi&quot; and &quot;Saito&quot; schools.) But then Ryoma, to be &quot;head&quot;\n &gt; of &quot;Chiba Dojo&quot; would have had to study under Shusaku rather than\n &gt; Sadakichi?!\n &gt;\n &gt; Or were there, by Hillsborough&#39;s definition of the dojo names, two\n &gt; Chiba dojo in Edo at that time and he has it wrong which of them was\n &gt; considered to be &quot;one of the three greatest&quot;? And if so, then were\n &gt; did he get that Ryoma was &quot;head&quot; of the more important one? Did\n &gt; Sadakichi perhaps succeed Shusaku as master of the dojo?\n &gt;\n &gt; And what of the other two people he mentions as being the &quot;heads&quot; of\n &gt; the other two famous dojo at the time? Takechi Hanpeita of Tosa, he\n &gt; says, was &quot;head&quot; of &quot;Momonoi Dojo&quot; and Katsura Kogoro of Choshu\n &gt; was &quot;head&quot; of &quot;Saito Dojo&quot;.\n &gt;\n &gt; Another curious thing, I note that on Serizawa&#39;s site it is stated\n &gt; that Yamanami studied at the Genbukan? So it becomes more likely then\n &gt; that Ryoma and Yamanami would have known each other?! Even if it -was-\n &gt; another school, they would have met each others students I would\n &gt; assume?\n &gt;\n &gt; -MissB (now completely lost somewhere out in left field)\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; Yahoo!
