What I was trying to do was just to let whoever was \nreading my post to see that I have this tendency to judge/think in \nterms of my own values / timeframe. Not really able to put myself in \ntheir shoes back then, so it was more of a warning to let them know I \ngo wacky most of the time.\n\nAs for Tatsuo, does anyone know the social status/class of his \nadoptive parents? Are they higher or lower than the Fujita&#39;s? It \nwould be interesting if Tatsuo was from a higher family, coz if so, I \nwonder if he harbored regrets being associated with biological \nparents with lower status... \n\n\n\n\n"
