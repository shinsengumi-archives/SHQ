I could not find reference to whether they will be \ntranslating the prequel SIMP but translation of the second part PMK \nis ongoing. \n\nAbout the Anime, ADV (at least from what I know right now) has not \nannounced ownership of the Anime but there are rumors that they are \nor very soon will be dubbing the series... Wow that was fast. If \nthis is true then I&#39;m glad I got the fansub version first. Unless \nADV announces they officially licensed PMK Anime then I guess the \ndistribution of fansubs by fansubbers won&#39;t stop till then. So glad \nthough that someone is picking up the manga because that means the \nDVDs will be out soon, probably on or after fall this year. \nWAI!!! :O)\n\n\n"
