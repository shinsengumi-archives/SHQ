According to this \ntranslation the victory was actually awarded to him, but there were \nsome who spread the rumor that the fight had actually ended in a \ndraw. \n\nI&#39;ve also been considering the whole thing about him never wrapping a \ntowel about his neck. So far I&#39;ve come up with two new clues that \nhave led me to a conclusion about what they mean. The first is the \nfact that the word &quot;neck&quot; is not necessarily the correct translation. \nThe evil goldfish also has a tendency to say &quot;neck&quot; when it&#39;s talking \nabout Kondo&#39;s beheading. So it could actually be talking about his \nhead, not his neck. The second thing I found was a reference to \na &quot;worktowel&quot; that people wore wrapped around their head to keep the \nsweat out of their eyes. It was in a book on the Edo period and \nmentioned that people took these off in the presence of someone of \nhigher rank. As I recall, in the Shin Kepp miniseries many of the \nscenes that featured training in the dojo showed the Shinsengumi \nmemebers wearing just such a towel on their head. So my conclusion is \nthat this is in fact the &quot;towel&quot; that Saito never wore around \nhis &quot;neck&quot; (or rather his head).\n\nAnd I found another reference to Saito being wounded at the battle of \nToba-Fushimi in the 1to5.net notes. He went to a medical place at the \nKando Izumi bridge on the 19th it says. The assumption made was that \nit was for treatment of injures substained during the battle. I just \nfinished watching &quot;When the Last Sword is Drawn&quot;, courtesy of Barb. \nIn that movie, Saito is wounded in the leg in the Toba-Fushimi fight. \nCoincidence or is this based on fact? I note that the movie also had \nSaito referring to Kondo as a &quot;snob&quot;. This becomes VERY relevant in \nlight of the info we just received about Kondo&#39;s attitude problem and \nthe quarrel within the ranks because of it.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
