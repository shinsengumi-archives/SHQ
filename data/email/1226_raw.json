(And just where was\n&gt; the alcoholic little brother, I wonder...  was\n&gt; Suzuki already under the table (if that was even\n&gt; possible)?)\n\n\n\nAs much as I&#39;d love to provide more info, I can&#39;t\nwrite anything too long anytime soon, thanks to my\ngraduate studies :( Perhaps later on or perhaps in a\nfuture chat? :)\n\n\n  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider\n&gt; Saigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also\n&gt; plenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo\n&gt; Takamori, who could have understood the plea of\n&gt; Yamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed\n&gt; in\n&gt; Edo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were\n&gt; good men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin\n&gt; side,\n&gt; as well as bad men in both, IMHO :)&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; And just possibly Saigou is an example of how a man\n&gt; could be both good AND bad... a human condition. \n\n\nThat&#39;s true enough.\n\n\n&gt; Unless you can give me some good evidence to the\n&gt; contrary (and you&#39;re probably one person who can), I\n&gt; will go on thinking he had a role in Sagara Souzou&#39;s\n&gt; demise.  \n\n\nI don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t have the Shinsenbumi Ibun\nhere with me, but I recall that it was another Ishin\nShishi who ordered the attack on the Sekihoutai.\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\nAnd talking about songs...\n\n&quot;Kamo no kawara ni chidori ga sawagu\nMata mo chi no ame namida ame\nBushi to iu na ni inochi wo kakete\nShinsengumi wa kyou mo iku&quot;\n\nA VERY ROUGH translation:\n&quot;The birds are restless at the margins of the Kamo\nriver\nAgain, there is a rain of blood, a rain of tears\nBetting their lives on the title of &#39;warrior&#39;\nthe Shinsengumi goes today once again&quot;\n\n(the only Shinsengumi song I&#39;ve got so far, sung by\nMihachi Michiya)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
