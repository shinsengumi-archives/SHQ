I should be\ngetting pictures of the artifacts in the mail soon ^_^  will share\nofcourse...I did make a phone call and spoke to someone who works at\nthis small museum and asked if anyone has examined the sword to\ndetermine the maker/lineage or any other identification and the answer\nis no as far as he knows.... (-_-) .... but maybe I&#39;ll get more info\nin the mail (let&#39;s hope)...\n\nAs much of what we know is based on &quot;lists&quot;...lists of names...lists\nof swords I was hoping that we could match the sword to its original\nowner since the owner was a samurai from Aizu.  If the sword is of\nvalue we can do some searching....and match families who had an\nancestor who posessed such and such a weapon....\n\n\n"
