What I was completely\nunprepared for was the appearance of the Shinsengumi\nin this universe. After all, it&#39;s a fighting/gag\ncomedy with cross-dressing giant fish with legs,\nsexually ambiguous octopus men, horny giant snails and\nvarious other weird creatures, and the main\ncharacter&#39;s catchphrase is &quot;N&#39;baba!&quot; \n\nDid you know about this already? Am I the only one who\nis delighted/disgusted? \n\n(For those of you who might point out that the kanji\nis different, yes it is, but the pronunciation is the\nsame.) \n\nThe series is PAPUWA!, sequel to Nangoku Shonen\nPapuwa; here&#39;s the link, and scroll about halfway down\nthe page for this universe&#39;s incarnations of our\nfavourite boys in blue. \n\nhttp://gangan.square-enix.co.jp/papuwa/toumin/toumin_b.html\n\n\nI almost died when I saw Saitou, in a hilariously bad\nway. \n\nBest wishes, and hope everyone&#39;s well, \n\nMio. \n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
