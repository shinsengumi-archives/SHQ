We accept and understand that the Shinsengumi are a\ncontroversial group.&quot;\n\nI hunted down this individual at the other forum and noticed that he\nis ALSO not Japanese LOL but he is studying a Japanese martial art.  \n\nI believe that this person was greatly affected, as we all are, by\ngraphic images currently shown in the mass media as one of his many\ncomments dealt with executions.  The person presumes that we cannot\ncomprehend or even deny the violence and brutality of that time period\nand so on and so forth.  He made some really horrible accusations on\nhow we seem to be glorifying violence.\n\nSo from now on please call me &quot;sec&quot; on that messageboard (abbreviation\nof secretarytocapt3) because this guy kept calling me by my first name\n.  Now I must try to do something about my email :(\n\nI just wanted to share.\nHopefully non of you here will receive a message from this person.\n\n\n\n\n"
