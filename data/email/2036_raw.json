Shikashi nakanaka kikai ga arimasen.)\nI have visited to Kumamoto and Nagasaki near Satsuma. \nDidn&#39;t you go to Kumamoto Castle? \nSince a fierce battle was fought here during Seinan war, there are \nmany data of Seinan war. \nAt the teenage time, I believed that Kirino Toshiaki (as Nakamura \nHanjirou) was handsome. \nAnd his photograph was seen here and I was disappointed very much. \nlol\n\nhttp://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/bakumatu/kirino.html\n\n\n\n&gt;Went to Shoukason-juku in Hagi and was VERY impressedka\n&gt;at Yoshida Shoin&#39;s teachings o.o (sugoi koto wo\n&gt;oshiete imashita) \n\nI think that Yoshida Shoin is the teacher of an ideal. \nHe had the capacity to find the hidden talent which all people have.\nHis thought attracted young students and made them consider the \nfuture of Japan. \nIn fact, most of famous Ishin-Shishis of Choshuu are the students of \nShoukason-juku. \nTakasugi Shinsaku, Yoshida Toshimaro, and Kusaka Genzui are the \nexcellent students to whom Yoshida Shoin was looking forward to the \nfuture. \nMoreover, the first Prime Minister&#39;s Itou Hirofumi was the student \nhere. \nAnd Katsura Kogorou was the student of Shoin and was also a friend.\n\nChoshuu had a grudge against the Tokugawa government from Sekigahara \nwar (A.D.1600). \nThey were deceived by Tokugawa and lost many territories. \n(The Mouri family who is the daimyo of Chosyuu held the ceremony of \na curse secretly to Tokugawa on January 1 every year.) \nHowever, I think that the reason in which the students of Shoukason-\njuku hated Tokugawa is that the Tokugawa government executed Shoin \nfor the unreasonable reason. \n\n\n\n&gt;(ano Takasugi wa chotto kakko yoku nai desu ^^;;;)\n\nTakasugi Shinsaku is not handsome.^^;;; \n\nhttp://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/bakumatu/shinsaku.html\n(This is a famous photograph.) \n\nHis face was very long. \nWhen he rode on a horse and walked along a town, people teased him, \nsaying &quot;He is wearing the face of a horse rather than the horse.&quot; \nHowever, he was liked very much by women^_^\n\nBy the way, don&#39;t you know the present appearance of Takasugi house? \nI looked at the news to which that is closed several months ago. \n(The posterity of Takasugi had answered that it became impossible to \npreserve it.) \n\n\n&gt;And last, but not least, read &quot;Dandara&quot;, by Akana Shu.\n&gt;Liked very much the drawing. Quite cool.\n\nAkana Shu is famous as the author of Anime &quot;YUGO&quot;.\nAlthough I counted on &quot;Dandara&quot; very much, it is interrupted now. \n\n(Totemo zannen desu.)-_-\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
