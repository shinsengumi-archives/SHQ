Many major Choshu and Satsuma\nfamilies=\r\n survived in the elite political groups *after* WW2.  It&#39;s\nvery interesting=\r\n how everything worked out due to careful reinvention\nand &quot;relabelling&quot;.\n\nN=\r\never ever read Japanese history of any era and take labels like\n&quot;liberal&quot; a=\r\nnd &quot;progressive&quot; at face value.  Those terms have to be\ncomprehended within=\r\n the context of the specific era and studied carefully.\n\nLiberal Democratic=\r\n Party (LDP) in Japan has a history of conservatism!   \n\nOne wonders if Asi=\r\nan politicians pick certain labels or keywords which\ntranslate well into En=\r\nglish to fool outsiders.  You can find many\nexamples in Meiji politics.  LD=\r\nP was founded post occupation era but\nyou can see how good it sounds if the=\r\n terms are used to keep the\nAmerican media happy. LDP&#39;s job was to smash th=\r\ne socialists just as\nthe fascistic pre-war gov. oppressed (often using dead=\r\nly force) the\nsocialists.\n\nErroneous labels applied to the kangun leaders w=\r\nho monopolized Meiji\nEra politics have prevented students and enthusiasts f=\r\nrom\nunderstanding the complexity of 1868.  People say &quot;OMG so and so\nclaime=\r\nd to want democracy in the Meiji Era---well by golly they\nmust&#39;ve been figh=\r\nting for that in 1868&quot;.  And it&#39;s false.\n\nWhat&#39;s written in the media and E=\r\nNGLISH, whether it be on the net or\nin dusty history books can be very misl=\r\neading.\n\nOkay done with being off-topic nowz.\n\n\n\n"
