I&#39;m not sure \n&gt; how many episodes it is but so far I think they will show three on \n&gt; WTTW Chicago on May 26 8PM. You&#39;ll have to check your own listings \n&gt; though...\n&gt; \n&gt; They also have a nicely done website tacking the subject divided \n&gt; into &quot;Enter Edo&quot;, &quot;Travel Tokaido&quot; and a timeline... Good if you&#39;re \n&gt; like me who needed a crash course.... ^_^\n&gt; Here&#39;s the link:  http://www.pbs.org/empires/japan/index.html\n\n\n"
