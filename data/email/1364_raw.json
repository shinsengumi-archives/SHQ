A terrorist group \nhijacks an Aegis warship of Japanese Self Defence Forces, and SDF&#39;s \nmembers fight against the terrorists. The original story swept lots of \nliterary awards in 1999-2000 in Japan. SDF will provide a full support \nfor this movie. In addition to Sanada-san, Koichi Sato (&quot;The Spiral - \nRasen&quot;) and Kiichi Nakai (Japan Academy Award winner this year for &quot;Mibu \nGishiden&quot;) are also playing. These three heartthrobs are long-time good \nfriends, and so there won&#39;t be any problem of chemistry!! &quot;&gt;&gt;\n\nOkay so they really should rewrite it to say two heartthrobs and one \nsemi-dweeb :-)\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
