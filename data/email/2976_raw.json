We feel that the followin=\r\ng bio will be of \ngreat interest in showing an unknown dimension of Shinsen=\r\ngumi \ndemographics and &quot;what happened&quot; to the survivors.\n\nThe article was w=\r\nritten mostly by HIrotada Tokugawa and with the \nassistance of secretarytoc=\r\napt3\n\nSome of you may be familiar with Saitou Hajime&#39;s wife, Takagi Tokio. =\r\n\nTokio was the daughter of a senior retainer in the service of Lord \nMatsud=\r\naira Katamori of Aizu, who was Shinsengumi&#39;s Shogunate-\nappointed patron an=\r\nd supervisor. \n\nThe following biography is of another Takagi who entered th=\r\ne \nShinsengumi.  At this time we cannot prove a family relationship \nbetwee=\r\nn this Takagi and Takagi Tokio.  Due to the complex family \nrelations of th=\r\nese samurai bloodlines, there is no way to determine \nif there is a connect=\r\nion to the Takagi family of Aizu which was \nposted in Edo (Tokio&#39;s family) =\r\nand this Takagi.\n\nTakagi Teisaku was a retainer of Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s br=\r\nother, \nMatsudaira Sadaaki. While Matsudaira Katamori was the Kyoto \nShugos=\r\nhoku, Matsudaira Sadaaki was the Kyoto Shoshidai.  \n\nSadaaki, as lord of th=\r\ne Kuwana domain, had many capable retainers in \nKyoto, just as his brother =\r\ndid. One of them was Takagi Teisaku. Born \nin Kuwana in 1848, he came from =\r\ngood background-- he was a cousin \nboth to senior councilor Sakai Magohachi=\r\nro, as well as assistant \nsenior councilor Hattori Hanzo (descendant of the=\r\n famous ninja \nleader). \n\nIn 1868, following the battle of Toba-Fushimi, Sa=\r\ndaaki ordered \nTeisaku, then 21 years old, to accompany fellow Kuwana retai=\r\nner \nYamawaki Hayatarou to assassinate Yoshimura Gonzaemon, the senior \ncou=\r\nncilor who had taken residence in Kuwana&#39;s detached territory in \nEchigo Pr=\r\novince and had pledged loyalty to the Satsuma-Choshu army \nwhich now called=\r\n itself the Imperial Army and labeled their \nopposition as enemies of the t=\r\nhrone. \n\nThe two men succeeded in their deadly goal, and then joined the \nf=\r\normer Shogunate&#39;s Shouhoutai, heading northward to Aizu-Wakamatsu, \nwhere t=\r\nhey joined the remainder of the Kuwana force, which had \ngathered there. To=\r\ngether with the Kuwana force, they fought their \nnorthward, surrendering in=\r\n Shomai. However, faced with reprisal at \nthe hands of the Yoshimura family=\r\n were they to return to Kuwana, they \nheaded northward, where they joined S=\r\nadaaki in Hakodate. \n\nThe two of them joined Shinsengumi there, and served =\r\nunder Hijikata \nToshizo. Therefore, Takagi Teisaku&#39;s story demonstrates how=\r\n the \nterm &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; although specific to Kyoto, (note that the \nShinse=\r\nngumi changed their name later) may encompass the KYoto period \nand even up=\r\n until 1869 Hakodate.\n\nSurviving the defeat, Teisaku was taken to Tokyo, wh=\r\nere he was \nimprisoned until 1872, however, in order to avoid responsibilit=\r\ny for \nthe murder of Yoshimura, he again fled, this time to America. \nStudy=\r\ning business in New York under William C. Whitney [1], he \nreturned in 1875=\r\n. \n\nIn a rather interesting turn of events, this man, a former assassin \nan=\r\nd Shinsengumi officer, became a professor of business and economics \nat Hit=\r\notsubashi University [2], which he helped to found. He was also \na colleagu=\r\ne of Tsuda Sen [3], who was associated with former Aizu \nretainers such as =\r\nYamakawa Kenjiro [4] and Takamine Hideo [5].\n\nSupplementary Info:\n[1] Willi=\r\nam Cogswell Whitney (1825-1882) ideas were transplanted to \nJapan via Takag=\r\ni.  The following books illustrate Whitney&#39;s influence:\n\nWilliam C. Whitney=\r\n and his influence on the early development of \nbookkeeping in Japan / Koji=\r\nro Nishikawa1959 English Book 17 p.

Kawasaki : \nShibusawa\n\n=\r\n[2] Hitotsubashi University http://www.hit-\nu.ac.jp/EnglishVersion/english/=\r\n\n\nHitotsubashi is also the name of the branch of the Tokugawa house \nwhich =\r\nYoshinobu headed, and in order to differentiate him from other \nbranches of=\r\n the Tokugawa house, he was often called &quot;Hitotsubashi \nYoshinobu&quot; or &quot;Hito=\r\ntsubashi Keiki&quot;.\n\nHitotsubashi was an area in Tokyo which became a hub for =\r\neducation.  \nEven Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School was located in Hitotsubashi i=\r\nn the \n1880s.  Many Meiji educators belonged to clubs and organizations, on=\r\ne \nof which was called the &quot;Hitotsubashi Group&quot;\n\nThe University went throug=\r\nh a series of phases and names (like many \npublic and private schools in th=\r\ne Meiji era)  &quot;Tokyo Shogyo Gakko \n(Tokyo Commercial School) in 1884; as th=\r\ne Tokyo Koto Shogyo GAkko \n(Tokyo Higher Commercial School) in 1885; as the=\r\n Tokyo Shoka Daigaku \n(Tokyo Commercial University) in 1920 and as Hitotsub=\r\nashi University \nin 1949.&quot; (Hall 256)  Ultimately, Mori Arinori, Meiji Japa=\r\nn&#39;s most \nhigh profile Minister of Education is still looked upon &quot;as the \n=\r\noriginal founder of [this] school.&quot; (Hall 256)\n\n[3] Tsuda Sen may best be k=\r\nnown through his daughter, Tsuda Ume, a \ninfluential female Christian educa=\r\ntor during the Meiji Era.  She was \na lifelong friend of Aizu&#39;s Yamakawa Su=\r\ntematsu (later known as the \nMarchioness Oyama) and younger sister of Yamak=\r\nawa Kenjiro.  Tsuda Ume \nwas also a friend and  co-worker, briefly, of Taka=\r\nmine Hideo who also \nsent her to Oswego Normal School in New York State.\n\n[=\r\n4] Yamakawa Kenjiro was the younger brother of Yamakawa Hiroshi.  \nKenjiro =\r\nwas a graduate of Yale University, physicist and President of \nTokyo Imperi=\r\nal University.  He was also a close friend of the Fujita \nfamily and it was=\r\n Kenjiro who left us anecdotal stories of Fujita \nGoro.  Kenjiro also wrote=\r\n Aizu Boshin Senshi an important work \naddressing the domain&#39;s role in the =\r\nBoshin war. \nWe first learned of this mysterious member of the Shinsengumi =\r\nfrom a \nfan page devoted to Yamakawa Kenjiro!  \nhttp://fukushima.cool.ne.jp=\r\n/ykcome/index.htm  \nalthough it is not clear how Takagi Teisaku was connect=\r\ned to Yamakawa \nKenjiro.http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\n\n[5=\r\n] Takamine Hideo  http://www.TakamineHideo.net\nFamily friend and co-worker =\r\nof both Mr. and Mrs. Fujita.  He was \nTokio&#39;s cousin.  Takamine was the dir=\r\nector of the Tokyo Normal \nSchool, Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal school which later =\r\nbecame the Tokyo \nHigher Women&#39;s Normal School.   Takamine and his close st=\r\nudents had \nmany connections to the Hitotsubashi group and a related \npubli=\r\ncation.  As a very young man, he was the page of Matsudaira \nKatamori, the =\r\ndaimyo of Aizu.\n\nSomething to think about=85\nHow does both Yamakawa Kenjiro=\r\n and Takamine Hideo, both of whom knew \nFujita Goro&#39;s Shinsengumi career *n=\r\not* mention yet another member of \nthe Shinsengumi, Takagi Teisaku, to thei=\r\nr friend Goro=85\n\nWithout understanding these complex Aizu connections with=\r\n the Fujita \nfamily we simply would not have found this fascinating member =\r\nof the \nShinsengumi, Takagi Teisaku.\n\nSources:\nHall, Ivan Parker.
