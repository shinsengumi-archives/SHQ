Later \nbecame a captain in the Shinch=\r\nogumi.\n&gt; \n\n\nI have *so* many questions right now, but I&#39;ll keep it to just =\r\na \nfew at a time.  Why would Rintaro be adopted into the Okita family? \nIf =\r\nKatsujiro died in 1845, and Rintaro married in 1846, was this \narranged in =\r\nadvance by Katsujiro - or someone else?  If Katsujiro \nwas ill and knew he =\r\nwas going to die, would it have been the normal \nthing to do in adopting an=\r\n heir because Souji was so young?  Did \nthat make Rintaro head of the Okita=\r\n family?  What if Souji had not\ndied so young? Could an adopted heir displa=\r\nce a blood heir?  And, \nwhere does &quot;Fujiwara&quot; in Rintaro&#39;s adopted name com=\r\ne from?  Perhaps \nsomeone wouldn&#39;t mind giving a quick history lesson on ad=\r\nopting \nheirs?\n\nAnd...about the adoption situation presented in NHK with Sh=\r\nuhei - If \nKondo was going to name Souji his successor as the Tennen Rishin=\r\n\nmaster, why wouldn&#39;t he also make him the Kondo family heir?  I had \nassum=\r\ned it was because he was already the Okita family heir. Is this \na case of =\r\nmixing historical accuracy and taking historical liberties?\n\nI hope I made =\r\nat least a little sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
