(I&#39;m not mad)\n...I&#39;m disappointed in you...LOL\n\nO.K. from the Japanese sites out there (yes I know they are all based\non the same books and stuff) they indicate he was more of an\nadministrator...paper pusher, number crunching, traffic directing guy\n(when it rains---much to the glee of his female fans by the way).\n\nTokio on the other hand was a dorm inspector and teacher which made\nsense when you take her more &quot;upper class&quot; background into\nconsideration.  Weren&#39;t you the one who shed some light on the school\nthat it was an all girl&#39;s education school (school for teachers?).\n\nThe school was close to home and I speculate that Tokio wanted to keep\nhim working rather than staying at home.  #1 killer of retirees is\nboredom:)\n\nCool site by the way. \n\nI don&#39;t think he taught the students directly.
