It led to a three hour debate with my advisor\n about what might =\r\nhave happened if the plot had NOT been discovered\nand Kyoto had burned (or =\r\nany other of the proposed aspects of the plot\nhad  occured). It&#39;s been deba=\r\nted that the destruction of Kyoto would\nhave had a similarly catalyzing eff=\r\nect on the pro-Bakufu\nfactions...Which led to a discussion of the Social At=\r\nmosphere in\nKyoto. Ain&#39;t history grand?\n\nI think we&#39;ve nailed down a focus =\r\nfor my preparatory thesis -- the \nCultural and Sociological Foundation of t=\r\nhe Shinsengumi with emphasis\non their violence and sociological evolution. =\r\n I think -- Mind, I say\nI THINK -- that most of the moronic ideas thrown ar=\r\nound my department\nregarding military corps and their movtivations arise fr=\r\nom on overly\npoliticized point of view.  My colleagues fail to recognize th=\r\nat these\nwere INDIVIDUALS making decisions based on their beliefs and past\n=\r\nexperiences. They overemphasize political events without considering\nthe so=\r\ncial atmosphere (for one thing, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to\nignore the poten=\r\ntial impact being raised in a region plagued by\nbanditry had on a young Kon=\r\ndo and his fellows). \nAnyway! I think I&#39;m trying to construct an academical=\r\nly supported\nthesis which puts their &quot;violence and zealotry&quot; (as a very lou=\r\ndmouthed\nfellow put it yesterday) in context -- not just the political cont=\r\next,\nbut how these men INTERPRETED that political context -- and how their\n=\r\nlives and experiences influenced that interpretation. Every history\nI&#39;ve re=\r\nad is either political or biographic or economic (with the\nexception of Hil=\r\nlsborough, who is either loved or vilified by anyone I\nask). Someone needs =\r\nto look at the organic evolution of the corps.\n\nWhew! \n\nI&#39;ll post my inital=\r\n research subjects in a separate post after this\none. Thanks!\n\n\n--- In SHQ@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Mio Yamada &lt;purplealienmio@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; *Lurks from out=\r\n of the shadows* \n&gt; \n&gt; I may be wrong (as I have often been), but the\n&gt; rea=\r\nsoning that the Ikeda-ya Affair delayed the\n&gt; eventual Meiji Restoration ha=\r\ns been explained thus: \n&gt; \n&gt; The Ikeda-ya Affair triggered the Choshu&#39;s Mar=\r\nch on\n&gt; Kyoto (or officially Kinmon-no-Hen), as vastly\n&gt; exaggerated accoun=\r\nts of how many, many, many Choshu\n&gt; men had been massacred reached the prov=\r\nince, which\n&gt; prompted them to take up arms. \n&gt; Then, their almost absolute=\r\n defeat at Kinmon-no-Hen\n&gt; undermined Choshu - militarily, politically and\n=\r\n&gt; economically. Based on this, people have reasoned that\n&gt; had it not been =\r\nfor Kinmon-no-Hen (for which Ikeda-ya\n&gt; has been credited as one of the dir=\r\nect causes), Choshu\n&gt; would have risen up earlier. \n&gt; \n&gt; There is also the =\r\nnotion that Ikeda-ya (or\n&gt; Kinmon-no-Hen rather) actually speeded up the\n&gt; =\r\nBakumatsu: had it not been such a catalyst for Choshu\n&gt; to take action, the=\r\nn their rebellious politics might\n&gt; have festered for much longer before co=\r\nming to the\n&gt; boil. \n&gt; \n&gt; Either way, it was a matter of a few years earlie=\r\nr or\n&gt; a few years later.
