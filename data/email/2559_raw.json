Which include:\n1) Shinsengumi parades/cosplay\n2) &quot;Who wants to be SAitou contest&quot; (no detail on how to win this contest)\n* The event will have Shinsengumi club members from all over Japan in\nattendance and ofcourse the Aizu chapter will be doing alot of the work\n\nIt is not clear which photograph, or if these are *new* photos. \nPerhaps it is the photo printed in a magazine earlier this year of a\nvery old Fujita Goro at Tsuyoshi&#39;s (second son) wedding/engagement.\n---------------------------------------------\nGoro&#39;s time at Aomori (Northern Japan) after the defeat of the Aizu\ndomain still remains a mystery.  To read the sketchy details we have\nand see a timeline go to the &quot;FILES&quot; section and open the &quot;SAitou&quot;\nfolder.  All we know is that he and his first wife Yaso lived in two\nhouseholds: The Kurasawa family and another family.\n\nThe Kurasawa home and the area in Aomori where many Aizu immigrants\nlived is explored at this webpage\nhttp://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/\nThere is 2 pages of info and photos specifically on Saitou here:\nhttp://www16.plala.or.jp/fusigitabi/saitou.html (scroll to bottom to\ngo to the 2nd page)\n\nThe Kurasawa family is related to Takagi Tokio.\nTokio was adopted into the Kurasawa family!  The very high possibility\nremains that Mr. Fujita met Tokio while still married to Yaso.\nBut why was Tokio adopted---her own father was a senior inspector for\nAizu.\nThe answer seems to have been posted here:\nhttp://8907.teacup.com/yazikita/bbs\nAgain, no text is cited so we don&#39;t know where the info is coming from\nbut it seems that both of Tokio&#39;s parents &quot;died of illness&quot;, leaving\nher without an older male relative to protect her or her younger\nbrother Goro (later known as Takagi Morinusuke).\n---------------------------------------------\nI have been told by one of volunteer translators that Takagi\nMorinusuke, later a Public Prosecutor or Chief Prosecutor should be\nvery &quot;researchable&quot; as he handled many important cases at Fukushima\nand Hakodate.  He was famous and would&#39;ve appeared in Meiji Era\nnewspapers.  Unfortunately many newspapers during the Meiji era are\nnot digitalized---you cannot &quot;search&quot; for names---you have to manually\nsearch page by page in newspapers or try to find a specific case\nMorinusuke prosecuted and &quot;follow along&quot;. \n\nWhy would Takagi Morinusuke be possibly important in terms of Fujita\nGoro&#39;s biography?  We know that his sons studied kenjutsu with Uncle\nGoro---clearly he was close with the Takagi family. If his sons wrote\ndown anecdotal stories about their studies with Uncle Goro---then you\nhave some valuable information.\n---------------------------------------------\nTokio&#39;s Bio *before* 1868\nThis is based on a question and speculation by a Japanese fan (however\nthe reasoning is very sound).\n&quot;If the Takagi family was based in Edo---wouldn&#39;t Tokio have been\nraised in the Matsudaira household?  More specifically the official\nAizu mansion in Edo?&quot;\nThe poster, who seems to have an outstanding command of historical\nminutia, is giving information which corroborates with the biography\nof Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s own granddaughter (Princess Chichibu).  That\nis the children of retainers are raised in the household of the\ndaimyo, in fact children of SERVANTS were also raised in a similar\nfashion.  All of this makes sense.  Young Sada, Tokio, would need the\neducation and familiarity with etiquette needed to later work with\nTeruhime.\n---------------------------------------------\nSeveral months ago, many TV stations aired a documentary on Nagakura\nShinpachi made by one of his descendants in the media industry.\nThis documentary recently won or atleast was nominated for a\nprestigious award.\n---------------------------------------------\nComing Soon to SHQ.com....\nAn info sheet on Shimada Kai !\n\n\n\n\n"
