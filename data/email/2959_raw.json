All the\nfacts to prove this comes from studies on rural peasant co=\r\nmmunities in\nEdo---even more specifically TAma/Hino regions! (this may poin=\r\nt to how\nsome of the top members of the Shinsengumi grew up with the\n&quot;possi=\r\nbility&quot; that they too could be samurai).\n\nHowever in the &quot;formal&quot; or admini=\r\nstrative world of the bakufu the same\nstrict protocol on social class was s=\r\ntill observed. It was the\ninflexibility of the bakufu in certain areas of i=\r\nts system which made\nit weak. Note, the bakufu was making several changes d=\r\nuring that era too.\n\nI&#39;m really interested in how the Shinsengumi and Kihei=\r\ntai (Choshu)\nshared something similar---[[[mixed social classes]]].\n\nSometh=\r\ning which has bothered me about resaerch into this era is that\nseveral book=\r\ns written by western writers say somthing along the lines\n&quot;the Choshu Kihei=\r\ntai {Takasugi&#39;s Strange/Surprise, Irregular or\nextraordinary Corps} demonst=\r\nrated that they were willing to admit\ncommoners into the military role of t=\r\nhe samurai and their use of\nwestern technology showed how forward thinking =\r\nthey were&quot;.  \n\nDuring the Meiji Era, westerners who just entered into the n=\r\now\nenlightened Japan (according to their measurement of what was modern),\ns=\r\naw the Kiheitai as the exact opposite of the bakufu military force. \nTo the=\r\n westerners, the Kiheitai were the essence of the revolution.  \n\nSimply, th=\r\ney were defined as being the common man who rose up against\nthe system.\n\nWi=\r\nthout looking ***deeper they interpreted the detail as an attempt to\nstart =\r\nan egalitarian military movement and the Kiheitai was viewed as\na precursor=\r\n to universal conscription (thanks to fellow Choshu samurai\nYamagata Aritom=\r\no during the Meiji). Basically, the west wanted to see\nin Japan the same va=\r\nlues they treasured---universal ideals, however\nthey disregarded key detail=\r\ns.\n\nThey overlooked how the bakufu was already incorporating French\ntrainin=\r\ng into their ranks (since they measure progress/modernity with\nwho has bett=\r\ner weapons of mass destruction).  \n\nFurthermore, \n\nThe Kiheitai commoners\n1=\r\n) had to dress differently\n2) were treated differently (however they had to=\r\n still act under\nsamurai rules)\n3) their leaders were lower ranking samurai=\r\n\n4) only at most 40% (or even less than that) of the 292 Kiheitai\nmembers a=\r\ns of 1864 were were actually peasants &quot;which makes it\ndifficult to call the=\r\n Kiheitai a peasant unit&quot; (Hackett 26)\n5) they were supported financially b=\r\ny the Choshu domain --however-- \n&quot;merchants and farmers were also permitted=\r\n to join---and used funds\nsupplied by merchants for part of its expense&quot; (H=\r\nackett 25)---in fact\nTakasugji mentioned a wealthy merchant, Yamashita Shis=\r\nhinojo of Gofuku\nvillage &quot;as a possible source of financial support&quot; (Hacke=\r\ntt 25).\n\n-If- the Kiheitai *did not take money from commoners, would they s=\r\ntill\nfeel obligated to take in those from the lower classes? Remember,\nKond=\r\no and Hijikata had rich elite peasants buddies (one was a sworn\nbrother of =\r\nKondo) who also gave them gifts too.  \nSee\nThe Farmers of Edo and the Warri=\r\nors in Kyoto\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm\n\nSo I guess, I m=\r\neandered off topic to compare the Shinsengumi mixed\nsocial classes with tha=\r\nt of the Kiheitai.  \n\nI ask, if the researchers from the west see the Kihei=\r\ntai as a sure\nsign of &quot;social progress&quot; how come they never took the same i=\r\ndea and\nlooked at the bakufu&#39;s guys...namely the Shinsengumi. So they shoul=\r\nd\nanalyze the Shinsengumi the same way too, did they make members from\nthe =\r\nlow class dress different, act different and so forth?\n\nOr have they missed=\r\n the obvious:  The bottom line---It wasn&#39;t about\n&quot;equality&quot; it was about ge=\r\ntting guys to fight/die for them.\n\nWhenever possible, higher ups had no pro=\r\nblem with exploiting people\nwho bought into social stratification (remember=\r\n 99.9% of people were\nraised in the system) and wanted to climb the ladder =\r\nto make a better\nfuture for themselves.\n\nSource\nHackett, Roger F.
