Thank you \nfor \n&gt;   telling me about this list, and welcome to Saitoh fandom.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Sith\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Firuze&quot; &lt;firuzekhanume2002@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Hi...\n&gt;   &gt; I suppose it&#39;s time to introduce myself... *fidgets slightly*\n&gt;   &gt; By now, some of you already know that all time RK favorite \ncharacter \n&gt;   is Enishi, and might wonder what I&#39;m doing here. Hell, I even feel \n&gt;   myself like some kind of intruder... However, I think it&#39;s not \nexactly \n&gt;   a mystery that my second favorite character in the series is \nSaitou, \n&gt;   and that&#39;s why I tend to give him an important role in my fics. \nSo, \n&gt;   well, I find tempting any place where I can find interesting \n&gt;   information  as well as to hear interesting discussions about him, \nhis \n&gt;   past and the Shinsengumi. So here I&#39;m. \n&gt;   &gt; Yet, there is a second reason, since I am in love with PMK \nseries. \n&gt;   The guilty party here is composed by Barbara Sheridan and Miss \nBehavin \n&gt;   *points at both* and their deliciously funny Mibu Times/Dispatch. \nI \n&gt;   found that to understand certain jokes I had to know about PMK, so \nI \n&gt;   decided to download several episodes. Since then, I&#39;m lost in \n&gt;   addiction. *wails*\n&gt;   &gt; A wave of sadness enveloped me over the past weekend, after I \nsaw \n&gt;   episode 23, since it announced that next one would be the ending. \nIs \n&gt;   there any news on any kind of continuation? Is there any place \nwhere I \n&gt;   can read/download scanlations/translations of the manga? I live \nwhere \n&gt;   the world ends, in deep South America, so you can imagine, no \ndreams \n&gt;   of getting any copy of the manga at all for a very long time. Any \ninfo \n&gt;   will be deeply appreciated.\n&gt;   &gt; Firuze\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   visit \n&gt; \n&gt;   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n&gt; \n&gt;   our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
