I was just wondering if anyone knew what the different \ncolors of the Shinsengumi uniform meant? I know that there&#39;s the \nstandard blue one, but I&#39;ve also seen a black one and a white one.\nAs far as the black ones go, I think that&#39;s just dramatic effect for movies. \nGohatto and Mibu Gishi-Den both have them in black, but that wasn&#39;t a real \nuniform. People in the film industry seem to think the real blue and white \nuniforms aren&#39;t eye-catching enough, which is all they&#39;re worried about. \n\nThe standard blue and white uniform is a copy of the uniform of the 47 ronin, \nwhom the Shinsengumi admired. It had the exact same strips on the sleeves and \nhem, but the color of their uniform was black (I think). The white strips are \nsupposed to allow for easy recognition of an ally during a sword fight, when \nthing could get pretty hectic. &quot;In a real sword fight you don&#39;t have time to \nthink,&quot; as Saito Hajime put it.  The light blue color was supposed to be the \ncolor that shows a samurai&#39;s resolve.\n\nAs far as the white one with the black triangles on the sleeves, that was \nsupposed to be the uniform of the leader of the group. (Or leaders. Shinsengumi \nKeppuroku and the NHK Shinsengumi drama both have only Kondo wearing it, but \nHijikata is wearing this version in PMK as well.) So basically it was a reversal \nof the colors the 47 ronin wore. \n\n-MissB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
