Great-grandfather- Kan&#39;emon- died Bunsei 2 (1819)\n2. Grandfather- Sanshiro- died Tenpo 4 (1833)\n3. Father- Katsujiro- Koka 2 (1845)\n\nIt&#39;s not doubted that Katsujiro was his real father, but there&#39;s still the \nrecord of &quot;2nd son of Okita Rintaro&quot; to deal with. The Hino Sato family \n(Hijikata Toshizo&#39;s brother in law Hikogoro) also records Soji as being \nOkita Rintaro Mototsune&#39;s youngest son. According to the &quot;Okita-ke Bunsho&quot; \n(Okita Family Record), however, lists Rintaro Mototsune as being Mitsu&#39;s \nhusband, so it&#39;s impossible that he was Soji&#39;s father.\n\nHowever, if the death record is correct, then we must conclude that Soji&#39;s \nfather was *another* Rintaro. But that complicates things. After all, \nRintaro was adopted as the successor, and thus became Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;son&quot;\n\nIn May of Bunkyu 3 (1863), when Rintaro entered Shinchogumi, he denoted his \nfather as &quot;the late Okita Katsujiro, retainer of Lord Abe Noto no Kami,&quot; and \nagain, describing himself in Keio 1 (1865), as &quot;son of Okita Katsujiro, \nretainer of Lord Abe Noto no Kami&quot; and again, in official documents of Meiji \n4 and 5, before the prefectures were organized into their present form, as \n&quot;Eldest son of Okita Rintaro, former samurai of Nihonmatsu Prefecture, in \nOushuu.&quot; That being the case, it is impossible that Rintaro was Soji&#39;s real \nfather. At the same time of Rintaro&#39;s last description of himself (the Meiji \n4/5 one), Mitsu was listed in the same document as &quot;Eldest daughter of \nKondou Shuusuke of Tokyo&quot;\n\nIn Meiji 7, the Okita family records list her the same way. Her son \nYoshijiro mentions her the same way-- &quot;Eldest daughter of Kondou Touzou of \nNorth Tama county, Ozawa Village.&quot; Mitsu&#39;s true origin as a daughter of \nOkita Katsujiro and her even having been born into the Okita family are thus \nhidden. Why is that?\n\nThe reason is: A man by the name of Chiba Yaichiro entered Shinchogumi in \nKeio 2 (1866). In his record, &quot;Shinchogumi to Shonai-han&quot; (Shinchogumi and \nthe Shonai domain), he lists Rintaro as &quot;the birth brother of Okita Soji.&quot; \nRintaro, it seems, told everyone he was Soji&#39;s blood brother, and in order \nto hide this, he listed Mitsu as the daughter of the Kondou family. With her \norigin thus concealed, even her son Yoshijiro didn&#39;t know her true origin.\n\nTHUS, with Rintaro selling himself as Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;eldest son,&quot; that makes \nSoji the &quot;second son&quot; of Katsujiro. With such confusion with the family \nrecords, whoever took down the listing for Soji&#39;s lineage in the death \nrecord was obviously confused, and ended up making Soji the &quot;2nd son of \nOkita Rintaro&quot;\n\nIn Tenpo 2 (1831), Katsujiro is listed in Shirakawa-Abe clan documents:\n\n&quot;Stipend of 22 hyo and 2 retainer allotments. Succeeded on Tenpo 2, July 22. \nSamurai of Tomobe Jiemon&#39;s unit, Okita Katsujiro.&quot;\n\nPeople who drew such low stipends, also amongst the Tokugawa shogunate&#39;s \ngokenin (lower retainers), were &quot;common.&quot; As a result, Rintaro and Soji, in \nthe Shinchogumi and Shinsengumi respectively, coming from such a background, \nwere truly &#39;creating a new heaven and earth&#39;.\n\n\n\n"
