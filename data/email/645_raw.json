Unfortunately, Black Faery never got my &quot;HELP&quot; email, \nbut she&#39;s come through for us after I resent the info to her last \nnight.  She sent me two screenshots, which I&#39;ve put in the Photos \nsection in a folder titled &quot;Saitou in Disguise.&quot;  I don&#39;t think MissB \nor I are crazy --- that&#39;s got to be Saitou! (Keep in mind that in the \nanime, when Saitou and Kenshin meet again after 10 years at Kaoru&#39;s \ndojo, Saitou makes a comment about how Kenshin let a fool like \nRaijuta wound him in battle... hinting at maybe he was there to see \nthe fight.)  What do the rest of you think, hmmm?\n\nI&#39;m going to put the screenshots up on my shrine site (Let&#39;s Hear It \nFor the Boy!) and will post a link to them on shinsengumimb.com.  \nGive me a couple days, though, okay?  :-D\n\nphil (spying on the spies... what fun!)\n\n\n"
