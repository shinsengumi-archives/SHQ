However, it should be remembered that \nthere was a calender change a couple years later, so all dates are \nactually off from what they should be by about a month. That&#39;s why it \ncan get so confusing. Some sites will show the &quot;corrected&quot; date, \nwhile others will show the date as it was at the time of the \nincident.  \n\nHm, I don&#39;t have anything to confirm this by right off hand, but I \nthink the anniversary of Hijikata&#39;s death is just around the corner \non May 11th. &gt;_&lt; I&#39;d better hear some nice words for my Hijikata-sama!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
