I find the characterizations of the Shinsengumi and the Ishin to be inspired, although not exactly serious.  The names aren&#39;t quite the same, but you&#39;ll easily recognize Kondou, Hijikata, Okita, Yamazaki and from the Ishin: Sakamoto, Katsura and Takasugi.\n\nThis is the only English fansite that I am aware of at the moment: http://www.yorozuya.cjb.net/ \n\nYes there are (were) scanslations, but I suspect these will be yanked out of deference to Viz.  \n\n-S\n\n\n\n\nred-bird.org  | s-girl.deviantart.com \n\n\n\n\n\n"
