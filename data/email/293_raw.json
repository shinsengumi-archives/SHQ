Then how come Yoshida \nsays &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about&quot; to Tetsu at Ikedaya?  \n\nI enjoyed the Yamazaki Susumu/Ayunee &quot;switch&quot; very much...very cool.\nYamazaki Susumu and S.H. are my absolute favorites however S.H. is \nstill a very underdeveloped character grrrrr.  S.H. is always \nalone...couldn&#39;t they make him hangout with the guys just once in ep. 24 \nduring the fireworks?  He was just walking like that:(\n\nThere is alot of potential in the series but it would be totally flaky if Suzu \ngoes crazy and that would be his only motivation...which is sadly where \nthe series is heading with him carrying around Yoshida&#39;s head and \nstuff.  I never understood the Suzu and Yoshida bond...like big deal \nYoshida comforted Suzu on the beach and encouraged Suzu to seek \nrevenge but it&#39;s still sooo shallow.\n\n\n\n\n"
