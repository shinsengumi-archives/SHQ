This really does help out a -lot-. I was stupefied \non \n&gt; how come I couldn&#39;t figure out anymore of her from the Taiga \ndrama. \n&gt; Now I know why.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes thank you for discussing the grandmother&#39;s death and \n&gt; Serizawa&#39;s participation. Perhaps this or you have discussed this \n&gt; before so please my apologies for the repeat (if any).\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a little disappointed.. Although probably not as disappointed \nas \n&gt; the person who I am working with.
