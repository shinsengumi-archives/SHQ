Did you read that somewhere? I would imagine that cutting all \n&gt; the way to the stomach&#39;s intestines would mean a more assured/faster \n&gt; way to die, wouldn&#39;t that be the preference or is it required that \n&gt; you be conscious for as long as possible when committing seppuku? \n&gt; Sounds harsh to me either way....\n&gt; \n&gt; Okita, as for falling backwards /forwards in the country where I came \n&gt; from (*wink*) the national hero (Jose Rizal) made it a point to be \n&gt; executed forwards by twisting himself as he got shot (indicating he \n&gt; is not a traitor) and to ensure he fell backwards towards the sky \n&gt; (another symbolism of his innocence and hopes for the future).
