It was the woman as =\r\n\nwhom the touch Japanese style Audrey Hepburn ? acted valiantly. Did \nit se=\r\nem to be being wise and the advanced one? Mr. Saito -- the \nEmpress -- a dr=\r\ness figure [ like ] -- admiring -- the time -- the \ntail -- &quot;-- make it Wes=\r\ntern style of dress -- is it having said in &quot; \netc. (*^_^*) . \n=82=C5=82=CD=\r\n=81B\nthen\n\nok so we know maybe he saw her 2-3 days before an important even=\r\nt of \nsome sort.  Menion of &quot;the time the tail&quot; which is, usually, nifty&#39;s =\r\n\nway of saying TOKIO.  This person probably wonders if she wore \nWestern we=\r\nar?  But I HIGHLY DOUBT IT because I think older women \nrarely chose to do =\r\nso.  Only the new generation, Emperor Meiji&#39;s \nQueen and what I call the Ya=\r\nmakawa/Oyama Sutematsu Generation \n(Rokumeikan circle) would have given wes=\r\ntern fashion a chance.  \nRemember, those dresses were not comfortable.  Ofc=\r\nourse all this \ninfo could be totally wrong if for some reason there was so=\r\nme kind \nof confusion between &quot;which&quot; Empress?  emperor Meiji&#39;s mother [or]=\r\n \nhis wife the queen who was considered by many to be a very \nprogressive w=\r\noman. \n \n------------------------------\noff-topic...there seems to be a ste=\r\nroid controversy in the world of \nbaseball right now...so I was thinking\n\nW=\r\nhat would PMK Harada think of all this?\n\nPMK Harada &quot;Steroids???? HA!&quot; (rip=\r\ns off shirt)\n&quot;check out these abs---100% Harada!  Harada never uses steroid=\r\ns!&quot;\n\nand that is an example of how my mind works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
