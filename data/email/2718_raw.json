The Shinsengumi/Edoji/& Spy division have a  an excellent home and message board going all thanks to the sweat and  blood of the presistant fans that keep the mailing lists going  strong.  My idea was, how &#39;bout we make a chatroom?    Maybe not on the actual site but on mIRC... Somewhere were we can all  meet and chit chat about everything and anything that comes to  mind.   It&#39;ll be a great way to get to know the memebers of  the 3 mailing lists.   What do you guys think?\n  \n  -Bunneh\n  \n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n \n What are the most popular cars? Find out at Yahoo!
