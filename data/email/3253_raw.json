I&#39;m al=\r\nso really fascinated with\nNagakura Shinpachi&#39;s journal, so I hope to transl=\r\nate some of that for\nthe future.&quot;\n\nThen you are gem!...do try to get the ch=\r\nance to translate Nagakura&#39;s\njournal...the new one (actually the older/orig=\r\ninal one...not the\nhistorically innaccurate one muddled by the newspaper)\n\n=\r\nYou know Kitsuno...we&#39;d buy your book if you could trans Nagakura&#39;s\njournal=\r\n. (^_^)....wanna make some money for the journal?  \n\nI think a couple hundr=\r\ned people here would buy a standard translated\nbio on OKITA :P (I&#39;m serious=\r\n)\n\nSInce you can translate 17th century text...Nagakura&#39;s journal should\nbe=\r\n a cinch for you to finish. \n\nWe really want a good scholar to give us the =\r\nfacts (or firsthand\naccounts) as opposed to Hillsborough&#39;s sad attempt at c=\r\nashing in on\nthe Shinsengumi---kind of scary that he seemed to not have tri=\r\ned to\nget the solid Japanese books on the era/Shinsengumi to use as\nreferen=\r\nces....\n-------------------------------------------\n\nKitsuno &quot;The main thin=\r\ng at the moment is to really get the word\nout about the journal and get the=\r\n submissions.&quot;\n\nyou need to contact:  \nUCLA, CORNELL, YALE, UPENN at Philad=\r\nelphia and \nUniversity of Georgia (just because the no nonsense Prof. Karl =\r\nFriday,\nthe true authority of samurai/bushido and spectacular academic and\n=\r\npractitioner of koryu---Kashima Shinryu teaches there still--I think).  \n\nT=\r\nhese schools are also considered to be major pillars in this\ndiscipline (as=\r\nide from the ones you listed). I know many professors\nmay not warm up to th=\r\nis idea right away...but you just need to get on\nthe departmental email lis=\r\nts and make one announcement...for\nstudents...because those universities ha=\r\nve libraries with TONS OF\nMATERIAL...they can help setup a network and even=\r\n provide resources to\nyour writers.  \n\nHeck, at UW MADISON we have tons of =\r\nworks from the Meiji, first\nprints, of books in English written in the spir=\r\nit of &quot;Orientalism&quot;\nalong the same vein as Hartshorne&#39;s work (I know she ha=\r\nd a very deep\nunderstanding of Japan having lived and worked there).\n\nI won=\r\nder if Cameron Hurst would write just a bit and help give advice\nto people =\r\ninterested in samurai studies...(note for shinsengumi\nfans...) Hurst is out=\r\nstanding. Author of a book worthy BUYING The\nArmed Martial Arts of Japan: S=\r\nwordsmanship and Archery. (Yale, 1998)\n\nand these people http://wason.libra=\r\nry.cornell.edu/CEAL/ who may have\nadvice on marketing this journal\n\n\n\n\n"
