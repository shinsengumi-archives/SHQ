(jumps up and down) Get this! On page 7 of the guidebook\nto the NHK series, I found a map of Kyoto with the different districts\nthat the different patrol groups ran, as of July 1866!!! I&#39;ve posted a\nsketch of it (I don&#39;t have access to a scanner right now) in the\nPhotos section!!!\n\nInteresting thing of note-- Shinsengumi didn&#39;t patrol a large area,\nbut they DID patrol the area around their HQ which included Shimabara\n(w/courtesans and all), which is on the left side of the map I posted,\nAND, they patrolled what I think is Gion (the geisha/teahouse\ndistrict), which is the one on the right side. Leave it to our guys to\nget all the babes....lol\n\n--M.\n\n\n"
