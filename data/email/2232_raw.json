The images are from &quot;Sagara Sozo to sono doshi ; Soma Daisaku to Tsugaru Tanomo&quot;  (translation?) written by the man who wrote the biography, Hasegawa Shin, and published by Kodansha (Tokyo).  Obviously, I don&#39;t know what all of them are and can only guess at a few (many probably being Hasegawa), so I don&#39;t know their relevance to Sagara & the Sekihoutai and bakumatsu/Meiji history.  If anyone who reads Japanese can clue me/us in...\n \nAgain, most images are huge, so the pages take time loading and I&#39;m still working with free space, so they could become unavailable (they&#39;ve just been uploaded so they *may* not be coming up right now).  Usually bandwidth is available again within the hour.  There are 4 pages with 5 images on each page.  Pages are linked.\n \nhttp://sozoko.tripod.com/hasegawa1988_1.htm\n \nAlso, I already had the pages up when Sec woke me up to it being a different book, so ignore headers and page titles.  I&#39;ll correct those at a later date.\n \nAND, even though today is March 3, according to Tama&#39;s handy-dandy lunar-solar calendar converter ( http://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv  --- Year, Month, Day in the boxes, then the two options below are solar/western to lunar at top, lunar to solar at bottom... thank you, Tama!) Sagara was executed on March 26, 1868, on western calendars.\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nCelebrate Yahoo!&#39;s 10th Birthday! \n Yahoo!
