I can just see some poor fool going out there and looking for that title.  :-D  If someone came up to me as a salesclerk in a video/anime store and gave me that title, I&#39;d never be able to stop laughing. Or imagine the poor person going to the R&#39;s and finding Rurouni Kenshin and standing there wondering if it&#39;s the same...\n&gt; \n&gt; Although, I guess the people who might be laughing hardest are kendo instructors who have people coming to them wanting \n&gt; to learn Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu or Gatotsu.  :-D\n&gt; \n&gt; phil\n\nLOL! That&#39;s funny! I wonder if the idiot who wrote the article was trying to use his spell checker to double-check the name? Mine always insist the name should be Reran Denshin!\n\nBut phil it might be funny the fist half a dozen times someone asks to learn the Gatotsu, but don&#39;t you think after a while they&#39;d just want to pull all their hair out? Sort of like the first few times you use the Babelfish are funny...\n\nWhile we&#39;re off topic anyway, Samurai Rebellion is about to come on the IFC channel at 8:00am ET. If you miss it, I believe it comes on again tomorrow morning at 6:00am ET.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
