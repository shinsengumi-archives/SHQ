The guys who fork \nhave the money usually know the least.  Probably explains why \neverything is a remake or a sequel.  There are a couple problems \nthough.  I don&#39;t think the American public would warm up to the \nShinsengumi like the Japanese do.  It&#39;s a part of their society, and \nwhat they feel are part of who they are.  The American audience, on \nthe other hand, view samurai only in the romantic/robotic \npersonality.  It&#39;s doubtful the mainstream will accept a &quot;down-and-\ndirty&quot; fighting unit like the Shinsengumi, portrayed with an eye for \naccuracy.  At least not pay to see it.\n\n&gt; 1) the lack of an Asian host/narrator who is \n&gt; a) famous b) speaks English\n\nRecommend Tamilyn Tomita.  Speaks excellent English, is Japanese, \nand HOT!!!  Kind of famous.\n\n\n&gt; So Shinsengumi had to be abandoned for Shogun&#39;s Swat Team or \njust &quot;Swat\n&gt; TEam&quot; and finally &quot;team&quot;.\n\nDid you try &quot;Wolves of Mibu&quot;?  That has a &quot;cool&quot; sound to it.  It&#39;s \ntoo bad it fell apart.  Have you considered something along the \nlines of the History Channel?  Not as mainstream, but they seemed to \nbe the type to jump all over something like this.\n\n\n\n\n"
