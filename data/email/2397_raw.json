This is especially for mailing list type groups\n devoted to specific areas. I belong and even own writing related\ngroups and many times there are topics and discussions I have no\ninterest in at that particular time so I pass over or ignore those\nsubjects.\n\n \n\nI would never think to tell the interested parties that &quot;no one else\ncares&quot; or is &quot;disgusted&quot; by the off topic chatter and that they should\nstop it because I don&#39;t like it. And yet that is what happened behind\nthe scenes here recently. &quot;Many&quot; anonymous members apparently too\ntimid to speak up allegedly contacted one member to be their\nspokesperson and present their concerns---they wanted non Shinsengumi\nspecific discussion to stop.\n\n \n\nThis led to self imposed silence from some of our more active members\nwhich was certainly not fair to them or to those of you who were\ninterested in some of the topics presented.\n\n \n\nWhen one member came out of their reluctant lurkdom to participate\nagain they felt they were demeaned in a subsequent post, replied and\nthen were publicly belittled in return. As a result as list owner I\nasked both parties to please cease and desist, one member apologized\non list  and the other. sent me a long scathing private email. As a\nresult I removed them as moderator and set their posts to be screened.\nAn attempt was made to spout all sort of false claims and accusations\npublicly.  I will not approve that post for public viewing as it\nserves no purpose other than to wreck havoc and destroy friendships. I\nadvise any of you who may be contacted off list with angry claims to\ntake it all with a grain of salt.\n\n \n\nThis list was and always will be a meeting place for Shinsengumi FANS.\nWe are all fans even if our tastes begin to lead us in other related\ndirections. ALL Bakumatsu/Meiji/Shinsengumi topics are WELCOMED HERE.  ALL MEMBERS are welcomed here.\n\n \n\nGranted, all discussions will not be to everyone&#39;s liking but NO ONE\nwill be asked or expected to stop posting because everyone is not 100%\ninterested in that particular subject at that particular time.\n\n \n\nIf you don&#39;t like a topic then skip over or delete. I do.\n\n \n\nNow let&#39;s get back to SHARING fun and info!\n\n\nBarbara Sheridan\n(your benevolent dictator&quot; ^_^)\nbsher212@...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
