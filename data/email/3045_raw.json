The\n&gt; Shinseng=\r\numi book I have (Blood and Makoto: Shinsengumi - Honor and\n&gt; Determination =\r\nof the Mibu Roshi) says that he was killed by Ooishi\n&gt; Kuwajiro (and others=\r\n) after trying to leave the Shinsengumi (&quot;He made\n&gt; a request to leave the =\r\nShinsengumi, however it was not accepted, and\n&gt; he was *put to the sword* [=\r\nzansatsu] by Ooishi Kuwajirou (and\n&gt; others)&quot;, but the Japanese Wikipedia s=\r\ntates he commited suicide. As a\n&gt; general rule, I disbelieve wikipedia firs=\r\nt, but I&#39;m still curious. I\n&gt; did notice on the Shinsengumi HQ site he is l=\r\nisted as showing up on\n&gt; the grave for Kondo and Hijikata he is listed as o=\r\nne of the people who\n&gt; &quot;Died of Illness, Executed, Assassinated, or otherwi=\r\nse Died Under\n&gt; Unusual Circumstances&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nLooks like I just found my answe=\r\nr - Apparently his grave states he\ncommited suicide (later in the same book=\r\n).
