Shikashi nakanaka kikai\n&gt; ga arimasen.)\n\n\nI went there and spent the day walking along some\nfamous spots including, but not limited to, Saigo\nTakamori and his comrades (Shiroyama! &quot;Kogun funto /\nkakomi wo yabutte kaeru / Ippyaku no ritei (...)&quot; wo\nomoidashimashita). Saw also the tomb of Togo\nHeihachiro.\n\n\n&gt; I have visited to Kumamoto and Nagasaki near\n&gt; Satsuma. \n&gt; Didn&#39;t you go to Kumamoto Castle? \n\n\nUnfortunately, I had no time to go to Higo this time\n-_- Went to Nagasaki, though.\n\n\n\n&gt; At the teenage time, I believed that Kirino Toshiaki\n&gt; (as Nakamura \n&gt; Hanjirou) was handsome. \n&gt; And his photograph was seen here and I was\n&gt; disappointed very much. \n&gt; lol\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/bakumatu/kirino.html\n\n\nWell, WAY better than Takasugi ^^;;;\n\n \n&gt; I think that Yoshida Shoin is the teacher of an\n&gt; ideal. \n\n\nI agree. A superb scholar with a natural talent for\nteaching.\n\n\n&gt; Takasugi Shinsaku, Yoshida Toshimaro, and Kusaka\n&gt; Genzui are the \n&gt; excellent students to whom Yoshida Shoin was looking\n&gt; forward to the \n&gt; future. \n\n\nWent to their graves too. It was surprisingly near to\nYoshida Shoin&#39;s birthplace.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;(ano Takasugi wa chotto kakko yoku nai desu ^^;;;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Takasugi Shinsaku is not handsome.^^;;; \n\n\n\nSaw a picture with him and other two boys (forgot who\nthey were ^^;;;;) where he wasn&#39;t so bad looking.\nAlso, his picture in bogu isn&#39;t *that* bad.\n\n\n&gt; His face was very long. \n&gt; When he rode on a horse and walked along a town,\n&gt; people teased him, \n&gt; saying &quot;He is wearing the face of a horse rather\n&gt; than the horse.&quot; \n&gt; However, he was liked very much by women^_^\n\n\nThat&#39;s to see that taste isn&#39;t something that can be\nunderstood (laughs).\n\n\n\n&gt; By the way, don&#39;t you know the present appearance of\n&gt; Takasugi house? \n&gt; I looked at the news to which that is closed several\n&gt; months ago. \n&gt; (The posterity of Takasugi had answered that it\n&gt; became impossible to \n&gt; preserve it.) \n\n\nI went to Takasugi&#39;s house and indeed it was closed.\nThere was a sign there warning that it was uncertain\nwhether it would be reopen for general visitation\nagain.\n\nMeanwhile, I guess all the other houses are still\nopen. Went to Katsura Kogoro&#39;s house, Yoshida Shoin&#39;s\nhouse (including Shokason-juku) and Ito Hirobumi&#39;s\nhouse.\n\n\n\n \n&gt; &gt;And last, but not least, read &quot;Dandara&quot;, by Akana\n&gt; Shu.\n&gt; &gt;Liked very much the drawing. Quite cool.\n&gt; \n&gt; Akana Shu is famous as the author of Anime &quot;YUGO&quot;.\n&gt; Although I counted on &quot;Dandara&quot; very much, it is\n&gt; interrupted now. \n&gt; \n&gt; (Totemo zannen desu.)-_-\n\n\nIndeed -_-\n\n\n\n=====\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
