Ikkyusan is called ikkyusan in the Thai dub or an \nalternate pronoun is the Thai word for novice+Ikkyu.\nBut the most popular manga and anime is still Doraemon it seems.\nManga is so popular in Thailand that we have problems with official \ncompared to unofficial translations and companies have to clearly \nstate that they have purchased the copyrights from Japan usually \nwith a holographic sticker or some other symbol.\n\nA Thai man invented ultraman SK ^_^ and it was exported to Japan in \none episode of ultraman he fights with the monkey king from the \nIndian epic Ramayana the costume of the monkey king is in the \ntraditional Thai dance style.  The Japanese company purchased the \nrights to ultraman for a certain number of years and continued to \nexpand the ultraman universe.  The creator of ultraman is still \nalive and well and he explained in a documentary that ultraman was \nbased on the BUDDHA @_@ !!!!\n\n\n"
