I \nvisite=\r\nd it immediately and yep.\n\nAll the content is gone.\n\nHopefully our hosting =\r\nservice will be able to restore the site via a \nback up.\n\nAs of yesterday t=\r\nhe site was still working as a friend and I over \nemail looked on the site =\r\nfor some citation so I guess this must be a \nsudden technical glitch.  \n\nAn=\r\nyways it has crossed my mind many times to just archive everything \ninto on=\r\ne file.  But the website will still stay online ofcourse.\n\nThe file would b=\r\ne a not for profit e-book written collaboratively by \natleast 2-3 people bu=\r\nt honestly we&#39;d need more help than that! (^_^)\n\nThe drawback to an e-book =\r\nwould be the increased likelihood of \nplagiarism (whole chapters turned in =\r\nas school assignments).  Our \nmost prolific contributor was plagiarized twi=\r\nce already (that we know \nof).  \n\nAs I understand it, if we were to create =\r\na pdf e-book it would still \nbe searchable.  Someone tell me if I&#39;m wrong (=\r\nI don&#39;t own the Adobe \nsoftware).\n\nPlease feel free by helping to give us i=\r\ndeas or post other \ninteresting Shinsen-things you find online---because we=\r\n need to put \ntogether our heads and help each other by thinking out loud.\n=\r\n\nFor me personally, I&#39;ve been quiet these past 3 months especially due \nto =\r\na life change and I -no- longer have access to a fabulous \nuniversity resea=\r\nrch library (I used these libraries during 2004, \n2005, 2006 and a bit in 2=\r\n007 focusing later on the Meiji).  That&#39;s \nwhy I don&#39;t have anything to con=\r\ntribute.\n\nBut that&#39;s just me---there are dozens of people here scattered \nt=\r\nhroughout the country who can find an aspect of the Shinsengumi or \nthe era=\r\n they like and study whatever they want.\n\nTo give an example, a friend and =\r\nI had found a very interesting book \nwhich is the bio of, Yamakawa Futaba, =\r\na friend and co-worker of both \nSaitou Hajime (Fujita Goro) and Takagi/Fuji=\r\nta Tokio. The book was \nwritten at the very end of the Meiji Era and we&#39;d l=\r\nove to read it to \nfind more &quot;texture&quot; and detail into the career of Futaba=\r\n---which \ncompletely overlapped with that of the Fujita husband and wife.  =\r\n\nFutaba&#39;s rank at the school was higher than that of the Fujitas.\n\nHowever =\r\nI was very busy in December and it would not be possible for \nme to order i=\r\nt through the university.  After losing my library \nprivileges due to a mov=\r\ne I asked a city public library if they can \nfulfill the request and get Fu=\r\ntaba&#39;s bio and they said I would have \nto pay for everything.  \n\nSo that&#39;s =\r\nwhy for a couple of years I was intensely focused on \nhistory because I had=\r\n a time limit and although I explained this to \nsome of my friends at the t=\r\nime it was not 100% clear to them why I \nseemed to &quot;favor&quot; history over fic=\r\ntion. I had some practical reasons \nwhich was why I was in a hurry to grab =\r\nhistory stuff (^_^).  \n\nWe all know manga, anime/dvds, all go through repri=\r\nnts and get picked \nup by companies all the time -however- some books are r=\r\nare, expensive \nor go out of print. Similarly, academic articles (a handful=\r\n of which \nwe&#39;ve exploited extensively) are not -public-.  You can&#39;t go onl=\r\nine \nand download some of the journal articles we have used and also \nprovi=\r\nded here on this list.\n\nSo now I guess all I have is fiction and I have to =\r\ngo with the flow \nuntil I find an occupation which can take me back into an=\r\n academic \nsetting of some sort (^_^).  Email me if you know of a universit=\r\ny \nwhich needs a floor sweeper---I&#39;m game XD\n\nI&#39;m currently trying to pass =\r\nthe time by writing fiction and I \nusually post updates now and then at the=\r\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n\n"
