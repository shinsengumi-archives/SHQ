There were many kinds o=\r\nf pages for a daimyo and \nthey had ranks etc, however Tadayoshi was close t=\r\no Matsudaira \nKatamori.\n\nThe only picture we have of him when he was really=\r\n young is this one \nwhich was taken after 1868 and likely when he was still=\r\n a prisoner in \nTokyo and moving around from school to school.\n\nhttp://1hap=\r\npyturtle.com/T-sensei/Kid.jpg\n\nbut even aside from young Takamine in Tsurug=\r\najo that horrible fall of \n1868, remember we have more guys too.  \n\nTakagi =\r\nGOro (Morinusuke) --- Tokio&#39;s bro who was a brave messenger, \nNumazawa Shic=\r\nhiro (he later adopted Tokio/Goro&#39;s son) he actually saw \ncombat and as men=\r\ntioned, Yamakawa Kenjiro.  \n\nAll 4 of these guys were born 1854 (Year of th=\r\ne Tiger) and all 4 had \nextensive ties with Fujita Goro and were close to o=\r\nne another in the \nMeiji.  We fondly call them the Tigers of Aizu (although=\r\n we call them \nthe BAKAtai as a pun on the Byakkotai behind their backs).  =\r\nAll 4 \nbecame prominent members of society and were key figures in \npreserv=\r\ning Aizu&#39;s story.  They were the fabulous 4! XD\n\nSo you see the fictional p=\r\nossibilities are endless especially when \nthe history basically reveals its=\r\nelf like this.  We have many \nuniverses in pop culture, but one can easily =\r\ncreate another if you \nfind inspiration in the history.\n\nWe used T-sensei t=\r\no get to not only Fujita Goro, Fujita Tokio but \nalso to provide a context =\r\nfor Fujita MIdori (daughter in law of \nTokio+Goro) and Yamaguchi Yukiko (ni=\r\nece of Fujita Goro).  Both of \nthese young ladies attended TAkamine&#39;s schoo=\r\nl.\n\nIf you want more fictional possibilities, consider this.  That photo \no=\r\nf the garden is interesting because it had hosted MANY MANY MANY \nforeigner=\r\ns (both famous and not well known).  One wonders if Fujita \never walked int=\r\no the home and was faced with...AMERICANS :: gasp ::\n\nIf you google William=\r\n Sturgis Bigelow there should be mention that he \nwas a collector of Japane=\r\nse swords and guards (he also had alot of \nmoney to spend).  He was very cl=\r\nose to Takamine---however from \nstudying Bigelow&#39;s personal letters (some a=\r\nre restricted though) I \ncouldn&#39;t find any mention of Takamine possibly int=\r\nroducing him to \nFujita.  \n\n----I digress----\nThe first chapter of Ono Suzu=\r\ne:  A Man of Talent in the Meiji \nEra &quot;THE PET RABBIT&quot; which Kikue patientl=\r\ny read, features \nmesmerism/hypnotism which in part came about from me stud=\r\nying both \nTakamine and Yamakawa (who were deeply interested in the field \n=\r\ngenerally called &quot;metaphysics&quot;).  \nInterestingly they both appear in the ar=\r\nticle &quot;The early 20th \ncentury: Shaping the discipline of psychology in Jap=\r\nan&quot; by SATO.\nBoth of them appear in later chapters (under fictional names \n=\r\nofcourse) and Fujita explains how he grasps mesmerism via \ndemonstrating ho=\r\nw he confounds his enemies in combat (which surprises \nYamakawa).\n\n\n"
