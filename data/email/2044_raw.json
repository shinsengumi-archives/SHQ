The translator called it &quot;the\n &gt; mountain in this circle&quot;.\n\nThe &quot;trademark&quot; of Ishida Sanyaku, called &quot;maru ni yama&quot; by crest term. \nCan be translated as &quot;Mountain on the circle&quot;(Seeing the form of the \ncrest the mountain is not &quot;in&quot; but &quot;on&quot; the circle).\n\n &gt; What is the proper name of the medicine made by the Sato family? It\n &gt; was for chest ailments and Toshizou sold it along with the Ishida\n &gt; Sanyaku. Okita may have used this for his TB as well. The translator\n &gt; calls it &quot;Empty trouble powdered medicine&quot; and &quot;Empty labor powdered\n &gt; medicine&quot;.\n\nJapanese name of that medicine called, &quot;Kyorou-san&quot; .\n\n &gt; Toshizou was thought to have been fond of plum blossoms? The passage\n &gt; from www.toshizo.com says something about his haiku and that one is\n &gt; carved on the tsuba of his sword is the reason people think this?\nToshizo composed many haiku about plum blossoms and he carved plum \nflowers on the tsuba too, therefore we can guess the plum flower might \nbe his favorite flower.\n\n &gt; There is one passage that says something about Toshizou wearing a\n &gt; hakama of &quot;Sendaihira silk&quot;? What is the big deal with this\n &gt; specifically?\nSendai hira silk is the name of fine silk fabric with stripes on it.\nhttp://www.crane-ny.co.jp/syouken/tenmansendaihira/temnamsendaihira.htm\nIt&#39;s used for the formal occasion today and you can see it frequently in \nthe different Jidai-geki costume films.\nhttp://www.shop-japan.co.jp/shop/shinsengumi-s.htm\n\n &gt; What about the haiku listed in the PMK Vol 2 graphic novel? Are those\n &gt; really his work or something that was made up for the manga?\nThose are all authentic Hijikata made haiku.\n\nAnd the\n &gt; rules they list? I&#39;ve heard of two of them, but not those others. You\n &gt; could be made to commit seppuku for talking about &quot;ghosts and other\n &gt; strange creatures&quot;?! *Starts hiding all her books on the\n &gt; supernatural.* Thinking back to his reaction on hearing people\n &gt; thought Serizawa&#39;s ghost was returning, Toshizou must have -REALLY-\n &gt; hated ghost stories! LOL\n\nThat rule is mentioned as annex to an item of &quot;Gunchu Hatto&quot;(rule under \nthe wartime) which said &quot;You shouldn&#39;t do any comment about the force of \neither our side or enemy side.&quot;(sorry for this is very badly translated \nby me)\nUnlike Kyokuchu Hatto which is supposed to be the invention of Kan \nShimozawa, this Gunchu Hatto is the real rule applied after Ikedaya, and \njust before the Kinmon incident.\nThe reason of special mention about supernatural thing is unknown as far \nas I know. ( The author of the manga &quot;Burai&quot; which is a kind of X-file \nof Shinsengumi at the beginning, has an interesting reflection about \nthis, saying if they mentioned especially about that, because \n&quot;something&quot; mysterious has happened...lol)\n\n\nI&#39;ll look for the answer about other questions and if you would give the \nurl of exact pages which mentions about the Toshizo&#39;s temper etc, that \nwould help me more.\n\nTama\n\n\n\n"
