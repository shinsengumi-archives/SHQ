I may have just assumed that ages ago, not realizing he had died.  Anyway, the way RK Kawaji smokes and practically hyperventilates over everything in both the manga and the anime, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he keeled over with a heart attack.  The real man must&#39;ve seen few nights of sleep trying to organize and regulate the new police force in such troubled and changing times... think of all the animosities he must&#39;ve had to deal with with so many former samurai in the ranks.  (Okay, let&#39;s see... we&#39;ve got to keep that Suzuki fellow away from *anyone* with Shinsengumi connections... it&#39;s easy to joke about now, but I have to think he had to keep things like that in mind.)  \n \nI developed an admiration for the man from the first I started looking for info on him.  He seemed to leave his own prior loyalties on the back burner in favor of creating something beneficial for all of Japan. I really do wonder how difficult it was for him to have to go against Saigou...  I sometimes feel like it might not have bothered him too much considering the threat Saigou posed to the new government.  Like I said, his actions speak more of man concerned with the larger picture, not just who won the war.  Even Katsura was fed up by the end.\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nTake Yahoo! Mail with you!
