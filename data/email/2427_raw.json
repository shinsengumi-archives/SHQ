So \nTakeda trusted Shinohara. [and why he took that after dinner walk with him, \nne?]\n \nThat was written by Kenbun Nishimura, the guardian samurai of \nNishihonganji\ntemple. In NHK he was the man for whom Kawai told his story \nbefore dying\n-----------------\n\nThere was a former Satsuma samurai called Toyama Yahei who committed \nmurder and was banished from Satsuma clan.. He ask Kondo to join \nShinsengumi.\n Kondo was leery of the guy but  Itou supported this Toyama and \nconvinced Kondo to accept him.\n\nItou then made Toyama be something of a spy and to report to Satsuma \nclan what Kondo was doing.\n\nThrough Toyama, Itou met Okubo. He met  often with him and  participated \nto other meetings to overthrow Bakufu. [Not sure if this was just with \nOkubo or with other high Ishin figures, my guess is it was]\n\n In his diary Itou wrote that everything went as he expected. Except \nafter leaving the Shinsengumi he couldn&#39;t find a suitable place to stay....\n--------------------------------------\nItou was promoted to the court rank of Ju-goi on November 18 ( his death \nanniversary) Taisho 7 (1918) &quot;Ju&quot; means &quot;Vice&quot; and the rank comes just \nafter Sho-go-i.\n \nJugo-i rank, it&#39;s lower than Sagara&#39;s, but we don&#39;t know why. It comes \njust after Shogo-i which is Sagara&#39;s.. Itou was enshrined in Yasukuni \nShrine and became a kami on April ( no mention for the date) Showa 4 ( \n1929) [same shrine as Sagara]\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote about court ranks\nThe &quot;Ikai&quot; or court rank system has been existed since 1400 years ago in \nJapan.\nThere are miner changing of the system but since Taisho era, the court \nrank has had the number 1 to 8 and each rank number has its &quot;vice&quot; \ntherefore 16 ranks in total.\n\nSo it has &quot;Sho-ichi (1)- i &quot; at the summit and &quot;Ju-ichi-i&quot; comes next, \nthen Sho-ni(2)-i , Ju-ni-i and so forth. (sho-go-i means 5th)\nThose rank are given to the people contributed to the country and except \nImperial family and Korean royal family.\nSometimes, the promotion is posthumous and the highest rank \n&quot;Sho-ichi-i&quot;has never been given before one&#39;s death.\nThis rank always exists but after W.W.II  the promotion became \nposthumous only.\n\nFrom  http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~BH3H-SMJY/rekisi/ikai.htm Tama gives \nus some Isihn leaders and their court rank.\n\n\nShoichi-i: (the highest)  Iwakura Tomomi\nJu-ichi-i: Okubo Toshimichi, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, (It isn&#39;t mentioned in \nthis site but also Kido Takayoshi/Katsura Kogoro is here)\nSho-san(3)-i : Saigo Takamori\nSho-yon(4)-i: Sakamoto Ryoma, Nakaoka Shintaro, Yoshida Shouin, Ii Naosuke\n\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n"
