Someone I recognize from the LJ!!  (Not that there&#39;s anything \ngoing on over there at the moment.)  Glad you got things straightened \nout with Yahoo... I *know* how long THAT can take.   \n\nWe&#39;ve gots lots of Saitou fans and some PMK Harada fans.  I&#39;ll let \npast messages from Barb introduce you to the stylish-fundoshi version \nof Harada from the live-action drama from NHK.  :-D  I&#39;m just about \nto get started watching some of that series.  Lots of references to \nfilm and television series featuring the Shinsengumi & the times... \nunfortunatly buried in messages right now (unless someone has \ncompiled a film/tv list and posted it to Files?).  If you get \nconfused like I do keeping them all straight, don&#39;t hesitate to ask \nquestions.  Oh, and if you haven&#39;t already, consider signing up on \nmiburo so you can access the files that are over there.  It&#39;s mostly \nacting as storage space and full of info.  \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/miburo .\n\nSo... Japanese language skills, eh?  (very wicked grin, rubbing \nhands... and not just me)  Two years or three, you HAVE to be better \nthan babelfish...  :-D\n\nYou don&#39;t have to have any translation skills to be welcome.  We&#39;re \nalways glad to have more miburo fans to join the fun.\n\nphil\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Mirel &lt;gryps_celsus@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Konnichi wa minna-san!\n&gt; I&#39;m new here and I&#39;m totally excited to finally get myself in this \ngroup (I \n&gt; was having arguments with Yahoo about the existence of my \naccount).  I am \n&gt; really interested in learning all I can about the Shinsengumi and \nits \n&gt; members, and I&#39;ve heard this is THE PLACE to get and share info in \nEnglish.\n&gt; Just as an intro, I&#39;ll give a quick rundown of what I&#39;m into, ne?  \nLet&#39;s \n&gt; see, my fav. member is Saitou Hajime, although Peacemaker Kurogane \nhas \n&gt; gotten me quite curious about Harada Sanosuke as well.  As for \nanime, I&#39;ve \n&gt; seen Kenshin and PMK and I am digging for more.  In manga, I&#39;ve \nread a \n&gt; bunch of PMK and I have a bunch of scanlations sitting on my \ncomputer \n&gt; waiting for attention.  As for live action stuff, this is where I \nam \n&gt; horribly deficient, but I hope to fix that soon!\n&gt; I&#39;ve also taken two years of Japanese and would be going into my \n3rd year \n&gt; if it weren&#39;t for the fact that I&#39;m going to Tanzania this fall.  I \nlove \n&gt; learning about other aspects Japanese history outside of the \nShinsengumi \n&gt; and the areas I&#39;m most interested in include the Sengoku jidai (age \nof \n&gt; civil wars), the Edo period, and the Meiji Restoration.\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m currently working on a full Shinsengumi uniform (minus \nthe armor, \n&gt; because that would be really hard to make) to wear to this year&#39;s \nOtakon in \n&gt; Baltimore, so any tips on such would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well that&#39;s about it!\n&gt; I look forward to many more e-mails wrought with Shinsengumi \ngoodness!\n&gt; \n&gt; Tootles!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
