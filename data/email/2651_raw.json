LOL! I just wanted to congratulate you  on this very nice piece of work. I&#39;ve seen a lot of doujinshi for the  Shinsengumi and yours has a very nice art style and -organization-. It  is very clean. \n  \n  I wish there were more people interested in making doujinshi, so that  we can actually have more in English. So salutations to you. :)\n  \n  ~Kizu\n  \n  Thank you very much.   Simple words like yours are the fuel  that keep me drawing no matter what ^____^   I really do  appreshiate it and I&#39;m always overjoyed when I know that someone has  also enjoyed what I do.   Words can&#39;t describe just how happy  & jittery I get.   Thank you very much.\n  \n  -Bunneh\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
