Sorry if yahoo finally \nbehaves and=\r\n if you receive two copies.\n\n--------------------------\n\nHi everyone!\n\n\nI w=\r\nas sitting right here in front of my computer, reading the \nnumerous posts =\r\nand feeling bad about the fact that I could get access \nto such precious in=\r\nformation without offering anything in return. But \nthe truth is that my kn=\r\nowledge of Japan history and of the world of \nanime is somewhat limited. Bu=\r\nt then, I thought about a little \nsomething=85\n\n\nI speak French at home and=\r\n I do happen to have French copies of the \nmanga and of the Kaden. I know t=\r\nhat they started publishing the manga \nin English, I don&#39;t know where they&#39;=\r\nre at, but I guess that it&#39;s not \nvery, very far. \n\n\nThere are some interes=\r\nting articles in both the Kaden and the manga. \nIf you are interested, and =\r\nif you tell me that no translation of \nthese articles are easily available =\r\non the web, then I&#39;ll work on \ntranslations of these articles and gradually=\r\n post them on the ML.\n\n\nHere are the most interesting topics, in my opinion=\r\n:\n\n\nIn the manga\n-The &quot;In the secret of the creation of the characters&quot; sec=\r\ntion. Each \ncharacter has one, even the more obscure characters. \n\n\nIn the =\r\nKaden, vol. 1\n-Historical note on Gensai Kawakami: the historical figure be=\r\nhind \nKenshin;\n-Historical note on Arimoto Yamagata: the politician who acc=\r\nidentally \nmeets Kenshin in one of the first episode;\n-Historical note on t=\r\nhe Oniwabanshu;\n-Historical note on occidental weapons used in RK;\n-Summary=\r\n of the Sekihoutai history;\n-Historical note on Saito;\n-Historical note on =\r\nthe Shinsengumi;\n-Historical note on Toshimi Okubo and Toshiyoshi Kawaji: t=\r\nhe ones \nwho, quite unfortunately, interrupted Saito/Kenshin fight (T-T)\n-T=\r\nhe Boshin war, the Seinan war and what links the two;\n-Information on katan=\r\na;\n-Watsuki&#39;s sources. Unfortunately, these books have not been \ntranslated=\r\n from the Japanese. Well, I don&#39;t think so=85 But the Kaden \ndo provide sho=\r\nrt summaries. \n-Interview with Watsuki: general questions on his life as a =\r\nmangaka \nand his aspirations.\n\n\nIn the Kaden, vol. 2\n-Interview with Watsuk=\r\ni, part one: The Tokyo Arc;\n-Interview with Watsuki, part two: The Kyoto Ar=\r\nc;\n-Interview with Watsuki, part three: The Revenge Arc;\n-Interview with Wa=\r\ntsuki, part four: the Hokkaido Arc, which, \nunfortunately for Shinsengumi f=\r\nans, has never seen the day.\n\n\nI&#39;m a quite busy person and also, I want to =\r\nmake sure that I give you \nguys the best translation I can, so I won&#39;t tran=\r\nslate everything over \none night. Tell me what would interest you the most,=\r\n and I&#39;ll \nestablish a priority order. If some elements above don&#39;t seem to=\r\n \ninterest anyone, they just won&#39;t be translated.\n\n\nTell me what you think,=\r\n\n\n\nMary-Ann (^-^)\n\n\n"
