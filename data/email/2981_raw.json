Written by the very men who had formed =\r\nits\nranks, the magazine was first published in 1898, and featured in its\ned=\r\nitorial staff such famous names as Enomoto Takeaki, Katsu Kaishu,\nOtori Kei=\r\nsuke, Ogasawara Naganari, and Inoue Masanao. Every square\ninch of this maga=\r\nzine is filled to the brim with facts, numbers,\ndates, photographs, calligr=\r\naphy, paintings, commentary, memoirs, and\nmore. Now largely ignored, it sit=\r\ns on the shelves of major Asian\nStudies research libraries around the world=\r\n, waiting to be rediscovered.\n\nQ. You mentioned Enomoto, Katsu Kaishu and O=\r\ntori Keisuke.\nCan you please explain the significance of those three men an=\r\nd any\npossible connections to the Shinsengumi?\n\nCertainly. Enomoto Takeaki =\r\n(1836-1908) was a senior officer in the\nShogun&#39;s navy, as was Katsu Kaishu =\r\n(1823-1899). Otori Keisuke\n(1833-1911) was an Infantry Magistrate in the Sh=\r\nogunate Army. All\nthree were members of the new nobility during the Meiji e=\r\nra, and all\nof them, despite their background in the Shogunate, held high\np=\r\nositions in the Meiji government. Later on in life they wrote at\nlength on =\r\ntheir experiences in the decades leading up to the\nRestoration; some of the=\r\nse writings appear in &quot;Kyu Bakufu&quot;\n\nAs for connections to the Shinsengumi, =\r\nthese men are directly\nconnected to them, on a face-to-face basis. Otori Ke=\r\nisuke fought\nalongside Hijikata, from Edo, to Utsunomiya, to Aizu, all the =\r\nway\nnorth to Hakodate. Enomoto was the one who carried Otori and Hijikata\na=\r\nnd many others by sea to Hakodate, where they set up the Ezo\nRepublic. Enom=\r\noto became president, Otori was Army Minister, and\nHijikata was Vice-Army M=\r\ninister. Katsu Kaishu was associated with\nShinsengumi during its time in Ed=\r\no immediately after the Battle of\nToba-Fushimi (late January 1868 by the we=\r\nstern calendar). Katsu Kaishu\nwas the one who dispatched Shinsengumi, then =\r\nrenamed Koyochinbutai, to\nKai Province, to take posession of Kofu Castle, w=\r\nhich was in theory to\nbecome the seat of a 100,000 koku domain ruled by Kon=\r\ndou Isami.\n\nQ. Are there biographies in this work? Anything of interest to =\r\nus\nShinsengumi fans?\n\n&quot;Kyu Bakufu&quot; has biographies or biographical notes in=\r\n every single\nissue. Of note to Shinsengumi fans is &quot;Kondou Isami-den,&quot; qui=\r\nte\npossibly the first biography of Kondou Isami which did not depict him\nas=\r\n a criminal. The biography of Kumoi Tatsuo, Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s\nacquaintan=\r\nce from Yonezawa, is also worthy of note. The biography of\nNagai Naoyuki, a=\r\n Shogunate official in constant contact with\nShinsengumi from their very in=\r\nception, is also present, as is\nextensive data on the Aizu domain, Shinseng=\r\numi&#39;s supervisors and\nShogunate-approved patrons.\n\nQ. Which members of the =\r\nShinsengumi were still alive to read this\nmagazine?\n\nTo the best of my know=\r\nledge, Saitou Hajime, Nagakura Shinpachi, Takagi\nTeisaku, Yamawaki Hayataro=\r\nu, Hieda Rihachi, and Abe Jurou were still\nalive in 1898, as well as others=\r\n whose names I either don&#39;t know or\ncan&#39;t recall.\n\nQ. Do you know the cost =\r\nof the magazine (per issue) and perhaps how it\nwas established given the pe=\r\nrvasive bias against many who were on the\n&quot;wrong side&quot; of the civil war in =\r\n1868?\n\nWhile I don&#39;t know what the cost per issue was, I can tell that\nwith=\r\nout Enomoto Takeaki and Katsu Kaishu&#39;s assistance, it never would\nhave exis=\r\nted. These men, being in high positions in the Meiji\nGovernment, had establ=\r\nished the fact that they were men of importance\nand loyalty, and so for the=\r\nm to patronize this magazine effectively\nwas what brought it into being.\n\nT=\r\nhank you for sharing this text. Although we do not yet know details\nlike th=\r\ne people who actually contributed financially to the\nestablishment of the m=\r\nagazine we must assume that having it published\nwould be difficult. Perhaps=\r\n most telling is -if- the list of\nacknowledged supporters who were less pol=\r\nitically powerful than the\nmen you mentioned does not exist.\nI asked about =\r\nthe cost as a way of exploring the possible readership\ndemographics. If the=\r\n magazine was very expensive, I&#39;m sure the\ncirculation would have been very=\r\n low. Even the location of its\npublication (perhaps Tokyo) would be interes=\r\nting to note.\n\nJust as in the present, fictional portrayals of the Shinseng=\r\numi were\nmore popular. The year 1898 was several years before the epic\nDAIB=\r\nOSATSU-TOGE http://www.shinsengumihq.com/DBT.htm was published.\nThat was th=\r\ne first truly public and modern method of introducing the\nShinsengumi in no=\r\nvel form during the late Meiji Era. The novel would\nhave easily overshadowe=\r\nd this first formal attempt of recording\nShinsengumi history.\n\nThe biograph=\r\ny of Kondou Isami can be seen here:\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/KondoIs=\r\nami-den1.zip\n\n\n\n\n\n"
