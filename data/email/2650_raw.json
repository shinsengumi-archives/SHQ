LOL! I just wanted to \ncongratulate you on thi=\r\ns very nice piece of work. I&#39;ve seen a lot of \ndoujinshi for the Shinsengum=\r\ni and yours has a very nice art style \nand -organization-. It is very clean=\r\n. \n\nI wish there were more people interested in making doujinshi, so \nthat =\r\nwe can actually have more in English. So salutations to you. :)\n\n~Kizu\n\n---=\r\n In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Bunny ^_^ &lt;shenlong71328@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Greeting=\r\ns to all the Shinsengumi lovers of this world! ^_________^\n&gt;   \n&gt;   Alright=\r\n then, these are 8 pages I did because I was deeply \ninspired  (and hooked)=\r\n on a fanfic I&#39;m currently reading called &quot;The \nCourtship of  Lady Tokio&quot; b=\r\ny Misaki Toyodome.   Now,  Misaki didn&#39;t  \nask me to draw this, I did it on=\r\n my own out of pure urge to see \nwhat  this one particular scene would look=\r\n like.   I was extreamly  \nnervous when I sent her the links to the pages a=\r\nnd I am overly \nexcited  that she loves them.   She loves them so much that=\r\n she \nsuggested I  share these pages with the SHQ mailing list (BTW are \nth=\r\ne SHQ & Spy  division under the same e-mail address for the \nmailing  list?=\r\n).   So, without further adue, the small section of  \nfanfic turned doujins=\r\nhi:\n&gt;   \n&gt;   http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970162/\n&gt;   http://www.devian=\r\ntart.com/view/24970267/\n&gt;   http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970380/\n&gt;   ht=\r\ntp://www.deviantart.com/view/25006043/\n&gt;   http://www.deviantart.com/view/2=\r\n5255863/\n&gt;   http://www.deviantart.com/view/25256502/\n&gt;   http://www.devian=\r\ntart.com/view/25275526/\n&gt;   http://www.deviantart.com/view/25394256/\n&gt;   \n&gt;=\r\n   If any of you haven&#39;t read this fic, you should.   It is  \nexquisitly wr=\r\niten.   The fanfic can be found both on  fanfiction.net \n(http://www.fanfic=\r\ntion.net/s/2049030/1/) & on  hakubaikou.com ... \nthe one on FF.net is more =\r\nfar ahead then the one on  Hakubaikou&#39;s \nsite.   Anyways, I hope you guys a=\r\nll enjoy this  as much as Misaki \ndid (I know secretarytocapt3 enjoys the f=\r\nic  ^.^).
