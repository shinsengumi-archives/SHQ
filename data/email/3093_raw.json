My interpretation of the boo=\r\nk so far is that\nthe &quot;expulsion of foreigners&quot; was way up on the shinsengum=\r\ni &quot;to do&quot;\nlist according to hillsborough.  As for the 105 - now I get it - =\r\nthere\nwere only 105 members (aside from the ones who declined or fled) - I\n=\r\nwas thinking that only a percentage were chosen.
