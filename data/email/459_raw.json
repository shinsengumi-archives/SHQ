This book I have on Japanese language \nand culture mentions something called a haramaki, which is basically \na waistband or healthband (whichever you prefer). The point of this \nis to keep the abdomen warm, even in hot weather, because it&#39;s \nsupposed to keep the wearer healthy. Maybe Saito wore the towel \naround his neck for a similar reason?\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
