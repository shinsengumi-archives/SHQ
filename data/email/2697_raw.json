I&#39;ve been really interested in the shinsengumi\never =\r\nsince I caught a brief episode of peacemaker kurogane. However, I\nrealize t=\r\nhat probably a large portion of the show is made up for tv\nwatchers but I w=\r\nas hoping that somebody could give me some information\non them. Most sites =\r\nI have been to only repeat the same thing over and\nover. There are a few me=\r\nmbers im really interested in(no offense to\nothers):\n1.Shinpachi Nagakura\n\n=\r\n2.Hajime Saito\n\n3.Soji Okita\n\n4.Sanosuke Harada\n\n5.Isami Kondo\n\n6.Toshizo H=\r\nijikata\n\n7.Their spies\n        Any info that somebody could email me or pos=\r\nt would greatly be\nappreciated. I&#39;m still ignorant when it comes to alot of=\r\n this but\nhopefully with this site I can learn more about the history of th=\r\ne\nshinsengumi.Thank you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
