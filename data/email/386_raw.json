While I \nappreciate a good pic of the Wolf as much as the next fangirl, I \nwould like to remind everyone that the files section is for text \nfiles only. Pictures take up much needed space in the files section \nand we have folders in the photo section for Saito pics. Please \nremove the pics and place them there within the next couple of days. \nThis is the last warning that will be given. The next pics found in \nthe text files will be forced to follow Shinsengumi law and be made \nto commit seppuku. (In other words they will be deleted without \nwarning.)\n\nSorry to be so harsh, but one of us moderators has to do it. I guess \nI&#39;ve just spent too much time reading up on Hijikata-sama. He&#39;s \nbeginning to influence me...\n\n-MissBehavin\nHijikata&#39;s Chamber Maid \n\n\n"
