Because NHK Akesato is a simple whore.\nPersonally I was surprised to see such Akesato at first but finally I \nthought her simple and frank character was what Yamanami needed and Sawa \nSuzuki played her very well.\nShe appears in the episode 31 to 33.\n\nI put some link from NHK official site but I warn that thre are some \nspoiler photos.\n\nYou can see Akesato here.\nhttp://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/topic/yamanami/point.html\n\nAnd here clicking the number 3.\nhttp://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/topic/yamanami/docu.html\n\nThis is the top page of Yamanami featured topics for his fans.\nhttp://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/topic/yamanami/index.html\n\nTama\n\nSaitoh Worship wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Ummm, does anyone happen to have a picture of Akesato in NHK? I sort\n&gt; of missed the episodes involving her and I really want to see what she\n&gt; looked like ^^;;; Thanks a bunch!
