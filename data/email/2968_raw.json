I didn&#39;t realized that the SH=\r\nQ had decided to use \n&quot;assistant instructor&quot; in place of the kanji that cou=\r\nldn&#39;t be displayed properly.  As soon as I \nnoticed it, I posted the follow=\r\ning message. \n\n--- n SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nlf7@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; About the last paragraph on http://www.shinsengumihq.com/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OkitaSouj=\r\nirobackground.htm, Okita became the &quot;??&quot; (&quot;School Head&quot;)\n&gt; at the Shieikan =\r\nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1861, not an &quot;Assistant Instructor&quot; (&quot;???.&quot;) (Oji, p.48) More inf=\r\no\n&gt; could be found on the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yamanami Keisuke discussion page at Wikipe=\r\ndia (since I can&#39;t type\n&gt; any kanji here.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wi=\r\nki/Talk:Yamanami_Keisuke\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve decided to translate &quot;??&quot; as &quot;He=\r\nad Coach&quot; to avoid confusion\n&gt; with &quot;??&quot; (&quot;Director&quot; - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Isami&#39;s=\r\n position at the time.) I&#39;m afraid it couldn&#39;t be\n&gt; interpreted as &quot;Assista=\r\nnt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instructor&quot; in any case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~Seven\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\nOf course, I =\r\nshould&#39;ve just used &quot;Jukutou&quot; in place of its kanji to begin with.\nThanks a=\r\n lot for making the correction. :)\n\n~Seven\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;s=\r\necretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As mentioned on previous posts =\r\nand during personal emails to you we\n&gt; asked you to just tell us what you w=\r\nanted on that page. So for some\n&gt; reason either you forgot to put this on a=\r\n list? I&#39;m sorry it should be\n&gt; corrected right away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even with minor =\r\ndetails such as changing your pen name, was done\n&gt; immediately or within th=\r\ne hour of your request.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just right now, the pages are undergoing conve=\r\nrsion to a different\n&gt; format for easier navigation---so as soon as that is=\r\n done by two\n&gt; volunteers, then the correction will be done as soon as poss=\r\nible.  I\n&gt; can&#39;t do anything because of this ongoing process.\n&gt; \n&gt; So thank=\r\n you for bringing this up---but we did stick to what you told\n&gt; us---and if=\r\n you recall I emailed you right away to inform you when\n&gt; your corrections =\r\nwent live.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nlf7@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAbout the translation of &quot;Jukutou&quot;, it&#39;s translated as &quot;head\n&gt; teacher&quot; (re=\r\ngarding Sakamoto) \n&gt; &gt; in the PMK anime and  &quot;head of the school&quot; in the PM=\r\nK manga.  In\n&gt; &quot;Shinsengumi : the \n&gt; &gt; Shogun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps&quot; by Romu=\r\nlus Hillsborough, it&#39;s also\n&gt; written &quot;Okita Soji: genius \n&gt; &gt; swordsman, h=\r\nead of the Shieikan...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve decided to keep &quot;Head Coach (Jukutou)=\r\n at the Shieikan&quot; in the\n&gt; Okita article and use  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Head Teacher (Jukut=\r\nou) at the Shieikan&quot; in the Yamanami article at\n&gt; Wikipedia.  I really \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n would like to avoid translating &quot;Jukutou&quot; as &quot;Head of School.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nwever, I&#39;d have no objection if the SHQ decided to use &quot;head of\n&gt; the schoo=\r\nl&quot;.
