Now, I am in the process of getting this book in\nthe hands of someone who knows Japanese & the Shinsengumi. Yes, I am\ntrying to approach this with caution...and as soon as I can get to a\nscanner I will scan the photo and the paragraph...because the\n&quot;letters&quot; right below the pic are also headers for a paragraph...so\nI&#39;m eager to get everything crystal clear.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;spiritus_saitou&quot; &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt;\nwrote:\nit would NOT be \n&gt; unusual for Fujita Gorou to be living at the facility as an \n&gt; employee.  \n\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he \n&gt; WORKED\n&gt; &gt; there...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because if \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; think about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a\n&gt; &gt; prison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he was\n&gt; &gt; formerly &quot;disciplined&quot; for something...because I trying really hard \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; be sure that he wasn&#39;t just a prison guard but she was trying to\n&gt; &gt; communicate that he did something &#39;bad&#39; but not &#39;criminal&#39;.\n\n\n"
