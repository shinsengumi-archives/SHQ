If you=\r\n guys have any more questions, feel  free to send me a mail ^^\n  \n  ~ * ~ *=\r\n ~\n  When the window first opens you get a pop up with some  freaky looking=\r\n dude.   Just hit the  =93Continue=94 button.   The next screen has  4 area=\r\ns to fill out, fill them out and then hit =93Cancel=94 and NOT =93OK=94.\n  =\r\n            Next you will see only a blank screen.   On the line all the wa=\r\ny to the bottom type  in =93/server aurora.caelestia.net=94 and hit enter. =\r\n  The screen called =93mIRC Favorites=94 will  appear.   On the right, clic=\r\nk on the  button =93Add=94.   Under =93channel=94 type in  =93#ShinsengumiH=\r\nQ=94 and hit the add button all the way in the bottom.   This will take you=\r\n back to the previous page  and have the channel highlighted.   All  you do=\r\n from there is either doubleclick on the chatroom name or highlight it  and=\r\n hit =93join=94 on the right of the popup.\n   Hopefully that is helpful.   =\r\nI know, I know, it=92s a bit confusing at first  (I got extremely confused =\r\nwhen I first did this).   Well, hope to see you guys in there ^_^\n    \n\t\t\n-=\r\n--------------------------------\n Yahoo!
