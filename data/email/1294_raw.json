I would like to \ntake the role of NHK Saito, if I were.\n\nI put only a precision about PMK Saito&#39;s yukata mentioned by M san.\n\n&gt;I personally don&#39;t like walking around in a yukata with \n&gt;only one sword at my side. :-D\n\nIn fact PMK Saito doesn&#39;t wear yukata, but ordinary kimono without hakama nor \nhaori. It&#39;s casual way of wearing kimono for men, called &quot;kinagashi &quot;style.\n\nA modern styel kinagashi page is bellow. Only difference with Edo period is \nunderwear, there is few person who wear fundoshi in this time, I think.\nhttp://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sawai/club2/r2nagasi.html\n\nYukata is originally a kind of bath robe for nobility in Heian period.\nIt become populer in Edo period, and especially for townpeople( both men and \nwomen). They used to wear it for some occasion like festival or hanami ( \ncherry blossom viewing),however it considered too casual. For exemple,a wife or a \ndaughter of Samurai class did never wear yukata at least in public.\n\nSo Saito and some PMK characters are dressed kinagashi style kimono.\nYou can notice in Jidaigeki (Japanese costume drama), some people wearing \nkinagashi style kimono. NHK Harada also appears frequently in kinagashi, but \ninconvenience of this style is, if you don&#39;t move properly, you are in danger of \nexpose your fundoshi.\n\nAn addition for NHK Hijikata fan,\nhttp://www.nhk-sc.or.jp/stera/index.html\n\nHave a nice chat.\n\nTama\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
