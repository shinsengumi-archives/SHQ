Which will most probably be based on the\n&gt; Peacemaker Kurogane \n&gt; manga, the ones licensed by ADV.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The anime has 24 episodes. Imon Peacemaker manga\n&gt; has 6 volumes, and \n&gt; Peacemaker Kurogane manga, I think, has 5 or six\n&gt; volumes.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Hope that helps!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ~Kane\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Logan &lt;wolverinesg7@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; how many seasons are there in the peace maker\n&gt; kurogane series and \n&gt; &gt; episodes. i have 1-6 and i&#39;m in love. i want to\n&gt; know how many more \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; there so i can get the rest for my collection.\n&gt; Domo.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!
