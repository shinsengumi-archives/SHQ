Sendai has had a crow problem for over 2 centuries, so the name \n&quot;Crow Unit&quot; is appropriate, in my opinion. At any rate, as the \nsouthwesterners were coming up into northern Japan, the Crow Unit was \nactive, and while I have yet to prove this, they were probably escorts for \nHijikata and his men, when they boarded Enomoto&#39;s ships at Sabusawa-jima in \nMatsushima Bay.\n\nTheir banner was a flying black crow on a white background-- and Hosoya&#39;s \njinbaori (armor surcoat) was black, with a black yatagarasu (mythical \nthree-legged crow) on a red circle on the back.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
