Is there anyway you can \n&gt; &gt;encode and post those up for download? If not...\n&gt; \n&gt;  Barbara posted the bit torrent link a few weeks back so that is \n&gt; probably your best bet if you are looking to store them on a ftp \n&gt; server:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/23f6v\n&gt; \n&gt;  If you have access to binaries there is a guy uploading a SVCD \n&gt; version in the alt.binaries.multimedia.japanese.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I collect these type of samurai movies and TV series so I am \ndoing \n&gt; the full DVD-R conversion for myself to watch on stand alone \nplayers. \n&gt; Anyone can get that from me, but due to size it isn&#39;t really \nsuitable \n&gt; for ftp downloading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n\n\n"
