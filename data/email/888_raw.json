The keyword\n&gt; is &quot;most&quot; of the paintings.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I placed all the pics on this temporary page\n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NN2.html\n&gt; my goal is to fix it up and then it will be moved into its permanent\n&gt; home at http://www.shinsengumihq.com\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, now I know Nakajima N. totally went all out with his work...we\n&gt; have 26 of his paintings and there were 3-4 archive.org could not\n&gt; retrieve making the possibility that he painted a total of 40! very\n&gt; high...he must&#39;ve had some serious time on his hands. I mentioned that\n&gt; there was a seminar planned to show all of his work and his descendant\n&gt; was going to give a lecture...one of the Japanese sites said the\n&gt; lecture was cancelled and it was going to be a full house too...all\n&gt; possible seats were taken.\n&gt; \n&gt; [PLEASE please HELP----problem]\n&gt; 1) I made thumbnails of the portraits and made it so that a new window\n&gt; pops up with an enlarged version of the image...I must&#39;ve messed up\n&gt; the javascript or something because the homepage ALSO pops up...I&#39;m\n&gt; ~really~ tired...if anyone understands code please help I thought I\n&gt; typed everything correctly.  Just visit the site and click on\n&gt; thumbnails you&#39;ll know what I mean.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know just a couple of you can read Japanese and if you are\n&gt; interested I did get the Japanese which came with the\n&gt; portraits...however the webmaster didn&#39;t include text for every single\n&gt; image...oh and for those of you to ~afraid~ to deal with the fish I\n&gt; did prebabel text for you too...you can download the file at\n&gt; http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3\n&gt; file name:NakajimaN (SMALL files on word~fast download 362kb)\n&gt; password:makoto\n&gt; \n&gt; ***there is a high possibility that somewhere along the lines I may\n&gt; have switched someone&#39;s name...it is because I&#39;ve been working on this\n&gt; for 2 days...during work 15-20 min breaks...so it was tough\n\n\n"
