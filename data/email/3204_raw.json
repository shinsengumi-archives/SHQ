By the way, yahoogroups keeps on posting my messages=\r\n twice!\n\n~Seven\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; [The following post was written by Hirotada TOkugawa---yaho=\r\nogroups is \n&gt; not posting his message]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;people in Kyoto were\n&gt; &gt; gener=\r\nally pro-Choshu.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to point out for the sake of argument, Seven=\r\n, the following \n&gt; song which was popular in Kyoto in the spring of Bunkyu =\r\n3 (1863), \n&gt; upon Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s entry into Kyoto (during the torren=\r\nt of \n&gt; Choshu-sponsored assassinations):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Aizu Higo-sama Kyoto Shugos=\r\nhoku tsutomemasu\n&gt; Dairi hanjou de kuge andon\n&gt; toko-Yo no naka you gansu.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (Akama Shizuko, &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Nazo.&quot; Tokyo: Shin \n&gt; J=\r\ninbutsu Oraisha, 1998, p. 36)\n&gt; \n&gt; (This can end &quot;you gansho&quot; depending on =\r\nwhose version you&#39;re looking \n&gt; at. Also, &quot;toko&quot; is just an onomatopoeia us=\r\ned in Japanese folk songs)\n&gt; \n&gt; A rough translation:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lord Aizu Higo i=\r\ns Kyoto Protector\n&gt; The Palace prospers, the nobles are relieved\n&gt; All is r=\r\night with the world again&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people in Kyoto may have supported Cho=\r\nshu, especially as time \n&gt; went on, but think about it: how logical is it f=\r\nor &quot;most&quot; of the \n&gt; residents of a city to like the people who go slinking =\r\naround at \n&gt; night murdering, and who, given a chance, wanted to burn their=\r\n city \n&gt; to the ground? This is not to excuse Aizu from blame: there was, f=\r\nor \n&gt; example, a recorded instance of Aizu men wanting to torch Nishi-\n&gt; Ho=\r\nnganji for hiding Choshu runaways in 1864. (see \n&gt; http://homepage3.nifty.c=\r\nom/naitouhougyoku/frame11/jinmei-ka.htm) \n&gt; However, the monk who was doing=\r\n the hiding, named Kawai Zenjun, was \n&gt; from Aizu, and reported the intent =\r\nof those men to the Aizu \n&gt; authorities, who promptly reined them in. After=\r\n all torching Nishi \n&gt; Honganji was a violation of Aizu&#39;s military codes, t=\r\nhe Rules for \n&gt; Commanders and Rules For Soldiers (which Aizu had compiled =\r\nhalf a \n&gt; century previously)-- these codes clearly state that unnecessary =\r\n\n&gt; destruction of &quot;civilian&quot; property (such as Nishi Honganji) was \n&gt; prohi=\r\nbited. The codes appear in Japanese, together with others such \n&gt; as the Ai=\r\nzu house code, here: \n&gt; http://homepage3.nifty.com/naitouhougyoku/frame11/j=\r\ninmei-ka.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Could someone here help me and provide\n&gt; &gt; book citation=\r\ns?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I agree-- if anyone has a citation-- not simply a book title, =\r\n\n&gt; but an actual passage from a book, complete with a page number and \n&gt; bi=\r\nbliographic citation (title, author, publisher, year)-- please \n&gt; share it.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
