Souji loved the vice-\nleader of the \n&gt; armed police, Toshizou Hijikata....&quot;\n&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101403/\n&gt; \n&gt; Originally written as a stageplay by Kouhei Tsuka, this film casts \nalso Ken \n&gt; Watanabe in the role of Ryoma who fell in love with Soji.\n&gt; I&#39;ve never seen this film until now for some reasons, but finaly \nI&#39;m getting \n&gt; to like it.\n&gt; Although the story is slapstick, it shows symbolically some \nhistorical \n&gt; aspects, I think.\n&gt; Actors are good and we can see fangirls screaming to Okita, \nHijikata writing \n&gt; his famous love poetry, sharpnesse of Kotetsu giving satisfaction \nto Kondo,and \n&gt; an interesting charactor of Izo Okada etc...\n&gt; If you have a chance to get this film, I can recommend it.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can see the cover of DVD and some photos here,\n&gt; http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/dvd/HP/bakumatu/\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
