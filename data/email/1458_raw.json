Though the practice of surrogating has always been around and continues to this day, I don&#39;t think people have as much contact with it as they do adoption in general and it may be difficult to accept how a couple could purposely produce or relinquish a child, especially when part of the driving force is loyalty to something as broad as keeping Aizu strong.  And as difficult as it seems to fathom how a woman could do what Tokio did (and others have done, before and since), she may have cared for this relative of hers and felt both blessed and honored that she could do this for her as well as an Aizu family.  Of course she felt something... those 9 months do\n something to you... but from everything I&#39;ve learned about Tokio on this list, this was a very strong woman with a loyalty to her homeland as strong as her husband&#39;s and an ability to live a life of her own instead of simply through her husband and children.\n \nWhat I&#39;m curious about is why Tatsuo was upset about the news... upset with his adoptive family or with the Fujitas?  Or the relative who spilled the beans and changed his perceptions of himself?\n \nphil (going back to throwing up... stupid chicken yakisoba...)\n\n&quot;GBattista (hajimenokizu)&quot; &lt;wounds@...&gt; wrote:\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I would like to say THANK YOU to our Japanese friends who cleared up\n&gt; once and for all that Tatsuo was adopted OUT of the family to the\n&gt; Numazawa family.  I was like the only person who stubbornly insisted\n&gt; that he was adopted INTO the family---I apologize for the \nconfusion -_-\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.1to5.net/saito/family/family.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been thinking about Tokio and the anguish she must have felt\n&gt; her whole life about adopting out her last child.  The website\n&gt; mentions Tokio&#39;s letter to Tatsuo one month before Fujita Goro \ndied. \n&gt; We can only wonder about the words a mother would write to a son she\n&gt; had to give away.\n&gt; \n\nWell we can speculate... However a few days ago I was IM&#39;ng with Phil \nand she turned me into the reason that they gave their last son away \nor had their last son because that Aizu retainer needed to continue \ntheir family name. Although I did not really agree with her because I \nfound the reason a bit unacceptable in my point of view, being an \nadopted person myself.\n\nWhich leads me to wonder how exactly did Tatsuo react after \naccidentally learning of that fact. I seem to remember this was \ndiscussed several months ago, he was pretty angry at the situation. \nSo maybe Tokio wrote him a letter to apologize? Did she realize that \nher child&#39;s life wasn&#39;t theirs to do as they wish? I know a number \nwon&#39;t agree with me since as Phil pointed out, I&#39;m applying 20th \ncentury values to the Meiji... But even if we don&#39;t speak about \nvalues, let&#39;s just go through a normal person&#39;s psyche, Tatsuo&#39;s \nreaction is not surprising as basically he would see himself not \ntreated the same way as his siblings, he was given away... \n\nWell I better stop here...\n\n~wounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
