I w=\r\nant to see!\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kirasaige&quot; &lt;pilgrimscribe5@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The other day I was talking with a co-worker. He was looking ove=\r\nr \nall \n&gt; the Japanese paraphenelia I have at my cubicle and asked if I spo=\r\nke \n&gt; or read Japanese. Unfortunately I read none and my speech is well \n&gt; =\r\nenough to get me around but not fluent.\n&gt; He said that back in the 60&#39;s he =\r\nhad purchases a Habachi in Japan \nfor \n&gt; $20. The drawers were all swollen =\r\nshut from the humidity. When he \nhad \n&gt; finally dried the desk out and was =\r\nable to open the drawers he \nfound \n&gt; inside a box and inside that box was =\r\na scroll. He hired a \ntranslator \n&gt; but the language was too old for the tr=\r\nanslator and all he could \n&gt; translate was the writing on the box that said=\r\n Commodore Perry.\n&gt; At this point my jaw dropped to the ground. And I tried=\r\n not to \nlaugh \n&gt; when he said that that dated the scroll back to the 1700&#39;=\r\ns lol. I \n&gt; politely corrected him. :)\n&gt; So the reason he was asking me if =\r\ni read Japanese was he wanted to \n&gt; see if I could translate it. I couldn&#39;t=\r\n but my bestfriend&#39;s mother \n&gt; might. Her mother grew up in a Buddhist Temp=\r\nle and is very \ninterested \n&gt; in her history. \n&gt; So he&#39;s going to bring the=\r\n scroll in and have my friends mom \n&gt; translate it. I&#39;m so excited!! I can&#39;=\r\nt wait to actually touch a \npeice \n&gt; of history that I love so much.\n&gt; I&#39;ll=\r\n keep everyone informed when i get it. I&#39;ll take pictures and \n&gt; post them =\r\nsomewhere for all to see. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kira\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
