Maybe ol&#39; Saigou did have reason to be concerned about him, after all.  Even though he&#39;s picking up some bad habits as we learn more (bad in the sense he wasn&#39;t so &quot;pure&quot; as Watsuki made him in RK), I&#39;m liking him more and more as he becomes more real.  Sounds like he could&#39;ve had a bit of the pirate in him.  (Yeah, yeah... I know... it was war.)  I can see aspects of Tsukioka Tsunan/Katsu in him.  This is *so* much fun!\n\n&gt;&gt;As Masayoshi already clarified, his previous name was\n&quot;Kojima Shirou Masamitsu&quot; (can&#39;t say &quot;Koshima&quot;,\nthough).&lt;&lt;\n\nSo in other words, the surname is actually Kojima, NOT Koshima for any reason... that somewhere along the line someone has translated it wrong and it&#39;s been propagating as misinformation?  If I&#39;m going to set up a site for this man, the least I can do is either stop reproducing the error or explain how it could be spelled either way.\nThanks for all the clarifications and the chance to engage in some discussion about him.  I feel so... alone... when it comes to Sagara and the Sekihoutai.\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo!
