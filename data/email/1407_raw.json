He was about 25 in 1868, correct? But what \n&gt; about Okita?\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought it was pretty much settled that he was 25 when he died \nin \n&gt; 1868. Most sites I know of list his birth year as 1844. It&#39;s also \n&gt; said that he was 10 years younger than Kondo, who was born in \n1834. \n&gt; But is this absolutely true?\n&gt; \n&gt; One site did mention that there was a possibility that Okita might \n&gt; have been born in 1842. It also gives the date of 1844 and says \nthat \n&gt; it has been handed down through the family that he was 25 when he \n&gt; died. But then it makes the bizarre claim, without any explanation \n&gt; why, that it&#39;s now &quot;generally accepted&quot; he was born in 1842. \n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any insight into this?\n&gt; \n&gt; The site is:\n&gt; http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~sohzi/about_Okita.html\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s in Japanese of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin\n\n\nHis exact year of birth is not known. \nIn the document which remains in Okita&#39;s house, there are data that \nSouji was 20 years old in Bunkyu 3 (1863), and it is the basis of \nthe opinion in 1844. \n(Please calculate by kazoedoshi.)\nAnd it is the basis of the opinion in 1842 which was written to be \n22 years old to the list of names when participating in Roushi-tai. \nRecently, the opinion in 1842 is said to be leading. That is because \nthese list of names are the documents of a public institution. \n\nIn my memory, when I got to know Shinsengumi, almost all researchers \nwere writing the opinion in 1844. \n(Incidentally, it is about 18 years ago that I got to know \nShinsengumi.) \nIn the world of manga, since there is a tendency which makes age of \nthe character young, most works set up Souji in the opinion in 1844. \n^^;\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
