At first glance you might think he was Mifune;\nboth had pretty long and distinguished acting careers.\nKinnosuke Nakamura is Okita as that website pointed\nout, this movie is one of his earliest roles. Both\nKataoka and Nakamura had a bunch of roles where they\nplayed the leading actors in the same movie in the\n1950�s.  Not too long after this movie they played in\na trilogy based on the story you know as �Sword of\nDoom� with Kataoka playing the mad swordsman and\nNakamura playing the young avenging brother.\n \n This Shinsengumi movie is one that definitely\ndeserves to be subtitled. I can�t give you too many\ndetails, but based on memory the story starts out with\nthe Shinsengumi storming the Ikedeya Inn right away\nwith some really fast swordplay as I remember.\nEventually they deal with the Ito Kashitaro group\ndefection and the movie ends near the battle of Toba\nand Fushimi. There are some love interests in the\nstory for both the main characters and I remember that\nnear the end the group burns the Makoto flag as a\nsymbolic ceremony of their group ending.\n\nKevin\n\n--- spiritus_saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Is that Toshiro Mifune in the foreground?  Hey,\n&gt; Kevin!!  What&#39;s it all about? \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online. File on time.\nhttp://taxes.yahoo.com/filing.html\n\n"
