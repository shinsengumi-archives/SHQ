Perhaps he speaks of himself and those he came in contact with in \nsuch a way that he comes across as a general &quot;nice guy&quot;.\n\nI know that I would certainly LOVE to learn more about the Shinsengumi \nmembers not only during their time in Kyoto but also before and after. \nMaybe, just maybe the Hillsborough book will give us that. I was able to \nget his Samurai Sketches through the library and I thought it was very \nwell done, it&#39;s a definite &quot;have to buy&quot; book on my list.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
