Or is it his\nwife&#39;s name or something...it is in the same sentence talking about\nhis firearms shop.  This detail interests me because orchids are very\nhard to cultivate ^_^ you really have to have a green thumb to have\nthem grow successfully.\nActually, what Nakajima Nobori grew was aspidistra! It&#39;s a type of a greenery \nthat is actually fairly hardy once it gets to going good. At least, that&#39;s \nhow the system I&#39;m using translates the name.\n\nThe other Saito is the guy who was adopted (if I&#39;m reading this right). He \nwas apparently some sort of priest or in a priest&#39;s family to begin with. He \ntook part in the Koshu-Katsunuma fight, but left the remaining Shinsengumi in \nSendai. He later founded a private elementary school in Tama and remained devoted \nto education-related business until he died in 1874 at 61 years of age. It \nseems doubtful that he was ever part of the group before the beginning of the \nBoshin War.\n\nAs for what the translator I use says about Saito&#39;s activities? It&#39;s not much \nbetter than the Babelfish, but here it goes:\n\n&quot;...and I utter Morizaki at the third morning, and I many soldiers reach full \nIchio, too and halve a police superintendent second-rate platoon and I lead a \nhalf captain Goro Fujita half platoon and put soldiers of the army together \nand I lead progress, a squad long Masato Yusa half platoon and put right ways \ntogether with army soldier and go over a secret path day flat peak and attack \nit and I outrun and enemy&#39;s fortress of Tsuruwa mountain pass and (?) and climb \nYamagami of an above-ground house. (?) than this and lead a soldier of the \nGoro Fujita right wing and go over Fukuhara Pass and shoot a final phase, an \nenemy&#39;s fortress in (?), and, in addition, omission pushes forward a soldier to \nan above-ground house, and (?) bombards this promptly and carries a this time \nGoro Fujita gunshot wound equal to this on my back...&quot;\n\nSo it doesn&#39;t make much more sense this way than it did the other. That&#39;s why \nI like to cross-reference between translators as much as possible. Even then, \nsome things remain confusing to me.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
