The Shinsengumi/Edoji/& Spy division have a  an excelle=\r\nnt \nhome and message board going all thanks to the sweat and  blood of \nthe=\r\n presistant fans that keep the mailing lists going  strong.  My \nidea was, =\r\nhow &#39;bout we make a chatroom?    Maybe not on the actual \nsite but on mIRC.=\r\n.. Somewhere were we can all  meet and chit chat \nabout everything and anyt=\r\nhing that comes to  mind.   It&#39;ll be a great \nway to get to know the memebe=\r\nrs of  the 3 mailing lists.
