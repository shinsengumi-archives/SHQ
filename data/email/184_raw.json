People who\nrepresented &quot;Bu&quot;, warriors were placed nearly at the same level as\nthose who represented &quot;Boon&quot; that is the thinkers/advisors. Boon&Bu\nare &quot;supposed&quot; to assist the leader in making decisions.\n\nMany books out there will as you mentioned give the definition to\nbushido as &quot;the way a samurai is supposed to conduct himself&quot; perhaps\nthis is due to the elaboration of the meaning during the Tokugawa\nperiod when things were ~relatively~ peaceful---and there was a need\nto redefine their roles?  During the Tokugawa many samurai added more\n&quot;peaceful&quot; aspects to their way of life right (popularity of zen,\ncalligraphy, and flower arrangement &lt;- this one still shocks me but I\ndefinately read this in a book on samurai!)?  So for non practitioners\nwho just read anything that comes our way the definition of bushido\nitself is far removed from its origins (99.9% of the writers do not\npractice martial arts and therefore can&#39;t tap into the warrior aspect\nof the samurai).\n\nIf you guys have a chance, join e-budo.com and read the posts to get\nan idea of what others are thinking and there are some really\nknowledgeable posters some of whom have all these characteristics\n1)know the language 2)research 3)practice martial arts (some for\nseveral decades).\n\nMy favorite post is &quot;Rural swordsmen beat urban &quot;Zen&quot; swordsmen&quot; which\nreminds me of Kondo and company moving into Kyoto :)\nE-Budo.com &gt; Koryu Bujutsu &gt; Sword Arts &gt; Rural swordsmen beat urban\n&quot;Zen&quot; swordsmen\nhttp://www.e-budo.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?s=2ae32c79ca36fe0c19b56ae7bbdfda37&threadid=22266&highlight=Rural+swordsmen+beat\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jon Mesina&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; These are just some thoughts I wanted to share since it relates to\nthe samurai in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; This whole week i&#39;ve been attending a seminar for Suio Ryu headed by\nthe headmaster who came from Japan. Tonight was one night that had\nprobably one of the most interesting discussions of the week. Our\nheadmaster was presented with a scroll with the kanji for &quot;bushido&quot; on\nit which was written by one of the grandfather&#39;s of one of the students. \n&gt; \n&gt; Our headmaster then told us the meaning of the word bushido, which\npointed to it&#39;s simplest meaning, yet I and many others never saw of\nit as this way. He broke down the meaning of the strokes in the first\nkanji &quot;bu&quot; and told us it basically meant &quot;to stop conflict&quot;. &quot;shi&quot;\nrefers to a person i.e. samurai. And &quot;do&quot; the way. But basically he\nsaid it means &quot;The way of stopping conflict&quot;. He then asked how do you\nstop conflict. Thinkuing to the hisotry of Japan, the only way to stop\nconflict is to produce conflict. To fight. To suppress the enemy so\nthat you cease their ability to produce conflict.   \n&gt; \n&gt; From this, I could see the truth behind the word. Bushido is not\nwhat is written in books about the samurai code, the way a samurai is\nsupposed to conduct himself, it&#39;s true meaning is simply in the way of\ncombat, the way of the warrior. \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
