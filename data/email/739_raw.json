Note as seen in\nMibugishiden when HIjikata yells to his men to use their swords at\nclose range---that was common sense to me too (use guns in an ambush\nand use swords to &quot;finish off&quot; the enemy).  Nakajima Nobori (who\nshould at least be the background of PMK---I insist!) also painted a\nportrait of one of the older members of the Shinsengumi manning a\ncannon.  I believe one of the Japanese websites also lists a member of\nthe Shinsengumi who taught gunnery.  Well, the group photo of Fujita\nGoro shows him with a rifle.  So he must&#39;ve been knowledgeable of its\nuse.  \n\nIn terms of Aizu...it was just outdated cannons vs. &quot;newer&quot; government\ncannons so when it came down to it---it was about the money.  \n\n\n\n\n"
