I\nhaven&#39;t had the honor nor the pleasure to meet him in\nperson, but I have seen him (in videotape) performing\nsome Suio Ryu katas and it was pretty impressive.\n\n \n&gt; From this, I could see the truth behind the word.\n&gt; Bushido is not what is written in books about the\n&gt; samurai code, the way a samurai is supposed to\n&gt; conduct himself, it&#39;s true meaning is simply in the\n&gt; way of combat, the way of the warrior. \n\n\nWell, since you drew such conclusion after the literal\nanalysis of the kanji (ideograms) for &quot;Bushido&quot;, I\nsuggest you doing the same with the kanji for\n&quot;Samurai&quot;. It&#39;s pretty curious :)\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online. File on time.\nhttp://taxes.yahoo.com/filing.html\n\n"
