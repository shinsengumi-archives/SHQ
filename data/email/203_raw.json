A majority of \nJapanese people at the time practiced a synthesis of Shintoism and \nBuddhism (many many sects/interepretations)...S.H. was buried at the \ntemple of Amitabha Buddha so (I&#39;m guessing that he was a Pure Land \nBuddhist).  As mentioned by Serizawa Kamo he may have practiced \nMugai ryu kenjutsu (NOT iaijutsu/iaido(?)) which survives today and \nhas websites.  Mugai ryu is heavily influenced by Buddhism---but \nofcourse we don&#39;t know the extent of S.H.&#39;s devotion/piousness.  \nMugai ryu emphasizes swordsmanship hand in hand with Buddhist \nbeliefs.\n\nIn Buddhist meditation you want to cultivate awareness by observing \nthe breath and mental fluctuations...so maybe this is what \nhistorical S.H. was aiming for.  Hindu-Buddhist beliefs in \nreincarnation aside, all we know for sure is that no one can \nremember their birth but they -can- experience their death (if they \ndie naturally).  Back then I don&#39;t think people had/used painkillers \nso someone in S.H.&#39;s situation had to suffer a really long time \n(gastric ulcers -symptoms- can take years before it becomes fatal). \nMany people today who pass on in hospitals lose consciousness long \nbefore their last breathe. So maybe S.H. was thinking along these \nlines...he was a policeman and soldier, he had a life filled with \nviolence (I don&#39;t think he forgot the people he killed even in cases \nof self defense) and I&#39;m sure his own mortality was on his mind alot.\n\nMy last and lamest interpretation was that he may not have died like \nthis for -himself- but as a gift to his family who would ofcourse \nfind him in this way.  Like a testament to them about all of his \nprior actions, all of his intentions.  A way for them to never \nforget him and how he lived.  His last demonstration of strength and \nwill after a prolonged illness and turbulent life.  Recall in RK OVA \nRemembrance when Kaoru&#39;s mother or father&#39;s (I can&#39;t recall) body is \non the futon and the person&#39;s face is covered with a small white \nclothe...the impact of a loved one&#39;s passing is devastating enough \nnow how is this different from find that person sitting in the seiza \nposition after he had been confined to a sick bed for so long?\n\nIt is raining where I am so such gloomy thoughts emerge easily.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ofcourse, I have not found an explanation for the significane of \ndying \n&gt; while sitting in the seiza position which was mentioned on either \n&gt; http://1to5.net or http://www.3-hajime.com...so I posted this \nquestion at the \n&gt; www.e-budo.com forum under the username Fujita Makoto :P\n&gt; E-Budo.com &gt; Koryu Bujutsu &gt; Koryu: History and Tradition &gt; \n&gt; hopefully I will get some replies!\n\nhttp://www.e-budo.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?\ns=0821e662fbae3bd9598e80507c742c62&threadid=25441\n\n\n"
