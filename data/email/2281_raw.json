Takeshi has ONE fangirl alive and kicking in this world.  :-D  (He was WAY too old for the role... no argument about that... but I liked the take on the torment inside the man.)  Now that I think about it, Gohatto was my TRUE introduction to the Shinsengumi... I saw the film long before RK... but I didn&#39;t make the connection until after I saw RK.  And it was Takeshi&#39;s performance that made me think of the film and how much I had liked it... enough for me to pick it up as a possible purchase one day and go &quot;WOW!!!  THAT WAS ABOUT THE SHINSENGUMI!&quot;  Of course, there was no question of me purchasing it then.  :-D  It was my first piece of Shinsengumi merchandise.\n \nphil\n \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
