I&#39;ve had no access to th=\r\ne internet all day (and it was torture to be away from you guys!)\n \nSince I=\r\n can&#39;t paste kanji into the yahoo mailer and get it to come out displayed c=\r\norrectly, the best I can do is guide you to where it is in the article.  If=\r\n you use the translator that wounds alerted us to the other day (http://www=\r\n.nifty.com/globalgate/ -- paste in the URL and in the drop-down menu undern=\r\neath, choose the second option, then hit the button to the right of that), =\r\nin the main text box (ignoring the top box which is the article title), it&#39;=\r\ns in the seventh paragraph (Nifty gives you first the paragraph of kanji, t=\r\nhen the English, then the next paragraph of kanji, etc.)  Since I don&#39;t rea=\r\nd kanji at all, I couldn&#39;t tell you where it is... I just know the paragrap=\r\nh.\n \nThe URL for the text is http://sara1.gotdns.com/~ark24/suzuki003.html =\r\n\n \nFor anyone interested in how Nifty translated it:\n \n&gt;&gt;Moreover, although=\r\n it is said that the thief went into the Suzuki family in Meiji 44 on the N=\r\new Year&#39;s Day The sword then put on the alcove (Saburo Miki has the Bizen N=\r\nagafune =97S=92=E8 with fierce god Kunishige Maru) the direction of a fierc=\r\ne god circle -- &quot;-- turn off this sword well -- it prizes with =82=E9&quot; and =\r\n=8E=E9=8F=E2 is quite showy -- making -- coming out -- seemingly it was -- =\r\nextracting -- &quot;-- get -- =82=C1 -- if it goes as &quot; -- a thief -- the force =\r\n-- overwhelming -- having -- the way way -- it is said that it escaped by =\r\n=82=C4=82=A2 &lt;&lt;\n\nAs you can see, it deals with the sword a little different=\r\nly than babelfish did.  Sec, you should run an article about Saitou&#39;s sword=\r\n through and see if it translates it any differently...\n\nphil (off to play =\r\ncatch-up with her mail)\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yaho=\r\no!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
