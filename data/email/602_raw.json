Wouldn&#39;t it be great, people will \nimmediately know we belong to the same group just by the flag... \nExcellent idea...\n\nBy the way... I hope this doesn&#39;t just apply to rkdreams... Would it \nbe okay if I used this also in other forums that I frequent? It would \nbe good exposure to the group. I&#39;m a member of several anime, \nstreamload, pocketpc and tech forums.\n\nI tried it on one site already the first banner is working but the \none for the Shinsengumi Message board is not... Do you have any ideas?\n\nOh if you want me to take it off. Let me know... :)\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;tnamwong@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I made a banner for SHQ.com to use in my sig at rkdreams...the\n&gt; screencap  of the flag is from http://www.jag.cx/Kenshin/ (I emailed\n&gt; the owner of the site to inform him/her)\n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shqbutton.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; So if any of you are joining rkdreams in the future you can add this\n&gt; to your sig:\n&gt; [img]http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shqbutton.jpg[/img][img]\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/1mbbutton.jpg[/img]\n&gt; the banners look better with the Shinsengumihq.com banner on the \nleft\n&gt; and the Shinsengumimb.com banner on the right so the images kind of\n&gt; sandwich the webaddresses\n&gt; \n&gt; If any of you become part of the rkdreams community I highly \nrecommend\n&gt; that you conduct patrols in groups and arm yourself to the\n&gt; teeth...from the background color of the site (skillfully set to\n&gt; replicate the Battousai&#39;s hair) we can draw logical conclusions on\n&gt; their political stance.  I noticed that many threads discuss fanfic\n&gt; which has become part of our canon so writers who feel\n&gt; underappreciated will be able to eavesdrop on fans there.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Fun Site\n&gt; http://hikarikat.com/sher/Saitoh/\n\n\n"
