True?\n \nIt of the meaning of kanji is a correct answer.\nHowever, a family name of Japan may have the historical origin.\nA Japanese kanji has the pronunciation from which some kinds are\ndifferent in one character.\n&quot;wisteria&quot; has the pronunciation of &quot;tou&quot; and &quot;fuji&quot;.\nAlthough you will probably know, &quot;tou&quot; of &quot;Saitou&quot; and &quot;Fuji&quot; of\n&quot;Fujita&quot; are the same characters(=wisteria).\n \nFirst of all, please bear it in mind.\n \nThere are many family names which &quot;tou&quot; attaches in Japan.\nSaitou, Satou, Katou, Itou, etc.\n(A character called this &quot;tou&quot; is changed into &quot;dou&quot; depending on the\ncase.\n&quot;dou&quot; of &quot;Kondou&quot; is also &quot;wisteria&quot;. There are other family names,\nsuch as Andou, Shindou, and Kudou.)\nThe family name of these &quot;tou&quot; is considered to be the posterity of\nFujiwara of the aristocrat of\nthe Heian period (From A.D. 794 to A.D. 1192) . &quot;Fuji&quot; of &quot;Fujiwara&quot; =\n&quot;wisteria&quot;.\nThe Fujiwara clan had huge power in the Imperial Court. And they got\nvarious court ranks.\nThere was a status called &quot;Saiou&quot;.\nThis is the duty which serves the goddess of the Ise Shrine as the\nEmperor&#39;s representative.\nThe Emperor family&#39;s unmarried woman is chosen and she becomes &quot;Saiou&quot;.\nThe castle in which &quot;Saiou&quot; lives was called &quot;Saiguu&quot;.\nThere, it was also the public office for &quot;Saiou&quot;.\nThe director general of &quot;Saiguu&quot; was called &quot;Saiguu no kashira&quot;.\nThe origin of the family name of &quot;Saitou&quot; is &quot;Fujiwara&quot; which acquired\nthe status of &quot;saiguu no kasira&quot;.\n&quot;Sai&quot; of &quot;Saiguu no kashira&quot; + &quot;Fuji(=tou)&quot; of &quot;Fujiwara&quot;.\n \nHowever, since Saitou Hajime changed the family name, it is not\napplied to this.\n&quot;Yamaguchi&quot; which is the true family name of Saitou means it as the\nentrance of a mountain.\nYama = Mountain + guchi(=kuchi) = Although it is originally the\nmeaning of a &quot;mouth&quot;, it is an &quot;entrance&quot; in this case.\nProbably, his ancestor would be related to the land.\n\n[secretarytocapt3 read somewhere that his mother was a\nfarmer...perhaps totally unrelated]\n\nIt was easy to change a family name a long time ago.\nNow, the family name of &quot;tou&quot; is hardly related to &quot;Fujiwara&quot;.\n \nSupplement:\nWhy Yamaguchi Hajime chose Saitou as the assumed name does not remain\nin record.\nIn a report, the expert of the sword of a family name called Saitou is\nin sword style &quot;Mugai-ryuu&quot; which he studied,\nand it is said that it became a basis.\n \n[secretarytocapt3 reminder...babelfish translates mugai-ryu as No\nouter form or &quot;Outside style nothing&quot;  as Serizawa Kamo used to\nmention the iaido of mugai-ryu is active today (they have websites)] \n \nAlthough remembered in the talk of a family name, it sometimes sees\nanalyzing the kanji of the name of characters at the site of RK.\nIn fact, if it is Japanese RK fan, there is a certain fact which all\nthe members almost know.\nMost family names of the characters who appear in RK originate in the\nname of a place of Niigata Prefecture which is the hometown of Watsuki\nNobuhiro.\n \nKamiya, Nagaoka, Sanjyou, Tsubame, Tsukioka, Tsunan, Isurugi,\nMakimachi, Mishima, Kashiwazaki, Kujiranami, etc.\nThese are a city in Niigata Prefecture, and the name of an area.\n \n&quot;Yuukyuuzan&quot; is the Yuukyuu mountain.\n \n&quot;Sadojima&quot; is the Sado island.\n \n&quot;Yahiko&quot; is the Yahiko shrine.\n&quot;myoujin&quot; which is the family name of Yahiko is the title of God of\nShintoism.\n \nhttp://www2.pref.niigata.jp/kankou/en_sight.nsf/31114b4c20e7417c49256a1c0020319e/cc5a9b75376ea64149256a2c002e18bc?OpenDocument\n \n\n&quot;Aoshi&quot; is the Aoshi shrine.\nNeighboring residents call this area &quot;Aoshi no mori&quot;. (Woods of Aoshi.)\nAoshi no mori &gt; Aoshi shi no mori &gt; Aoshi shino mori &gt; Aoshi shinomori\n&gt; Shinomori Aoshi........hehehe.\n \nhttp://www2.pref.niigata.jp/kankou/en_sight.nsf/31114b4c20e7417c49256a1c0020319e/05828c27e840b15949256a2c002e42b6?OpenDocument\n \nThe reply of yesterday&#39;s mail is written independently later.\n \nGood-bye .\nP.S.\nShinsengumi Themed Merchandising, Promo, wishlist and WHAT IF?  &gt; \nForget the Beer, try the wine!\n \nAlthough the wine of a site which Warg3791 looked at is a name of\n&quot;Yukari no hito&quot;(Those who are related to Hakodate),\nthere is wine of a more fearful name in Hakodate.\nWith red wine, the name is &quot;Hijikata Toshizou no chi&quot;(Blood of\nHijikata Toshizou).\nAlthough I have it, I am fearful and am not drinking.\n \nhttp://www.ne.jp/asahi/harinotubuyaki/kyoya-rui/image/hatago/hakodate2.html\n (There is nothing at my site. )\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Serizawa Kamo &lt;serizawakamo@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Fuji: Wisteria(?). &quot;Tou&quot; is the &quot;Chinese&quot; way\n&gt; (actually, a Japanese way to pronouncing the Chinese\n&gt; pronunciation) for &quot;Fuji&quot;, which is a 100% Japanese\n&gt; way of reading it.\n&gt; Ta: Farm (actually, the original meaning is rice\n&gt; plantation)\n&gt; \n&gt; Go: five\n&gt; Rou: man\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n"
