This book was published about 20 years =\r\naga and was \n&gt; targeted at young adults.  It was pretty good.  Several of t=\r\nhe \n&gt; characters are based on historical figures.  I think that \nMatsudaira=\r\n \n&gt; makes an appearance, but I do not remember if the Shinsengumi do.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hirotada Tokugawa&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think some people might enjoy this--\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The newspaper &quot;The=\r\n North-China Herald,&quot; in its article on 25 \nSept. \n&gt; 1868 \n&gt; &gt; (&quot;The Albion=\r\n at Neegata&quot;), describes Henry Schnell-- the Prussian \n&gt; gun runner \n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\no became a senior councilor serving Matsudaira Katamori.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Apparentl=\r\ny, he wore a kimono top, silk haori, red obi, either 2 \n&gt; Japanese \n&gt; &gt; swo=\r\nrds or one European cavalry saber, had his hair combed back \nfrom \n&gt; the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; forehead, and wore trousers and long boots. Everyone bowed \nwhenever \n&gt; =\r\nthey saw \n&gt; &gt; him, and he was always accompanied by officials and a retinue=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am SURE he crossed paths with Hijikata Toshizo.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anywa=\r\ny, this might present somewhat of an interesting challenge \nto \n&gt; those of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; you wanting to study or draw clothing of that era. I know I \nintend \n&gt;=\r\n to do a \n&gt; &gt; drawing of him in that outfit ASAP-- sounds delightfully ecle=\r\nctic!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -M.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P.S. But I think Hijikata in his suit looks coo=\r\nler. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
