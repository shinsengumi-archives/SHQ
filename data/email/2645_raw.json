This book was published about 20 years aga and =\r\nwas \ntargeted at young adults.  It was pretty good.  Several of the \ncharac=\r\nters are based on historical figures.  I think that Matsudaira \nmakes an ap=\r\npearance, but I do not remember if the Shinsengumi do.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Hirotada Tokugawa&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think some peo=\r\nple might enjoy this--\n&gt; \n&gt; The newspaper &quot;The North-China Herald,&quot; in its =\r\narticle on 25 Sept. \n1868 \n&gt; (&quot;The Albion at Neegata&quot;), describes Henry Sch=\r\nnell-- the Prussian \ngun runner \n&gt; who became a senior councilor serving Ma=\r\ntsudaira Katamori.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apparently, he wore a kimono top, silk haori, red o=\r\nbi, either 2 \nJapanese \n&gt; swords or one European cavalry saber, had his hai=\r\nr combed back from \nthe \n&gt; forehead, and wore trousers and long boots. Ever=\r\nyone bowed whenever \nthey saw \n&gt; him, and he was always accompanied by offi=\r\ncials and a retinue.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am SURE he crossed paths with Hijikata Toshizo.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, this might present somewhat of an interesting challenge to \nt=\r\nhose of \n&gt; you wanting to study or draw clothing of that era. I know I inte=\r\nnd \nto do a \n&gt; drawing of him in that outfit ASAP-- sounds delightfully ecl=\r\nectic!\n&gt; \n&gt; -M.\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. But I think Hijikata in his suit looks cooler. :)=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
