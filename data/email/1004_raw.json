Welcome to this wonderful mailing list. \n&gt; Not trying to lift our own bench here but I can assure you that if \n&gt; you&#39;re looking to learn more about the Shinsengumi, this is \n&gt; the &quot;English&quot; place to be. Certainly there are Japanese sites out \n&gt; there but I don&#39;t think any other &quot;English&quot; group can compare to \n&gt; this one. Who is your favorite Shinsengumi? What is your favorite \n&gt; Anime? Manga? Live-action? Hope to hear from you soon.\n\nThanks so much for welcoming mina-san! hehe wellz my favorite \nShinsengumi would have to be either Okita or Saitou (for now) heh \nhmmm my favorite anime and manga thats a tough one! i like all of \nthem so far errr well the ones ive seen/read. (I&#39;ve seen Rurouni \nKenshin, and read Kaze Hikaru and im wanting to see Peacemaker \nKurogane &gt;&lt;)  \n\n\n"
