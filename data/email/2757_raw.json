Very likely researchers in\ndifferent cultures =\r\nwill have a unique view of this part of Japanese\nhistory.  Most of what we =\r\nhave is -just- from the American and British\nperspective. Please share, we =\r\nwant to learn from you (also include the\nbook title, author, publisher and =\r\npublication date).  \n\nFor example, we know there were French soldiers, such=\r\n as Jules Brunet,\nin Hakodate RIGHT THERE WITH HIJIKATA....so perhaps betwe=\r\nen 1869 and\n2006 a French researcher may have written an article about the =\r\nFrench\ninvolvement in 1869 at the Republic of Ezo.  All these teeny tiny\nde=\r\ntails add up and help us understand the conditions in which the\nShinsengumi=\r\n (former Shinsengumi technically) fought.\n\nAnother good example is Ernest S=\r\natow.  He wasn&#39;t everywhere, nor did\nhe see everything himself but he did m=\r\nention &quot;&quot;Aidzu had occupied the\ncastle of Yodo, a few miles south of Kioto =\r\non the direct road, with\n500 of his own troops, and 300 of the Shinsen-gumi=\r\n, a recenty raised\nbody of Tokugawa infantry, had also proceeded thither, w=\r\nhile all along\nthe road small detachments were stationed.&quot; (Satow 305)\n\nTha=\r\nt isn&#39;t a big deal---but don&#39;t you feel ~better~ that -someone-\nbothered to=\r\n note the &quot;Shinsen-gumi&quot; (^_^).

This is the sword I&#39;ve \n&gt; seen on most webs=\r\nites being sold as &quot;Okita&#39;s favorite&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to some sources, afte=\r\nr that sword broke, he used a sword \n&gt; made by Yamatonokami Yasusada. The s=\r\nword was 2.2 shaku long \n&gt; according to a source at www.n-p-s.net/aitoh.htm=\r\n , but my \n&gt; photocopied page from a swordbook (name of book lost long ago)=\r\n says \n&gt; it was 2 shaku, 3 sun, and 6 bu long.\n&gt; \n&gt; On a side note, OishiKu=\r\nwajiro (known by the nickname&quot; \n&gt; hitokirikuwajiro) also used a sword made =\r\nby Yamatonokami Yasusada \n&gt; that was 2 shaku 5 sun in length according to t=\r\nhis site \n&gt; www.bakusin.com/jiten41.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Okita&#39;s most famous sword, th=\r\nough, was the &quot;Kikuichimonji&quot;, which \n&gt; was 2 shaku 4 sun 2 bu in length. T=\r\nhere is some speculation as to \n&gt; whether he actually owned such a valuable=\r\n sword, but we will \n&gt; probably never know if he really owned it since it w=\r\nas supposedly \n&gt; lost after he died. If you are interested in reading more =\r\nabout it, \n&gt; I recommend Shinsengumi Keppuroku by Shiba Ryotaro.\n&gt; \n&gt; As fa=\r\nr as the swords being accurate, for sure Hijikata&#39;s is \n&gt; accurate. Unfortu=\r\nnately the model on that page is the &quot;affordable \n&gt; model&quot;. The exact repli=\r\nca which is listed on Ozawa swords Japan is \n&gt; quite a bit more. \n&gt; \n&gt; Okit=\r\na&#39;s replica is in what they call handachi (han-dachi)mounts, \n&gt; literally &quot;=\r\nhalf tachi&quot; mounts, which come from the pre-edo periods \n&gt; where there was =\r\na transition from tachi to katana. Unfortunately, \n&gt; i&#39;ve seen conflicting =\r\ndata on if his Ichimonji blade was mounted in \n&gt; handachi mounts. He owned =\r\none other sword besides the Kiku Ichimonji \n&gt; and that one could have been =\r\nthe one mounted handachi style.&quot; I hope \n&gt; this will help you think better =\r\nand to tell ya we might not ever \n&gt; find his swords. Thanks for reading thi=\r\ns and I hope that someone \n&gt; will find them.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
