Why?\n\nSaito Hajime.  No one argues that he was one of the strongest \nswordsmen in the group.  I&#39;ve also got a soft spot in my heart for \nkenshi who liked to drink.\n \n&gt; 4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\n\nR Kenshin, read some Peacemaker Kurogane, Band of Assassins with \nMifune, Gohatto, Mibu Gishiden.  \n \n&gt; 5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do \nyou \n&gt; think captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?\n\nI personally really liked Mifune as Kondo.  I also liked the Saito \nportrayal in Mibu Gishiden, though it sent me into a rage that they \nput his swords on his right hip instead of the left. I&#39;ll buy that \nSaito had a left handed thrust or may have been naturally left \nhanded, but the conventions of the time had everyone growing up \nright handed.  Wearing his swords on the right hip woulda had him \nknocking saya with and having to fight everyone he came across.  It \njust didn&#39;t happen.\n\n&gt; 6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any \n&gt; particular Shinsengumi members or events?\n\nThe Saito swords on the right hip thing.  Outside of that no real \nbeefs with any of the Shinsengumi or their portrayals.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
