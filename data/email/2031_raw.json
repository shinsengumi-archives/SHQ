Thomas HISTORY OF JAPANESE EDUCATION.\nTokyo: The Hokuseido Press, 1937.\n\npage 177\n&quot;There is also a punishment known as &#39;kinshin&#39; which means putting \nthe delinquent in a state of respectful attentio or introspection.&quot;\n\n*this book also connects the Aizu Byakkotai with modern \nclubs/associations for boys (as it builds camaraderie)...for some \nreason these writers came across the Byakkotai while compiling the \nbook\n\nduring the Meiji there were local and national associations for boys \nwhich prepared them for conscription (and served as back up \ninformation gathering for the government)\n\nyou will note the printing date of 1937....I find that the older the \nbook the BETTER the information!\n\nfor example more modern books on Toshiyoshi Kawaji will eliminate \ndetails on how he may have slightly altered his information about \nWestern police models so that he can implement his goals and \ninterpretations...and not print his entire speeches...by the way he \nwas a good speaker from the translations I have...he gave some very \ngood arguments...also from the paintings of him he was a very \nforceful speaker as well in one painting of all the major &quot;players&quot; \nduring the Seinan War he was shown in a kimono yelling and shaking \nhis fist...as Saigo&#39;s former PROTEGE, Kawaji&#39;s stance in the SEinan \nWar made things very complicated to say the least\n\n\n\n\n\n"
