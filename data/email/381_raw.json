I&#39;m confused.  Do we know that Saitou was related to Sasaki?  \nI thought it was still a &quot;rumor&quot; he was related to &quot;someone&quot; within \nthe Mimawarigumi...\n\nAnd where does the info that Saitou&#39;s father was a ronin come from???\n\nphil (feeling out of touch with things...)\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You saw this on a livejournal?  I saw it on a Japanese messageboard\n&gt; (it is very painful trying to find the page I saw this using \nbabelfish\n&gt; for yahoo.co.jp)...He may have just stayed on with the Shinsengumi\n&gt; because he is &#39;secure&#39; he knows his men, he has some respect, he is\n&gt; trusted by the management etc...if he went to the Mimawarigumi then\n&gt; sure he knew the management but these police/para-military groups\n&gt; function as a team somewhat and you need to have the &quot;respect&quot; of \nyour\n&gt; team---people were watching each other&#39;s back when they did\n&gt; raids/patrols etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, \n&gt; &gt;I did come across another \n&gt; &gt; interesting rumor from a livejournal somewhere (can&#39;t remember \nright \n&gt; &gt; now)... Saitou seems to be related by blood to Mr. Sasaki? I \nknow.. I \n&gt; &gt; know... All I ever bring to the tables are rumors, just like that \n&gt; &gt; other woman of Saitou-sama... But really? This just sparked my \n&gt; &gt; interest because, Saitou joined the Shinsengumi why did he not \njoin \n&gt; &gt; the Mimawarigumi? &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyone have any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way... You can find more photos on the shinsengumi and \n&gt; &gt; Sasaki&#39;s grave at this site...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.fc.a-vst.jp/location_library/shinsengumi/sasaki.html\n\n\n"
