Was able to finish PMK last night.... Watched all last 5 \nepisodes non-stop. I don&#39;t know personally I think it was rushed, \nbut I liked it nonetheless.... Somehow though, my favorite character \nchanged from Susumu to Suzu. I feel so sorry for him... The ending \ndefinitely gives good way for a second series which might not be too \nfar off if ADV does license the anime... \n\nNo one ever answered my question before whether the Anime started \nwith the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker or Peacemaker Kurogane manga. \nI&#39;m just curious because I&#39;d like to see a second season an was \ncurious what that might contain...\n\nAnyway, while watching Hijikata&#39;s interrogation of that store owner, \nI remembered a few weeks ago I posted a bus tour here in the mailing \nlist. The reason I did that was because it had very interesting \nphotos on the Maekawa residence particularly the storehouse where \nthey did the interrogation of prisoners. The site is in Japanese and \nI can&#39;t find it in my bookmarks right now... Sorry, I&#39;ll put it up \nonce I find it. Anyway, the pics are in the location section of the \nphotos.\n\n\n"
