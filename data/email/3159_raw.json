Those \nkanji are not read &quot;Okikou&quot;-- as can be evidenced here: \nhttp://www.nihontoantiques.com/g83.htm (Different swordsmith but the same \nkanji for the name in question.)\n\nAlso, Seven, I&#39;ve been curious for some time-- why do you translate the \nnames of your Japanese resources? It certainly isn&#39;t standard reference \nprocedure to do so, and makes the job of someone who might try to look up \nthe same sources (after looking at your work) more difficult. For instance, \nif someone read my work on Aizu and I had stated Yamakawa Hiroshi&#39;s book \n&quot;Kyoto Shugoshoku Shimatsu&quot; as &quot;Kyoto Commissioner Management,&quot; would \nsomeone (with presumed Japanese skill) have been able to track it down? Yes, \nI know, I&#39;d have the author&#39;s name, but it makes the job of the reader/peer \neditor much easier if you give the title of a foreign language book in the \nlanguage that it was written. At any rate, I&#39;m not trying to criticise you, \nI have a sincere interest in trying to understand why you do so.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
