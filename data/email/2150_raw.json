In 1877, eleven years after the close of the war of the \nrestoration, a rebellion broke out in the south which required a \nconsiderable expenditure of blood and money for its suppression.  \nWhen the new war began, these two ladies presented a petition to the \ngovernment, in which they begged that they might be allowed to make \namends for their former position of opposition to the Emperor, by \ngoing with the army to the field as hospital nurses.  At that time, \nno lady in Japan had ever gone to the front to nurse the wounded \nsoldiers; but to those two brave women was granted the privilege of \nmaking atonement for past disloyalty, by the exercise of the skill \nand nerve that they had gained in their experience of war against the \nEmperor, in the nursing of soldiers wounded in his defense.&quot;\n\n*perhaps these two Aizu women had husbands or brothers who like many \nformer Aizu samurai joined the police force and the army during the \noutbreak of the Seinan War (SAtsuma Rebellion)\n\nShe also writes about the warrior training of samurai women, and \nofcourse the information was from her Aizu friends.  Thus the book is \nnot merely a general snapshot of women in Meiji Era Japan, but women \nduring the end of feudalism and provides valuable insight into the \nlives of those who lived in Aizu.  There is even a painting of a \nwoman using a chain and sickle against another woman wielding a \nnaginata.\n\n\n\n\n"
