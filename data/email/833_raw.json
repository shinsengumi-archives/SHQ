He seems to have gathered men to him quickly, both ronin for these terrorist activities and non-samurai for the Sekihoutai.\n \nAnd, hmmmm... if initially Sagara was fighting with the Mito clan, I wonder if he transfered his allegiance to the Imperialists at the same time Satsuma allied with Choshuu... This is the first I&#39;ve heard of who he was a retainer for.  Dr. FangLang&#39;s Pavement only comments that Sagara had to end his assocation with the Mito clan.  sigh... Time to dig out my one book and start learning more about Satsuma&#39;s involvement.\n \n&gt;&gt;Five days earlier, after weeks of rumors that Satsuma agents were planniing to attack Edo Castle, a suspicious fire had broken out and destroyed the castle women&#39;s quarters.&lt;&lt;\n \nWell, if Sagara looked *anything* like Watsuki&#39;s creation, I&#39;m sure that was easy enough to do...  ;-)  (Yes, I know, Watsuki created Sagara from his own imagination, but still... )\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
