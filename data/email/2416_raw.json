That page in particular seems to be  history \narticle focusing on Hijikata. You can try to stick it in an online \ntranslator, but the results will probably be pretty ugly. X_x\nFortunately, I was able to get my mother to do some translating for \nme. =3\nThe following is a collection of notes from the partially translated \npage (deciphered from my unreadable notes taken while she was \ntranslating). I&#39;m not sure about some of the dates (the Roushitai \nformed in 1863, not 1862, right?), and I&#39;m sure some of this is \nalready common information, but there may be something new. ^^;\n\n-- Hijikata Toshizou b. 1835, d. 1869\n-- his father died before he was born\n-- his mother died when he was five\n-- lived with his sister and her husband\n-- worked at a cloth-merchants&#39; place (?), quit becuse of a problem \nwith women\n-- then worked at a kimono sellers and a medecine store (medecine \npeddler?)\n-- his sister-in-law had some tie with kendo\n-- his brother-in-law introduced him to the Tennen Rishin Ryuu\n-- At Shieikan, he was like brothers with Kondou, Okita, and Inoue, \nbut was closest to Kondou\n-- friends from other schools: Nagakura, Toudou, Harada, and Yamanami\n-- 1862 (correct date?) joined Roushitai\n-- his personality changed a lot; he used to be kind and friendly, \nbut became severe/strict\n\n-- the five principles/rules (most of you know these already, so I&#39;ll \nskip those)\n-- total of 18 disobeyed (not sure if this was at a specific time, or \noverall)\n-- of the 18, 10 committed seppuku, 8 were beheaded\n-- 5 were spies, 3 were part of conspiracies, 3 escaped, 2 were \nslackers (?), 2 quarreled over money, 1 was very violent, 1 had \nproblems with a female, 7 were unidentified (?)\n\n-- during Serizawa&#39;s assassination, five were killed and one escaped\n\n-- 1964 Masuya/Furutaka captured and tortured by Hijikata\n-- put 5-inch long nails on his feet and put candles on the nails so \nthat the melting wax fell on the foot\n\nThere were also some notes on the page asking readers to consider of \nHijikata was being too mean (?) and if the laws of the Shinsengumi \nwere just (?).\n\n\n\n\n"
