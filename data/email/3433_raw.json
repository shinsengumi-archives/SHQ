The table \ndrawers were swollen =\r\nshut with the humidity and when he brought it \nhope he set it before a fire=\r\n till it dried out enough to open the \ndrawers. Inside he found two small b=\r\noxes that were very very light to \nthe touch.\n\nWell last week I was finally=\r\n able to catch up with him and set up a \nmeeting with Tokiko (I&#39;ll get her =\r\nlast name later, I thought i had \nit). She is the mother of my best friend =\r\nand loves history. Born and \nraised in a Budhist Temple, her father was the=\r\n high monk. \n\nThe first contents of the box were four items. The first item=\r\n she \npulled out was the letter. The paper was very light and almond \ncolor=\r\ned, but the writing on it was very bold. She had no problem \nreading it. In=\r\nside the letter was a snake skin that had been wrapped \naround what looked =\r\nlike cotton. The skin was so dry that it was \ncrumbling. Inside the lid of =\r\nthe box was some writing.\n\nNow I&#39;m not sure where the date was written, if =\r\nit was in the lid or \non the letter. But Tokiko San said that it was writte=\r\nn the 6th year \nof Kaei. When we looked it up, it was 1854. A year after Co=\r\nmmodore \nPerry arrived. \n\nThe letter in a nutshell was from Miyawaki San ex=\r\nplaining that the \nsnake inside was being given as a gift of monetary luck.=\r\n The design \non the snake was the same as the coin with the square hole in =\r\nthe \nmiddle. \n\nUnder the letter and snake skin were three talismans. Two sm=\r\nall ones \nand then a large one. She tried opening the large one, but it had=\r\n \nnever been opened before and was VERY fragile. She said that it is \nthe k=\r\nind of talisman not to be opend otherwise what ever fortune or \nprotection =\r\nit was providing would go away.\n\nIn the second box was a scroll. I wish i h=\r\nad gotten a picture of it \nundraveled. It was a red one. And Tokiko San sai=\r\nd that these \ntalismans can still be purchased at any shrine in Japan. When=\r\n she and \nher daughter began to unravel the scroll, it was as strong as the=\r\n \npaper the letter was written on. It didn&#39;t tear or rip. (much to my \ndeli=\r\nght, my poor heart was in my throat) She said that the scroll was \na protec=\r\ntion scroll of the 9 Kami-samas or 9 spirits. She was not \nable to translat=\r\ne the scroll, much.\n\nThe wood the boxes are made of is called Kiri or Paulo=\r\nwnia. She said \nit was very common to use this kind of wood because the bug=\r\ns didn&#39;t \nlike it and it was very light. \n\nThe Talismans came from Komeira =\r\nShrine.\n\nI have posted my myspace site where I have posted the pictures.\nht=\r\ntp://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?\nfuseaction=3Duser.editAlbums&MyTok=\r\nen=3Ddbceeb4a-2d7a-457f-a758-\ne51e81229c33\n\nand also the site for the Komei=\r\nra Shrine \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotohira_Shrine\n\nThis was such an e=\r\nxciting thing. Thanks for letting me share.\n\np.s. The gentleman who owns th=\r\nese was wondering if there was any way \nto determine their monetary value?\n=\r\n\nI would also like your opinions on these items. :) \n\n  \n\n\n"
