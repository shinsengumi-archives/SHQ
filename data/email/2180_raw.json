Basically the dialogue \naddressed the common people&#39;s frustration with both sides of the \nconflict and used word play to poke fun of some of the leaders of \nthe Ishin and Tokugawa factions...but it was still noticeable Pro-\nTokugawa.\n\nbut I found another reference in this book....\n\nAuthor:\tRubin, Jay, 1941- \nTitle:\tInjurious to public morals : writers and the Meiji state\nPublisher:Seattle : University of Washington Press, c1984.\nISBN:\t0295960434 \n\n(page 20)\n&quot;The first items of journalism banned by the new government were \nhandbills and woodblock color printes (nishikie) that evinced a pro-\nTokugawa bias in depicting the military skirmishes against the \nBakufu forces.  This was in May of 1868.  In that same month, the \ndemand for military news led to the establishment of some of Japan&#39;s \nfirst newspapers, a half-dozen irregularly issued publications \nprinted from wood blocks on few sheets of rice paper.  One of these, \nFukuchi Gen&#39;ichiro&#39;s KOKO SHIMBUN, became the first newspaper to be \nprohibited from publishing, also for its pro-Tokugawa (or rather, \nanti-Satsume-Choshu) bias.  Its final issue, the twenty second, \nappeared on July 11, 1868.  When it was banned, Fukuchi was jailed \nfor eight days and his woodblocks were confiscated.  On July 27 the \ngovernment temporarily wiped out all newspapers by requiring them to \nobtain the same &quot;official permission&quot; to publish required of books.&quot;\n-------------------------------\n1942 an army major expressed admiration for a magazine called \nREVERE THE EMPEROR EXPEL THE BARBARIANS\n-------------------------------\nMori Ogai, a very famous writer during the Meiji and one of Higuchi \nIchiyo&#39;s closest guy pals (books on Higuchi Ichiyo will include \nMori&#39;s picture), was not only a friend of Natsume Soseki but also a \ncompetitor in a sense.  Mori and Natsume met formally on at least 3 \noccasions and sought advice with one another in terms of \npublications.  Threads on all three of these writers can be found in \nthe MEIJI section of http://www.shinsengumimb.com\n\nMori Ogai attracted controversy with his book VITA SEXUALIS 1909\nusually simplified to be the sexual biography of a professor\n\n&lt;&lt;secretarytocapt3 *imagining*&gt;&gt;\n\nTokio &quot;I just finished reading Mori Ogai&#39;s novel&quot;\n\nFujita Goro ::gasp:: &quot;Tokio! Why are you reading that smut?&quot;\n\nTokio &quot;I heard from the school that all the young ladies are reading \nMori&#39;s work&quot;\n*historically accurate by the way, Mori Ogai had the same exact fan \nbase as Higuchi Ichiyo\n\nFujita Goro (snatches novel from Tokio&#39;s hands and skims some of the \npages Tokio folded for *re-reading later)\n\nTokio &quot;see, its not that bad&quot;\n\nFujita Goro &quot;My friend Harada could do a better job writing about \nhis sex life&quot;\n\nTokio (^_^)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
