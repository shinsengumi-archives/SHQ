In the future I hope\nto babel all of 3-hajime&#39;s pages and store them offline for reference\nas well.  And I don&#39;t need to warn you about how the fish warp&#39;s the\nJapanese language---however many of 1to5.net&#39;s pages are easier to\nunderstand than 3-hajime it depends on how the webmaster writes.\n\nMy purpose for doing this is \n1) 1to5.net is currently experiencing server downtime and many pages\nwill result in messages like &quot;document contains no data or server\ncannot be found&quot;\n2) It is very very painful to keep logging onto the net and\nbabelfishing the same pages for just a tiny bit of info\n\nI zipped all 52 pages of 1to5.net \nthe file size is 775 kb\nhttp://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3\npassword: makoto\nfilename:1to5\n\n[please] retain files for private use only as reference\nI&#39;m only doing this to save us some time and headaches when using the\nfish...and yes, I have also tried to contact the owner of 1to5.net to\ninform her that I have been referencing her site on shinsengumimb.com\nand here as well.\n\n\n"
