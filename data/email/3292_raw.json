I forgot to ask these questions :\n\n1. Why bakufu allowed a peasant to become their troop ? (Roshigumi case)\n      I can&#39;t find the reason in any books.\n  2. When the bakufu government about to collapse, are the daimyou still doing sankin koutai \n      or other bakufu laws ?\n  3. Yamanami Keisuke no jutsuryuu wa Hokushin Ittouryuu or Tennen Rishin Ryuu ?\n      ( cause both is exist in different book )\n  4. What did Kiyokawa do when Kondo and Serizawa (and their team) chosed to stay in \n      Kyoto instead follow him ? Didnt he make any execution ? (since he was the leader of \n      Roshigumi)\n  5. Hows the real relation between Kondo (or Hijikata) with Yamanami Keisuke ?\n      I know theyre friend. But in Oishi Manabu (Shinsengumi. Saigo no bushi no jitsuzou), \n      why Kondo was so happy when Yamanami will commit seppuku ? (or its just me who \n      cant read the kanji)\n  6. May I know what do you think about Shinsengumi beliefe ?\n   \n  Please give me some book references !!!\n  Thanks in advance !!\n   \n  Rei\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nShape Yahoo! in your own image.
