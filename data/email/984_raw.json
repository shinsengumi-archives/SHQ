Buck\n&gt; Monumenta Nipponica, Vol 28 no. 4 (Winter 1973) 427-446\n&gt; \n&gt; [my summary]...will appear in my Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept. \n&gt; write up too...I&#39;m just so happy that hours of research turned up \n&gt; something new for me atleast...\n&gt; \n&gt; The Imperial government attempted a secret ammunitions seizure from \n&gt; Kagoshima (officially under government but prior to the Restoration \n&gt; property of Satsuma clan)...the government was unsuccessful as 1,000 \n&gt; Satsuma men drove off the gov&#39;s naval force.\n&gt; Saigo T. was unaware of this situation.  When Saigo T. returned to \n&gt; Kagoshima, Nakahara Hisao was charged with plotting to assasinate \n&gt; Saigo T.  Furthermore, Nakahara H. confessed to meeting with Kawaji \n&gt; Toshiyoshi, Chief Inspector of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept \n&gt; (and native of Satsuma).  We don&#39;t know if Nakahara&#39;s words are to \n&gt; be trusted however at least 50 members of the Tokyo Police Dept who \n&gt; were natives of Satsuma returned to Kagoshima in 1876-1877 at the \n&gt; same time a high-ranking Tokyo official was sent to &quot;adjust Tokyo&#39;s \n&gt; relations with Satsuma leadership.&quot; &quot;Some even advocated immediate \n&gt; execution of the &#39;traitors&#39; from the Tokyo Police Department.&quot;(page \n&gt; 430)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, it is quiet obvious that Kawaji had been monitoring his own \n&gt; Satsuma domain for some time and used Satsuma policemen as spies.\n&gt; The article also give some more info on how Satsuma remained \n&gt; rebellious against various policies,from the government they put in \n&gt; power, imposed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
