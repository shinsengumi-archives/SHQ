I am interested in a few more info about Yagi Hide (aside \n&gt; &gt; from the NHK show) ^__^*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I cannot find any good sources on her and her \n&gt; family \n&gt; &gt; per se. If someone can point me to the right direction, that will \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; very much appreciated. Thanks guys/gals.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Probably, I think that you will be disappointed about this answer. \n&gt; (My conscience pricks me when I think of it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The girl called Yagi Hide does not exist really. \n&gt; She is the fictitious person of Taiga drama.\n&gt; The elder brother and younger brother of a name who are called \n&gt; Hidejirou and Tamesaburou were in the actual Yagi family. \n&gt; The present Yagi family is the posterity of Hidejirou. \n&gt; \n&gt; Incidentally, although the old woman was in the Yagi family of a \n&gt; Taiga drama, she does not exist really in practice, either.\n&gt; The actual Yagi family is also holding the funeral at the same time \n&gt; as death of her of Taiga drama. \n&gt; In practice, it was the funeral of the child of Yagi family.\n&gt; Probably, other brother would exist in Hidejirou and Tamesaburou.\n&gt; (Although Japanese television has little regulation compared with a \n&gt; foreign country, it becomes nervous at a child&#39;s death.) \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo did not help a funeral in the Taiga drama. \n&gt; However, actual he acted as a visitor&#39;s receptionist together with \n&gt; Kondou.\n&gt; The scribble which Serizawa wrote to the note remains then still \n&gt; now.^_^ \n&gt; \n&gt; momoiro-usagi\n\nThank you Tama! This really does help out a -lot-. I was stupefied on \nhow come I couldn&#39;t figure out anymore of her from the Taiga drama. \nNow I know why.\n\nAnd yes thank you for discussing the grandmother&#39;s death and \nSerizawa&#39;s participation. Perhaps this or you have discussed this \nbefore so please my apologies for the repeat (if any).\n\nI am a little disappointed.. Although probably not as disappointed as \nthe person who I am working with. But yet I&#39;d rather know the truth. \nThank you for your help!\n\n~wounds\n\n\n\n\n"
