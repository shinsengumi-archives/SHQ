I se=\r\nek help to double check the translation when I&#39;m not sure about the \ntransl=\r\nation (such as Tani Tateki&#39;s statement after Imai Nobuo&#39;s confession to the=\r\n murder of \nSakamoto.)  I don&#39;t seek help for something like &quot;in Mibu&quot; thou=\r\ngh. The online language \ntools simply couldn&#39;t tell the difference between =\r\n&quot;at the Mibu temple&quot; and &quot;in Mibu, (at a) \ntemple. &quot;\n\n&gt;however we are listi=\r\nng all the Okita books you\n&gt;recommended for visitors to see\n\nYou only need =\r\nto list the five books on Okita. I really don&#39;t think that you need to list=\r\n all 20 \nfor such a short article. Moreover, the other 15 Shinsengumi books=\r\n would be more \nappropriate on your Bibliography page. \n\n&gt;Wikipedia seems t=\r\no suggest strict citation rules however they don&#39;t\n&gt;enforce them\n\nYes, Wiki=\r\npedia  uses the so-called &quot;wikifying&quot; format.  I decided to keep the style =\r\nused in a \nfew other articles on historical figures (like the Matthew Perry=\r\n article), after I saw a flag on \nthe Nagasone Kotetsu article page. \n\n\n~Se=\r\nven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
