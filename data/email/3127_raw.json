I was looking for the confirmation, but didn&#39;t have the fully\n&gt; f=\r\normed thought until after I sent the message. By then I figured I&#39;d\n&gt; wait =\r\nto see what the response was.  So - &quot;official&quot; question - is that\n&gt; how Jap=\r\nanese calculated ages prior to the 20th century?\n\n\nEast Asian age reckoning=\r\n: \nthe current year - the year of birth + 1\n\nTherefore, it still doesn&#39;t ad=\r\nd up.\n\n~Seven\n\n\n"
