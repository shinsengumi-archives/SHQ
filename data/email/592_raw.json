Is there a good (non-Japanese-needing-to-be-babelfished) web source? \n \nI got to thinking about it after Tiffany speculated that Suzuki needed to be reconciled to accepting the emperor and imperialist government.  I had always *assumed* he accepted that because of his participation in the Sekihoutai, and I think by association because of his brother&#39;s departure from the Shinsengumi.  I think I also *assumed* Itou&#39;s argument had to do with a departure from bakufu policies.\n \nSorry if the information is staring me in the face somewhere...\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
