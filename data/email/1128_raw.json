Someone check me on my dates, but isn&#39;t there some indication of when Yaso isn&#39;t around anymore (the census thing in Shimokita, when he was sharing the house with another family) and *very* soon after he&#39;s married to Tokio?  Another &quot;like father, like son&quot; in terms of raising the family&#39;s status. He seems to have been a man very conscious of such things (thinking of how strict he was in his behavior), as well as very loyal to Matsudaira.\n \nBienvenue, Tama!  Glad you&#39;ve joined us!  (And your English is perfectly understandable... *much* better than my French!  :-D )\n \nphil\n\n\nBarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@...&gt; wrote:\n\nktamae@... wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt;Hajime&#39;s father doesn&#39;t buy stocks for the family  but Gokenin-Kabu\n&gt;Gokenin is a rank of Shogun&#39;s direct vassal and a Gokenin could sell his \n&gt;estate to merchant, farmer or samurai of lower rank. Those who get Gokenin-Kabu \n&gt;become Gokenin, but this practice is considered as adoption for the public.\n&gt;It&#39;s a way of social promotion in this periode just like some bourgeois in \n&gt;Europeen countries who bought their title of nobility in the past.\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope everyone could understand my English.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tama\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYour English is just fine as always. So, Hajime&#39;s father bought the \nfamily a higher social rank? Now that&#39;s a fascinating bit of news.  I \nsuppose this is how our Hajime was able to be involved with Matsudaira \nof Aizu and marry well?\n\nI knew the Matsudaira arranging his marriage was all about knowing the \n&quot;right people&quot;.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
