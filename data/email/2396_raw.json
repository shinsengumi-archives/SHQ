Batman and Robin.\n&gt; Lewis and Clark. \n&gt; Chip and Dale...\n&gt; \n&gt; According to fictional sources at least, the great\n&gt; duo of the \n&gt; Shinsengumi appears to have been Harada and\n&gt; Nagakura. Movies and manga \n&gt; often shown in association with one another.\n&gt; Historically this is \n&gt; slightly backed up by the fact they were both on the\n&gt; list of those \n&gt; protesting against Kondo and by the fact that they\n&gt; both left the \n&gt; Shinsengumi after a disagreement with their boss\n&gt; following the defeat \n&gt; at Kofu.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the question is, what is your favorite portrayal\n&gt; of the two? What \n&gt; was your least favorite protrayal? And of all those\n&gt; who have (or could) \n&gt; play the roles of the 2nd and 10th captains, what\n&gt; actors would you most \n&gt; like to see bringing this famous friendship to life?\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissB\n&gt; \n&gt; Oooh... that&#39;s hard to say.  I would say PeaceMaker\nKurogane.  I mean, they really share a bond,\nespecially in Kurogane when Nakagura, Shinpatchi, and\nHarada are known as the &#39;Comedic Trio&#39;.  Their\ncharacters prefectly balance each other out.  The\nshort Nakagura is smart and seems to know what he&#39;s\ntalking about while Harada... is not.
