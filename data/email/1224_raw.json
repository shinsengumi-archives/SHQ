Emperor Meiji and\nSaigo abhorred the photograph because of superstition or traditional\nbelief?\n\nIn the same exact time period in the kingdom of Siam the king Rama V\n(King #5 Chakri Dynasty) loved the photograph for friendliness with a\nforeign country.  Opposite of Emperor Meiji ^_^\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;momomanjyuu2004&quot; &lt;momomanjyuu2004@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; And it is strange that Emperor Meiji is in this photograph as you \n&gt; say. \n&gt; If the status distinctions at the time are considered, this will be \n&gt; an impossible talk absolutely. \n&gt; Furthermore, although this was a digression, Emperor Meiji abhorred \n&gt; the photograph. \n&gt; His vassals were troubled whenever the Emperor&#39;s photograph was \n&gt; needed on friendliness with a foreign country, after becoming Meiji \n&gt; Era. \n&gt; Incidentally, Saigo also disliked the photograph. \n&gt; Now, there is no photograph decided as a photograph of Saigo. \n\n\n"
