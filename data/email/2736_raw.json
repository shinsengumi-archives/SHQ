It is not strange \nif neighbors who work=\r\ned in the same  field new each other very \nwell.  I have discussed this con=\r\nnection already on \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\n\n***pleas=\r\ne note that the Fujita family lived in Hongo..but \nspecifically in the BUNK=\r\nYO WARD which bordered with Koishikawa a \nmore upscale neighborhood\n\nThe ot=\r\nher map &quot;1910&quot; is the MOST IMPORTANT\n\n1) look for the HIGHER NORMAL SCHOOL =\r\nFOR GIRLS this was Tokio/Goro&#39;s \nplace of employment (don&#39;t confuse it with=\r\n the brand new schools---\nmost of which were also connected to the HNSfor G=\r\nirls)\n\n2) Look for Kano&#39;s dojo (note the term jiujitsu used---actually JUDO=\r\n \nis used in most texts to seperate it from the older schools)\nI mentioned =\r\nrecently the intriguing connection between Kano Jigoro \n(Pres. of the Norma=\r\nl School for men), and Aizu. Note it is right in \nthe Koishikawa area\n\n3) K=\r\noishikawa and why is it important in regards to the Fujita family\na) Koishi=\r\nkawa was the birthplace of Matsudaira Tsuneo (son of \nMatsudaira Katamori) =\r\nso we know that the Matsudaira mansion was \nright there in Koishikawa\nb) at=\r\nleast 2 of the Fujita family friends lived right there in \nKoishikawa too, =\r\nthe Takamine and Yamakawa (both discussed on \nSaitou&#39;s page)\n\n[conclusion] =\r\nwe have &quot;Little Aizu&quot; in Tokyo, this is why Mr. and \nMrs. Fujita had visito=\r\nrs such as the young daughters of Takamine \n(please see http://www.shinseng=\r\numihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
