I meant to make a suggestion.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;From the SHQ FILM/TV/ANIME/VID GAMES\n&gt;  (http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm):\n&gt; &quot;I think of this Okita as the young man with the flower fetish. We don&#39;t get but a glimpse of \n&gt; him, but he kiks some serious butt at the Ikedaya. It&#39;s a pity Saitou intervened when that \n&gt; Kami damned battousai showed up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps that should be corrected?\n\nSince I&#39;m the one who wrote that bit of commentary I don&#39;t think there&#39;s \nanything to &quot;correct&quot; really. It was simply MY impression of that \nversion of Okita. ( that comes across as I think but it is _not_ meant \nto be. ^_^)\n\nThough it&#39;s been a long time since I watched it I do recall Saitou \ncoming into it when Kenshin arrives to &quot;save the day&quot; for his fleeing \ncomrades.\n-- \n~Barbara Sheridan\nBlood Brothers & The Dragon&#39;s Disciple on Sale now!\nhttp://www.dragonsdisciple.com\n\n\n"
