It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve \nwatched it I may have the episode numbers wrong but I believe it&#39;s \nepisodes 28--31. Or you could get the RK/Samurai X Trust & Betrayal , \nbut I personally prefer the saitou tv episodes.\n\nPEACEMAKER KUROGANE is also a must have in my book\n\nFor live action films I say do try to get hold of the NHK Taiga Drama \nShinsengumi! This can be had free or very inexpensively if you know \nwhere to look (email me off list to buy a clue)\n\nMIBUGISHIDEN a/k/a/ WHEN THE LAST SWORD IS DRAWN top film for me\n\nSHINSENGUMI KEPPUROKU--actually this is a tv series and can be had from \nthe same sources as the NHK series (again email off list to buy a clue)\n\nGOHATTO/TABOO a bit odd with VERY bad casting for Hijikata/Kodou but an \ninteresting little movie nonetheless\n\nCRUEL STORY Different, dark and interesting\n\nOKITA SOUJI the LAST SWORDSMAN Not the best but pretty good.\n\nThose are my favorites you&#39;ll probably get other recommendations\n\nI also have Band of Assassins and Shinsengumi Chronicles both of which \nare very good but not my favorites and yes the weird Kuniochi thing...\n\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n"
