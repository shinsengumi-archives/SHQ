Whatever you have to \n&gt;   do to see it, just do it!\n&gt; \n&gt;   Wonderful, gritty look at the internal world of the Shinsengumi from \n&gt;   just after the Ikedaya Affair to just past the death of Yamanami.  \n&gt;   Fundoshi theft, homoerotic playfulness, guy talk about women & \n&gt;   Shimabara (including Kondou&#39;s 4 babes), a sweet love story, patrol \n&gt;   changes, after-hours in the barracks, execution of law breakers, a \n&gt;   samurai bacchanal, the clash of strong personalities, testing new \n&gt;   recruits, man&#39;s inhumanity to man, history, regrets, blood & gore, \n&gt;   Saitou --- it&#39;s got a little of everything.  The ending is just too \n&gt;   amazing to even consider hinting at.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The flashback of Serizawa&#39;s assassination is pure poetry and exactly \n&gt;   as I read about it.  I swear, the words came right to life before my \n&gt;   eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Every Shinsengumi fan should have a copy of it!!!\n&gt; \n&gt;   One thing did hit me over the head like a brick, though --- when the \n&gt;   captains are announcing themselves in one scene, when it comes to the \n&gt;   captain of the 9th squad, the man is Abe Juro, not Suzuki.  Anyone \n&gt;   know why this would be?  I thought Abe Juro was a corporal (source: \n&gt;   Serizawa Kamo&#39;s Biography --- see links on the shinsengumimb main \n&gt;   page).\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122390/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   visit \n&gt; \n&gt;   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n&gt; \n&gt;   our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Yahoo!
