So, my guess is some people, perhaps his \nsuperiors, probably knew him.  And as mentioned by other members \nhere, who would want to tap on Fujita Goro&#39;s shoulder and say &quot;don&#39;t I \nknow you from somewhere?&quot; :)  \n\nNote: Saitou&#39;s boss Kawajii was himself a former Satsuma samurai.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, GCW &lt;saitohworship@y...&gt; wrote:\none more question - are the police offiers who worked with Saitoh in \nTokyo Boshin samurais?
