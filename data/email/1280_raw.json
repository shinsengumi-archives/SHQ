In real \ntime \n&gt; (i.e. Japan time)?  (Note to self --- set alarm clock)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is around 10:00 p.m. that Kondou went into Ikedaya-inn. \n&gt; How about making it somewhere start at the time? \n&gt; (The participation from Tokyo is impossible.)   \n&gt; And although this is very hard to say, the Ikedaya-inn attack was \non \n&gt; July 8. \n&gt; The incident arose on June 5, 1864 on old Japanese calender. \n&gt; I searched this date at some sites. It is on Occidental calender \non \n&gt; July 8 on that day. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, ktamae@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; My HN tama is come from my name. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m living in Tokyo for most of year, but I&#39;m in overseas now.\n&gt; &gt; Your English is very good!
