On the day they set out it was raining according to \nToshizo.com.\n\nAngrybee had a link on her site that I thought you might be \ninterested in. It gives a quick overview of the highway, but the real \ntreasure is the section on post towns. It follows the entire route of \nthe orginal road in reverse. You can get a good idea of the \nexperiences that the original Shinsengumi members would have had on \ntheir journey as well as a glimpse into the daily life of people in \nthat era. \n\nUnfortunately there is only one small mention of the Shinsengumi. It \ntalks very briefly about Kondo&#39;s execution in Itabashi (at Itabashi \nPrison), the last post town before one reached Edo it seems.\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
