It is outstanding to see an\n&gt; individual such as yourself take a =\r\nproactive approach to this topic,\n&gt; and the misconceptions that arise from =\r\nit.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this time, I&#39;d like to make a request, which I believe\n&gt; secret=\r\narytocapt3 made earlier. Could you please tell us what books\n&gt; you&#39;ve been =\r\nusing (Japanese and English) for your Shinsengumi\n&gt; research? We have a lis=\r\nt of books which mention Shinsengumi on the SHQ\n&gt; website (www.shinsengumih=\r\nq.com, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been to\n&gt; already), and we would be delighted =\r\nto add more titles to that list.\n&gt; This isn&#39;t for any single person among u=\r\ns, but rather for ALL of us in\n&gt; the non-Japanese speaking (and in some cas=\r\nes also the\n&gt; Japanese-speaking) fandom, so that we can better understand t=\r\nhese men\n&gt; we are interested in.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have perused some of your articles =\r\non Wikipedia (especially your\n&gt; work on the Kondou and Okita articles), and=\r\n I would like to applaud\n&gt; your efforts there, as well. It often takes grea=\r\nt courage to be able\n&gt; to remind people to keep fact and fiction separate, =\r\nespecially in a\n&gt; topic like this one, which has been so colored and often =\r\nskewed by\n&gt; popular portrayals. However, I&#39;d like to suggest that you add a=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;References&quot; section to both articles, so that we know on Wikipedia as\n&gt;=\r\n well, where your information is coming from. I say this in all\n&gt; honesty--=\r\n I&#39;m curious to see what other books there are out there!\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, please=\r\n allow me to say that I hope that with such an attitude\n&gt; toward spreading =\r\nknowledge, that you consider writing an article or\n&gt; book on Okita. Wikiped=\r\nia is good in its own right, but as you know,\n&gt; articles are open to being =\r\nedited or deleted at anytime. By writing\n&gt; something-- anything-- you&#39;d be =\r\na trailblazer-- to the best of my\n&gt; knowledge, at this time there are no bi=\r\nographies of Okita in print form.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I&#39;d like to reiterate that =\r\nif you&#39;d like to write or publish\n&gt; anything related to history, any editor=\r\n or publication will likely ask\n&gt; that you follow industry standards in cit=\r\nation.  Even if you do not\n&gt; plan to publish, when you attend school your t=\r\neachers will also force\n&gt; you to adopt a citation format as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\ncurrent most widely used format in the United States and now at\n&gt; the inter=\r\nnational level is MLA (or something very similar to it).  You\n&gt; can learn m=\r\nore about this easy format here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/res=\r\nource/557/01/\n&gt; \n&gt; An example of the format for the MLA citation:\n&gt; &quot;blah b=\r\nlah blah bakumatsu info blah blah blah&quot; (Madison 34)\n&gt; (author last name, p=\r\nage number)\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s really as easy as listing the books at the bottom of =\r\nyour webpage\n&gt; like this:\n&gt; (author last name, first name. title either in =\r\nbold or underlined.\n&gt; location published: company, year.)\n&gt; With journal an=\r\nd magazine articles, though, there&#39;s a bit of a\n&gt; different format.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ma=\r\ndison, Sconnie. THE GREATEST GUIDE TO SAITOU HAJIME IN THE \nENTIRE\n&gt; UNIVER=\r\nSE. Los Angles: Makoto Publishers, 2007.\n&gt; \n&gt; For webpages we at the shinse=\r\nngumihq.com actually link right back to\n&gt; the very webpage and note the per=\r\nson who translated from Japanese to\n&gt; English\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re not trying to make=\r\n fandom boring/tedious however we are trying\n&gt; to acknowledge the hard work=\r\n and valuable contributions of Japanese or\n&gt; western scholars, and protect =\r\nourselves from plaigiarism (which is a\n&gt; prosecutable offense).\n&gt; \n&gt; ******=\r\n****************\n&gt; Note on Wikipedia\n&gt; Wikipedia allows ANYONE to go in and=\r\n edit or delete your information.\n&gt;  I think that you can provide basic inf=\r\normation on wikipedia and link\n&gt; to your own personal website with addition=\r\nal information---that&#39;s\n&gt; really a safe way of protecting your work.  If yo=\r\nu write a wikipedia\n&gt; article it is also necessary to cite your information=\r\n.\n&gt; **********************\n&gt; \n&gt; On a personal note as a longtime Kondou fan=\r\n, I&#39;d also like to thank\n&gt; you for pointing out that the &quot;Kotetsu&quot; that he =\r\nis said to have\n&gt; posessed was most probably not a real one. The book &quot;Swor=\r\ndsmith\n&gt; Nagasone Kotetsu Okisato,&quot; an English text written by Yasu Kizu,\n&gt;=\r\n confirms what you pointed out: Kondou&#39;s sword was not a true Kotetsu,\n&gt; bu=\r\nt instead was a sword made by Minamoto Kiyomaro, the foremost\n&gt; swordmaker =\r\nof the shinshinto period, and roughly contemporary to\n&gt; Kondou Isami. Appar=\r\nently faked Kotetsu swords were common even during\n&gt; the life of Kotesu him=\r\nself, and he is said to have remarked on seeing\n&gt; a fake &quot;The blade is mine=\r\n but the signature is not.&quot; (from page 8 of\n&gt; the Yasu Kizu book).\n&gt; \n&gt; Lin=\r\nk on the Kotetsu from Kondou&#39;s page at the SHQ site...\n&gt; http://www.shinsen=\r\ngumihq.com/KondouIsami.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; And a new article: \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.o=\r\nrg/wiki/Nagasone_Kotetsu\n&gt; \n&gt; Those who want to see a (real) Kiyomaro sword=\r\n can visit this site:\n&gt; http://perso.orange.fr/nipponto/kiyomaro.html\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOnce again, I thank you, and hope to hear more from you soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; -M.\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"
