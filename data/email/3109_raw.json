For example dra=\r\nwing out an entire manga and writing it\nis very time consuming...however we=\r\n&#39;d like to see what people would\ndesign for their story&#39;s cover---and they =\r\ncan include a one paragraph\nsummary of the plot line (Sort of like what wou=\r\nld go on the back of\nthe book cover).\n\nThanks ahead of time for your contri=\r\nbution and participation.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Charo Goldstein&quot; &lt;g=\r\noldstein16@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll do both (contribute money and fanwork).  As=\r\n to the fan work, \n&gt; should the work be (example would be art) of the Shins=\r\nengumi member \n&gt; only in Shinsengumi garb, or can it be different, such as =\r\nin AU \n&gt; roleplays, ML challenges, etc.?   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Charo Goldstein\n&gt; Harri=\r\nsburg, PA\n\n\n\n"
