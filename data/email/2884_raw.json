(Oji p. 58 - p.59) His=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Great-grandfather was Okita\n&gt; &gt; Kan&#39;emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfathe=\r\nr was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His\n&gt; &gt; father, Okita\n&gt; &gt; Katsujiro, died =\r\nin 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907)\n&gt; &gt; and Okita Ki=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; (1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; family, Okita Rintaro\n&gt; &gt; (1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu be=\r\ncame an adopted daughter of\n&gt; &gt; Kondo Shusuke\n&gt; &gt; in name. Kondo Shusuke wa=\r\ns the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and\n&gt; &gt; Okita started\n&gt; &gt; train=\r\ning at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time,\n&gt; &gt; Kond=\r\no Shusuke had\n&gt; &gt; already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami)=\r\n, but Hijikata\n&gt; &gt; Toshizo had not\n&gt; &gt; yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ry=\r\nu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy\n&gt; &gt; and attained\n&gt; &gt; Menkyo Kaiden s=\r\ntatus (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 -\n&gt; &gt; p.11)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; In 1861, Okita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; was often\n&gt; &gt; commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by thos=\r\ne around him, he\n&gt; &gt; was also\n&gt; &gt; known to be a strict and quick-tempered t=\r\neacher to his students. (Mori,\n&gt; &gt; p.27 - p.28)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; According to Yagi T=\r\namesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) and Satou Shun&#39;sen\n&gt; &gt; (Satou\n&gt; &gt; Higokor=\r\nou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high\n&gt; &gt; cheekb=\r\nones, a\n&gt; &gt; wide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he=\r\n was known\n&gt; &gt; as a man who\n&gt; &gt; smiled and laughed well (not very talkative=\r\n, however.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shinsengumi Period\n&gt; &gt; Okita changed his name to Okita =\r\nSouji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before\n&gt; &gt; his departure\n&gt; &gt; to Kyoto i=\r\nn 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; also a\n&gt; &gt; practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; Shinchougumi (the\n&gt; &gt; Shinsengumi&#39;s brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p=\r\n.52)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, with=\r\n Todo\n&gt; &gt; Heisuke being\n&gt; &gt; the youngest. He was one of the Shieikan member=\r\ns involved in the Serizawa\n&gt; &gt; Kamo (one of\n&gt; &gt; the original commanders of =\r\nthe Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro\n&gt; &gt; assassinations in\n&gt; &gt; 1863. =\r\n(Oji, p.132)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Equally skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katan=\r\na, his signature\n&gt; &gt; technique was\n&gt; &gt; named the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (w=\r\nhich translates as &quot;Three Piece\n&gt; &gt; Thrust&quot;), a\n&gt; &gt; technique that could at=\r\ntack one&#39;s neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder\n&gt; &gt; with one strike.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (the Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; this is most\n&gt; &gt; likely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was h=\r\nis own invention\n&gt; &gt; and it could\n&gt; &gt; have been derived from an invention o=\r\nf Hijikata&#39;s (the Hirazuki.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was rumored that his tuberculosis w=\r\nas discovered when he coughed blood\n&gt; &gt; and fainted\n&gt; &gt; during the Ikedaya =\r\nAffair, but some sources say that he contracted the\n&gt; &gt; disease after that.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Both are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; slowly (many years).\n&gt; &gt; While many of the Shinsengumi fans believe th=\r\nat Yoshida Toshimaru was\n&gt; &gt; killed by Okita\n&gt; &gt; during the Ikedaya Affair =\r\n(based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction), it is in\n&gt; &gt; fact historically\n&gt; &gt; in=\r\naccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction, man=\r\ny also believe that Okita and\n&gt; &gt; Hijikata were like\n&gt; &gt; brothers. In histo=\r\nry, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared\n&gt; &gt; a brotherly\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; relationship with. Yamanami&#39;s seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; was an\n&gt; &gt; extremely painful incident in Okita&#39;s short life. (Mori, p.7=\r\n8) There is no\n&gt; &gt; record showing\n&gt; &gt; that Hijikata and Okita were close; i=\r\nt is debatable whether Okita even got\n&gt; &gt; along with\n&gt; &gt; Hijikata.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIn 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; also served as a\n&gt; &gt; kenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later that year=\r\n, he was appointed by\n&gt; &gt; Kondo Isami to be\n&gt; &gt; the fifth master of the Ten=\r\nnen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although highly unlikely, i=\r\nt was rumored that he wielded a famous katana\n&gt; &gt; called Kikuichi-\n&gt; &gt; monj=\r\ni. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a\n&gt; &gt; wak=\r\nizashi) and\n&gt; &gt; his so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a Yamasir=\r\no Kunikiyo\n&gt; &gt; instead. (Oji, 96)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Death\n&gt; &gt; During the Boshin War, =\r\nafter the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of\n&gt; &gt; Keiou 4, Okita went\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ninto Matsumoto Ryoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; guesthouse\n&gt; &gt; with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. Whe=\r\nn the shogunate\n&gt; &gt; forces (including\n&gt; &gt; the Shinsengumi and the Shinchoug=\r\numi) retreated to the Tohoku region,\n&gt; &gt; Okita remained in\n&gt; &gt; Edo alone. (=\r\nMori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May\n&gt; &gt; 30th), 1868=\r\n. Later\n&gt; &gt; that night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (present =\r\nTokyo),\n&gt; &gt; under his birth name\n&gt; &gt; (with Okita Souji listed in the death =\r\nrecords.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is\n&gt; &gt; not open to the\n&gt; &gt; public. (Oji, p.2=\r\n52)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the =\r\ntheory that\n&gt; &gt; he was born\n&gt; &gt; in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian =\r\nage reckoning when he died in\n&gt; &gt; 1868 (or on a\n&gt; &gt; lesser-known theory tha=\r\nt he was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and\n&gt; &gt; therefore was\n&gt; &gt; 25 =\r\nby Western standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Trivia\n&gt; &gt; It =\r\nis historical accurate that Okita loved children. Duing his time in\n&gt; &gt; Kyo=\r\nto, he was often\n&gt; &gt; seen playing with children and was a baby-sitter to Ya=\r\ngi&#39;s sons in the\n&gt; &gt; Mibu temple. (Oji,\n&gt; &gt; p.100)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He was not parti=\r\ncularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved\n&gt; &gt; sweets.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Okita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Aside from being t=\r\nreated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku\n&gt; &gt; (medicine for\n&gt; &gt; e=\r\nnervation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nshida Sanyaku for\n&gt; &gt; treating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There has not been any evidence of an Okita photograph.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ref=\r\nerences\n&gt; &gt; ?

Tokyo: Shin Chosha, 20=\r\n03.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Okita in Fiction\n&gt; &gt; It is important not to confuse fictional w=\r\nork featuring Okita with\n&gt; &gt; historical data about him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Okita is br=\r\niefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga series Rurouni\n&gt; &gt; Kenshin, wh=\r\nich\n&gt; &gt; takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. A chara=\r\ncter\n&gt; &gt; later on in the\n&gt; &gt; series, Seta S?jir?, was based on the Okita So=\r\nji from fiction Shinsengumi\n&gt; &gt; Keppuroku (and\n&gt; &gt; therefore, darker than t=\r\nhe real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in\n&gt; &gt; the anime/manga\n&gt; &gt; P=\r\neacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an\n&gt; &gt; epis=\r\node of the anime\n&gt; &gt; GS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a =\r\nhaunted movie about\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted =\r\nas a crazy guy who thinks only\n&gt; &gt; of killing\n&gt; &gt; people (obvious pun on hi=\r\ns usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the\n&gt; &gt; show&#39;s rendition of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHijikata.) Okita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n which is a fictional\n&gt; &gt; story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokug=\r\nawa shogunate (where\n&gt; &gt; Okita trains a\n&gt; &gt; young girl to be one of the Shi=\r\nnsengumi to avenge her father and older\n&gt; &gt; brother.) He is also\n&gt; &gt; depict=\r\ned in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/manga series Shura\n&gt; &gt; no=\r\n Toki,\n&gt; &gt; Okita&#39;s (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sicknes=\r\ns is with\n&gt; &gt; a warrior from the\n&gt; &gt; Mutsu, a clan that supposedly practice=\r\nd unarmed combat. Their duel was a\n&gt; &gt; request from\n&gt; &gt; Okita himself from =\r\nyears before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a h=\r\nandsome young man\n&gt; &gt; (sometimes a\n&gt; &gt; bish?nen). The Latin American dub of=\r\n Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook\n&gt; &gt; Okita for a\n&gt; &gt; woman, and the Hijik=\r\nata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the\n&gt; &gt; fangirls of\n&gt; &gt; Peacem=\r\naker Kurogane.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Mo=\r\neyo Ken (in a\n&gt; &gt; flashback and as a\n&gt; &gt; possible ghost), Okita&#39;s (obviousl=\r\ny) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an\n&gt; &gt; equally-obviously\n&gt; &gt; fictional unna=\r\nmed wife) is one of the three main characters of the series.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; His th=\r\nree-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are also very\n&gt; &gt; similar=\r\n to the\n&gt; &gt; character Ukyo Tachibana from the video game series Samurai Sho=\r\ndown.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
