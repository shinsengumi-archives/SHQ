When they say style of text I wonder if they \nmean the kanji itself or do they mean in the general way sentences are \nconstructed etc? Sort of comparing  an English language book from the \n1800s to one written recently. They&#39;re the same in terms of language yet \nvery different.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;[The Last Samurai]\n&gt;I was surprised very much by TLS. I think that many Japanese were \n&gt;surprised. TLS was wonderful Jidaigeki although there were many \n&gt;mistakes and strange scenes.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nI&#39;d love to hear what they consider ed to be the &quot;strange scenes&quot;\n\n&gt;As for the old &quot;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&quot;, DVD will be released in July \n&gt;and afterwards. \n&gt;This work built the foundation of the present Shinsengumi \n&gt;popularity. Therefore, there are many old fans. \n&gt;The actor who played Hijikata with this work is playing the elder \n&gt;brother of Hijikata&#39;s blindness in the Taiga drama.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nYes, Miss B and I are squealing with major delight about now as we have \ndeveloped a major fangirl crush on Murakami Hiroaki..  I saw him in the \nNHK series, thought he had an excellent screen presence compared with \nthe younger actors playing Hijikata and Kondou  but of course hadn&#39;t a \nclue as to who he was at the time since I&#39;ve only just seen S.K.\n\n&gt; About Satou Kouichi (KOICHI SATO)\n&gt;Have you seen the movie of Shinsengumi in which Mifune Toshirou \n&gt;performed Kondou Isami? \n&gt;The actor (Mikuni Rentarou) who is performing Serizawa Kamo with \n&gt;that work is Satou&#39;s father. \n&gt;Mikuni is an actor very famous for Japan. And Serizawa which he \n&gt;performed is also famous. \n&gt;Therefore, Satou desired to perform Serizawa. &gt;\n&gt;\n\nAs SHQ&#39;s resident  Koichi Sato groupie I really appreciate this \ninformation.  The movie mentioned would be Band Of Assassins, right?  \nThat&#39;s finally worked it&#39;s way to the  top of my must get  list.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;[Japanese film buffs will recall that Rentaro Mikuni starred in such \n&gt;classics as BURMESE HARP, Harakiri/Seppuku, KAIDAN and more]\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAnd just when I thought my &quot;to track down&quot; list had reached an end.....\n\nI wonder if there&#39;s any aspect of American or western history that \nMomoiro-Usagi is interested in. I&#39;m sure there are many of us who would \nlove to repay the favor  of tracking down information  they can&#39;t easily \nfind in Japanese.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
