It&#39;s been\n&gt; so long since I&#39;ve \n&gt; watched it I may have the episode numbers wrong but\n&gt; I believe it&#39;s \n&gt; episodes 28--31. Or you could get the RK/Samurai X\n&gt; Trust & Betrayal , \n&gt; but I personally prefer the saitou tv episodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; PEACEMAKER KUROGANE is also a must have in my book\n&gt; \n&gt; For live action films I say do try to get hold of\n&gt; the NHK Taiga Drama \n&gt; Shinsengumi! This can be had free or very\n&gt; inexpensively if you know \n&gt; where to look (email me off list to buy a clue)\n&gt; \n&gt; MIBUGISHIDEN a/k/a/ WHEN THE LAST SWORD IS DRAWN top\n&gt; film for me\n&gt; \n&gt; SHINSENGUMI KEPPUROKU--actually this is a tv series\n&gt; and can be had from \n&gt; the same sources as the NHK series (again email off\n&gt; list to buy a clue)\n&gt; \n&gt; GOHATTO/TABOO a bit odd with VERY bad casting for\n&gt; Hijikata/Kodou but an \n&gt; interesting little movie nonetheless\n&gt; \n&gt; CRUEL STORY Different, dark and interesting\n&gt; \n&gt; OKITA SOUJI the LAST SWORDSMAN Not the best but\n&gt; pretty good.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those are my favorites you&#39;ll probably get other\n&gt; recommendations\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have Band of Assassins and Shinsengumi\n&gt; Chronicles both of which \n&gt; are very good but not my favorites and yes the weird\n&gt; Kuniochi thing...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; The Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\nPeace be with thee.
