Intuition?\nBoth?  \nWhat I found to be very difficult in k=\r\nendo is to look at the\nopponent&#39;s entire body while not focusing on just on=\r\ne spot=85his/her\neyes (through the metal face guard), hands, feet etc even =\r\nthough many\nof us in the club are hardly executing the basic strikes correc=\r\ntly,\nthe instructors are always telling us to keep our eyes on the\nopponent=\r\n&#39;s entire frame (many such as myself keep checking on my own\nwrist etc etc)=\r\n.  This is similar to driving=85just try to get a wide\nfield of vision with=\r\nout losing focus on anything.\n\n2) &quot; Gettan passed away peacefully while dee=\r\np in meditation, his\nrosary in his left hand, his hossu (Zen Master&#39;s whisk=\r\n)  in his\nright.&quot; Remember how hist. S.H. died?\n\n3) &quot; Famous techniques of =\r\nMugairyu include the upward cut from the\ndraw (gyaku-kesagiri), the horizon=\r\ntal cut across the heart\n(yoko-ichimonji) and DEEP THRUSTS (TSUKI) MADE WHI=\r\nLE SUPPORTING THE\nBACK OF THE BLADE WITH ONE HAND. Mugairyu students master=\r\n the twenty\nbasic kata of the style, and then go on to learn deeper and sec=\r\nret\nkata, including kumitachi (two-person forms) with both the long and\nsho=\r\nrt swords.&quot;\n\nSo from reading other books own martial arts I realized that\np=\r\nractitioners, especially during that time period not only studied the\nart/s=\r\ncience of combat but its spiritual dimension AND became very much\nacquainte=\r\nd with its &quot;lore&quot; the stories of the founders and previous\nstudents are alw=\r\nays handed down=85if indeed S.H. was part of Mugai Ryu\nthen he was more tha=\r\nn aware of these stories. \n\nSekiguchi Shin Shin Ryu Jujutsu (bare handed te=\r\nchnique)\nhttp://www.bushinjuku.com/arts/bushinarts/sgrjj/sekiguchijj.htm\nJu=\r\nst pretty cool to read how it was associated with the Tokugawas=85..\n\nhttp:=\r\n//p199.ezboard.com/fsamuraibujutsufrm36.showMessage?topicID=3D8.topic\n&quot;Seki=\r\nguchi Ryu was a favored martial arts system of the Tokugawa\nShogunate.&quot;\nYes=\r\n we all know the Tokugawas favored Yagyu Shinkage ryu (messed up\nspelling) =\r\nbut this lineage was also highly favored as well\n\nLast but not least one of=\r\n the sword lineages S.H. practiced grouped\nits katas into sets of 5=85Go in=\r\n Goro?\nOkay I&#39;m being stupid again=85many lineages have their own ways to g=\r\nroup\nkatas and I&#39;m sure it changes=85just lost control there with the\nspecu=\r\nlating=85:D\n\nI added all the  links at \nhttp://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengum=\r\niheadquartersfrm22.showMessage?topicID=3D2=3D\r\n.topic\nthe links all deal with many of the lineages S.H. supposedly\nstudie=\r\nd/practiced...\n----------------------------\nI also added links to Barbara/M=\r\nasayoshi&#39;s humor updates at SHQ\n\n\n\n"
