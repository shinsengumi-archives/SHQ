The pain\nis gone.&quot; Those were his last words. A few minutes later, at 4:10 PM\non November 21, 1913, he was gone.&quot;\n\nI was stunned when I read this.\n\n&quot;No, I am just weak. The pain is gone.&quot;\n\nI know that he was sick, but these words, in my opinion, have a deeper\nmeaning as well. As someone who is currently writing a book that is\npartly about the Tokugawa and what _might_ have been, it hurt to read\nthese words. What hurt and stung even more was reading what Emperor\nMeiji said to Ito Hirobumi (the Prime minister), after having received\nYoshinobu at the new Imperial Palace (formerly Edo Castle), and having\nbestowed upon him the rank of Koshaku (marquis):\n\n&quot;Yesterday I was finally able to do something to show my gratitude to\nYoshinobu. I ought to be grateful; after all, I took the country away\nfrom him!&quot;\n\nArrogant little snot....\n\n--Masayoshi(stalks away muttering about the Imperial house)\n\n\n"
