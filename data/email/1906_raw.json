We \n&gt; require assistance.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this inovating game, we control a group of the\n&gt; famous samurais working \n&gt; for Shogun. As you know, the story is held about\n&gt; 1865 before the end of the \n&gt; Tokugawa era. Gameplay, scenario, combat, realism,\n&gt; graphics are awesome.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the following link, you can see our official\n&gt; website. There are two \n&gt; trailers and some banners that can be used in news,\n&gt; for example.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://membres.lycos.fr/shinsen/\n&gt; \n&gt; A news, an advertizing, an article in your site to\n&gt; make known our movement \n&gt; will be greatly appreciated by us, if you accept to\n&gt; post one, of course. \n&gt; Here is a link to the free and legal petition; do\n&gt; you want to speak about it \n&gt; in latters posts so as to invit people to sign it?\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.PetitionOnline[...]amoto/petition.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This game isn&#39;t the only reason that we started up\n&gt; this petition, we also \n&gt; try to promote the japanese culture and masterpieces\n&gt; in Europe that wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; be released here if we don&#39;t act.\n&gt; \n&gt; Our action is not hopeless, Genki Corporation is\n&gt; surprised by our will (We \n&gt; remain in negotiation with them), and we gathered\n&gt; more than 1000 signatures. \n&gt; But currently, it remains doubtful as for the future\n&gt; of the European release \n&gt; of &quot;Fu-un Shinsengumi&quot;, thus, your assistance will\n&gt; be welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; We hope a positive reply from you and wish you an\n&gt; excellent continuation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good bye !\n&gt; \n&gt; The French Community for the release of &quot;Fu-un\n&gt; Shinsengumi&quot; in Europe\n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Nouveau MSN Hotmail : 250 Mo d&#39;espace de stokage\n&gt; gratuit ! \n&gt; http://www.msn.fr/newmsnhotmail\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
