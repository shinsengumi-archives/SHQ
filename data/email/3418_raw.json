This Sunday a friend who=\r\n is\nalso a member here on SHQ dragged me out of the monotony of my daily\nli=\r\nfe to attend Obon (Bon) at http://www.nishihongwanji-la.org/.\n\nYou can get =\r\na general idea of Bon from reading this article:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wi=\r\nki/Obon\n\nPeople who are familiar with the Day of the Dead or the Chinese fe=\r\nast\nfor ghosts will find a similar sentiment in Bon.\n\nHere is a collage of =\r\na few photos we took:\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/collage.jpg\n(can you =\r\nfind a familiar kamon, family crest?)\n\nThe temple has been part of the Japa=\r\nnese-American community in LA for\nmany decades.  I found some of the innova=\r\ntions inside the table to be\nvery fascinating!  Notice the pews in the main=\r\n worship hall.  The\napsaras or devadas (heavenly beings/maidens) which are =\r\npart of the\nornamentation above the main alter have wings which make them l=\r\nook\nlike cherubs or western angels, whereas in traditional Japanese (or\ngen=\r\nerally E. Asian art) they would never have birdlike wings.\n\nDuring the serv=\r\nice for the souls of the deceased, the reverend\npresiding over the ceremony=\r\n emphasized how at one point, many\ngenerations back we were all relatives o=\r\nf one another and therefore we\nare still presently connected.\n\nLike other B=\r\non ceremonies everyone was asked to dance in a circle. \nThe center is also =\r\nthe central axis in which the lanterns with the\nnames of the deceased writt=\r\nen on them are united.  The dancers move\naround the axis to the tune of var=\r\nious music however I noted that the\nfirst dance resembled the movements of =\r\na fish.  People press their\nhands together in front of them and assume the =\r\nswimming gesture as if\nto swim through the sea/river of life around a cente=\r\nr.\n\nThe symbolism may be connected with the movement of people through a\nma=\r\nndala to reach the center, which is also related to Buddhist\ncosmology wher=\r\ne the center is Mt. Meru which is also the object people\ncircumambulate (Bu=\r\nddhists are big on circumambulating temples,\nstupas/chedis etc).  Unlike th=\r\ne living, the dead can traverse from the\ncenter to the outermost realms as =\r\nthey &quot;hang&quot; above us (the lanterns).\n\nI was really happy, if not completely=\r\n shocked to meet this individual\nwho shares an interest in Fujita-sama.  We=\r\n both prayed for his\nhappiness at this ceremony and hoped that his comrades=\r\n are also at\nrest.  It was really great to be able to make a small contribu=\r\ntion to\nthe temple on behalf of these long dead figures who have become\nout=\r\nstanding teachers to us not only in studying history but other\naspects of o=\r\nur lives too.\n\nChanging topics, the upcoming Shinsengumi e-book written by =\r\nand for\nfans or the general public will be completed on a laptop contribute=\r\nd\nby this person.  I also learned that fellow Shinsengumi enthusiasts\nwill =\r\nalso feed another (thank you, you saw through my lie about being\non a diet =\r\nand all that).\n\nHere is a pic of the donated laptop and router (it&#39;s on the=\r\n floor due\nto some reorganizing I had to do):\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/KCCat=\r\n/CatandLaptop.jpg\nThe cat has inspected it and certified that it is safe to=\r\n use after\nsleeping and &quot;guarding&quot; over it for a day now.\n\nSo it looks like=\r\n we have to get moving on that first draft!\n\nTake care everybody,\nsecretary=\r\ntocapt3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
