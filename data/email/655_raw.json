I see them in a lot of movies and on other characters in anime.  Not sure if it was more common to street types, like Sano.  (Good practice for when he gets with Sano, ne?  He&#39;ll know how to get Sano in and out of them... though I have to admit, I much prefer it when he takes them off with his katana... ;-P)\n \nphil (who still likes the stupid, tight, black t-shirt... he wears it *so* well!
