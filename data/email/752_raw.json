As soon as I put on the\ntenugui and carefully tied on my men nice and tight (these 2 steps are\ncomplicated to say the least) I felt like clawing my face mask and I\nwanted to scream &quot;get me outta hear it stinks and its hot and I can&#39;t\nsee! Aaaaaargh!&quot;\n\nThe whole bit about calloused hands...I look at my blistered palms \nand I think &quot;will bath & body works lotion cure this?&quot;  Note you also\nget calloused/blistered feet too...stupid sticky floors....I even\ntried the recommended &quot;caress the floor with your feet&quot; technique.\n\nnow technically one must spend &quot;several&quot; and not a couple of sessions\npracticing strikes and learning how to walk---now I do the kendo glide\nacross my apartment at work and around campus LOL! But today one\nperson failed to come to the club meeting so I had the good fortune of\nbeing the &quot;dummy&quot;...after a couple of drills (I can&#39;t remember all\ntheir names)...I began to really feel the weight of the gear and the\nshinai. To make things really fun the gym was around 70 degrees but\nunder the stuff you have to wear it felt like 90 degrees...\n\nOur teacher was very rigorous with all the drills and you really had\nto concentrate to hear his advice over all the screaming and\nyelling...I just nod to everything he says.  Because I&#39;m a cautious\nand considerate person it seemed that my training partner took this as\na que to be really dramatic when he started hitting me...I&#39;m just\nlooking out for his safety but right when I got the nerve to hit him\nREALLy hard we had to rotate partners...and this is interesting as I\nmentioned at www.shinsengumimb.com about the importance of height etc\nbecause in practice you had to constantly readjust to practice on\ndifferent partners and when you had a really tall guy you were almost\non tippy toes to hit him on the top of the head/men\n\nIn a chat session I mentioned the unity of mind/body...so I&#39;m\nbeginning to realize this (ofcourse atheletes/dancers and people who\nconcentrate really hard on their endeavours can relate)...but in the\ncase of martial arts you have to be very precise in how you are\nhitting your opponent and your own posture and how your own hands/arms\nend up and how fast you moved in on your opponent etc.\n\nI won&#39;t get to continue beyond 1 or 2 months for various reasons but\nit is really fascinating to experience kendo...by the end of 2 1/2\nhours I felt like curling up and saying &quot;please please stop hitting\nme...&quot; LOL!  Now I have a taste what was meant in Shinsengumi\nKepporoku when during a practice session a guy had a bucket of water\nthrown on him and the teacher says &quot;this isn&#39;t your soft city\ndojo&quot;...I mean I&#39;m with a university club practicing modern kendo and\nthe Shinsengumi were training to be effective as possible with their\nvaried lineages.\n\n\n"
