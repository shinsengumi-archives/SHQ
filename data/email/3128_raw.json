I&#39;m not trying to start any discord here, but to be\n&gt; &gt; honest=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I did not consider the accuracy of the Japanese Wikipedia to be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; germane to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the discussion at hand, therefore I didn&#39;t bring it up.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, what I was thinking about was if prior to the 20th c=\r\nentury the\n&gt; &gt; Japanese used the &quot;chinese&quot; method of calling you 1 on the d=\r\nay of your\n&gt; &gt; birth. I was looking for the confirmation, but didn&#39;t have t=\r\nhe fully\n&gt; &gt; formed thought until after I sent the message. By then I figur=\r\ned I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; wait to see what the response was.  So - &quot;official&quot; question - i=\r\ns that\n&gt; &gt; how Japanese calculated ages prior to the 20th century?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nEast Asian age reckoning: \n&gt; the current year - the year of birth + 1\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nTherefore, it still doesn&#39;t add up.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt;\n\nPS.  Inoue Taisuke was b=\r\norn in 1857 so he was 12 (by East Asian age reckoning) in 1868.\n\n\n"
