(pp. 2=\r\n38-241)&quot;\n-------------------------------------\n\nAdditional translation (AUG=\r\nUST 2007) \n\n&quot;However, Harada Sanosuke (Shinsengumi personnel) was not the m=\r\nan who \nmurdered [Ryoma]&quot;\n\n&quot;I [Yamakawa] was still young at the time, but I=\r\n&#39;ve asked older \npeople, and they all say it was the work of former Aizu re=\r\ntainer \nSasaki Tadasaburo, who worked for the shogunate and was the leader =\r\nof \nMimawarigumi.&quot;\n\nSource:\nNagakura Shinpachi, Shinsengumi Tenmatsu-ki. To=\r\nkyo: Shin Jinbutsu \nOraisha,\n2003.\n\nBasically Yamakawa (Yamagawa) Kenjiro, =\r\nAizu retainer and good friend \nof Fujita Goro (Saitou Hajime) was also in c=\r\nontact with Nagakura&#39;s \nson as well.  So aside from being deeply involved i=\r\nn post 1868 Aizu \naffairs, Yamakawa obviously concerned himself with Shinse=\r\nngumi issues.\nYamakawa is the most famous Aizu samurai in the Meiji era (al=\r\nthough \nhis sister was also very well known too)...his influence extends we=\r\nll \nbeyond academia because he was also an advisor to RIKEN Labs and was \ne=\r\nven involved the negotiation between the Brits and Japanese Naval \nagreemen=\r\nt in the 20th century.  \nI wrote an article about his other interests here:=\r\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/unmaskmeijipsychology.html\n------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\nM found some correspondences between=\r\n Yamakawa and an American at the \nNew York Public Library and scanned his s=\r\nig for us\n\nhttp://www.megaupload.com/?d=3DUBZ297WI\n\nThe New York Public Lib=\r\nrary does not allow for reproduction of their \nmaterial, therefore we had t=\r\no put it on Megaupload so the link/image \nexpires in 7 days.\n\nWe have alot =\r\nof info on people like Yamakawa and soon \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com will=\r\n be back up functioning at full \ncapacity\n\nYou may preview the new site com=\r\nplete with search features and \nsitemap at the site.\n\n\n"
