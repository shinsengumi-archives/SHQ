I \nwas \n&gt; &gt; wondering if Miki worked in a more rural area...if so he would&#39;ve \n&gt; &gt; managed chuzaisho (rural versions of the &quot;koban&quot;* police boxes) \nand \n&gt; &gt; had to deal with the army which was more dominant in rural \nareas.  \n&gt; &gt; Police in rural areas are even more *closer* to citizens too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *during the Meiji Era another term was used for koban (which \nmeant \n&gt; &gt; dormitory) but the term &quot;koban&quot; stuck to this very day\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\t\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt;  Take Yahoo!
