What I mentioned is just what most people go by when caring for blades in the present. There are others that feel otherwise though.  \n\nIf were to put myself in the past. I would only uchiko whenever the blade drew blood. If the blade hasn&#39;t seen combat in a while, maybe every month. \n\nHope this helps ^_^\n\nJon\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: spiritus_saitou \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, April 15, 2004 7:07 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Stupid question about sword care\n\n\n  This has probably been addressed before, but is there a site that \n  discusses in some detail how swords were cared for (more interested \n  in the past than the present, for writing reasons, though I realize \n  some things continue in time-honored fashion), or am I going to have \n  to go searching for a book?\n\n  Thanks for the information about the uchiko ball!  So, what you&#39;re \n  saying is that it was done on a regular basis in the past, right?  In \n  other words, this would be something of a regular chore for Saitou \n  even doing what he was doing in RK?\n\n  phil (getting too curious... again)\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jon Mesina&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; That ball is actually filled with a powder called uchiko.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Uchiko removes all the old oil and debris from a blade. It&#39;s made \n  by taking a polishing stones and grinding them up. This process \n  shouldn&#39;t be done too often on blades since it&#39;ll dull the polish and \n  mar the details in the metal. Course in the old days this didn&#39;t \n  matter as the upkeep as a weapon mattered more than perservation as a \n  piece of art.  \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Check this link for images. \n  &gt; http://johndswordpolishing.com/swordaccessories/\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Jon\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;   From: spiritus_saitou \n  &gt;   To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt;   Sent: Thursday, April 15, 2004 5:56 PM\n  &gt;   Subject: [SHQ] Stupid question about sword care\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   In so many samurai movies I see swordsmen caring for their swords \n  by \n  &gt;   applying *something* with a *puff-ball* type thing.
