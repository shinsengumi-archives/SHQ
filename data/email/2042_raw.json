The translator called it &quot;the \nmountain in this circle&quot;. \n\nWhat is the proper name of the medicine made by the Sato family? It \nwas for chest ailments and Toshizou sold it along with the Ishida \nSanyaku. Okita may have used this for his TB as well. The translator \ncalls it &quot;Empty trouble powdered medicine&quot; and &quot;Empty labor powdered \nmedicine&quot;.\n\nTamejirou was the one who inspired Toshizou to write haiku?\n\nWHO jumped into a flooded river with their kimono wrapped around the \nhead so they could go home? :D (www.tamahito.com)\n\nThere is a passage on www.toshizo.com that I am not sure I&#39;m reading \ncorrectly. It is saying something about him going off into a corner \nalone to drink when everyone else was celebrating? Was this one \nparticular incident or was this common behavior for him?\n\nToshizou was thought to have been fond of plum blossoms? The passage \nfrom www.toshizo.com says something about his haiku and that one is \ncarved on the tsuba of his sword is the reason people think this?\n\nI noted that it appears Kiroku died in 1860? So then was the &quot;older \nbrother&quot; that took care of the dojo while they were in Kyoto Daisaku? \nOr did someone else do this? And what is it trying to say about him \nbeing the one to make the Shinsengumi&#39;s offical sign?\n\nAnother passage from www.toshizo.com that I&#39;m not sure about... What \nis it saying about Toshizou&#39;s temper? Something about when he was \nangry (which was rare) he was &quot;stormier&quot; than Kondou and could not as \neasily be calmed down again? But he was usually fairly level-headed \notherwise? Is this a correct interpretation?\n\nWhat is it trying to say about him &quot;taking plain food&quot; in Hakodate?\n\nMizosoba (Gyukaku-sou) has some sort of stickers or thorns? \n\nThere is one passage that says something about Toshizou wearing a \nhakama of &quot;Sendaihira silk&quot;? What is the big deal with this \nspecifically?\n\nWhat is a &quot;sogami hairdo&quot;? I have no idea what the translator is \ntrying to say there...\n\nWhat about the haiku listed in the PMK Vol 2 graphic novel? Are those \nreally his work or something that was made up for the manga? And the \nrules they list? I&#39;ve heard of two of them, but not those others. You \ncould be made to commit seppuku for talking about &quot;ghosts and other \nstrange creatures&quot;?! *Starts hiding all her books on the \nsupernatural.* Thinking back to his reaction on hearing people \nthought Serizawa&#39;s ghost was returning, Toshizou must have -REALLY- \nhated ghost stories! LOL\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
