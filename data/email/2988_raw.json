Yak=\r\nuza today still are considered to \nbe right wing conservatives and use thei=\r\nr money to support political \ncandidates.\n\nRei Shinoda was asking about the=\r\n *Bakumatsu era, during which the \nyakuza had flourished (they were also do=\r\ning very well much earlier). \nAs stated in my post, yakuza &quot;history&quot; mostly=\r\n lore, goes way back in \nthe past.\n\nYakuza, samurai and politicians also ha=\r\nd common ground in very high \nprofile martial arts societies as well during=\r\n the Meiji (which had \nmembers from the military and police).\n\nThe quote po=\r\nsted at http://www.shinsengumihq.com/misc_facts.htm\n\nSeymour, Christopher. =\r\nYakuza Diary \nAtlantic Monthly Press ISBN: 087113604X \n\n&quot;Tells of the origi=\r\nns of the Aizu-Kotetsu gang which traced its \nroots to the birth of its fir=\r\nst leader Senkichi in 1836. &quot;Isao \nKondo&quot; was the leader of &quot;Shinsei-gumi&quot; =\r\nand he needed to place \nredundant members of the Shinsengumi. These men wer=\r\ne incorporated \ninto the gang was formally established in 1888 and used the=\r\n name \nAizu-Kotetsu. Aizu was their native region and Kotetsu was the \nfavo=\r\nred brand/type of sword of the boss.&quot; (Seymour 70-72)\n\nagain, I&#39;m sure Seym=\r\nour who had heard this lore from a member of the \nyakuza cannot guarantee i=\r\nts accuracy.  As I mentioned in my post, \nthere were practical reasons why =\r\nthe Shinsengumi *may have sought to \nbe on good terms with the powerful yak=\r\nuza which in fact did run the \nred-light district (the shinsengumi patrol a=\r\nrea).  Yakuza families \nmimicked samurai and merchant families and often ha=\r\nd blood line \nlineages where the &quot;business&quot; was passed onto the oldest son =\r\n(unless \nhe is overthrown).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
