Then how come Yoshida \n&gt;says &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about&quot; to Tetsu at Ikedaya?&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nThe was some speculation on some message board or other that I can&#39;t \nrecall either LJ or the AnimeForever one that said maybe it wasn&#39;t \nYoshida who killed them but that it could have been Hijikata since the \nsimilarities between their looks and attitude. Personally I think \nYoshida was such a bad character and that he killed so many who \ndisagreed with his views that he just didn&#39;t remember--as in they were \ntoo unimportant for him to remember. He did seem to recognize Tetsu in \nShimabara.\n\n&gt;There is alot of potential in the series but it would be totally flaky if Suzu \n&gt;goes crazy and that would be his only motivation...which is sadly where \n&gt;the series is heading with him carrying around Yoshida&#39;s head and \n&gt;stuff.  I never understood the Suzu and Yoshida bond...like big deal \n&gt;Yoshida comforted Suzu on the beach and encouraged Suzu to seek \n&gt;revenge but it&#39;s still sooo shallow.\n&gt;\n\nI know that in the manga Suzu totally goes off the deep end and I&#39;m \nguessing the bond was a result of Yoshida being all Suzu had in the \nworld as his brother&#39;s death made him an orphan?\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
