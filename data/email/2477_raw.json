While full\ntranslations seem a bit too daunting, I might put up detailed chapter by\nchapter (or story by story in the case of Okita-Kirameki no Zanzou) plot\ndescriptions along with a &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; gallery with images of each\nsignificant character.  Perhaps after reading a full summary, the books&#39;\nimages would make more sense.  It would take me a while to get something set\nup, but then I&#39;ll probably start with Getsu Mei Sei Ki and some of the\nstories from Okita Souji - Kirameki no Zanzou, to be followed by Hokusou\nShinsengumi and later Burai and perhaps some of the others.  I&#39;ll post a\nlink once I have something to point it to.\n\nNiwashi\n\np.s.  I just ordered Shinsengumi Hijikata Toshizou Mibu no Ginrou (the\ncompanion volume to Shinsengumi Okita Souji Kirameki no Zanzou), the next\ncouple volumes of Getsu Mei Sei Ki, and the first volume of Onikami Shinsen.\nWith ground shipping from halfway around the world, I won&#39;t get them for a\nmonth or so, but eventually I&#39;ll have a few more reviews to add.\n\n\n\n\n"
