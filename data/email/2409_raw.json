(^_^)\nYamanami has already appeared in the manga, and he looks like rather a \nkindly father too!\nI&#39;m waiting for Ito and Goryoeji group people but that would take more \ntime from now on.\n\nProbably I&#39;ll upload some scanned images for a while to give some idea \nof this manga.\n\nTama\n\n\n\n\n\n"
