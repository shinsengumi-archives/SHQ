Falling forward/backwards...the right and wrong\nway to do anything is a recurring theme in Japanese martial culture.\n\nI&#39;ve read that in the scenario that a woman actually kills herself (no\nsecond to assist)...she will plunge the dagger into her heart...I got\n2 examples to help us understand\n1) The Shambhala Guide to Kendo by Minoru Kiyota isbn1570629277 page 110\n&quot;General Nogi Maresuke...dressed himself in ceremonial garb and\ndisemboweled himself while his wife, Shizuko, pierced her heart beside\nhim&quot;\n2) The following scenario involves a couple of samurai which took a\ncastle...they searched each room and found the body of a\nnoblewoman...she had killed herself ...the samurai I guess removed the\nknife and commented that maybe the dagger was not made by Mr. X\nbecause all weapons knives made by Mr. X would not have been easily\ndamaged by bone.  The gist is they thought the knife was a fake. Thus,\nthe point is the woman stabbed herself in such a way that it scraped\nbone (sternum?rib?) in the chest area.&lt;&lt;&lt;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is interesting. In addition to the beliefs, I wonder when excactly these practices became more ritualized with the wearing of all white, the use of a second, the wooden pedestal, etc. \n\nHmm, interesting, I thought that the heart would be the hardest to pierce because of all the bone in that area. Now that my interest has been peaked i&#39;ll have to look more into the woman&#39;s side of this hehe. \n\nOne other thing I remembered, was there are a few ways to disembowel oneself that i&#39;ve heard about. There&#39;st the regular stab and cut across, but thers&#39;s others that involve manipulating the knife up or down in addition to cutting across. Sounds even more gruesome.... \n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, May 21, 2004 8:41 AM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Topic from Wounds~Beheading Decapitation\n\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Okita Souji&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n  Woops, I meant, the woman would sever her own arteries in the neck\n  with the\n  knife, not the second.
