Bodies were usually buried at night.  \n\nIn more modern times funerals are held during the day but the lantern \nis still present to reflect on this old belief.\n\nI&#39;ve seen many Chinese films dealing with night burials but the \nreasoning may not be the same.  Even today in Chinese burials there \nare lanterns all over the place at the service.\n\nmore on death\nThere are a couple versions of Toshiyoshi Kawaji&#39;s death.  But he \nisn&#39;t the only one, many important people will have different days on \nwhich they supposedly &quot;died&quot;.  He died on the way home, OR he died 5 \ndays after he got home.  Dr. Baelz in his diary mentions during his \ntreatment of a government official that the family was 100% prepared \nfor a funeral and they announced that their beloved was DEAD even \nthough the good doctor said that the man was in a coma state and NOT \nDEAD.  Simply, deaths are announced when families are PREPARED.  \nThere are more examples going farther back in history as well.  Even \nin the early 20th century and Empress, I can&#39;t remember which one, \npassed away while on vacation but she was treated as alive during her \ntrip back home.  Once the body was in the palace...THEN her death was \nmade public.\n\nif you want more morbid stuff....I read plenty on cremations and how \nbodies are prepared........\n\n\n\n\n"
