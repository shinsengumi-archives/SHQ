Cho&#772;shu&#772; in the Mei=\r\nji restoration. \n\nIs the best general reference on the topic.\nIf Choshu was=\r\n insanely popular it would be something short lived \nbecause the military a=\r\nction Choshu took against the westerners seemed \nthe most proactive however=\r\n the most foolhardy.  Much of the \npopulation was not fully aware of the mi=\r\nlitary capabilities the west \nwas ready to unleash on Japan (and they would=\r\n LOVE to have been \nprovoked and therefore justified in striking back).\n\nI =\r\nwill nudge a Choshu enthusiast and ask her to address this question.\n\n--- I=\r\nn SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I&#39;m aware of all =\r\nthis.  Though, I&#39;ve read from books that \npeople in Kyoto were pro-\n&gt; Chosh=\r\nu a long time ago. I just can&#39;t remember which books I read \nthat from and =\r\nI&#39;m \n&gt; wondering whether you guys have also read it before (from books, I \n=\r\nmean.)  If so, can \n&gt; anyone provide a few citations?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think that it =\r\nis impossible to truly determine if people in \nKyoto \n&gt; &gt; were Pro - [inser=\r\nt faction] and the reason is that there was \n&gt; &gt; no &quot;polling&quot; done in that =\r\nera.  Even in our modern era polling is \n&gt; &gt; unreliable and manipulated to =\r\nget people on a &quot;bandwagon&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For instance, Fukuchi Genichiro was a=\r\nble to print some of his \n&gt; &gt; arguably pro-bakufu opinions (Fukuchi later w=\r\nas a Meiji newspaper \n&gt; &gt; editor and became pro-Meiji government due to the=\r\n desire to seek \n&gt; &gt; stability in Japan).  We do not know if his pro-bakufu=\r\n stance \nduring \n&gt; &gt; the Bakumatsu years were popular or not.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The =\r\ntruth is the people in Kyoto or any situation will have a \nhard \n&gt; &gt; time e=\r\nxpressing themselves because they will side with whichever \nside \n&gt; &gt; can b=\r\nring stability and peace---at any cost.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps the question can=\r\n be answered with how people interpreted \nthe \n&gt; &gt; events of  Kinmon no Hen=\r\n (1864) during which many pro-bakufu \ndomains \n&gt; &gt; clashed with Choshu forc=\r\nes.  Was this viewed as an attempt BY \nChoshu \n&gt; &gt; to aggressively retake p=\r\nolitical power in Kyoto? OR was this \nviewed \n&gt; &gt; by many as Aizu&#39;s attempt=\r\n to suppress another domain.  We must \nask \n&gt; &gt; Choshu experts to explain d=\r\netails to us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rekishi Dokuhon is a magazine type publication with =\r\na mixed \n&gt; &gt; reputation however one can be clever and see if the informatio=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; printed can be confirmed with OTHER sources.  We also have to \nkeep =\r\nin \n&gt; &gt; mind that publishing in general is difficult and that some \n&gt; &gt; res=\r\nearchers may find it easier to get things recorded in \n&gt; &gt; Rekishi...than i=\r\nn other books.  For example let&#39;s imagine a \n&gt; &gt; researcher without mainstr=\r\neam credentials like for instance a PHd \nin \n&gt; &gt; history with a specializat=\r\nion in Japan---an &quot;amateur&quot; researcher \nmay \n&gt; &gt; have found something VERY =\r\nvaluable but may have to publish in \nRekishi \n&gt; &gt; Dokuhon due to the simple=\r\n circumstance of lack of credentials but \n&gt; &gt; more likley due to the fact t=\r\nhat it is just hard to get \npublished.  I \n&gt; &gt; think that we as fans must j=\r\nudge on a case to case basis.  \n&gt; &gt; www.shinsengumihq.com for instance has =\r\nhad to cite Rekishi \nDokuhon. \n&gt; &gt; Things such as rare Shinsengumi photos h=\r\nave even appeared in \n&gt; &gt; Rekishi....  We also have to keep in mind that ma=\r\nny books (not \njust \n&gt; &gt; the history magazine Rekishi...) on the shinsengum=\r\ni were written \nin a \n&gt; &gt; non-academic tone with dubious citation and the i=\r\nnformation \ntherefore \n&gt; &gt; at times is unreliable as well.  So Rekishi is n=\r\not the only \nproblem.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the reply and the pro-Aizu informa=\r\ntion.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
