Why can&#39;t people just \nrespect differences in views and opinions instead of being a \nflamer... Sorry if I kept referring to you by your real name on the \nmessageboards and even here. \n\nAs for violence... I do not condone it and I&#39;m sure no one here \ncondone, much less glorify violence. It was the reality at the time \nand could not be helped. For myself I see them just as people and as \nhow they were presented in the books, movies, anime that I have seen. \nIt&#39;s probably a skewed vision but that&#39;s why we study what \nwas &quot;real&quot;. There will be times that I forget about all the violence, \nbut when I do remember, I do not condemn anyone (pro/anti shogunate). \nI did not live during the time period so I have no right to judge \n(but I do speculate), but I (we) do have a right to study them. \n\nTo everyone,\n\nHow about we announce here on the groups what we would like to be \ncalled to &quot;protect&quot; ourselves not only from flamers but \nalso &quot;others&quot;. I will now just go by my pen name &quot;wounds&quot; on all \ngroups/messageboards related to the Shinsengumi. \n\n~wounds\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;tnamwong@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear friends,\n&gt; It seems that someone from another forum followed my banner to our\n&gt; shinsengumimb.com messageboard and took it upon himself to send me a\n&gt; very nasty, nasty email.  \n&gt; \n&gt; 1)The Shinsengumi were standing in the way of democracy [!]\n&gt; 2) They are evil cruel people etc etc etc\n&gt; 3) We aren&#39;t Japanese nor do we know the Japanese language therefore\n&gt; we shouldn&#39;t even study them\n&gt; \n&gt; So I had revised the announcement at the top of the messageboard to\n&gt; clearly state &quot;We welcome new members and critical analyzation of \nthe\n&gt; Shinsengumi. We accept and understand that the Shinsengumi are a\n&gt; controversial group.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I hunted down this individual at the other forum and noticed that he\n&gt; is ALSO not Japanese LOL but he is studying a Japanese martial \nart.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that this person was greatly affected, as we all are, by\n&gt; graphic images currently shown in the mass media as one of his many\n&gt; comments dealt with executions.  The person presumes that we cannot\n&gt; comprehend or even deny the violence and brutality of that time \nperiod\n&gt; and so on and so forth.  He made some really horrible accusations on\n&gt; how we seem to be glorifying violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; So from now on please call me &quot;sec&quot; on that messageboard \n(abbreviation\n&gt; of secretarytocapt3) because this guy kept calling me by my first \nname\n&gt; .  Now I must try to do something about my email :(\n&gt; \n&gt; I just wanted to share.\n&gt; Hopefully non of you here will receive a message from this person.\n\n\n"
