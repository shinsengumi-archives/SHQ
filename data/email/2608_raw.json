I mentioned\nin m=\r\ny post at the SHQ SPY DIVISION of scientists, husband and wife who\nhad TB, =\r\nstill caring for their own children (not out of necessity as\nthey had frien=\r\nds and relatives)\n\nin 1882 Dr. Robert Koch discovered tubercle bacillus the=\r\n aerobic\nbacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)---doctors around the world =\r\ndid\nnot believe him and there was a &quot;delay&quot; in adjusting their\nmethodologie=\r\ns and treatments---because it still made sense to many\nthat it was inherite=\r\nd (as of 1901 medical journals still printed\narticles proving how it ran in=\r\n the family).  Koch&#39;s failed attempt of\ndeveloping a cure, tuberculin, also=\r\n didn&#39;t help his cause.\n\nSo I skimmed\nThe Modern Epidemic: A history of tub=\r\nerculosis in Japan\nBy William Johnston. 432 pp. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard U=\r\nniversity\nPress, 1995. $45. ISBN 0-674-57912-7\n\n[New England Journal of Med=\r\nicine Review\nhttp://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/334/11/739]\n\nyeah yo=\r\nu can&#39;t really buy this book at that price---so see if your\nlibrary has it =\r\n(^_^)\n\nOk, let&#39;s get the Okita issues out of the way.  \nThe superstitions a=\r\nnd stigma associated with the symptoms/pollution\n(blood) of tuberculosis ha=\r\nve been mentioned on this list before---this\nbook will not only go into inc=\r\nredible detail it will also mention real\nlife examples (from the 20th centu=\r\nry) illustrating how these people\nwere banished from society.  \n\nThe book a=\r\npproaches the topic from a medical point of view and how\nthis illness is no=\r\nt confined to just the respiratory system --- but\ncan affect your spine, st=\r\nomach, intestines etc.  Members here who\nstudy science and want to combine =\r\nstudy w/ Shinsengumi interests will\nreally enjoy this book.  It was a disfi=\r\nguring disease associated with\nbad karma--hence the secrecy of OKita&#39;s heal=\r\nth was not simply for\nreasons concerning group morale.\n\nI cannot recall the=\r\n exact Japanese website but there is talk that\nOkita was a &quot;clean child&quot; or=\r\n celibate or even a virgin (all of this is\nJUST a rumor).  During his lifet=\r\nime it was believed that excessive\nsexual activity will lead to TB---thus i=\r\nf he was rumored to be a clean\nchild it makes sense that it was part of the=\r\n medical advice to abstain\nfrom sex.\n\nOkita&#39;s constant smiling.  During his=\r\n lifetime melancholia was\nassociated with TB---hence keep your spirits up a=\r\nnd you will not catch it!\n\nOkita as &quot;feminine&quot; --- the book does a stellar =\r\njob of examining TB in\nMeiji era literature (there was an entire GENRE devo=\r\nted to it). \nUsually the illness is associated with young frail, beautiful =\r\nwomen. \nInterestingly, many girls after their first menses WERE likely to g=\r\net\nTB, especially if they had a lower intake of protein (note many\nJapanese=\r\n had a vegetarian and fish diet that time).    We know that\nthe Shinsengumi=\r\n were the subject of folktales and even the novel\nNakazato Kaizan&#39;s DAIBOSA=\r\nTSU-TOGE [the film SWORD OF DOOM] (although\nOkita was not feminine or child=\r\nlike in this work) it is easy to see\nhow a doomed swordsman with TB all of =\r\nsudden takes on female qualities\nwhich would solidify him as a perpetually =\r\ntragic figure in fiction.\n\nthe book will mention some familiar names:\n[Mats=\r\numoto Ryojun] physician who accompanied shogunate troops as far\nas Hakodate=\r\n and later along with Nagakura and SAitou built a memorial\n\n[Dr. Willis] (a=\r\nt Toba & Fushimi and Aizu during Boshin War,\nKumamoto/Kyushu until Seinan W=\r\nar, later laid the foundation of Siriraj\nMedical School and Hospital in Ban=\r\ngkok)\n\n[Dr. Baelz] German who was the personal physician to royality and\ngo=\r\nvernmental VIPS --- his sticking to cellular *rather* than\nbacteriology pat=\r\nhology in Tokyo University School of Medicine\ninhibited alternate modes of =\r\napproaching the illness (we now know\nbacteriology was the right way to go)\n=\r\n\n***and for the one person out there who loves Dutch studies*** yes\nDutch m=\r\nedicine is discussed\n\nTo learn more about the romanticism connected to TB p=\r\nlease read\nhttp://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~mfukuda/english.html\nnovelist/do=\r\nctor/bureaucrat MORI OGAI is mentioned on this page.  \nMori Ogai, Higuchi I=\r\nchiyo and several of the most famoust writers of\nthe Meiji Era suffered fro=\r\nm and died of TB.  Note how Mori Ogai kept\nhis condition a secret.\n\nThe boo=\r\nk also provides euphemisms doctors will use in diagnosing a\npatient.  Docto=\r\nrs who diagnose patients with TB were themselves\nsubject to negative public=\r\n reaction!\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[Footnotes]\nThe big=\r\ngest obstacle to medical education was the abhorrance of\ndissection and ass=\r\nociation with uncleanliness see:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/mes=\r\nsage/107\nin the late 1890s-early 20th century the only women&#39;s medical acad=\r\nemy\n(born from the founder&#39;s desire to have women treat women infected\nwith=\r\n sexually transmitted diseases) was ridiculed for unladylike\nmanners in dis=\r\nsecting cadavers...\n\nTakamine Hideo spent alot of time studying protozoa un=\r\nder a\nmicrocope---the discovery of tubercle bacillus would have been of\ngre=\r\nat interest to him as well since his own brother died of TB in 1883\n\nThe no=\r\nvel mentioned throughout the book HOTOTOGISU (bestseller later\ntranslated i=\r\nnto English as NAMIKO: A REALISTIC NOVEL)\nwas about Yamakawa Oyama Sutemats=\r\nu\nmentioned http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\nand\nhttp://www=\r\n.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\n\n\n\n\n"
