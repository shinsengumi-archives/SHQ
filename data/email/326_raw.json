I suddenly got ready... :-)\n \nIt is a LONG way from finished... needs some tweaking in various spots... no manga images yet (just received them a few minutes ago) and no PMK yet (going after permissions tomorrow)... and a couple of links need looking into.  It also hasn&#39;t been tested on Netscape yet as Netscape isn&#39;t loaded on my computer and I can&#39;t get to my husband&#39;s until he&#39;s finished blowing up things in his online game.\n \nThis is my first time creating and loading a website, so it&#39;s very experimental.  The font size is smaller than I want it in some places... lots and lots more to learn.  I wanted to do something related to Saitou, so I chose to collect images.  I owe many thanks to Tiffany and Kevin for helping me today... especially Tiffany for giving me that little extra push over the side to do it.  Comments and complaints welcome.\n \nhttp://www.geocities.com/spiritus_saitou\n \nphil (who&#39;s about decided RK Saitou deserves a site all his very own... ever try to pick &quot;just a few&quot; from among hundreds?  I should make it a revolving gallery...)\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
