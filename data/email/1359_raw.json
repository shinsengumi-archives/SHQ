Therefore, \n&gt; the text was expressed by Romanji from Japanese&#39;s\n&gt; mind easy. \n&gt; However, I looked at the comment of Kamo san and I\n&gt; thought that the \n&gt; text which mixed Romanji might confuse those who can\n&gt; read Japanese. \n&gt; Therefore, although I asked Kamo san, I seem to be\n&gt; OK. ne?\n\n\nOh, no problem at all for me ^^ If you feel more\ncomfortable writing some stuff in Romaji to avoid\nmisunderstandings and all, then please do so ^^ \nAs for myself, I don&#39;t mind at all. Besides, I am the\none who will potentially sound impolite when writing\nin Japanese (keigo wa mattaku dame desu no de\nohazukashii kagiri desu. Sumimasen... m(..)m ).\n\n \n&gt; &quot;Yahiko no Sakabatou&quot;!! If I confess, I am not\n&gt; reading it. \n&gt; (Of course, the story knows. However, I lost the\n&gt; chance to read it.)\n&gt; Probably, this is the first time that it goes\n&gt; abroad. \n\n\nI guess so. According to Shueisha, it was the first\ntime that it was published abroad and the first time\nin the world that it was published in &quot;tankohon&quot;\nformat.\n\n\n&gt; About Brazil, I read this report considerably\n&gt; before. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/\n&gt; \n&gt; Since I did not think that RK became popular in\n&gt; countries other than \n&gt; Japan, I was very much surprised. \n&gt; Has a thing like this report really happened in\n&gt; Brazil? \n\n\nI presume you are talking about these:\n\nhttp://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/011102-71colonia.html\nhttp://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/030124-62colonia.html\n\nAnd yes, it is pretty much true. Rurouni Kenshin\n(known as Samurai X here) was a huge hit, despite the\nheavy censorship suffered when it was aired and the\nincredibly poor dubbing (e.g., they never defined if\nKenshin was going to Kyoto, Tokyo, Edo or Aioria(sic)\nto fight Shishio). The &quot;Yahiko no Sakabatou&quot; is being\nreleased here almost one year after the end of the\noriginal series and already its first print is almost\nsold out (ookata kanbai desu), though it&#39;s being sold\nso far only in a local anime con. Not to mention that\nthere are still many RK cosplayers in the event,\nincluding Kenshin, Sanosuke, Yahiko and Saito, despite\nthe end of the series.\n\nAs for RuroKen popularity, I guess it is quite popular\nin the Phillipines and France, just to name other two\ncountries where RuroKen was published and got popular.\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
