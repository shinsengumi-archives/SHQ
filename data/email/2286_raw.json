I developed MY fundoshi fetish a LONG time ago... for *cough* aesthetic *cough* reasons.  ^_^\n \n&gt;&gt;Miki is the butt of our jokes and even his guardian fangirl\naccidentally be-littles him...quote from PHIL....(^_^)\n(Suzuki may have been sent to the Tokaido, the eastern road connecting Edo and Kyoto... not sure about that yet... no big deal since his Second Patrol was disbanded two weeks after it was created.)&lt;&lt;\n \nWhat!!??  I wasn&#39;t belittling him with that.  How much could he have realistically done in a mere 13 days?  Stupid Imperialists...  I have *no* doubt that Miki would&#39;ve been as successful as Sagara was (and Sagara was successful, which was part of the problem for the Imperialists) if he&#39;d been allowed to do the job.  From what I&#39;ve understood from texts, it was the men in the Second Patrol who wanted him as their captain.  There had to be a reason. (And it wasn&#39;t his fault he had a domineering, overprotective big brother in the Shinsengumi. *pinching Barb*)\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
