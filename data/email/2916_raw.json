For instance, texts will say &quot;The Seinan War may \n&gt; be regarded as=\r\n a shizoku rebellion&quot;.  Meaning former Satsuma samurai \n&gt; (who still consid=\r\nered themselves to be samurai ofcourse).  The \n&gt; Fujita Family were categor=\r\nized as heimin.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even after 1868, your social roots still continued to =\r\nbe very \n&gt; important.  Interestingly, many students at a school I studied \n=\r\n&gt; noted &quot;shizoku&quot; status even though their parents were engaged in \n&gt; merch=\r\nant work in the Meiji Era.

Many samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed their name twice, but Okita had o=\r\nnly changed \n&gt; his name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once. Yes, a samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwould have usually kept his formal given name/middle \n&gt; name when he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed his (full)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from H=\r\narumasa to Kaneyoshi. \n&gt; Why?

I \n&gt; thought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps a male mi=\r\nght choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been \n&gt; given) a name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hon=\r\nor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his \n&gt; name from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like \n&gt; Katsujirou. And\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part \n&gt; of his=\r\n name,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separatin=\r\ng \n&gt; himself from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a=\r\n Shimazaki \n&gt; first?
