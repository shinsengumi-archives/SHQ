We know\nHijikata is mentioned in Jules Brunet&#39;s writing (in French) but are\nthe docs in the vid---RUSSIAN??? It would be interesting. We have to\nremember that the north (Hokkaido) was of special interest to the\nRussians. I saw some art out of that era where the Russian bear and\nother western powers were watching over the naval battles in the north.\n\n\n\n                           \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
