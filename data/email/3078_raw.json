His name was\nSakurada Matsumaro, and he was alive till some 20\nyears ago (he was a friend of my grandfather, who was\nfrom Aizu). Before WWII, he was one of the kendo\ninstructors in Brazil.\n\nAccording to the records,\n\n1) His grandfather was Sakurada Sakuramaro and he was\none of the kenjutsu instructors of Sendai. This\nimplies that Yamanami Keisuke most probably wasn&#39;t\nSakurada Sakuramaro himself.\n\n2) Their kenjutsu style was Hokushin Itto ryu. This\nimplies that either Chuka Itto ryu was abandoned (at\nleast its name) or it was something that was passed\nonly to the head of the family, which I think it&#39;s\nmore likely. So, the head (first son) would inherit\nChuka Itto ryu and all the others would learn Hokushin\nItto. According to this hypothesis, Yamanami Keisuke\nwould have been proficient in Hokushin Itto, not\nChuka, which  explains why the name Chuka Itto ryu\nisn&#39;t associated with Keisuke.\n\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
