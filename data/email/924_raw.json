At first, it was based on the Ishin Shishi, but then I fell in love with the Shinsengumi. I&#39;ll post some pics as soon as I can! Also, the link is http://www.fictionpress.com/read.php?storyid=1519468.\n \nI want to read yours too! It&#39;s really hard finding Shinsengumi fans nowadays. *sighs* I&#39;m really glad that this group has been started and all. Keep the fandom alive and long live the Shinsengumi! ^.^x\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo!
