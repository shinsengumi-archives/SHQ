Also, does anyone know if Hijikata married/had children before he \n&gt; died?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kalli\n\nOn the subject of Saito, no they never had any daughters. And the youngest son actually wasn&#39;t their child. They adopted him. Apparently he was the son of some of Tokio&#39;s relatives. He found out when he was in college by asking an aunt. We&#39;ve yet to figure out exactly what made him suspicious, but the most likely explanation is that his name doesn&#39;t appear of the Fujita house documents.\n\nAs for Hijikata, there was a rumor that a marriage had been arranged for him at one point, but he never went through with it. Then there&#39;s another rumor that someone did have a little girl by him, but unfortunately the baby died soon after birth. So he apparently died single and childless. Such a shame.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
