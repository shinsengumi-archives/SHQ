There is always another person that will\nact this way. Isn&#39;t the anonomity of the internet\ngreat? lol ;)\n The Shinsengumi were clearly &quot;anti-terrorist&quot; for\nthat time period. They weren&#39;t the ones stirring up\ntrouble in Kyoto. The notion of democracy really\nwasn&#39;t in the minds of the people in Satsuma or Choshu\neither. Ryoma Sakamoto being one of the exceptions. \n\nKevin\n\n--- Tiffany &lt;tnamwong@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear friends,\n&gt; It seems that someone from another forum followed my\n&gt; banner to our\n&gt; shinsengumimb.com messageboard and took it upon\n&gt; himself to send me a\n&gt; very nasty, nasty email.  \n&gt; \n&gt; 1)The Shinsengumi were standing in the way of\n&gt; democracy [!]\n&gt; 2) They are evil cruel people etc etc etc\n&gt; 3) We aren&#39;t Japanese nor do we know the Japanese\n&gt; language therefore\n&gt; we shouldn&#39;t even study them\n&gt; \n&gt; So I had revised the announcement at the top of the\n&gt; messageboard to\n&gt; clearly state &quot;We welcome new members and critical\n&gt; analyzation of the\n&gt; Shinsengumi. We accept and understand that the\n&gt; Shinsengumi are a\n&gt; controversial group.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I hunted down this individual at the other forum and\n&gt; noticed that he\n&gt; is ALSO not Japanese LOL but he is studying a\n&gt; Japanese martial art.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that this person was greatly affected, as\n&gt; we all are, by\n&gt; graphic images currently shown in the mass media as\n&gt; one of his many\n&gt; comments dealt with executions.  The person presumes\n&gt; that we cannot\n&gt; comprehend or even deny the violence and brutality\n&gt; of that time period\n&gt; and so on and so forth.  He made some really\n&gt; horrible accusations on\n&gt; how we seem to be glorifying violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; So from now on please call me &quot;sec&quot; on that\n&gt; messageboard (abbreviation\n&gt; of secretarytocapt3) because this guy kept calling\n&gt; me by my first name\n&gt; .  Now I must try to do something about my email :(\n&gt; \n&gt; I just wanted to share.\n&gt; Hopefully non of you here will receive a message\n&gt; from this person.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
