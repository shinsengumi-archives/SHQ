The Japanese Police Establishment. Tokyo: \nObun Intereurope Limited, 1972.\n\n*obviously the law below is way past Nagakura&#39;s time however it does \ngive us some insight to his daily work before he retired\n\n(Rinalducci page 331)\narticle 20 of the Prison Law IMPERIAL ORDINANCE NO. 289 of 1908\nPrison Guards may carry swords or rifles \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I am making this dissertation by Naoyuki Umemura (University of \n&gt; Chicago graduate now at Waseda Univ.) available to the group.   \nJust \n&gt; so you know dissertations (their are at least dozens dealing with \n&gt; every aspect of the Meiji Era) are available in PDF form via \n&gt; dissertation databases (available at all college/university \nlibrary \n&gt; databases).\n&gt; \n&gt; I had this paper for several months now but I would like someone \nto \n&gt; consider summarizing pages 159 to 206 which deals with the \n&gt; Tokugawa &quot;Benevolent Prisons&quot; and Meiji Era prison system (there \nis \n&gt; also a chapter at the end called Hokkaido as a space for exodus). \n&gt; \n&gt; Just like the police system many aspects of the Tokugawa era are \n&gt; carried over into the &quot;modern&quot; period and I guarantee that you \nwill \n&gt; come across some very interesting information.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are in junior high or high school *please DO NOT be \n&gt; intimidated the reading is VERY VERY easy and this is your chance \nto \n&gt; expose yourself to the kind of writing advanced students do.\n&gt; \n&gt; *as you guys know I am researching the Meiji Era police system \njust \n&gt; because....I&#39;m weird (and I find it to be a good &quot;template&quot; for \n&gt; understanding the rise of the modern nation state for other \n&gt; countries, I specialize in Thailand actually) oh and I think we \ncan \n&gt; actually follow the careers of Miki and Fujita G. in an organized \n&gt; manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; file size = 10mb \n&gt; https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/policeandprison.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; and yes you can download it without actually summarizing the \nprison \n&gt; part for us (-_-) I&#39;m hoping someone will *volunteer* though \n(^_^).  \n&gt; POOR Nagakura...he needs a loyal fangirl.\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n\n\n\n\n"
