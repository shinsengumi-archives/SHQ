While reading through a few pages online, some people stated that if Okita Souji hadn&#39;t been sick and had fought during the battles of Fushi and Toba, that the outcome would have been very diffrent.   So the question is, what do you guys think?   Would the Shinsengumi and their allies have won the battle (and maybe a few more afterwards) if Okita had fought?   Or would they have lost anyways?\n \nThe other quesion is, was Kogoro Katsura really determined to burn down Kyoto?   (I need to verify this so that I don&#39;t screw up on my fanfic ^^;;;)  \n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
