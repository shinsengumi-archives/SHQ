I just got back from a field trip to Borders, \n&gt;where I discovered an entire mystery series set in Japan in the 1680&#39;s.  \n&gt;The author is Laura Joh Rowland.\n\nI have a book from that series!! I read some others, too. It ROCKS!! Plus, \nwith the timeframe the author is operating in, her character might be around \nfor the vendetta of the 47 ronin (aka Chushingura, chushin gishi, etc.)!!\n\nOne of her books, &quot;The Samurai&#39;s Wife&quot;, is actually set in Kyoto.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTired of spam?
