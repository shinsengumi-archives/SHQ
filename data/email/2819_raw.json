However, in history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander=\r\n \nOkita shared a brotherly relationship with. It is debatable whether Okita=\r\n and Hijikata were \neven on good terms with each other.\n\nIf anyone&#39;s unsure=\r\n of it, accurate information could be found in HISTORICAL references. \n\n\n--=\r\n- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; ok =\r\nso we are all in agreement that there is some conflicting info on\n&gt; Okita b=\r\nut there are issues regarding citation\n&gt; \n&gt; as of today this page is now a =\r\nmess  ::ROFL!!::\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; I can=\r\n&#39;t keep up with you intense researchers (I work on the timeline,\n&gt; Saitou H=\r\najime post 1868 because there is more info in English on the\n&gt; Meiji Era, T=\r\nakagi/Fujita Tokio and some Aizu folks) so I have a ~weak~\n&gt; grasp of Okita=\r\n (but I wrote that article on TB, that counts for\n&gt; something right?)...now=\r\n this is an idea...\n&gt; \n&gt; why don&#39;t all the Okita specialists form a team an=\r\nd revise Okita&#39;s\n&gt; info page (^___^) get in a chatroom, or work on someone&#39;=\r\ns blog and do\n&gt; some revising etc...but really you don&#39;t have to be a speci=\r\nalist you\n&gt; can be a fan who joins the group and asks questions, this will =\r\nhelp\n&gt; the main writers understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of the hundreds of thousands o=\r\nf\n&gt; Okita fans out there\n&gt; \n&gt; again it is totally important to cite details=\r\n this would be very\n&gt; helpful to visitors of the site\n&gt; \n&gt; also you may rig=\r\nht some mini articles on Okita as well and I can\n&gt; create a sub-menu\n&gt; \n&gt; f=\r\nor example I split the Saitou Hajime page into sections (by the way\n&gt; I&#39;m i=\r\nn the process of converting my word document essay into html to\n&gt; enhance t=\r\nhe info on the page) you can take a peak here:\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.c=\r\nom/saitouhajime.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; and when you are all done, just email the text, yo=\r\nur names (real or\n&gt; user names) to shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com\n&gt; \n&gt; a similar=\r\n approach was adopted with the gigantic still in progress\n&gt; timeline where =\r\nseveral people over a couple of months emailed\n&gt; updates/entries\n&gt; \n&gt; so pr=\r\nomise me that you will all think about it!  It is really\n&gt; impossible for o=\r\nne person to study ALL the Shinsengumi members or all\n&gt; facets of the histo=\r\nry/culture\n&gt; \n&gt; specialize. divide and conquer!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
