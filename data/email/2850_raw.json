It&#39;s a misconception that Okita&#39;s mother died when he was &quot;very y=\r\noung.&quot;  In fact, she \ndied in 1862. (Mori, p.36 - p.37)\n\n2. Okita Souji is =\r\nlisted in the death records at the family temple\nas being the &quot;2nd son of O=\r\nkita Rintaro Genji (sp???)&quot; (not to be confused with  Okita \nRintaro Fujiwa=\r\nra no Mototsune.) Okita Rintaro Genji (also from the Inoue family) was \nado=\r\npted into the Okita family; he died in 1852.   (Mori, p.10)   \n\nIt&#39;s believ=\r\ned that Okita Rintaro Genji adopted Okita Souji. (Mori, p.11)\n(Myabe he als=\r\no adopted Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune?)  Okita Rintaro Genji served=\r\n \nas the head of the Okita family, before Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsu=\r\nne became the \nhead of the family in place of the young heir, Okita Souji.\n=\r\n\n3. Okita changed his name to &quot;Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot; before hi=\r\ns departure to \nKyoto.  He could have changed his name in 1863 (or in 1862,=\r\n or less likely, in 1861.)  I&#39;ve \nreversed my notes on the Okita discussion=\r\n page at Wikipedia (and have taken all the caps \noff.)\n\n&gt;A few notes\n&gt;\n&gt;1. =\r\nOkita was born in the Shirakawa-han&#39;s mansion in Edo (present day Tokyo.)\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;2. His birth name (in full) was Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa. He l=\r\nater &gt;changed \n&gt;his name to &quot;Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi.&quot; Other than=\r\n his full &gt;name, he could be \n&gt;referred as Okita Souji, Okita Souji Kaneyos=\r\nhi, or Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi. In the case of \n&gt;his birth name, he could be =\r\nreferred as Okita Soujirou, Fujiwara no Harumasa, or Okita \n&gt;Soujirou Harum=\r\nasa (never Okita Harumasa Soujirou!)\n&gt;Family Name: Okita\n&gt;Given Name/First =\r\nName Equivalent: Soujirou, Souji\n&gt;Family Clan Name:Fujiwara\n&gt;Formal Given N=\r\name/Middle Name Equivalent: Harumasa, Kaneyoshi\n&gt;\n&gt;3. Okita was enrolled at=\r\n the Tennen Rishin-ryu school between 1850 and 1852, Kondou \n&gt;Isami was enr=\r\nolled in 1848. Kondou Isami was like a &quot;TA&quot; to Okita and didn&#39;t become the =\r\n\n&gt;forth master until 1861, the same year Okita mastered all the techniques =\r\nof Tennen \n&gt;Rishin-ryu.\n&gt;\n&gt;4. Okita was actually Hijikata&#39;s &quot;senpei&quot; and wa=\r\ns enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school \n&gt;before Hijikata. (Hijikata was=\r\n formally enrolled in 1859.)\n&gt;\n&gt;5. Okita was sent to a hospital in Edo duri=\r\nng the Boshin War(1868-1869) and after the \n&gt;first battle (Battle of Toba-F=\r\nushimi) of Boshin War. It was not a tuberculosis hospital and \n&gt;an injured =\r\nKondo was sent to the same hospital with Okita.\n\n4. This is only a suggesti=\r\non,  I think it&#39;s more appropriate to refer him as &quot;Okita Souji \nFujiwara n=\r\no Kaneyoshi.&quot; While Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi was a member of the \n=\r\nShinsengumi, Okita Soujirou Fijiwara no Harumasa was the Head Coach at the =\r\nShieikan.\n\n5.  Even though my user name is &quot;nlf7,&quot; I&#39;ve been using my nickn=\r\name &quot;Seven&quot; on all the \ndiscussion pages at Wikipedia. May I suggest that y=\r\nou also use my nickname &quot;Seven&quot; to \navoid confusion or list both my user na=\r\nme and my nickname?\n\n\n~Seven\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secr=\r\netarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; test run http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSou=\r\njiro.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; again nlf7 can gather more Okita fans to improve upon the pag=\r\ne \n&gt; \n&gt; a proper disclaimer has been inserted at the top of the page\n&gt; \n&gt; a=\r\nlso if there is an error please give the page address so I know what \n&gt; to =\r\nrevise...for example just say &quot;Background&quot; &quot;Shinsengumi Period&quot; and \n&gt; so f=\r\north so I can save some time\n&gt; \n&gt; over time as more information is gathered=\r\n and contributed many \n&gt; Shinsengumi member&#39;s pages will change to this for=\r\nmat\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
