Nobori says in \nthe picture &quot;Nagashima Gorosaku, killed at age 18. Originally from Awa, he \nfollowed Hijikata from the Kyoto days on, going to Ezo. Meiji 2, from the \n4th to the 5th month, he fought the enemy countless times at Futamata. 5th \nmonth, 11th day, he was killed in battle.&quot; The site that the picture is \nposted on adds: &quot;Born Ka&#39;ei 5, in Awa. In the 6th month of Keio 3, he joined \nShinsengumi. Fought at Toba-Fushimi, and escaped to Edo, then went to Aizu, \nand escaped to Ezo via Sendai. Fought at the battle of Futamataguchi, but \nbecause he was attached to Hijikata and not Shinsengumi at the time, this \ncannot be credited to Shinsengumi. Killed in action in the defense of \nHakodate on 5/11/Meiji 2&quot;\n\nSo he was probably an older brother figure to Ichimura Tetsunosuke, \nparticularly in the last days. Unlike Tetsu, however, he stayed with \nHijikata, and paid the price.\n\nSuch is war.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
