The version I have was published in 2003,\n&gt; &gt; edited=\r\n by Kimura Sachiko.  I found Nagakura Shinpachi&#39;s post script\n&gt; &gt; particula=\r\nrly interesting:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (I&#39;m paraphrasing)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;This battle record w=\r\nas not written during the trying times of the\n&gt; &gt; actual battles. This was =\r\ndone after the fact, memories that I\n&gt; &gt; revisited now and then.  This is t=\r\nhe story of what actually happened.\n&gt; &gt; Because of this, it differs from fi=\r\nctional accounts, and I want it to\n&gt; &gt; be understood as a true account.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s somewhere near the top of my to-read list, once I get started,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll post translations of the more interesting/broadly applicable\nparts=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
