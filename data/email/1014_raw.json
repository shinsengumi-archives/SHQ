I am \n&gt; really interested in learning all I can about the Shinsengumi and \nits \n&gt; members, and I&#39;ve heard this is THE PLACE to get and share info in \nEnglish.\n&gt; Just as an intro, I&#39;ll give a quick rundown of what I&#39;m into, ne?  \nLet&#39;s \n&gt; see, my fav. member is Saitou Hajime, although Peacemaker Kurogane \nhas \n&gt; gotten me quite curious about Harada Sanosuke as well.  As for \nanime, I&#39;ve \n&gt; seen Kenshin and PMK and I am digging for more.  In manga, I&#39;ve \nread a \n&gt; bunch of PMK and I have a bunch of scanlations sitting on my \ncomputer \n&gt; waiting for attention.  As for live action stuff, this is where I \nam \n&gt; horribly deficient, but I hope to fix that soon!\n&gt; I&#39;ve also taken two years of Japanese and would be going into my \n3rd year \n&gt; if it weren&#39;t for the fact that I&#39;m going to Tanzania this fall.  I \nlove \n&gt; learning about other aspects Japanese history outside of the \nShinsengumi \n&gt; and the areas I&#39;m most interested in include the Sengoku jidai (age \nof \n&gt; civil wars), the Edo period, and the Meiji Restoration.\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m currently working on a full Shinsengumi uniform (minus \nthe armor, \n&gt; because that would be really hard to make) to wear to this year&#39;s \nOtakon in \n&gt; Baltimore, so any tips on such would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well that&#39;s about it!\n&gt; I look forward to many more e-mails wrought with Shinsengumi \ngoodness!\n&gt; \n&gt; Tootles!\n&gt; \n\nJust wanted to say WELCOME! Enjoy your stay... Don&#39;t worry about live-\naction/chambara films you&#39;ll get there. TRUST ME.... Hmm what else? \nOh let me introduce myself to you, I&#39;m wounds the MOST LOYAL fan of \nSaitou-sama. I&#39;m fond of the big three too, most specially Kondou but \nwith the new info I&#39;m hearing that might change. *sigh*\n\nSee you around.\n\n~wounds\n\n\n"
