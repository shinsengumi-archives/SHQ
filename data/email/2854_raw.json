Rintaro Mototsune is listed in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Shinchogumi records as &quot;So=\r\nn of the late Okita Katsujiro, retainer of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Lord Abe Noto no Kami&quot;. (Ki=\r\nkuchi, p. 26) \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry, but I have to respectfully disagree. The rec=\r\nord of Okita\n&gt; Rintaro as [adopted] son of Okita Katsujiro *is* a fact, rec=\r\norded in a\n&gt; source related to the Shinchogumi, compiled *during* the Bakum=\r\natsu,\n&gt; which Kikuchi lists. It wasn&#39;t raised as part of explaining why Soj=\r\ni\n&gt; is listed as the &quot;second son&quot;, it was merely confirming how Rintaro\n&gt; M=\r\nototsune/Fusamasa was listed in Shinchogumi records. Kikuchi\n&gt; theorizes la=\r\nter, but this much, with regards to Rintaro being\n&gt; Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;son&quot;, is a=\r\n fact which Kikuchi cites as coming from the\n&gt; record of &quot;Shinchogumi Meisa=\r\nishosocho&quot;, from 1865.\n&gt; \n&gt; As always, thank you for your interaction, and =\r\nfor bringing activity\n&gt; back into this group.\n&gt; \n&gt; -M.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
