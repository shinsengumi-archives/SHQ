First look at Shinsengumi Game Designs\n\n\n  I admittedly ain&#39;t the biggest fan of when they put the swords on \n  the wrong side for Saito.  On various Martial Arts boards there are \n  threads worth of lefties asking if they can train left hand over \n  right on the sword and then they get all huffy when they&#39;re told \n  that it&#39;s not done that way (for a variety of reasons, among them \n  being that putting the swords on the right hip instead of the left \n  will have you whacking saya with pretty much every other swordsman \n  you walk past).  In Yagyu Shinkage Ryu we have a few left handed \n  draws and cuts, but these waza always end with the right hand \n  resuming its topside grip on the tsuka.  Saito may have been \n  naturally left handed but as was said he would have been forced to \n  use his right hand from the time he was a small child thanks to the \n  conventions of the times.  I dug Mibu Gishiden, but the side switch \n  with Saito was something that drove me nuts.  I like how its done in \n  RK a lot better where he wears his swords on the proper side and \n  switches his grip when he decides to use his left handed thrust.\n  But anywho, wasn&#39;t there another Shinsengumi game coming out where \n  they&#39;re all wearing the generally accepted blue haori?  Are any of \n  these ever going to make their way over to the U.S.?\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt; You beat me to it ^_^ I noticed it too...the Hijikata ends up \n  &gt; looking like the Fuun Shinsengumi Hijikata...so many Japanese \n  &gt; messageboards like to say &quot;its impossible he, like other lefties \n  &gt; would&#39;ve had to conform to the widespread etiquette of the time \n  &gt; period&quot; etc etc etc...besides the &quot;shirts off&quot; mode I also \n  recommend \n  &gt; the fundoshi only mode after you have accumulated a certain number \n  &gt; of points and so forth....\n  &gt; \n  &gt; If it is like Dynasty Warriors (where you can increase the \n  &gt; skill/intelligence of your bodyguards not to mention their \n  &gt; weapons)...maybe in this new Shinsengumi game you can improve on \n  &gt; your squad&#39;s capabilities and give orders and employ \n  strategies...oh \n  &gt; the possibilities...squeal\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;unsafesects&quot; &lt;mindglue@i...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \n  &gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Not bad...if it has some of the detail seen in such games as \n  &gt; Soul \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Calibur 1&2 or Onimusha then it&#39;ll be awesome...I noticed that \n  &gt; the \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; uniforms have elements of the Gohatto design...\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Many games allow for the customization of uniforms...e.g. \n  &gt; Dynasty \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors 4...I wonder if this game has that feature...in which \n  &gt; case \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; fangirls may choose the &quot;no shirts&quot; option LOL! ^_^\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; I am very amused by the fact that they remembered to put \n  Saitou&#39;s \n  &gt; &gt; katana on the righthand side so he can draw with his left hand.\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Perhaps I should not be scrutinizing these pictures as much as I \n  &gt; am.\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Angrybee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
