It was thought to be dangerous to give strangers your real name. (One has to keep in mind how isolated rural villages were and the fact that actually meeting a stranger would have been a very rare event. Most people never left their villages once during their entire lifetime, even to go to the next town.) You find the examples of this most often in the Faery lore. Strange that such a fear was so common all over. \n\nThanks for clearing that up! I&#39;ve heard the name &quot;Yoshitoyo&quot; before and was told it was a formal name, but I had no understanding of exactly what that meant. Hm, it seems that someone learning his &quot;Imina&quot; would have been disasterous. Would he have trusted that a person claiming to have an urgent message from his family more if they used this name or would it have made him even more suspicious than he might have been? An interesting idea to pursue in a fic.\n\n\nOh, I was actually still referring to Matsudaira. It would have actually surprised me to hear of Yoshinobu taking an active part. I&#39;ve never seen any indication that the Shinsengumi were all that close to him in any way. But they seemed very loyal to Matsudaira. So I was just thinking of all that he did for them later and was glad to know he thought so much of their efforts on his behalf.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
