I have most of the characters and scenes \n  jotted down but I need a bit of help. I need a detailed timeline of \n  the battles between them, which has been hard for me to find.(I am \n  considering writting some of the novel, and it&#39;s sequel if I make one, \n  in diary form, thus the very very important need for a timeline.) \n  \n  Also I need information on the 4th-9th Captains. (I&#39;ve got a fairly \n  good idea of how I am going to write Souji, Toshizou, Sanosuke, \n  Shinpachi, Saitou, and Kondou.) \n  \n  And last of all, I need an opinion on whether I should start the novel \n  in the Edo Bakufu or Bakumatsu. The novel, or novels, will last until \n  the beggining of the Meiji Era. Thanks for the help. If you are \n  intrested in reading the novel, which I hope to have finished before \n  Nov. 2007, then look for &#39;Makoto: Wolf in Maiden&#39;s Clothing&#39; by S.
