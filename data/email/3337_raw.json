You ca=\r\nn read online classic\ntranslations of ROTK, read summaries in Chinese liter=\r\nature books or\njust play any one of the famous DYNASTY WARRIOR vid games.\n\n=\r\nROTK was/is not only beloved in China but also Korea, Japan and even\nentere=\r\nd Southeast Asia a couple hundred years ago (in the form of\nstage plays/ope=\r\nras/puppet shows).\n\nI&#39;m posting about RED CLIFF\nhere is the trailer http://=\r\nca.youtube.com/watch?v=3DRbx9oPfFNFs (Takeshi\nKaneshiro as Zhuge Liang and =\r\nAndy Lau as Zhou Yu)\nbecause it&#39;s the easiest and least time consuming way =\r\nfor Shinsengumi\nfans to be acquainted with what Kondou Isami loved, ROTK, a=\r\nnd\nespecially the character of Guan Yu, known for his loyalty.  We&#39;ve\nmenti=\r\noned in the past that Kondou&#39;s love of Guan Yu is interesting\nbecause of th=\r\ne way Guan Yu is captured and eventually executed\n(classic case of a great =\r\nhero&#39;s fall) and it&#39;s almost foreshadowing\nKondou&#39;s own fate. In the traile=\r\nr you can see Guan Yu at 0:48.\n\nWhat I like about the trailer is that it do=\r\nesn&#39;t seem fancy and artsy\nlike HERO or THE BANQUET or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGG=\r\nERS.  ROTK is none of\nthose things and the story would not have any staying=\r\n power of the\ncenturies if it was &quot;boring&quot;.  I hope RED CLIFF will do its p=\r\nart to\nintroduce one of the greatest works of historical fiction to the wes=\r\nt.\n\nAside from the eery parallels between Guan Yu and Kondou Isami....ROTK\n=\r\nis THE TEMPLATE or prophetic narrative of how empires and governments,\nmode=\r\nrn and ancient,  fall.  Think about it...Three Kingdoms and the\ndivision of=\r\n China into major factions and the parallel between the end\nof the Tokugawa=\r\n shogunate.  The Three Kingdoms of China also had\nshifting alliances to neu=\r\ntralize the third party and all negotiations\nfluctuated over time.  It&#39;s ju=\r\nst like the major feuds of Japan vying\nfor power in Kyoto.\n\n\n"
