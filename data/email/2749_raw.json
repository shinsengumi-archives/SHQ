I watched the\nmovie &quot;Shinobi: Heart Under Blade&quot;, which is supposedly a live-action\nversion of the anime/manga &quot;Basilisk&quot;.  I&#39;m not familiar with\n&quot;Basilisk&quot;, so I can&#39;t comment on how well the movie follows its source\nmaterial, but I can heartily recommend the movie on its own.\n\n\n[Possible spoilers follow]\n\n\nThe movie is something of a take on Romeo and Juliet, if the Montagues\nand Capulets were ninja clans.  Tokugawa Ieyasu sets the Iga and Hoga\nclans at each other, leaving two young lovers, each the grandchild of\ntheir respective village&#39;s leader, stuck in the middle.\n\nProduction values were very high, with beautiful scenery and a haunting\nsoundtrack.  The fight scenes were very good; each of the main ninja\ncharacters had their own specialty, including the best live-action\nversion of Kenshin&#39;s fighting style that one is likely to see.\nUnfortunately, it was a bit rushed; the story revolves around a series\nof duels between ten ninja, five to a side.  Two hours is just too short\nof a time to develop much empathy for that many characters.  Instead,\nyou only get to know the two lovers fairly well, and only two of the\nother ninja really get to explain themselves.  They were all potentially\ninteresting characters, and I would have preferred a longer format to\nget to know them better.\n\nI&#39;ve read a number of complaints about the ending in online forums.\nBeing both a fan of Asian cinema and a student of Japanese history, the\nending was not terribly surprising to me, and I believe it fit the story\nwell.  I can, however, see how someone who either doesn&#39;t know the\nhistory of the time period or is more used to Hollywood movie endings\nmight not like this (my mother was the same way when she saw &quot;Crouching\nTiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;... she loved the movie up until the end, but\ncouldn&#39;t understand why it had such a sad ending). \n\nIn short, it&#39;s not the kind of movie that&#39;s going to change the world,\nbut it was a worthwhile use of two hours.  It had an interesting story,\ndecent acting, good fight scenes, and more ninja than you can shake a\nstick at... what more can you ask for?\n\n\tkuruma deshita\n\n\n\n\n"
