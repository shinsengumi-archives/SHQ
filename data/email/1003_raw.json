The police stationed at \nKumamoto were pretty shocked to find a document on the body of one \nof Saigo&#39;s guys indicating that none other than Saigo was waiting \nbeyond the castle walls.  In this case the police trapped in the \ncastle were seriously outnumbered...I&#39;m not going to spoil the \nstory :)\n\nMiss B, remember how we were scratching our heads over the \nword &quot;tail&quot; that babelfish keeps spitting out?  Well it seems that \nin many maneuvers during the Seinan War, specifically involving \npolice battalions their goal was take attack Saigo&#39;s forces from the \nback, furthermore, the article I was reading deals alot \nwith &quot;pronged&quot; or &quot;pincer&quot; movements the government used to deal \nwith the guerrilla forces used by Saigo after siege of Kumamoto \nCastle (considered by another researcher to be a turning point of \nthe war because it raised the morale of gov. troops).  After the \nsiege of Kumamoto castle, fierce fighting continued (because other \ngroups of samurai began to join with Saigo) and in a way the gov. \nhad to deal with a smashed bee hive so to speak.\n\n3-hajime mentioned that it was hard/impossible to determine which \nbattalion Fujita G. was assigned to and I know why...once police \ntroops were deployed they were re-organized and split up a couple of \ntimes as tactics in the war changed.  All I know was that Kawaji was \nin charge of an independent brigade #3 and this was considered to be \na &quot;final&quot; reorganization as of March 1877.  None of the writers \nunderstand how to present the info visually like a pyramid structure \nor something because it seems that there are brigades/battalions and \nthen a whole bunch of other police battalions running around too \nwhich I assume are part of a larger brigade.  I know there is \nprobably a military book out there that explains this stuff but I am \nreading info from 3 authors and they mention both \nbrigades/battalions/units without drawing any distinction or even \ngiving a basic defintion :(\n\nMiss B, did you find in 3-hajime anywhere of a &quot;bonus&quot; or prize \naward given to Fujita G, besides the Medal &quot;Order of the Blue \nPaulownia&quot;?  One of the ideas adopted from the French/&quot;Paris&quot; police \nsystem was the idea of monetary awards to policemen.\n\nRemember how we discussed how much 100 yen really was back then?  \nFujita G received the &quot;Order of the Blue Paulownia&quot; + 100 yen.  \nDuring the Seinan War, the gov. troops were in Saigo friendly \ndomains and when they inadvertantly destroyed civilian homes, \ncommanders had to compensate the civilians ofcourse.  In one record \nit mentions a gov. official awarding 5 to 10 yen to people who lost \ntheir home during the fighting...so 100 yen was -alot- of money.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; secretary wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Today&#39;s &quot;Menu During a Seige&quot; as we wait for other police troops \nto \n&gt; &gt;show up... millet gruel\n&gt; &gt;vegetable gruel which looks like bird droppings\n&gt; &gt;horsemeat (lets hope one of our steeds get shot today)\n&gt; &gt;soup made from crushed horse bone\n&gt; &gt;yummy\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; No wonder Saitou looks so blah and worn out in that group photo! \nThe \n&gt; poor man hadn&#39;t had a decent meal let alone a bowl of soba in far \ntoo long!\n\n\n"
