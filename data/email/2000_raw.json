So, if you watch Kunoichi: Lady \nNinja,\n&gt; and feel you can explain that part to me, I would appreciate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Angrybee\n\nActually I understood that part, sadly, it&#39;s so gross I will not post \nmy explanation...just watch -where- the hero places his sword after \nthe deflowering (it&#39;s a split second)...the result of which allows \nhis sword to cut through anything... even though the Phoenix magic \nreleased is what saves them as it sets fire to the jug of oil which \nwas thrown at them.\n\nOther kunoichi magic requires the heroine to assume highly suggestive \nposes.\n\nThe BAD GUY is the lord of Aizu who also happens to be the sex fiend.\nI believe that Aizu&#39;s Board of Tourism gave the greenlight to this \nfilm...the entire 2nd half of the film was filmed on location very \noften against the base of the castle, or along one of the beautiful \nston pathways and contains good shots of the castle...in one cliff \nhanger (literally) you get to see a shot of one of many entrances to \nthe domain...it looks smaller than the one which was the site of the \nBonari Pass in one of the major battles during Boshin (we see this \npic alot on Shinsengumi related sites)\nhere is a nice screencap\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/AIZUaerial.jpg\nthe movie even advertises &quot;Edo has its pleasures so does Aizu&quot; cuts \nto a studio recreation of the hot springs complete with a bunch of \nnaked women...in fact the film uses every excuse possible to exploit \nwomen.\n\nThe pattern is, any movie with &quot;kunoichi&quot; in the title is AWEFUL.\n\n\n\n\n"
