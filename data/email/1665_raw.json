There were the traditional greetings\n&gt; after the arrival of the Shinsengumi parade, some\n&gt; words by Fujita Taro (the great-grandson of Fujita\n&gt; Goro), the memorial service and a demonstration\n&gt; (hounou enbu, actually) of Mugai-ryu iaijutsu. And I\n&gt; could get to meet Tama-san in person, which was really\n&gt; great ^.^\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who are interested, I have uploaded some\n&gt; pictures I took at the memorial service. They are in\n&gt; the Photos section of yahoogroups. Again, the images\n&gt; are very heavy...\n&gt; \n&gt; And I couldn&#39;t go to the Shinsengumi summit either.\n&gt; Pity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n\n\nI LOVE THE PICTURES!!!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH! \nIt gives us here who cannot get there a way to at least see for a \nmoment what it was like! And their descendants... Well they were like \nwhat I imagined them to be!!!!! Yehey! *runs and makes a rain dance*\n\n~wounds\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; _______________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Declare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\n&gt; http://vote.yahoo.com\n\n\n"
