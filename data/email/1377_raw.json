But in Brazil, manga is a new kind of\nmedia and it is something very specific, so it is\nquite surprising and outstanding that it has sold that\nwell.\n\n\n\n&gt; Although RK is a fiction, history of Japan is\n&gt; involved. \n&gt; And a color of Japan is a strong work. \n&gt; I think that it will be really serious to translate\n&gt; it as the people \n&gt; of a foreign country can understand it. \n&gt; However, I read that translators have translated the\n&gt; world of RK \n&gt; very in conscience.\n\n\nWell, in the Brazilian case, there was a lot of\nfootnotes, so that people would be able to at least\nhave an idea of the wordings, characters and concepts\ninvolved.\n\nAs for the setting of the manga, there are many people\nwho have a keen interest in Japanese culture (just as\na curiosity, many people started practicing kendo\nafter reading RuroKen. Kinda like what Captain Tsubasa\ndid to Japanese soccer, methinks ^^), especially manga\nand anime. Some older people (20s and higher) do like\ntokusatsu too, ranging from Ultraman/Ultraseven to\nChangeman (including Magma Taishi!). There was\nrecently a local anime con with the presence of four\nJAM Project members, Kageyama Hironobu, Okui Masami,\nEndo Masaaki and Sakamoto Eizo, and their show was a\nhuge success (I am still a bit dizzy thanks to the\nshow ^^;;;). The artists themselves were quite\nimpressed, as their diaries show:\n\nhttp://www.makusonia.com/cgi-bin/diary/diary.cgi\n(Okui Masami&#39;s diary)\n\nhttp://www.mmjp.or.jp/birthday/kage/d/d_new.html\n(Kageyama Hironobu&#39;s diary)\n\nSo, I guess the interest in the Japanese culture was\none of the reasons why RuroKen was such a success\nhere. Obviously, there was also the artwork, the plot\nand the characters ^^\n \n\n&gt; Is the page of the talk of Watsuki sensei also\n&gt; translated? \n\n\nYes, all the character profiles and the free talks\nwere translated. I guess the same happened in other\ntranslations, like in French and in American English.\n\n\n&gt; Translation is more difficult for that page than\n&gt; story. \n\n\nFor those who are not acquainted to Japanese history\nand Shinsengumi, it surely is. But the translator\nhandled the job ^^ Plenty of footnotes on the\nShinsengumi.\n\nAnd in the first few volumes, there was even some\nextra material explaining things like Japanese\nhistory, basic Japanese swordsmanship (kendo) jargon\nand all, including a short essay on the &quot;Miburo&quot;\nmanga, starring Serizawa Kamo (no, not me, of course\n^^;;;) who was the model for Jin-eh.\n\n\n&gt; I think that people who are not interested in\n&gt; Japanese history and \n&gt; Shinsengumi do not understand the talk of the model\n&gt; of the character \n&gt; at all. \n\n\nPerhaps, but on the other hand, I guess many people\nalso developed an interest in Japanese history and in\nShinsengumi thanks to those talks.\n\n\n \n&gt; I have heard rumor that there is a fan of very deep\n&gt; Shinsengumi, \n&gt; about France. \n&gt; (Since I cannot read French, I cannot confirm it.) \n\n\nPerhaps it&#39;s Tama-san ^.^ (just kidding!). But I&#39;m\nsure there are many Shinsengumi enthusiasts in France.\nThere are some hardcore Shinsengumi fans here as well.\nJust as a curiosity, the winning &quot;cosplay&quot; of one\nanime con in 2001 was about the Shinsengumi killing\nBattousai ^^;;; I really got surprised when I saw one\nperson fighting with a spear and another one coughing\nup blood during the masquerade ^^;;;;\n\n\n&gt; For me, RK is only one of the eccentric Shonen\n&gt; Manga. \n&gt; However, it is very wonderful because this Manga is\n&gt; introducing \n&gt; Shinsengumi to many countries. \n\n\nI agree ^^ That&#39;s very good, especially because the\nonly other &quot;source&quot; of information on the Shinsengumi\nhere was... the &quot;Gohatto&quot; movie... ^^;;;\n\n \n&gt; She had said that &quot;Ikkyusan&quot; was popular. \n\n\nYamabushi: &quot;onushi wa doko ni mairareru&quot;\n(&quot;Where are you going to?&quot;)\n\nIkkyusan: &quot;kaze ni makasete mairu&quot;\n(&quot;I go where the wind blows&quot;)\n\nYamabushi: &quot;kaze no nai toki wa&quot;\n(&quot;And if there is no wind?&quot;)\n\nIkkyusan (playing his shakuhachi): &quot;jibun de fuite\nmairu&quot; ^^\n(&quot;I will blow the wind that will take me&quot;)\n\nI remember I took years to understand what it meant\n^^;;;\n\n\n\n&gt; By the way, has the talk of &quot;Azumi&quot; movie already\n&gt; come out here? \n&gt; With this work, Odagiri Joe is playing the crazy\n&gt; swordsman. \n&gt; Since there was much action using a wire, to those\n&gt; who like a \n&gt; legitimate sword-play film, it was disreputable, but\n&gt; it was \n&gt; comparatively interesting. \n\n\nAnd they will produce the sequel ^^;;; Obviously, as\nit is based on a manga, I didn&#39;t expect a jidaigeki or\nanyting similar ^^;;; Odagiri Joe reminded me of a\ncharacter that appears in the first volumes of Burai,\nthough. And they could have replaced Aya Ueto for a\ncute doll and it would have acted better than her\n^^;;; Let us hope that her acting skills will improve\nfor the sequel...\n\nHave you watched &quot;Jigoku no Koshien&quot;? Odagiri Joe\nappears in that work too, as Yakyu Jubee, if I&#39;m not\nmistaken ^^\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
