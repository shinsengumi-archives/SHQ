If you see the last few episodes (this coming Sunday will be #40) You can really see the change in Kondou. He looks so much harder and older than he did in the beginning. The job has clearly taken its toll. Maybe that&#39;s why the historic Kondou looks much older than  his years?\n\nHijikata -Keppuroku Hijikata is by far the coolest though I like Mibugishiden Hijikata. I think Maybe NHK Hijikata wins out though. He comes across as pretty believable most of the time. \n\nOkita --This is a four way ties between Mibugishiden, NHK and Keppuroku and Gohatto OKita. \n\nSaitou--Again with the tie! RK was the and the best for a long time but then Koichi Sato won me over in Mibugishiden (his sneer is to died for!)closely followed by NHK Jo Odagiri.  \n\nHarada --PMK & NHK tie again.\n\nTodou --Yet again with the PMK NHK tie though I think NHK Heisuke has the edge because he&#39;s really so sweet with his feeling that he&#39;s in OKita&#39;s shadow in everything.\n\nNagakura--Though he had but 37 seconds in screen time Mibugishiden Shinpachi is #1 all the way. They really needed to let his character do more because he really stood out in his brief appearances. \n\nYamanami ---PMK edges out NHK in this case. \n\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n"
