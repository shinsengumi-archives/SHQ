The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu 1862-1868\nUSA:  The University Press of Hawaii, 1980. Isbn 082480614\nand found the maps to be very useful...I can&#39;t remember if we \nalready had maps uploaded somewhere...but in any case I have scanned \n(pdf)a map of Edo (you can see where Ueno Hill is located), Kanto \nPlain (Present day Tsukuba Univ where we have a record of S.H. \nteaching kenjutsu is pretty far from Edo/Tokyo) and Toba-Fushimi \n(note presence of swamps)\n\nI inserted the citation in the pdf document...\nhttp://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3\nfilename TotmanMaps\npassword makoto\nfile size 4.34 MB!!!!!I don&#39;t know why I thought I scanned it \ngrayscale bitmap (shrugs)\n\n[Sonno Joi]\nI realized after skimming a few books that authors will each have \ntheir own way of attempting to identify the political stance(s) of \ncertain groups. People back then may have been asking each \nother...&quot;hey what do you believe in?&quot;\nA. Joi via force\nB. Joi via negotiations\nC. Sonno just outwardly to keep up &quot;appearances&quot; forget Joi we are \nmaking $$$\nD. Pro/Sincere-Sonno but anti Joi\nE. Anti-Sonno (which existed but not &quot;officially&quot; ofcourse) but Pro-\nJoi\nF. Anti Pro Sonno Joi altogether ^_^\nG. Radical Sonno Joi (which some writers don&#39;t define clearly)\nH. You are too confused to care but you ~do~ like that new catchy \ntune &quot;Ee ja na kai Ee ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka&quot;\n\n[Sekihoutai]\nI have been searching jstor.org with the keywords Phil sent me and \nnot surprisingly...nothing has shown up...in fact none of the \ndetailed indexes of history books even mention them...HOWEVER this \nmay be simply due to how things are indexed...so I&#39;m skimming all \ntexts\n\nFor example...I&#39;ve been looking for words like &quot;Police&quot; &quot;Tokyo \nMetropolitan Police&quot; &quot;Kawaji&quot; and a whole bunch of what seems to \nbe &quot;logical&quot; words in indexes when I should be looking \nfor &quot;keihoryo&quot; which some authors translate loosely as the law \nenforcement system...I found shreds of info on the TMPD&#39;s adoption \nof the kyu ranking system for kendo/kenjutsu too ^_^ during Fujita \nG&#39;s time in the dept.\n\n[Stuff]\nI don&#39;t understand the request on starting a forum on the \nmessageboard with introductions...do you mean introducing us \nmembers?  Please explain just tell me what to do exactly.\n\n\n\n\n"
