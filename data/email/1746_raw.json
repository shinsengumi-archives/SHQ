I know there&#39;s supposed to be a lot of anime and such that relates to them.\n\nOh, and I don&#39;t agree with the reviewer... I thought the show started out all right, got rather boring at times in the middle (then again, that may be because I don&#39;t care for the Maro/fake Okita storyline at all, I think it had potential but they did very little useful with it) and really picked up from #18 onwards. \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
