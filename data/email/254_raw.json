It&#39;s bringing up Real Player on my desktop \nwhen I click on images, trying to connect, and the site owner says \nsomething about being worried about the links actually showing the \nfilm... am I reading that right?  My computer isn&#39;t always reliable \nwhen it comes to loading various media and I&#39;m too sick right now to \nfool with it, but I thought I&#39;d mention something...\n\nphil\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; 2000 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400817/\n&gt; is an animated movie...I think &quot;stop-motion&quot; with paper\n&gt; dolls?...Kodachiko Kureru&#39;s site has some pics of this unique\n&gt; film...it&#39;s based on a manga by Hiroshi Kurogane.  I ordered this \nbook\n&gt; and it hasn&#39;t arrived yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kodachiko&#39;s site (there is a pic of paper doll Saitou too by the \nway)\n&gt; http://www.angelfire.com/anime2/shinsengumi/kuroganemovie.html\n&gt; \n&gt; The thing that is driving me insane is \n&gt; 1) KON ICHIKAWA directed it!!! My fav films from him are THE KEY and\n&gt; BURMESE HARP...Kon Ichikawa has a background in animation so this \nfilm\n&gt; must&#39;ve been fabulous\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Kiichi Nakai does the voice of Hijikata Toshizo!\n&gt; For those of you who haven&#39;t seen MIBUGISHIDEN...Kiichi Nakai is the\n&gt; actor who portrays Yoshimura Kanichiro (I spelled the name wrong). \n&gt; Maybe this actor is a closet Shinsengumi fan:)\n&gt; \n&gt; Why oh why is this film not available for purchase!!!!\n\n\n"
