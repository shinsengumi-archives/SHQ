I guess being perpetually hungry is the lot of ronin LOL!  \n&gt;When I get more of the series...I am going to have to see this in \n&gt;slow motion ^_^...in the case of Saitou it should be like fighting \n&gt;over the last bottle of sake\n\nIn fact, when Miss.Hide says &quot;These riceballs are made by me&quot;, first persons \nwho stand up and charge at her are Saito and Shimada.\nI couldn&#39;t notice it at the first view, and couldn&#39;t believe after reading \nthe blog of a friend which mentions about it, because it wasn&#39;t Saito&#39;s a \nttitude for me, I watched the tape again...And I saw Saito doing it.(laugh)\nEven Nagakura go straight toward Hide&#39;s riceballs and no one seems to be \ninterested in Mrs.Yagi&#39;s.\n\nTama\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
