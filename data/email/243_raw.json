I have read probably one hundred\nstories...I chose some of the more popular ones and I&#39;ll add more when\ntime permits...I have to search Saito, Saitou, Saitoh, Fujita\nGoro/Gorou, Shinsengumi etc yep there are too many and plenty of guest\nappearances of S.H. in Aoshi stories too.  I think the database can\nencompass Meiji Era as well because many &quot;flashback&quot; to the days of\nthe revolution.\n\nyeah, just in case there are some tech. difficulties atleast people\nwill see the root address.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;spiritus_saitou&quot; &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Way cool, Tiffany!  Wonder if there&#39;s a way to get it to create links \n&gt; for the location ID so all one would have to do is click on it and \n&gt; PRESTO (assuming ff.net isn&#39;t down at the time).  Probably not \n&gt; just &#39;cause that would be too efficient.  :-)  I assume you were \n&gt; hoping it would create links when you created the table?  (Looks like \n&gt; it since you have the full URL for them.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Just out of curiosity, what criteria did you use for including a \n&gt; story in the database?  There must be hundreds (over a thousand?) \n&gt; that involve Saitou.  Is it only when the story involves the \n&gt; revolutionary time period or other members of the Shinsengumi?  \n&gt; (uh... I think what I&#39;m trying to get at is &quot;Saitou other than just a \n&gt; Meiji cop&quot;?)\n&gt; \n&gt; You should post a message over on SHQSD for newcomers to bump into if \n&gt; they read past messages so they&#39;ll know it&#39;s there.  I think so far \n&gt; most people on SHQSD are on this list, too (which I&#39;m really glad \n&gt; of), but there are always exceptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for starting it up!\n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; -- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I started a database at \n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n&gt; &gt; everyone can add records\n\n\n"
