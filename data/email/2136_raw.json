The film=\r\n is restricted by time restraints \nwhile the novel itself is EXTREMELY long=\r\n and filled with lots and \nlots of action!!!!, martial lore, the origin of =\r\nswords and lineages \nof various school=81c.and a whole lot **more** Shinsen=\r\ngumi narrative.\n\n*the entire novel has not been translated into English=81c=\r\nfortunately \nall the parts dealing with the NEW CHOSEN GROUP (the name used=\r\n by the \ntranslator) are in English (^_^) for us to read.\n\n*the book calls =\r\nronin/roshi =81grover=81h or =81gdetached=81h samurai=81cso the \ntranslatio=\r\nn is kind of literal at times which is pretty good\n*the novel is historical=\r\nly accurate in describing the political \nsituation, the role of Matsudaira =\r\nKatamori and the difficult \nsituation Aizu was in \nHOWEVER what I don=81ft =\r\nunderstand is why the author felt that the war \nof 1868 was peaceful, I als=\r\no read in another book how Boshin was \npretty =81gpeaceful=81h as well=81c.=\r\nscary=81cI guess it was pretty peaceful \nminus Ueno Hill (Edo), Aizu, Hakod=\r\nate and all the little skirmishes \nhere and there which killed a couple tho=\r\nusand\n*Tsukue Ryunosuke was a REAL person, so was Shichibei the thief (seen=\r\n \nin the movie) there are folk stories surrounding this thief too=81c.\n*the=\r\n novelist has an odd style=81cwhen describing all the chambers of \nShimabar=\r\na in detail he=81fll add his opinion that the buildings should \nbe preserve=\r\nd for future generations which means he must have toured \nthese locations\n\n=\r\nMissB the reference to Kondo and Hijikata=81fs personality are all from \nth=\r\nis book=81c.Hijikata NEVER forgets or forgives=81c=81c.\n\nM as you pointed o=\r\nut before Shimabara was the location of Shiro \nAmakusa=81fs revolt 1637=81c=\r\n.according to this novel in 1641 the pleasure \nquarters in Kyoto were moved=\r\n and people were so excited they \nnicknamed the place Shimabara, because th=\r\ne rebellion was still fresh \non their minds=81c  page 264 =81gOne is struck=\r\n with the strangeness of \nfate that the memory of the Christian Persecution=\r\n is born by the name \nof a license quarters!=81h\n\nExamples (which will make=\r\n perfect sense if you watch the film SWORD \nOF DOOM)\n\nTsukue Ryunosuke firs=\r\nt joins the New Chosen Group because he was from \nthe same region as Hijika=\r\nta and Kondo (and you=81fll see Kondo and \nHijikata at the Mt. MItake duel)=\r\n\nMatsu (omatsu) the heroine in the movie is adopted by Miyukidayu \n(Miyuki =\r\nTayu) Kondo=81fs woman=81c.Matsu was the little girl whose \ngrandfather was=\r\n killed by Tsuke right at the beginning of the movie \nat the mountain top\n\n=\r\nUtsuki Bunnojo, older brother of Hyoma, knew Hijikata Toshizo\n\nUtsuki Hyoma=\r\n the hero whose older brother was killed by Tsukue \nRyunosuke (the main cha=\r\nracter) during a duel at Mt. Mitake, joins the \nNEW CHOSEN GROUP, spends ti=\r\nme meditating in Mibudera and even gets \ndragged to Shimabara in the entire=\r\n chapter devoted to =81gMibu & \nShimabara=81h=81cand even receives a warnin=\r\ng from Kondo\n\nThere is an odd character names Yamazaki Yuzuru of Mito, who =\r\ntried to \nrecruit Ryunosuke early in the novel,  his favorite weapon was th=\r\ne \nKatori Ryu quarter-staff=81c.what totally caught my attention was that \n=\r\nhe kept changing outfits=81c.just like Yamazaki Susumu=81cthen finally the =\r\n\nwriter finally says  Yamazaki Yuzuru arrives at headquarters to \nlisten ab=\r\nout how a thief, the kleptomaniac Shichibei, stole money \nfrom the New Chos=\r\nen Group=81fs accounting office=81c. (page 286) =81gYamazaki \nwas very skil=\r\nled at spying, going about in disguise, upon =81erover=81f \nand =81edetache=\r\nd=81f samurai of different clans.  But Yamazaki Susumu was \nsupposed to be =\r\nfrom Osaka from what I understand NOT Mito.  This may \nbe an example of his=\r\ntorical inaccuracies in this book.\n\nAs in the movie you will meet Serizawa =\r\nKamo, Kondo Isami, Hijikata \nToshizo (the author pointed out that Toshi was=\r\n =81eshort=81f and agile)\n=81c.but the book mentions Okita as well but he i=\r\nsn=81ft the =81ggirly=81h man \nwe are used to seeing anime or manga=81c.(pa=\r\nge 286) =81gSoji Okita of the \nNew Chosen had been boasting of his strength=\r\n for some time, and he \nnow went to that extent that he wanted a wrestler t=\r\no get down to the \ngarden for a bout. Okita =81gHey, let=81fs see who is th=\r\ne better man,=81h he \nsaid and he stamped his feet bringing his seat well d=\r\nown as the \nwrestlers do before a bout.=81h\nSo imagine PMK challenging a su=\r\nmo wrestler (^_^)\n\nThere are so many passages dealing with the Shinsengumi =\r\nI can=81ft \npossibly type them all up!!!!  THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES in t=\r\nhe \nmovie and the book especially the assassination of Serizawa Kamo \n(whic=\r\nh was not shown in the film).\n\nNow before I rant about how totally AWESOME =\r\nthis novel is, how the \nauthor should have been an action film director and=\r\n why this would be \nthe all time greatest manga ever=81c.I=81fll just start=\r\n my mini \nphotocopying project and make all 300 pages available to people w=\r\nho \nemail me=81c.\nSecretarytocapt3\n\nPage 320\n=81gThe colour of the eyes of =\r\nRyunosuke was something like a pearl sunk \nin the water.  When the water wa=\r\ns clear the eyes shone sharp.  When \nthe water was not clear, the eyes were=\r\n dull.  They were alike coldly \nand gloomily lustrous whether they shone sh=\r\narp or looked dim.  Now \nhis eyes lost that peculiar lustre.=81h\n\nEvery swo=\r\nrdsman in this novel has =81gshiny=81h eyes=81c.Kondo=81fs eyes shine \nall =\r\nthe time\nIT IS A REAL shame Ryunosuke and Saito did not meet because the \nc=\r\nharacter of NHK Saito is VERY similar to Ryunosuke=81c.they both speak \n=81=\r\ngcoolly=81h\n\n\n\n\n\n"
