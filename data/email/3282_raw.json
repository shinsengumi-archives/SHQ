What&#39;s clear to me from just the number of visit=\r\nors \nto SHQ is that we have people who want to read and learn about the \ngr=\r\noup from ALL OVER THE WORLD and it would neat to hear from some \nfriends we=\r\n&#39;ve never met before.  So your message can be in any \nlanguage (as long as =\r\nyou submit a translation, that way I can put up \na slide in English and we =\r\ncan read it).\n\nI think that anywhere from one sentence to a 5 minute commen=\r\nt is fair \nbecause the goal is to capture the variety of reasons people hav=\r\ne for \nhaving an interest in the Shinsengumi.\n\nSo I hope to get a couple of=\r\n responses (^_^)\n\nI know you all are out there...and we well eternally need=\r\n your help \nin making the site better and better.  So by contributing your =\r\nvoice \nyou are encouraging some of our researchers to keep up their work an=\r\nd \nkeep sharing it with the world.\n\nhistory.fiction.makoto\nShinsengumihq mo=\r\ntto\n\n\n"
