My first reaction was &quot;WAIT a minute!  That&#39;s wrong!  Saitou was never in charge of a police force!&quot;  Not even in RK.  :-D  \n \nLet&#39;s face it... 1868 seems to have been the year when BOTH sides were doing some weeding and the likes of Kondou and Sagara may have gotten plucked for what some people thought was for the good of the garden.  I agree with Sec that Matsudaira may have let them take Kondou... to alleviate some trouble and put himself in a better position to save others if he could... but not that there was any malicious intent on his part.  He was tough, but I&#39;ve never seen Matsudaira in that light.  As always, that&#39;s just my reaction to things.\n \nphil\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\nAll Aboard the the Train Bound for Conspiracy Central! by our chief\nBarbara...\n\nsecretarytocapt3 checking passenger tickets and asking questions\n\n1) what do you mean by &quot;new police troop/force&quot; (the new police system\nheaded by Kawaji)...I do not think so Fujita Goro&#39;s official rank was\ninspector and sometimes sites translated by will say assistant\ninspector...his rank was MUCH lower than let&#39;s say Miki\n\n2) Fujita Goro&#39;s rank in the military during the Seinan War was\ncaptain (also translated at times as semi-captain)...it was after his\nreturn from Seinan that he got &quot;probationary&quot; duties as inspector it\nseems...although I am surprised that he commanded 107 guys in this war\nand captured 2 cannons from the enemy...captain is not a very high rank\n\n*both 1to5.net and 3-hajime.com (which uses the same books as sources)\nsay he was affiliated with the police much earlier in terms of secret\nrecruitment and who knows what kind of assignments he got...in any\ncase the nature of his work does not seem to be public leadership at all\n\n*I do find it interesting that he may not have met with Nagakura in\nperson but we may have to leave the door open that they wrote\nletters...who knows later generations...&quot;geez look at these stacks of\nold papers, I&#39;ll go leave them by the curb&quot;...so just because they did\nnot meet in person (besides the fact that Nagakura lived far away) did\nnot mean they were on bad terms\n\n*However I do believe that Matsudaira may have &quot;let&quot; Kondou die...but\nchances are Ryoma Sakamoto&#39;s murder (long believed to have been the\nwork of the Shinsengumi) and all the other &quot;crimes&quot; committed by the\nShinsengumi towards the revolutionaries had already sealed Kondou&#39;s\nfate and I do NOT believe that the deposed Matsudaira could have saved\nKondou even if he wanted to\n\nsecretarytocapt3\nfor the first time ever actually trying to SLOW DOWN the conspiracy\nlocamotive :P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
