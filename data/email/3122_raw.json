The Wikipedia article \nsays that he went home to the Inoue family and relayed the news of his \nuncle&#39;s death. Tamura, two/three years older than him, stayed in Shinsengumi \nand saw further action.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
