Also, I added an English translated excerpt\nfrom Daibosatsu Toge. The English isn&#39;t very good and\nsome translated terms could have probably used better\nwords, but it is the only thing in English from that\nstory. This particular part is the attempt on Hachiro\nKiyokawa&#39;s life...of course...if you have seen &quot;Sword\nof Doom&quot; you know what happens. I was trying to\nconserve space here so you may want to zoom in\nsomewhere between 75% to 100% depending on how much\nyour eyes can take. If someone wants me to I can try\nto do the excerpt over again later.\n\n I counted the bodies at the end of Sword of Doom\nyears ago and it is somewhere in the late 40&#39;s range I\nthink. Believe it or not there is a movie called\n&quot;Orochi&quot; with Raizo Ichikawa that rivals this endings\nbodycount too and probably more. The Lone Wolf and Cub\nmovies had high bodycounts near the end of most of\nthem.\n\n The thing about Sword of Doom is if it had continued\nin the sequels you would have seen him get up the next\nday after he passed out, join the Tenchugumi, some bad\nstuff happens to him in that, and he continues to\nsuffer. His son plays an important role to any hope in\nhis &quot;salvation&quot; as the story goes along. The story was\noriginally written as a Buddhist parable about\nsuffering.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nKevin\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun.
