AGAIN!  :-D\n \nThe picture that everyone always sees as Saitou in police uniform (the charcoal drawing, NOT the woodcut) and has been debateable (debatable?) because the only connection of it to Saitou/Fujita was his name penciled in at the side...that infamous picture is actually his son, Tsutomu?  And it&#39;s in the memorial hall in Aizu because they couldn&#39;t find a picture of Saitou?  (And I suppose now that I go and change it, something new will come up, ne?)\n \nLove the fundoshi story...  I wonder if he kept his equipment as clean (thinking of sec&#39;s comments about keeping kendo equipment clean).  Still, it certainly reminds me now of the old anecdotes about mother telling you to be sure you have on clean underwear in case something should happen...  Another one of those universal human traits?  (Actually, I can understand it on an evolutionary psychology basis, but I don&#39;t think you want me to get into that here...)\n \nphil (nicotine-deprived)\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\nMomoiro-usagi:\n\nhttp://www.logovista.co.jp/english/index.html\nhttp://www.logovista.co.jp/english/koryaip5.html\n\nThe language which corresponds to &quot;headband&quot; in the site was not found.\nFrom the word of &quot;wash&quot; or &quot;iron&quot;, I judge that it is this episode.\n\nSaitou Hajime changed &quot;shitaobi&quot;(It is the same as fundoshi.=Classic\nJapanese underpants) every day.\nIt was washed always pure white.\nHe struck it by hand and eliminated wrinkles. And it dried with a\nsolar light.\nIt was beautiful as it ironned.\n\nThis talk is the episode which shows that Saitou was very clean.\nSamurai does not leave shame, after he dies. For them, the greatest\nshame has an unsightly body.\nSaitou is a really splendid samurai. \n\nSaitou is popular also in Japan.\nI like him to the 2nd in the member of Shinsengumi.\nBy the way, did you see the &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; movie?\nThe actor who was playing Saitou on that movie is playing Serizawa\nKamo in this drama.\nSimilarly, the actor who was playing Okita on that movie is performing\nYamanami in this drama.\nIt is very interesting if the 4th story is seen in consideration of it.\n\nIncidentally, the picture of Saitou of the top of the site is not him.\nThe picture makes Saitou&#39;s son (Fujita Tsutomu)&#39;s photograph the model.\nThe picture is in Aizu&#39;s Byakkotai memorial hall.\nThe memorial hall wanted to decorate with Saitou&#39;s photograph there.\nHowever, the photograph was not able to be got.\n(It was not in the Fujita family which is Saitou&#39;s posterity, either. )\nThen, Saitou&#39;s son&#39;s photograph was offered.\n\n****(secretarytocapt3)  momoiro-usagi is referring the pic seen\n&quot;everywhere&quot; on the internet...this is NOT the group photo.  I read on\nother Japanese sites that the photo/charcoal drawing was based on his\nGRANDson...but momoiro-usagi knows his/her stuff\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
