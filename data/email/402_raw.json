Everyone went on a boat trip,\nSaitou got sick they went to stay at an inn and called a doctor for\nhim and later the group got into a &quot;scuffle&quot; with sumo wrestlers. \nHowever, I skimmed Burai, and the situation outlined was not the one I\njust mentioned...the author used it as an excuse to have Okita spoil\nhim (not in -that- way you sickos)...at least I didn&#39;t catch anything\ncontroversial:)  \n\nSource:http://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html\nyou can search for Saitou by just using the EDIT button and type in\n&quot;Saitou&quot; to find references to him on the pages\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hmmm... Makes me think twice if they make such a big deal of his \n&gt; stomach ache... \n\n\n"
