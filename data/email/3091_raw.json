The first concerns the labeling \non Kitsuno&#39;s map. The rooms have labels such as &quot;6巾占&quot; (hopefully the \nmessage encoding allows the kanji to display; if not, I&#39;m referring to \nthe labels with a number followed by a three-stroke and a five-stroke \nkanji). I&#39;m familiar with the convention of expressing room sizes by the \nnumber of tatami, but I learned that as 6-jou (6 畳) and could not find \nthe map&#39;s notation in my dictionaries. Does the notation on the map mean \nthe same thing? If so, what is the distinction between the two?\n\nThe two maps are clearly derived from the same original source. Is this \nknown to be a historically accurate map of the Ikedaya, or drawn from \ntypical inns of the period (or perhaps the set of one of the Shinsengumi \nfilms)?\n\nWhat would the exterior grounds look like (other than the rear garden)? \nNarrow alleys between the\nadjacent buildings or a larger lot, potentially with a fence or wall \naround the whole property?\n\nFinally, in the interest of giving due credit, what are the sources for \nthese two maps?\n\nThanks,\nChuck\n\nKitsuno wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In case anyone is interested, here is the Ikedaya floorplan from the\n&gt; &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; Gakken series #31 that I have:\n&gt; http://img405.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ikedaya1ez3.jpg \n&gt; &lt;http://img405.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ikedaya1ez3.jpg&gt;\n&gt; Click on it to get the giant size view.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; \n&gt; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Seven&quot; \n&gt; &lt;nlf7@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here you go.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=14&m=f&o=0 \n&gt; &lt;http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=14&m=f&o=0&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=13&m=f&o=0 \n&gt; &lt;http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=13&m=f&o=0&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~Seven\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n\n"
