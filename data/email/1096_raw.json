Were these ever done on \npurpose?  I posted a link to a site which contains short videos to \ntours of Shinsengumi related sites and in one segment the guide was \npointing out a damaged door/window (removed from the main structure) \nbut he seemed kind of enthusiastic not at all serious so it made me \nwonder if guys just slashed at stuff for fun(?). The book from which \nI scanned the full body chainmail also contains MORE sword scars \nthan those seen on websites...did our guys get a little too rowdy at \ntimes?\n\nFor people who haven&#39;t seen my sig at http://www.shinsengumimb.com\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/sig10.jpg\n\n\n"
