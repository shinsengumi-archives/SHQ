I did recently check out the diaries of Katsura \nKogoro which cover 1868 until the time of his death and was planning \nto compile notes on various historical personages as well as what \nthoughts he had about various things.\n\nNo mention of Shinsengumi or Ryoshingumi as far as I could tell from \nthe indexes. \n\nWhat sort of interest (if any) do the folks here have with respect to \nthis material? What persons or events do you think would be of \ninterest to this list or the mirror site?   Just wanted to ask before \nI started taking notes.   (Already extracted references and personal \nthoughts w.r.t  to Takasugi Shinsaku...)\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n"
