Prior to\nreading this book I did read a ***fanfic*** translated\nvia nifty which portrays Fujita Goro as helping the\ndaughter of Kondou.   According to Hillsborough a\npoliceman formerly affiliated with the Shinsengumi\nattempted to save Kondou&#39;s daughter from life in the\nred-light district. \n\n***\nOk... I&#39;m fairly new and am well aware that theres a\nTON of info I don&#39;t know about the Shinsengumi, and\nthis was just another thing that I&#39;ve never ran\naccross while going through various webpages.   I\nthink I read a long time ago that Kondou was married\nsometime before he left to Kyoto (as Roshigumi) and a\ndaughter was born shortly after he left, and\nappearently he never meet his daughter even when he\nreturned to Edo to recruit more men.   But know that I\nread this, I wonder if what I read was even correct.\n\nAnyways, I was wondering you by chance you still have\nthe link to that fanfic (sounds intresting).   And\nalso, may I ask for the members on this mailing list\nto help me find another fanfic that I can&#39;t find\nanymore.   The fic is a RK one, saddly I don&#39;t\nremember the name of the piece or the author.   The\nfew chapters that I read started pretty much a few\ndays before the Ikedaya, it dealed mostly of what the\nShinsengumi were doing.   One chapter in particular\ncentered completely around Hijikata discoving a few\ntradors amoung the ranks (4 men I think) and ordering\ntheir deaths (when each man was by himself).   After\nbeing confronted by Hijikata himself, one of the men\nis willing to commit seppuku and asks for Hijikata to\nbe his kaishaku.   After the man split his belly open,\nHijikata picks up the short sword used by the man and\nwalks away, warning everyone that if they help the\nman, they will suffer the same faith.   He really was\ndepicted as a deamon in this part of the fic ...and\nthats pretty much all I remember about the fic.\n\n-Bunneh\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
