Because it is a very short \nperiod form  January to September and because I do not know what \nGOYOOGAKARI means in  relation to sergeant...this part is confusing \nsergeant in the army or police?\n\nI don&#39;t think he was fired.  Maybe, I should have used the word \n&quot;discarged&quot;? First, I looked up dictionary, and Goroo means to \narrest criminals or the position to arrest criminals.  So, the job \nhas something to do &quot;sergeant,&quot; and to be a sergeant from \nGoyoogakari seems to be promotion.  Since Saitoo \nHajime was appointed to be a sergeant just 2 months after his \ndischarge from Goyoogakari, it seems that he quit Goyoogakari for \nthe promotion to be a sergeant. \n&gt;\n[QUESTION]About the adoption of the third son is something my \nfriends are interested in because adoption was so common and the son \nwas related Tokio...why should it be a secret?  It is strange.  \nThere is no reason to keep adoption secret in Japanese culture?\n&gt;\nIn Japanese culture, it is very common to make adoption secret.  One \nof the reason is we think the blood boundary is extremely \nimportant.  The idea was much stronger in old times.\nMaybe, there is an idea that if the child knows he is not real child \nof his parents, the family cannot keep their solidarity.  Also, we \nhave respected the blood or genealogy.  Still now, adoption is not \ncommon like the U.S. and some people want to make it secret in Japan.\nIt is interesting, I&#39;ve never thought about it...\n\n[QUESTION] Also Tokio was like a dorm inspector at the school.  So \nthe school had a dormitory for students but in the translation it is \nmentioned that students can stay at her home too or just to visit \nher home?  \n\nIt means that Tokio let some students live at her house.  I don&#39;t \nknow the system of dorm at that time, but I think not everybody had \nto live in dorm.\n\n[secretarytocapt3 thinks]  Poor inspector Fujita, after a long hard \nday at work catching criminal scum, writing reports he had to come \nhome to a house full of....girls LOL!\n\n\n"
