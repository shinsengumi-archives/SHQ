However the person \nbehind these articles was kind enough to include an English \ntranslation, so there&#39;s no need to bring out the evil goldfish. \n\nThis first article is about the place we discussed last Sunday during \nthe chat session. Serizawa Kamo very kindly translated a name the \ntranslator had mutilated beyond all recognition, so I know this place \nis connected to Hijikata. \nhttp://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=83\n\nThe next two sites I&#39;ve known about for a while actually. The first \nis about the war and Goryokaku. The next one is about the monument \nbuilt to Hijikata and the other Tokugawa forces killed in battle.\nhttp://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=155\nhttp://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=140\n\nThe next article is about my new hero, Yanagawa Kumakichi! This has \ncleared up a bit of a mystery for me!\nhttp://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=139\n\nSo this is the temple that the www.tamahito.com site keeps going on \nabout! While the EXACT location of Hijikata&#39;s grave remains unknown, \nit seems that it is probably somewhere on the side of Mt. Hakodate. \nBut I thought that the bodies were cremated? I guess they mean he \nburied the ashes? Or is the translator just messing with my head?! \nWell, maybe the mystery isn&#39;t COMPLETELY cleared up...-_-\n\nNow if I could just figure out what this &quot;Wood Eagle&quot; thing is. It \nseems to be the place that Enomoto (and of course Hijikata) first \nlanded in Hokkaido. They keep showing pictures of some beach.\n\nBut I&#39;m off the point now. The point is all you Ishin-haters out \nthere will really find your blood boiling and know why I have such \ntremendous respect for this man!\n\nAnd if that isn&#39;t enough to condemn the new government&#39;s actions in \nHokkaido, then check this article out. This appears to be dealing \nwith some of the Aizu people who joined Hijikata in Hokkaido.\nhttp://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=97\n\nSo are you angry yet?\n\n-MissBehavin \n\n&quot;We are the Shinsengumi! We have business!&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;Still thinks this \nshould be our motto.\n\n\n"
