Aren&#39;t tattoos in Japan the mark of yakuza organised \ncriminals? Unfortunately Hollywood, Western and Japanese writers and \nthe media have portrayed Japanese tattoos in a very negative light; \nnote how many so-called reference books and tattoo experts talk \nabout &#39;yakuza tattoos.&#39; Just because many yakuza are tattooed does \nnot mean those who are tattooed are yakuza - in most countries of the \nworld tattoos are common among the criminal element of society. In \nAmerica many crack whores and paedophiles have tattoos, however, \npeople do not call them &#39;crack whore tattoos&#39; or &#39;paedophile \ntattoos.&#39; I believe the same applies to horimono. A visit to any \ntattoo artist&#39;s studio in Japan should instantly dispel this \nmisconception.&quot;\n\nGreat Reading....\nhttp://www.artelino.com/articles/japanese_tattoo_art.asp\nnote that laborers and firemen also liked to get tattoos...its a \nbonding thing\n\nhttp://www.artelino.com/articles/edo_firemen.asp\ndetails about honorable bandits, outcasts and firemen\n\nLastly an example of a tattoo from the film...TATTOOED LIFE (great \nfinal fight scene!...the film is surprisingly NOT about gratuitous \nviolence/sex)\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/TattooedLife.jpg\nthe heroine in the film asks her man to strip because she found it \nodd that even other men have not seen his body...the phrase &quot;bare \nyour shoulder&quot; is used in other places of the film as well...clearly \ngetting a tattoo is a bad idea if want to live on the right side of \nthe law usually (^_^)\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem may be with the word coinage of &quot;yakuza&quot; I&#39;m sure \n&gt; researchers can estimate when the word came into usage but common \n&gt; sense points to the fact that every culture has organized crime \n&gt; going way way back (^_^) and their influence continues today.\n&gt; \n&gt; if you visit\n&gt; http://www.streamload.com/green_2\n&gt; click on Shinsengumi\n&gt; then go to the folder &quot;Shinsengumi, Articles, Screencaps, TMPD, \n&gt; Seinan/Satsuma, Music Vids, Scanlations&quot;\n&gt; then the subfolder &quot;ARTICLES&quot;\n&gt; download the PDF file &quot;ironfantattoospdf.pdf&quot;\n&gt; you can read an article about tattoos and yakuza\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n&gt; AIM=badgerturtle\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Animemystique &lt;saitohworship@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On a not so related note, does anyone happen to know how long the \n&gt; yakuza dates back to?
