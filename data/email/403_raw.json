Kondou\n& Hijikata come upon her and apparently make comments about her being\npretty puny to wield a sword. They mention the Tennen Rishin style and\nI&#39;m guessing they said &quot;We&#39;ll teach it to you and make a man out of\nyou!&quot; The poor girl runs crying to her mother the minute the guys walk\naway. It was hilarious to see the girl&#39;s look of terror as they&#39;re\nlifting her arms,squeezing her muscles, adjusting the sword she&#39;s\ncarrying in her belt.\n\n\n"
