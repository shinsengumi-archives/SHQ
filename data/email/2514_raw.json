It had a stable.When Fujita had days off, he would go \nto the Yamakawa residence and drink sake, and his spirit would burn\nMany many people visited all year round, attested to by Ookura \n(Yamakawa Hiroshi) being a person of virtue as well as a &quot;Center of \n(gathering for) Aizu People. So the many comings and goings were a \nmatter of course.\nAmong those who visited can be seen the name of Fujita Goro.\nFujita Goro. Of course, it goes without saying that this is \nShinsengumi 3rd captain, Saitou Hajime.\nThe time of his frequent visits then must be around the time that \nOokura had long since retired from the Police Office and had become \nheadmaster of the &quot;Normal School&quot; (I think &quot;Normal School,&quot; Shihan-\ngakko, should actually be translated &quot;Military Academy&quot;)\nThe man who, as Yamaguchi Jiro, left his fame and renown in many \nplaces in the course of the Boshin War&#39;s Aizu front.\nFujita, after Hijikata Toshizo left Aizu, commanded the remaining \nShinsengumi men, sharing in Aizu&#39;s fate, following the people to \nTonami, and then fighting in the Seinan War, always remaining by the \nside of Aizu people.Looking at it from Fujita&#39;s perspective, his \nvisits to the Yamakawa residence must have been very calming.\n\nFujita Goro &quot;When you draw your sword with the intent to kill, don&#39;t \nwaste your time posturing like in kenjutsu. Just kill your enemy on \nthe spot.&quot;\n\n(from another volunteer translator: &quot;When you actually fight \nsomebody with a real sword, never mind about taking a correct \nposture as you would in your fencing trainings; you just have to go \nforward holding your sword up high. Then the next moment you&#39;d find \nyour oppenent collapsed on the ground.&quot;)\n\nFujita Goro &quot;I want my bones to be buried next to the [mass?] grave \nof the men who died at Amida-ji in the Aizu Boshin War&quot;\n\nToday, Fujita Goro&#39;s soul, as was his wish, rests alongside those of \nhis war comrades in Amida-ji, sharing in their eternal rest\n\n[Footnotes]\n***Yamakawa Hiroshi was one of the matchmakers for Goro+Tokio, and a \nmajor figure in the post 1868 Aizu story\nsee his pic here \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/YamakawaHiroshioldyoungpic.jpg\n\n***the Normal School was a teacher training academy in Tokyo for men\nthe history of the Normal School is totally connected to Tokyo \nWomen&#39;s Normal School (Takagi/Fujita Tokio&#39;s workplace and her \ncousin Takamine Hideo)\nyou can learn more here:  \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm (with an account of \na graduation ceremony, fire and pics etc)\nEdward Sylvester Morse (1838-1925)(google name) mentions and \nsketched the fire\nhttps://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/Takamine/TWNSfire.jpg\nin his amazing book JAPAN DAY BY DAY (contains info on Takamine \nHideo all over the place)--book has no index\n-----------------------------------\nIn the past I have mentioned that Fujita Goro was a friend of \nNatsume Soseki (just google this name) my volunteer translator did \nsome double checking independently and found that this eccentric \nnovelist had not one but 2 connections to the Shinsengumi. I have \nrecently searched for webpages and found quiet a few repeating this \nconnection---nifty mistranslated some things.  Below is a *human* \ntranslation.\n\nNagakura Shinpachi was a friend of Natsume Soseki&#39;s [father]\n[warning] Natsume Soseki was adopted out to a family and then later \nadopted back into his natural birth parents...it is not clear \n*which* father\n\nNatsume Soseki and Fujita Goro were co-workers (they worked in the \nsame office)\n\n[note: Soseki wasn&#39;t alive during the Bakumatsu however he did write \n2 weird short stories on that era. \nAnyone who reads Soseki&#39;s works will notice that he has an older \nfriend, who like himself was neurotic and had gastric ulcers this \nfriend is an elderly man with a white moustache (who eats relish a \nfood recommended to people who have ulcers).  This older friend is a \nrecurring character in more than one work. Soseki ofcourse changes \nthe names of his real friends who frequently appear in his fiction--\nin this case the mystery character is anonymous and often stops by \nfor dinner.  Both men starve themselves for days and then share big \nmeals.  In another work this same character appears in a dream \nsequence.  Interestingly in I AM A CAT Soseki writes long passages \nabout dastardly under cover police, how they are uneducated, rude \nand plant evidence on people.  He lists their possible disguises as \nwell! Soseki, understandably was paranoid as he was blacklisted for \nhis liberal leanings and anti-Russo-Japanese War stance.]\n-----------------------------------\nShinsengumi Fun/Accessories\nhttp://www.jbox.com/SEARCH/shinsengumi/1/\n\nhttp://www.hlj.com/product/AZNSB004GIR\n\nhttp://www.hlj.com/product/AZNSB004MAN\n-----------------------------------\n[Off-Topic but of possible interest]\n\nsomeone brought up the 47 Ronin a while back...\n\nThe MANY paintings and reproductions you see of the 47 Ronin (many \nversions of the famous scenes) were amassed in a huge collection by \na guy named Ernest F.Fenollossa (1853-1908) (google name)---most of \nhis stuff ended up in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts or were \ngradually sold to private collectors once he returned to the United \nStates.  Although he later severed his connection to the museum his \nlegacy still remains.  While in Japan, his \nassistant/translator/travelling companion was Takamine Hideo (the \ncousin of Takagi Tokio and friend to Goro).  Takamine himself \ncollected 3,000 ukiyo-e, calligraphy, ALOT of pottery and swords \n(which Goro worked with in Takamine&#39;s store room).  Fenollossa also \ncites Takamine Hideo in his writings.  Recently I went to my \nuniversity&#39;s historical society and read a pamphlet printed in 1905 \nwhen part of Fenollossa&#39;s collection arrived in my city (the small \ncollection was purchased by a Japanese man).  Fenollossa himself \nwrote the introduction and description of the paintings.  Of the \nlittle over 20 pieces displayed, 5 were of the 47 Ronin.  Much of \nFenollossa&#39;s collection are now commonly mass reproduced ukiyo-e \nposters you can purchase right off the internet. \n\n[scroll down to see new translations on the Byakkotai]\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/YHFGtranslation.htm\n\n\n\n\n"
