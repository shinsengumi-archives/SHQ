It&#39;s something I read in a book a while back, but I don&#39;t remember what role the second has in it. \n\nI know for men, they tucked away their kimono under their knees in in such a fashion along with placing the wooden pedestal behind and under them to prevent themselves from falling backwards. I forget if this also prevents them from falling forward as well, or makes them only fall forward. \n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, May 21, 2004 8:10 AM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Topic from Wounds~Beheading Decapitation\n\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Okita Souji&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; I&#39;ve heard that in some instances, the second would be someone close\n  to the one who is actually commiting seppuku. (like a friend or\n  something) Because the second shows them &quot;an act of kindness&quot; in\n  ending their suffering after cutting open their stomach. Have you read\n  or heard anything similar? \n\n  [secretarytocapt3]\n  yes, I read the same thing before in several books...if a friend is a\n  second then he will do a &quot;good&quot; job and understand not to hesitate or\n  waver at the critical moment a secondary idea is that the person\n  committing suicide will not attach any ill feelings to the\n  second...basically everyone knows their role.\n\n  &quot;Okita Souji&quot;\n  &gt; For women, i&#39;ve read that seppuku is a bit different and involves\n  severing the arteries in the neck. \n\n  [secretarytocapt3]\n  in terms of killing women...I never read about the artery thing...all\n  I read was that if a man was going to execute a woman there was some\n  attention paid as to how she &quot;falls&quot;.  If she is kneeling...the\n  executioner will cut her in a way that she falls either forward on her\n  face or backward (I can&#39;t recall which is the right/wrong way).\n\n  but we all gotta remember that the etiquette for stuff like this can\n  change dramatically over the years...but I&#39;ve never found like an\n  essay written on the topic...these details are mentioned here and\n  there in history books.\n\n\n\n  visit \n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n  our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n        Yahoo!
