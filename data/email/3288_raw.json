I=\r\n\nfound it pretty fascinating; she covers history and culture equally well.\n=\r\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Dear Kitsuno,\n&gt; I am a bit familiar with Anna C. Hartshorne, her contrib=\r\nution to\n&gt; Tsuda&#39;s institution and the role Hartshorne played in preserving=\r\n the\n&gt; Tsuda&#39;s famous Attic Letters. ACH, is a major figure in Christian\n&gt; =\r\neducation in that era, I was always curious to read her works because\n&gt; I&#39;d=\r\n like to see if she mentions Takamine Hideo who played a key role\n&gt; in esta=\r\nblishing Jyoshi Eigakujyuku&#39;s Scholarship committee for Tsuda\n&gt; Ume (and se=\r\nnt her packing to Oswego NY).  Sometimes Takamine comes off\n&gt; as shady and =\r\na bit cunning (perfectly understandable given the\n&gt; politics).  If you come=\r\n across something on T-sensei or TWNS send me\n&gt; an email---I have some piec=\r\nes of the puzzle still.  The Min. of\n&gt; Education was really functioning lik=\r\ne a gigantic gang most of the time\n&gt; and detractors set up their own &quot;gangs=\r\n&quot; if you will and one posse was\n&gt; the pro-women&#39;s education group (which of=\r\ncourse ACH was part of).\n&gt; \n&gt; So you were so lucky to work on ACH&#39;s book!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; It&#39;s my understanding that this book was already pubished (however I\n&gt; =\r\ncannot acquire it through my library) as noted here\n&gt; http://www.ilab.org/d=\r\nb/book804_HB8225.html\n&gt; \n&gt; so this a republication of her 1902 book correct=\r\n? But refined by you.\n&gt; Does she discuss women&#39;s educ. much?  You know scho=\r\nlars like LIncicome\n&gt; would want it (if it does cover education).\n&gt; \n&gt; Alot=\r\n of people here on SHQ ML may like LIan Hearn&#39;s fiction and it&#39;s\n&gt; very awe=\r\nsome she wrote the intro to your book.  She&#39;s like the JK\n&gt; ROWLING of Japa=\r\nn/fantasy.  Please tell us of all your future projects\n&gt; so if some of us h=\r\nave the money we can snap up the books.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hear Lian Hearn is planning =\r\npossibly a BAKUMATSU BOOK----likely set\n&gt; in KYOTO?  Will the Shinsengumi m=\r\nake a cameo appearance?  YOU MUST\n&gt; TELL US...we&#39;ll keep it our little secr=\r\net (^_^)...don&#39;t hold out on\n&gt; us...we fans don&#39;t have a whole lot to wait =\r\nfor.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
