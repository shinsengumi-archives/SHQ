I have tried to &quot;reach out&quot; to our sisters (why is\n&gt; it that a majority of Shinsengumi fans are women?) in Japan.  I \nposted\n&gt; shinsengumimb.com info on the 3-hajime.com board in English and\n&gt; Japanese (via babelfish)...it doesn&#39;t hurt to give them some \nlaughs...\n&gt; here are their responses...\n&gt; \n&gt; (goldfish spitting out bubbles)\n&gt; The foreigner it is? So, if we assume that is, famous of new \nselection\n&gt; group it exceeds the border, the better seed. You think that it is\n&gt; truly enormous thing. You are glad very Contribution day: 4/14 (Wed)\n&gt; \n&gt; (Owner of the site &quot;Hajime&quot;) Way it study enthusiastically Maggie &gt;\n&gt; new selection group, concerning Saito one, the shank. Also Maggie,\n&gt; seems that it manage the new selection group-related sight, but,\n&gt; contents do not understand excessively well in unskillful me of\n&gt; English, it is regrettable. Your period &gt; Maggie, the foreign \ncountry\n&gt; it seems like. Don&#39;t you think? far widely know the name of new\n&gt; selection group, it is to have crossed even in foreign area. Don&#39;t \nyou\n&gt; think? he et. al. who had the will of the valuable imperial \n&gt; barbarian, probably is certainly to have been surprised greatly. \nBut,\n&gt; the fact that it can encounter the companion who exceeds the border,\n&gt; holds the common thinking is truly delightful thing.\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; I think...they are happy to meet us...she didn&#39;t call me a\n&gt; barbarian...I think she meant that it is funny that the Japanese in\n&gt; the 19th century would consider me to be a barbarian (hey I&#39;m Asian\n&gt; wait I wonder if they think of southeast asians as barbarians too) \nand\n&gt; it is ironic that we barbarians take interest in the new selection\n&gt; group.  I read an online newsarticle (posted waaaaay back) about how\n&gt; Hijikata Toshizo read essays translated from English to Japanese and\n&gt; one such essay mentioned the need for protein in one&#39;s diet (since\n&gt; most Japanese had mostly vegetarian diets) and he encouraged his men\n&gt; to consume more meat so he wasn&#39;t THAT close minded (note that\n&gt; portrait of him).  I wonder what he would think if he knew us \nforeign\n&gt; devils are his fans LOL.  He would be like o_0\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOk, so I tried to reply to this once before and my computer booted me \noff. I hope this doesn&#39;t end up posted twice...\n\nWhat I was attempting to say was that I would love to see Hijikata&#39;s \nreaction to being glomped by a horde of us foreign devils and that it \nwould be a Kodack moment for sure. I also wonder what he would think \nof those of us -whistles innocently- who are slightly obsessed with \nhis fundoshi...\n\nOn another note, I was wondering if there was another way to reach \nJapanese Shinsengumi fans. I noted that on http://japanese.about.com/ \nthey have a section for finding penpals. Is there anyway someone \n(preferably who understands more of the language than me!) might \ncould use that to try and reach out to them?\n\n-MissBehavin (Who must learn Japanese in order to perform her duties \nas Hijikata-sama&#39;s Chamber Maid more effectively. He does not like it \nwhen he finds his goldfish gatotsued...)\n\n\n"
