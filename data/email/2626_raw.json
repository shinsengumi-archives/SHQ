I\nhaven&#39;t had the pleasure of meeting Sono Sensei yet,\nbut our group is heading out there early next year.  \nI&#39;m also trying to church up on my Japanese so I can\nspeak with Yoshida Sensei on my own.  From what I&#39;ve\nbeen told the man knows volumes about the Shinsengumi\nand regardless, seeing Tennen Rishin Ryu in person\nwould be pretty exciting (even for a humble Shinkage\nRyu fencer like me :-D).\n\n--- Hirotada Tokugawa &lt;patriot014@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Oops!! Sorry....I read the article about the current\n&gt; Tennen Rishin Ryu head \n&gt; some years ago, right around the time I first\n&gt; encountered Yamato Yagyu-kai, \n&gt; so I obviously mixed the two up.
