I&#39;m confident =\r\nto say \nthat it would not be possible.  \n\nOkita was born in the Shirakawa D=\r\nomain&#39;s Edo mansion and the other party might have \nconfused that with him =\r\nbeing born in Shirakawa.  While his place of death is an issue of \nbook &quot;A&quot;=\r\n saying something and book &quot;B&quot; saying something, his place of birth is NOT.=\r\n  I \ncould upload some book samples for you (for example, p12 -13 from &quot;Oki=\r\nta Soji Feature&quot; \nby Mori and p14-15 from &quot;Walking with Okita Soji&quot; by Oji)=\r\n, but could the other party do \nthe same??? \n\nMeanwhile, here&#39;s a list of h=\r\nelpful (Japanese) websites.\n( I&#39;ve always checked the references before inc=\r\nluding a website in my research and some \nwebsites here are also included i=\r\nn your links.)\n\nhttp://www.bakusin.com/okita.html\nhttp://www.toshizo.com/na=\r\nme/okita.html\nhttp://www1.odn.ne.jp/makoto/taisi/souji.htm\nhttp://www.geoci=\r\nties.jp/str_homepage/rekishi/bakumatsu/shinsengumi/taishi/souji.html\nhttp:/=\r\n/www.fan.hi-ho.ne.jp/gary/okita00.htm\n\nPlease feel free to use language too=\r\nls to translate the first few lines (if you haven&#39;t done so \nalready.) \n\nAl=\r\nso, as I&#39;ve mentioned, many believe that Okita was close to Hijikata based =\r\non Shiba&#39;s \nfiction and until I made the corrections, the Shinsengumi artci=\r\ncles at Wikipedia had Shiba \nRyoutarou&#39;s novels listed as non-fiction refer=\r\nences.  \n\nThere&#39;s no doubt that his books are historical novels. \n\n&quot;Moero K=\r\nen&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/410115208X/qid=3D1150316653/sr=\r\n=3D1-23/\nref=3Dsr_1_2_23/503-8662209-2817527\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/=\r\nobidos/ASIN/4101152098/qid=3D1150316653/sr=3D1-24/\nref=3Dsr_1_2_24/503-8662=\r\n209-2817527\n\n&quot;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/AS=\r\nIN/4041290074/qid=3D1150316653/sr=3D1-25/\nref=3Dsr_1_2_25/503-8662209-28175=\r\n27\n\n\n&gt;Are you confusing us with another site?\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.shinsengumihq.c=\r\nom/bibliography.htm\n&gt;contains historical texts and we have never listed Shi=\r\nmozawa Kan&#39;s\n&gt;work there\n\nNo, I was using Shimozawa Kan&#39;s work as an exampl=\r\ne. I apologize if I didn&#39;t make that \nclear enough.\n\n\n&gt;THUS, when you are d=\r\none revising and combining your wikipedia Okita\n&gt;information with what we h=\r\nave now..just email and I will get it\n&gt;uploaded ASAP\n\nI understand,  Thanks=\r\n.\n\n\n&gt;My point is this: I can give you hundreds of books on the Bakumatsu\n&gt;r=\r\night now and say &quot;those are my sources&quot; however you have to\n&gt;*specifY* sour=\r\nces. You cannot say &quot;I got my fact from one of those\n&gt;10 books&quot;. I&#39;m not ar=\r\nguing with you or anything but that is just\n&gt;how things work (not at the SH=\r\nQ) but now many websites are adopting\n&gt;basic standards to strengthen their =\r\nfandom...as I mentioned before\n&gt;if you are in school--you should be aware t=\r\nhat even basica 5\n&gt;paragraph essay requires you to do this\n\nYes, I&#39;m aware =\r\nof that and I do use basic standards in my writing. Please try to understan=\r\nd,  \nI didn&#39;t start &quot;writing&quot; about the Shinsengumi by writing, but by maki=\r\nng corrections or/and \nre-editing. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve nearly finished with =\r\nall the corrections at Wikipedia, so \nreferences will be included in my fut=\r\nure edits/writing. \n\n&gt;secretarytocapt3\n&gt;I don&#39;t know what you are referring=\r\n to...this is a public\n&gt;group...there are many Shinsengumi fandoms, some ba=\r\nsed on certain\n&gt;universes such as PMK, RK and so forth...we are very genera=\r\nl\n\nYes, I agree. \n\nI&#39;m not sure why others don&#39;t want to join this group; I=\r\n could only speak for myself. I \nwaited a while before I joined any group (=\r\nor started editing the articles at wikipedia) so I \ncould have more time to=\r\n read about the Shinsengumi.  I could only spare so much time on \nthe Shins=\r\nengumi, after all.\n\n&gt;Why would you think of giving up? Currently Wikipedia =\r\nis not\n&gt;acceptable in terms of citation. The reason is that the internet is=\r\n\n&gt;always in &quot;flux&quot;. The reason why books dominate academia is because\n&gt;the =\r\ntext is &quot;frozen&quot;. \n\nWhy? I&#39;d rather spend the time on reading the Shinsengu=\r\nmi manga I&#39;ve bought and more \nabout the history of the Shinsengumi...\n\nIn =\r\naddition, it gets rather tiring sometimes and I haven&#39;t had any time left t=\r\no edit articles \nunrelated to the Shinsengumi. :( :( :(\n\n&gt;---your correctio=\r\nns are at the top because they\n&gt;are the most recent. Your edits are backed =\r\nby books---but again\n&gt;your citation method is still too general.\n\nMy edits =\r\nare at the top because they are the most recent; they are the most recent b=\r\necause \nI wouldn&#39;t allowed mistakes to be edited in. :P :P :P \n\nYes, I do s=\r\nee your point. As I&#39;ve mentioned above, the citation method won&#39;t be so gen=\r\neral \nfrom now on.\n\n\n~Seven\n\n\n\n\n\n"
