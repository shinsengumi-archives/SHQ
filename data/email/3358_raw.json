Towards the end of the Tokugawa Era and especially during Bakumat=\r\nsu, there seemed to be a rise in what I like to call &quot;Beater Styles&quot; like J=\r\nigen Ryu and Tennen Rishin Ryu, as opposed to styles which relied a bit mor=\r\ne on finesse like Yagyu Shinkage Ryu (which I typically refer to as a &quot;Bait=\r\ning Style&quot;).  Alot of the styles used by the Shinsengumi and their opponent=\r\ns looked to my limited understanding as styles meant to return to the bare =\r\nbones of swordsmanship.  As my own teacher put it (his Aikido teacher in Os=\r\naka is a shihan of Tennen Rishin Ryu), Tennen Rishin Ryu was designed to be=\r\n quick to pick up so you could get people out fighting as soon as possible.=\r\n\nAs a modern analog for what I mean, I&#39;d point to Toyama Ryu and it&#39;s branc=\r\nh styles.  A few years ago my group did a joint seminar with some kenshi fr=\r\nom Nakamura Ryu, which is a more modern style drawn from the Toyama kendo t=\r\naught to Japanese soldiers during the war.  Drawdy Sensei explained that To=\r\nyama Ryu was kendo designed to pass along the solid ideas of sword kihon to=\r\n alot of people quickly.  When our group went up my teacher explained that =\r\nwhile Toyama was sword designed to be simple, Yagyu Shinkage Ryu existed du=\r\nring a time when men had nothing better to do than train in swordsmanship a=\r\nll day, so it could be said that Yagyu is kendo at it&#39;s most complicated.\nA=\r\nnywho, talking about the &quot;gravity&quot; of Hokushin Itto Ryu, in modern Kendo (I=\r\n generally use capitol &quot;K&quot; for the modern sport and lower case &quot;k&quot; when tal=\r\nking about Japanese fencing in general, be it gendai or koryu) sometimes wh=\r\nen someone makes a really powerful strike with the shinai it can leave deep=\r\n bruises in the shape of the bamboo strips, even if hit on the kote or men.=\r\n  Alot of Itto Ryu is centered around the idea of victory in one sure strik=\r\ne called Kiri-Otoshi.\n \nRemember, No Matter How Bad Life Gets, There Is Alw=\r\nays Beer.\n-Norm MacDonald\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Barbara Sher=\r\nidan &lt;bsher213@...&gt;\nTo: SHQ@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, March 9, 20=\r\n08 9:45:45 PM\nSubject: [SHQ] Kenjutsu people, I need you!\n\nOkita, Serizawa =\r\nI hope you guys are still out there in Shinsengumi- land somewhere and see =\r\nthis.
