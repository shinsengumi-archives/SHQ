The newspaper article clearly narrates that\n&gt; he was actually on the field with whatever battalion he was \n&gt; assigned to.\n\nI think that the movie exaggerated the injury. He certainly had something happen to him at Toba-Fushimi. Not only to both 1to5.net and www.3-hajime.com mention it, I just noticed that the new site with the info on all the Captains says he &quot;suffered a slight illness&quot;. I doubt it could have been anything too serious, because he took several days to go to this medical place about it and then he went straight back into action.\n\nThat tummy-wrapper thing is in one of my books actually. I suggested that before, but I thought we decided that couldn&#39;t be it? Hm, it could still be that tenugui thing. Perhaps we have it all wrong? Don&#39;t let those clean fundoshi fool you!  It&#39;s not Harada&#39;s equipment you want to avoid, you want to steer clear of Saito&#39;s! LOL! Seriously though, please ask momoiro what the devil they mean!\n\nI had to buy a translator that frankly works similar to Gist. That&#39;s the only way I can get some sites to come up, which is the only benefit. The Fish won&#39;t work for me most of the time and occasionally Gist won&#39;t either. I have to paste everything onto it, which can be a real pain. As far as doing zip files goes, I&#39;ve never tried to do that before and I have no idea where to start. You&#39;d have to give me a crash course, IF this computer will even co-operate. It can be a real PITA when it comes to zip files. I STILL haven&#39;t been able to retrieve that info about that Shogitai, either from here or your account. It tells me the format isn&#39;t recognized. \n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
