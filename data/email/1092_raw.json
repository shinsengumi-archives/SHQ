Thank you so much for that wonderful tale! It&#39;s so hilarious! Does that sort of remind anyone else of the famous scene in RK where Kenshin goes to rescue Yahiko and the Yakuza boss realizes he &quot;has the eyes&quot; of a REAL manslayer? I wonder if that&#39;s what those Yakuza creeps were thinking when Nagakura stared them down?\n\nI wonder how many of those Shinsengumi members thought directly after that &quot;You know, fighting those Ishin dogs was less of a headache than this!&quot; -grin-\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
