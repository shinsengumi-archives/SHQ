Just one\n&gt; last request if someone can actually get the exhibit book.  I&#39;d like a\n&gt; high res scan of the page whenever it could be had (since my\n&gt; interpretation of my translated search implies I can&#39;t get a copy of\n&gt; the book myself).  I&#39;d just like a really, really sharp version of it\n&gt; without the pixelation.  Maybe like 600 DPI or so.  If it can be done,\n&gt; awesome.  If not, thanks for taking the time to read this post.\n&gt; \n&gt; =M\n\n\n\n"
