Unfortunately, before I had time to \ngo through and read all that interesting stuff, it started \ndisappearing.  At first it was just some of the posts missing, then \nall of the posts and many of the forums disappeared.\n\nWhat&#39;s going on???  And is it going to get fixed?\n\n\nOn a marginally related note, I recently bought the first volume of \neach of several different Shinsengumi manga.  I was thinking of \nwriting up a little first-impression mini-review of each of them and \nposting it on the messageboard (if it were still there).  I guess I&#39;ll \npost to the Yahoo group instead (although I generally like message \nboards better than e-mail lists).  Is the SHQ group or the \nSHQ_Spy_Division group the better one to send reviews to?\n\n\nNiwashi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
