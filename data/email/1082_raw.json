Perhaps &quot;spunky&quot; isn&#39;t\nthe right word when it applies to sword/halberd/rifle wielding women\nboth at Aizu and Satsuma...in the file I placed on streamload for all\nto download...that pic of Satsuma women (the book is called Seinan\nSen-so) on a bridge with swords/halberds was TOTALLY like what\nhappened at Aizu.\n\nWow the myster wife Yaso...&quot;unpleasant&quot;? that&#39;s weird...maybe they did\nget a divorce?...that&#39;s sad I think its hard for women back then to\nre-marry (unless she keeps it a secret)...but remember back in that\nday divorces are almost always blamed on women (hisssss)...heck maybe\nS.H. wasn&#39;t very good at judging character\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;warg3791&quot; &lt;Warg3791@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lots of speculation about Saito&#39;s connections to Aizu. \nIt \nseems to be an opportunity that father became friendly with an Aizu \n&gt; feudal clan in the intermediate service times.&quot; \n\n&gt; Now this is interesting! &quot;According to the testimony of the people \n&gt; who knew him well, looks of Saito during the lifetime assumed that \n&gt; the eyebrows were ? which was ? and it seems to have been sharp ? of \n&gt; eyes and the tall man who did it. This is Saito of later years, and \n&gt; there is the story that was a fat (big of a body) man with a ruddy \n&gt; face in one&#39;s youth in fact.&quot; I suspect that &quot;fat&quot; is not really the \n&gt; correct word, but it&#39;s the one the stupid translator chose.\n&gt; \n&gt; There the indication that Saito did everything possible to keep the \n&gt; name &quot;Goro Fujita&quot; good. \n&gt; \n&gt; There is a mention of the mystery wife. It says &quot;In time tail and the \n&gt; Aomori times (when he was in the Shimokita peninsula area with the \n&gt; exiled Aizu clan) before marrying, I seem to have married a woman \n&gt; of &quot;unpleasant ?&quot;, which was 4 years old older.&quot; &quot;Unpleasant&quot; what \n&gt; though? Family? Character? Or is &quot;unpleasant&quot; the wrong word? Curious.\n&gt; \n&gt; And now for the real interesting part, though I can&#39;t understand AT \n&gt; ALL what the connection was! It says that &quot;At the time of Aizu war, I \n&gt; tried to do it Yaeko Yamamoto ? who enters a castle becomes the \n&gt; night, and to cut hair in a short sword by taking the field (Yaeko \n&gt; held a gun with a spunky woman and appeared in a battlefield with a \n&gt; man), but I am not readily sharp and tell that I &quot;had cut older \n&gt; sister time (a tail)?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok Yaeko Yamamoto I know something about! She&#39;s mentioned in the \n&gt; introduction of &quot;Remembering Aizu&quot;! She was the woman prisoner who \n&gt; was sent with the men to the camp in Inawashiro. The reason is that \n&gt; her brother was killed outside of Kyoto, so she began to dress in his \n&gt; clothing and demand that everyone call her by his name. She was \n&gt; supposed to have fought right along side of the men. \n&gt; \n&gt; But what on earth is it trying to say about her and Saito?!\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin\n\n\n"
