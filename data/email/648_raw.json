AND show the EXACT same guy in 2 scenes\n(this &quot;mystery&quot; guy is in 2 -separate- scenes right?)...they wouldn&#39;t\ngo through that much trouble for nothing remember it takes hundreds of\ncells to make an animated film and lots of work (even with the aid of\ncomputers)...it could be an inside joke for all we know.\n\nI know that sarcastic smirk anywhere.\n\nIt&#39;s Saitou with a wig...which kind of worries me and adds the\npossibility of Saitou with Kamatari tendencies. 0_0  What is more\nscary Saitou with a wig or SAitou coloring his hair...green for that\nmatter LOL\n\nIn the manga...check maigo-chan&#39;s translation Saitou specifically\ncriticizes Kenshin for getting himself injured AND CAUSE SOMEONE TO BE\nPERMANENTLY INJURED (the kid Yutaro)...take that Kenshin...I remember\nthis distinctly because this was an example of how a couple of words,\nIMPORTANT words were left out of the anime (hisssss).  I read this in\nthe Thai translation of the manga and was surprised Nobuhiro would\n&quot;turn on&quot; his hero.\n\nAnd I used this point to discuss with my sister how Saitou is\nprotective of kids (Eiji + Misao)...although Miss B reinterprets the\nMisao part :P\n\nI will probably duplicate this thread on Shinsengumimb.com\nso tired...just finished fanart...fingers covered with blue marker and\nI posted a long message explaining why SAitou didn&#39;t anticipate\nShishio&#39;s metal headband.\n\n\n"
