I&#39;m not sure, but I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m watching.  \nI&#39;m more than a bit confused at the moment --- there is *so* much \ngoing on in this film and so many crazy connections among \ncharacters.  Definitely hilarious in spots.  Anyone who likes samurai \nfilms and spaghetti westerns has gotta love this one!  :-D  It \nrepeats later tonight if anyone wants to try to catch it (on IFC).  \nAccording to Quentin Tarantino (who&#39;s hosting this mini-fest) it&#39;s \ndifficult to find and rarely shown.  (BTW, the time period for this \nstory is 1833, if anyone is interested.)\n\nphil\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Phil,\n&gt; Are you referring to the movie &quot;Kill!&quot; a parody of other famous\n&gt; samurai films?  The one in which Tatsuya Nakadai stars and makes fun\n&gt; of a bamboo sword (which is critical in the film\n&gt; Seppuku/Harakiri)...totally hilarious and I think it was directed by\n&gt; Kihachi Okamoto too...geez Sword of Doom! and then Kill! big \ncontrast.\n\n\n"
