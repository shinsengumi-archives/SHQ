I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself! \n\nAlan if you would read what she wrote, she only stated that it was -not \nimpossible-. She never said, -that&#39;s how it was-. In fact, she wrote that she \nherself found it unlikely. There&#39;s a difference between stating something as \nabsolute fact and asking for people to keep an open mind. \n\nWe throw out some very odd ideas around here from time to time. My advice \nwould be to learn some tolerance. No one is going to appreciate or accept being \nblasted for stating their opinion or making a suggestion about some point. I&#39;m \nnot sure what history groups you may have been a part of in the past that \nwould accept such things, but that&#39;s a huge no-no around here.\n\nYour opinions are just as unsupported, BTW. And MOST movies I&#39;ve seen where I \nknew a great deal about the history take the same liberties. Ever see Young \nGuns? They get very basic facts about Billy the Kid and his buddies wrong, but \nI still enjoyed the movie. The same is true of nearly every Jack the Ripper \nmovie I&#39;ve seen. \n\n I enjoy the Shinsengumi drama. I don&#39;t CARE if it&#39;s accurate or not. \nPeaceMaker Kurogane and Rurouni Kenshin have the same sorts of problems, as Firuze \npointed out. Yet they are mainly responsible for making people aware of the \nShinsengumi in the first place. So they DO serve a purpose in my own humble \nopinion.\n\nAgain, I want to stress to Momoiro-usagi how grateful I am that she took the \ntime to offer some insight to the behind-the-scenes stuff of the drama. It was \nmuch appreciated, as was all the other wonderful info you&#39;ve given us about \nthe Shinsengumi that we would not know otherwise. THANK YOU!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
