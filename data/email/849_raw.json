Saitou&#39;s Sekiguchi style.  So did Saitou fight the guy with a\nwooden sword and the guy was bare-handed?  But many guys back then had\nto study both, since childhood, ofcourse people had their preferences.\nThis is what makes the Shinsengumi so interesting...the guys came from\nall over the country and brought with them their skills...martial arts\nmayhem galore in the Shinsengumi dojo I&#39;m sure...I wonder if Romulus\nHillsborough worked with any experts to cover this issue.\nWell, if Hijikata could write poetry who knows what other hidden\ntalents he may have possessed.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\nThe next guy that came took Saitou on \n&gt; _Barehanded_ and won!!!!! Saitou was crushed and quickly went off to \n&gt; sulk alone. Apparently the boob knows the hand to hand combat guy which \n&gt; would explain his lack of sword skills if he&#39;s also a judo specialist.\n\n\n\n"
