Would be a pity if it \ndidn&#39;t. Though yuri seems to be very acceptable, &#39;specially in Little Tokyo \nhere in Los Angeles. @_@ There were shelves full of that stuff, anime and \nmanga alike.\n\n\nMiser Bellatrix\n\n&quot;Allow me to give you a hand...with your doom.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------\n\nyes, 3-hajime&#39;s counter is WAAAY off the charts:)\n\nthe girls on 3-hajime are obsessing over those collectible\nshinsengumi figures which can double as cake decorations\n\nI like their take on fundoshi...babelfish says &quot;scrupulous&quot; as a\ndescription for historical S.H....I don&#39;t understand what they are\nsaying regarding the towel wound around the neck though which is\nanother quirk associated with hist. S.H. too :(\n\nIn Thailand there are many bootleg translations however now many\nofficial copies have a special holographic sticker to show that it\nis licensed etc\n\nI wonder if manga continues to expand its territory in U.S. if it\nwill have the same problem as in Thailand...the government is/was\nvery concerned about yaoi/hentai and for a time manga was just\nlabelled as evil altogether because *very* young kids were reading\nhentai...one case an adolescent was charged with sexual/physical\nassault and police investigated his room to find it filled with\nhentai and so an association was made.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch LIVE baseball games on your computer with MLB.TV, included with MSN \nPremium! \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/mlb&pgmarket=en-us/go/onm00200439ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
