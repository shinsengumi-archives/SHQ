I \nkeep meaning to do that and get sidetracked.  (wow... what a \nsurprise!)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Well, because I forgot to check I missed the earlier showings, but \nthere&#39;s still one more showing this weekend of &quot;The 47 Ronin, Part 1&quot; \non IFC (Independent Film Channel).  It comes on at 3:00 a.m. in my \narea (Mountain/Pacific time), so look for it early in your area.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Following is the Samurai Saturday on IFC fare for next week to \nAugust 21:\n&gt;  \n&gt; July 31st -- The 47 Ronin, Part 2\n&gt; August 7th -- Kill!  (Kiru!)\n&gt; August 14th -- Sanjuro\n&gt; August 21st -- Samurai Spy\n&gt;  \n&gt; You can check out IFC&#39;s schedule at http://www.ifctv.com/ifc/index .\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though it&#39;s not Japanese, but may be of interest, on July 31st IFC \nis having a &quot;Chop-Socky Fest&quot; in the evening... 2 films and a new \ndocumentary examining the history of the Hong Kong martial arts film \ntradition.  The films will be &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; (Jet Li) and &quot;Project \nA&quot; (Jackie Chan).\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n\n\nAll that extra-curricular activities catching up with you Phil? ^_^\n\nToo bad I don&#39;t have IFC or cable otherwise I&#39;d be watching. I have \nseen fist of Legend though and I think that was one of the first \nmovies that turned me to a Jet Li fan a year ago... On another note \nif you are going to watch more Chinese films try out Fong-Sai-Yuk and \nFong-Sai-Yuk II... I believe his mother in that movie is the love \ninterest of Yun Fat.. I think her name was Michelle Yeo or was it \nZiyi Zhang? Sorry I get them mixed up, it&#39;s been a while... \n\n\n"
