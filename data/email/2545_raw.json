Which will most probably be based on the Peacemaker Kurogane \nmanga, the ones licensed by ADV.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The anime has 24 episodes. Imon Peacemaker manga has 6 volumes, and \nPeacemaker Kurogane manga, I think, has 5 or six volumes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hope that helps!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; ~Kane\n&gt; \n&gt; Logan &lt;wolverinesg7@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; how many seasons are there in the peace maker kurogane series and \n&gt; episodes. i have 1-6 and i&#39;m in love. i want to know how many more \nare \n&gt; there so i can get the rest for my collection.
