Watson. I recommend this short book for=\r\n people\nwho are interested in martial arts bios and getting a crash course =\r\nin\nhow &quot;fun&quot; education can be during the Meiji Era...\n\nI updated http://www=\r\n.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm with a few\nbrief paragraphs of info reg=\r\narding these details and a quote of Kano\nhiring good kendo teachers for Tok=\r\nyo Normal School (called Teacher\nTraining College in this book).  Many peop=\r\nle knew that Kano&#39;s student,\nSaigo Shiro was the son of Saigo Tanomo, senio=\r\nr retainer of Matsudaira\nKatamori.  How would Mr. and Mrs. Fujita miss this=\r\n? \n-------------------------------------\n\nIt took a really really long time=\r\n to get confirmation on a minor\ndetail regarding Tokio&#39;s friend.  Please se=\r\ne\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\nclick on &quot;Memories of To=\r\nkio&quot; \nand read near the end of the paragraph, \nI also added a pic of Tokio&#39;=\r\ns much older friend Takamine Kinoko.  \n\nMore information including on her c=\r\nan be found here\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm\n\nKinoko was=\r\n an interesting older woman (she was not shy at all)\nwho also recorded what=\r\n\nhappened to her and her family after the defeat of the Aizu domain.\nThus, =\r\nher narrative is one of the few written by a woman in that\nsituation (at th=\r\nis time I cannot find any record written by an Aizu\nwoman which has been pu=\r\nblished).  \n\nIncidentally I found it funny that this elderly lady Takamine =\r\nKinoko\ndragged her grand daughters to the Fujita household---because\naccord=\r\ning to the American scientist Edward Morse, she also was a\nbabysitter to a =\r\nherd of boys (maybe? the Fujita boys too?)\n\n-------------------------------=\r\n------\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\nclick on &quot;Normal Sc=\r\nhool This and That&quot;\n-------------------------------------\n\nI had to revise =\r\nthe timeline&#39;s format here\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm=\r\n \n[scroll down to 1919]\n\nI used the Watson book to get more solid info on t=\r\nhe ultimately severe\nprotesting by the faculty, and alumni of the Normal Sc=\r\nhool (where both\nFujita Goro and Tokio were employed).  The most open oppos=\r\nition shown\nby these educators occurred after Mr. Fujita died...however Tok=\r\nio was\nstill very much alive to observe these movements at the school.  \n\nY=\r\nou will note that I am not saying either Mr. or Mrs. Fujita was in\nany way =\r\ninvolved or if they agreed or disagreed with any of this. \n\nUnless both kep=\r\nt their eyes and ears closed at work they would be very\nmuch aware of these=\r\n incidents. The school was pretty small and run\nlike a &quot;family&quot; even if Mrs=\r\n. FUjita was retired it would be hard for\nnot to take an interest in these =\r\nsituations (covered by national\nnewspapers).  Tokio would have co-workers/f=\r\nriends and students still\nthere and she would feel a deep attachment to her=\r\n workplace.\n\nIn other English texts, no specific dates were recorded for\n**=\r\n*earlier*** &quot;threats&quot; by the faculty/staff of the Normal School\nwhich shoul=\r\nd have occurred at the very beginning of the 20th century\n[during Fujita Go=\r\nro years] and not just before the 1920s.  These were\nall well coordinated e=\r\nfforts where teachers would sign petitions draw\nup lists and so forth.\n\n&quot;Th=\r\nreats&quot; being mass walk outs to protest the Ministry of education&#39;s\nstubborn=\r\ness in increasing pay and so forth.  Walk outs and\nresignations were SIGNAT=\r\nURE tactics for these pesky teachers (^_^).\n\nKeep in mind that mass protest=\r\ns were discouraged by the Meiji gov.\nwhich had a distaste for such public d=\r\nisplays (which occurred shortly\nafter the Russo-Japanese war in 1905)...the=\r\nse teachers faced possible\narrest and imprisonment (a small handful of teac=\r\nhers were banished\nfrom Tokyo earlier in the era for political reasons). \n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n"
