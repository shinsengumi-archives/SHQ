Even after doing iai for a few years, tonight I found myself tripping over my hakama on 1 kata where we move from seiza to standing while advancing forward. I think I tripped over my hakama about 3 times in a row (repeated the kata 2 more times cause I tripped the 1st time). Luckly I caught myself before I commited otherwise my sword would have smacked into the floor ^^;. Normally hakama sabaki (arranging it so it&#39;s neat and out of the way) isn&#39;t too hard, but sweat for a while and it changes things a bit in repeatedly sitting and standing. Have you gotten accustomed to sitting down and standing up while wearing the hakama without tripping over yourself or stepping on it? \n\nAbout the indigo hakama for starters, thats insane o_o; some of those hakama are $200+ quite a bit of cash to sink in for a beginner, not to mention they bleed like crazy for the first few washes and wears....which reminds me. Does your gi bleed? I know most indigo gi (even the inexpensive ones) are dyed traditionally and bleed like crazy (I turned a bucket and my washing machine blue with the one I got as well as looked like a smurf after every practice).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 2004 8:01 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Some kendo stuff\n\n\n  Okita:\n  &gt; Btw, when you mean follow through do you mean cut big?
