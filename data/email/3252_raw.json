You may wonder well &quot;and this has\nsomething to do with=\r\n the Shinsengumi how???&quot;.\n\nThe answer is this:\nFujita Goro and Fujita Tokio=\r\n had devoted *years* of their life at the\nTokyo Women&#39;s Normal School (it h=\r\nad some name changes, won&#39;t list them\nhere) but the TWNS had *EXTENSIVE* in=\r\nteraction with Jyoshi Eigakujyuku\n(Tsuda Jyuku Univ)---students interacted =\r\nand observed classes, in fact\nstaff and faculty were friends and there were=\r\n even shared social\ngathers (parties!)...I am casting a wide net here and e=\r\nven in the\npublished (and censored) letters of Tsuda Ume, some details abou=\r\nt TWNS\ndid emerge (not to mention some serious dirt on MEIJI VIPS). Tsuda U=\r\nme\nis a confirmed gal pal of Yamakawa Futaba (WHO WAS A FRIEND OF TOKIO,\nac=\r\ntually Tokio&#39;s superior at the school).\n\nMy gameplan was, study TWNS and so=\r\noner or later Mr. and Mrs. Fujita\nWILL appear (the issue for me friends is =\r\nmoney...intuition tells me\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Fujita are sitting at the WOme=\r\nn&#39;s STudies Library in\nOchanomizu---which has one of the largest collection=\r\ns on the topic\nfrom that era...lots of stuff still there! I just can&#39;t get =\r\nto Tokyo\nnor can I hire someone who can read Japanese from that era....)\n\n-=\r\n-- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; wrote:\n&quot;I actually have a book coming =\r\nout within a\ncouple months - &quot;Japan and Her People&quot; by Anna Hartshorne, edi=\r\nted by\nmyself and my publisher friend, so that should give me some indicati=\r\non\nof the market for that type of book. Here is the link to that:\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.typeandculture.com/?page_id=3D36\n\nLian Hearn (Author of the Tales of the =\r\nOtori series) was kind enough\nto write the introduction to this edition.&quot;\n\n=\r\nDear Kitsuno,\nI am a bit familiar with Anna C. Hartshorne, her contribution=\r\n to\nTsuda&#39;s institution and the role Hartshorne played in preserving the\nTs=\r\nuda&#39;s famous Attic Letters. ACH, is a major figure in Christian\neducation i=\r\nn that era, I was always curious to read her works because\nI&#39;d like to see =\r\nif she mentions Takamine Hideo who played a key role\nin establishing Jyoshi=\r\n Eigakujyuku&#39;s Scholarship committee for Tsuda\nUme (and sent her packing to=\r\n Oswego NY).  Sometimes Takamine comes off\nas shady and a bit cunning (perf=\r\nectly understandable given the\npolitics).  If you come across something on =\r\nT-sensei or TWNS send me\nan email---I have some pieces of the puzzle still.=\r\n  The Min. of\nEducation was really functioning like a gigantic gang most of=\r\n the time\nand detractors set up their own &quot;gangs&quot; if you will and one posse=\r\n was\nthe pro-women&#39;s education group (which ofcourse ACH was part of).\n\nSo =\r\nyou were so lucky to work on ACH&#39;s book!\n\nIt&#39;s my understanding that this b=\r\nook was already pubished (however I\ncannot acquire it through my library) a=\r\ns noted here\nhttp://www.ilab.org/db/book804_HB8225.html\n\nso this a republic=\r\nation of her 1902 book correct? But refined by you.\nDoes she discuss women&#39;=\r\ns educ. much?  You know scholars like LIncicome\nwould want it (if it does c=\r\nover education).\n\nAlot of people here on SHQ ML may like LIan Hearn&#39;s ficti=\r\non and it&#39;s\nvery awesome she wrote the intro to your book.  She&#39;s like the =\r\nJK\nROWLING of Japan/fantasy.  Please tell us of all your future projects\nso=\r\n if some of us have the money we can snap up the books.\n\nI hear Lian Hearn =\r\nis planning possibly a BAKUMATSU BOOK----likely set\nin KYOTO?  Will the Shi=\r\nnsengumi make a cameo appearance?  YOU MUST\nTELL US...we&#39;ll keep it our lit=\r\ntle secret (^_^)...don&#39;t hold out on\nus...we fans don&#39;t have a whole lot to=\r\n wait for.\n\n\n"
