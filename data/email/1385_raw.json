It seems that, till 1948,\n&gt; the Hijikata family still made that medicine. My only\n&gt; doubt is the name of the herb: I thought it was\n&gt; &quot;gyukawa-so&quot;, but in the article says &quot;mizosoba&quot;. I\n&gt; wonder if they are the same thing...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n\nYes, &quot;Mizosoba&quot; and &quot;Gyukaku-sou&quot; are the same plants. \nIn a strange thing, if net search is carried out by Gyukaku-sou, \nonly the site related to Ishida Sanyaku will come out. \nPossibly, Gyukaku-sou may be a local name in Hino area. \nThe scientific name of Mizosoba is &quot;Polygonum thunbergii&quot;. \nA general alias is &quot;Ushi-no-hitai&quot; and there is no English name.\n\nManufacture is stopped soon after WWII, and since the master of the \nHijikata family who learned the manufacture method in 1988 passed \naway, those who tell the right manufacture method of Ishida Sanyaku \ndo not exist now. \nAfter the medicinal law changed, the manufacture stop was brought \nabout because Ishida Sanyaku was not able to get the registration \npermission as a medicine. \nAlthough Mizosoba seemingly has some effect of a medicine, since \nIshida Sanyaku burns it, the effect of a medicine of it is lost. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
