Sesshu is the\n&gt; name of the place. This is a sword forged in the Tenwa\n&gt; Era and, as of 1986, it was worth about 50,000 US\n&gt; dollars. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is a Shinto (newer than Koto and older than\n&gt; Shin-Shinto), classified as Jo-josaku (2nd highest\n&gt; class in the aesthetical aspect) and as a Wazamono\n&gt; (4th highest class in the blade sharpness aspect).\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: &quot;Touken Youran&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) For those who like old anime, try finding an old\n&gt; anime (from the 80&#39;s) called Haguregumo, produced by\n&gt; Mad House. It features the Shinsengumi. I haven&#39;t\n&gt; watched it, but I&#39;ve seen some screenshots of it and\n&gt; it&#39;s gorgeous, mixing sumi-e and ukiyo-e to draw\n&gt; scenes and background.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Nagakura Shinpachi has lots of interesting tales...\n&gt; the Kashiku pleasure woman thing, the murder of Haga\n&gt; Gido (Yoshimichi?), the incident where he drank too\n&gt; much with Saitou Hajime and Itou Kashitarou and was\n&gt; almost condemned to death, the Ryubi no Ken incident\n&gt; where he got wounded below the eye, the failed attempt\n&gt; of murder of Kiyokawa Hachiro and others that were\n&gt; already listed and/or discussed here, like the meeting\n&gt; with Suzuki Mikisaburo. :)\n\n\n"
