See I&#39;d do this myself exc=\r\nept I\nmaxed out my phone card. And the person who promised to help me\nmust&#39;=\r\nve forgotten or something.\n\nThis is the info I have\n1) author was formerly =\r\nan employee at the Japanese Cultural Center at\nWeber State\n2) author wrote =\r\n&quot;&#39;Samurai in Salt Lake&#39; and available at the Weber\nState bookstore for arou=\r\nnd $5.00\n3) I don&#39;t have a name, year or anything!!! or whether it was an M=\r\nA\nthesis or undergrad thesis or Phd whatever---however it was\n&quot;published&quot; f=\r\nor the school records\n\n-but- I have been searching, searching, searching al=\r\nl databases\navailable to me his thesis is just not showing up anywhere whic=\r\nh means\nthat if someone can call http://library.weber.edu/ and ask the\nlibr=\r\narian who handles this sort of thing we may be able to read it.\nThe best wa=\r\ny to go about it is to find his or her &quot;Samurai in Salt\nLake&quot; and get their=\r\n full name to do a search.\n\nWhy must we pursue yet more nerdy work?  Becaus=\r\ne anyone who read Mr.\nHillsborough&#39;s work knows that it is far from compreh=\r\nensive and\npossibly alot of stuff was left out---this thesis may help us fi=\r\nll in\nthe &#39;gaps&#39;.  \n----------------------------------\n(added to shinsengum=\r\nihq.com bibliography) thank you to Hirotada\nTokugawa (M) and Michael from t=\r\nhe ninjadojo.com who pointed out the\nimportance of this book\n\nBoyer, Samuel=\r\n Pellman. Naval surgeon; the diary of Dr. Samuel Pellman\nBoyer. Bloomington=\r\n: Indiana University Press, 1963.\n\n***the following pdf has stuff on Aizu a=\r\nnd HAKODATE battle details\n(please tell any Hijikata fangirl you know to re=\r\nad these scans)\n[download] http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/navalsurgeon.pdf\n=\r\nremember the book will not explicitly state &quot;Hijikata Toshizo&quot; however\nall =\r\nthe fighting at Hakodate detailed in this diary basically spells\nout all yo=\r\nu wanted to know\n\n***note how the author mentions the civilians cheering fo=\r\nr Satsuma one\nday and then Aizu the next\n\n***bibliography now contains a li=\r\nst of the best of the best newspapers\nprinted during the Meiji Era or late =\r\nBakumatsu --- Meiji papers such\nas the TOKIO TIMES analyze several Bakumats=\r\nu events...in English\n----------------------------------\n\nGet Shinsengumi i=\r\nn pop-culture articles delivered right to your inbox\nwith Google and yahoo =\r\nalerts see notice/links at the top of the page\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com=\r\n/bibliography.htm\n\n***alerts also cover all official anime/manga releases\n\n=\r\nExample of recent article:\nhttp://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/culture/200=\r\n60131TDY03005.htm\n----------------------------------\n\nOver at http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/ \nis a discussion of a Phd thesis about Aizu duri=\r\nng the Bakumatsu...again\n&quot;Shinsengumi&quot; is not stated (T_T) \nalthough the au=\r\nthor WILL write\na book later (and I insisted that he write a chapter on the=\r\n Shinsengumi).\nThe dissertation is no longer available for download however=\r\n if\nsomeone here is interested I can get it to you just email me---lot&#39;s\nof=\r\n very very interesting battle details (the invasion of Aizu doesn&#39;t\nconcern=\r\n -just- Saitou---it did concern Hijikata, Nakajima Nobori,\nShimada Kai and =\r\nTetsu) and ofcourse the others who died there.\n----------------------------=\r\n------\n\n[Takagi Tokio Update]\nSee Chronology **1893**... sample student and=\r\n [probably] teacher\nhandiwork from Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School (where Tokio=\r\n and later Goro\nworked) came here to the USA (Chicago)....and yes photos of=\r\n the school\n(wonder if the dorm mothers insisted on having a group photo ta=\r\nken)\nwere part of the exhibit too! \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiToki=\r\noinfo.htm\n----------------------------------\n\nAre you feeling sad that you =\r\ncan&#39;t read Shinsengumi\nstuff in Japanese?  But do you know another language=\r\n\nother than English?  \nLike German? French? Spanish? Thai? Filipino? Korean=\r\n?\nDid you know that there is PLENTY OF BAKUMATSU info in\nother languages?  =\r\n\n&quot;Shinsengumi&quot; may not be stated but\n&quot;mercenaries of Aizu&quot; will show up one=\r\n way or the other \n(our boys have many many positive and negative labels).\n=\r\nAlso remember that other cultures will view the Tokugawa and\neven the Meiji=\r\n Era very DIFFERENTLY from American scholars.\nIt has alot to do with whethe=\r\nr or not that culture interacted\nwith Japan during WWII (this will totally =\r\naffect how they will write\nabout the restoration).\n\n\n\n\n"
