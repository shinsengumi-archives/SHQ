Our member, [Tama], provided a clarification saying \nthat\n&gt; it is in fact Koga TAnji&#39;s shirt.  Koga was a friend of Fujita \nGoro in\n&gt; the TMPD where they both worked as spies.  Fujita Goro would have \nworn\n&gt; a similar shirt and nobekama (not sure about the spelling).\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/SHclothes.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; now the question is why would a spy &quot;uniform&quot; exist *_* wouldn&#39;t \nthat\n&gt; be dangerous?  ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n&gt; AIM badgerturtle\n\n\n\n\n"
