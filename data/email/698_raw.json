If you&#39;d run across it, I&#39;m sure you would&#39;ve said.  I&#39;m going to use one of the two designs for &quot;Saitou&quot; until someone can tell me it&#39;s something else and also the one you use for Fujita.  (I was wondering why the mon was bamboo and not wisteria... will have to hunt up that discussion... )  Anyway, the mon are part of the new layout for the Visions site.  I&#39;ll make some comment about them so if someone knows, they can correct the error.\n \nThanks!\nphil\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\nNo, it seems that we don&#39;t have a kamon for the Yamaguchi\nhousehold...we just have one for the Fujita household which is my pic\non www.shinsengumimb.com...\nhttp://www.miburo.com also has a pic which seems to be a scan from\nShizuko Akama&#39;s book.  \nThe pic of Fujita Goro&#39;s 2nd son also has the son wearing a haori with\nthe same kamon as well and the haori which belonged to Fujita G. also\nhas the same design (you have to scan the pic and zooooom in to see it).  \nMissB/Warg and I discussed the possible symbolic meaning of the bamboo\nleaves, the number 9 and the three diamonds which appear in the\ndesigns negative space at www.shinsengumimb.com.\nI&#39;m pretty sure Fujita G. used the kamon because of the reasons\nmentioned above and it is also one of the symbols used in a\nShinsengumi chapter newsletter (and we all know how serious those\npeople are).\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; And now for something completely different...\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do we have an image for the mon Saitou Hajime would&#39;ve used?  I have\ntwo possible designs for Saitou, but don&#39;t know which, if either.  I\ntake it that the one used by...uh... &quot;sec&quot; on the message board is the\none he used as Fujita?  Just out of curiosity, where did that image\ncome from and are we sure it&#39;s the design he used?  (I thought I\nremembered a post either here or the mb about accessing images of\nmon... where did it go??)\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil (currently overhauling one of my sites... finally)\n&gt; P.S.  secretarytocapt3, you can delete the senna pics.  I&#39;m going to\ntake down the entry and repost when we get things cleared up with our\nisp.  The anniversary is passed and the need less urgent.
