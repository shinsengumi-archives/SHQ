I hope that you guys can put\n&gt; it to good use. Btw, I was intrigued at how close Mibu and the\n&gt; Nishi-Honganji temple are to Shimabara...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, GCW &lt;saitohworship@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what Masayoshi was talking about - classical\n&gt; Japanese?  is it a lot of kanji or something else entirely?  What&#39;s\n&gt; the difference btwn classical Japanese and the language today?\n&gt; \n&gt; Classical Japanese, or &quot;Bungo&quot; (&quot;Literary-language&quot;), as it&#39;s called,\n&gt; basically uses an incredible amount of kanji and kana (syllabary\n&gt; characters) that have been dropped as of 1868. Also, the type of\n&gt; spoken bungo depended on what social class the person was from. \nSo, a\n&gt; farmer would talk differently than a samurai, the shogun would talk\n&gt; differently than a ronin, and the Emperor&#39;s bungo was so archaic that\n&gt; even when Showa Tenno (Emperor Hirohito) delivered his surrender\n&gt; speech over the radio in 1945, most of the people had no idea what he\n&gt; was talking about.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, the word &quot;Bungo&quot; in this case is not to be confused with\n&gt; the former province of Bungo (now Oita Prefecture) in Kyushu...\n&gt; \n&gt; --M.\n\n\n"
