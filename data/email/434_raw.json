I also wonder what he would \nthink \n&gt; of those of us -whistles innocently- who are slightly obsessed with \n&gt; his fundoshi..\n\nHijikata surrounded by the kunoichi on this board\n&lt;thinking to himself&gt; These female foreign devils are trying to \ndefile the nobility and purity of the Shinsengumi, the epitome of \nJapanese maculinity,...&lt;draws sword&gt;\n\n&quot;Die evil female foreign devils YAAAAAA!&quot;\n\n***He may also think that some of you who used WAY to much starch in \nfundoshi washing are actually working for the Ishin \nShishi...overstarched underwear tends to be errr uncomfortable you \nknow***\n\n&gt; On another note, I was wondering if there was another way to reach \n&gt; Japanese Shinsengumi fans. I noted that on \nhttp://japanese.about.com/ \n&gt; they have a section for finding penpals. Is there anyway someone \n&gt; (preferably who understands more of the language than me!) might \n&gt; could use that to try and reach out to them?\n\nI&#39;m not going to have time to look into this for maybe another month \nor something but is there a way to search for Shinsengumi fans?  \nBecause in their profiles maybe they&#39;ll just leave off interests they \nmay assume are confined to Japan.  In the meantime I have emailed \nsome major Shinsengumi sites and one replied\n&quot;sorry no English&quot;\nand this was from a super fancy site!!!  No one on either side of the \nworld wants to use the goldfish it seems because I include the link \nin all my messages and I structure my sentences very simply to have \nit translate to Japanese &quot;Japanese language to English language \nhttp://babelfish.altavista.com&quot;  -_- I guess they can&#39;t comprehend \nbabelfish Japanese either :)\n\n\n"
