Yes th=\r\ne title is &quot;Byakkotai&quot; but the entire \nfirst half is Shinsengumi (this is a=\r\n 2 part series).  This film \nexplains the interdependence between our boys =\r\nand the Aizu domain\nsee caps here http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.ht=\r\nm\n\nMichael has been incredibly helpful to us in terms of history \nresearch =\r\nand compiling lists of films, recommendations and updating \nus with alot of=\r\n info for pop culture.  Please help us provide an \nanswer to this small req=\r\nuest. Basically, would you BUY BYAKKOTAI? Is \nthe question (^_^) just say &#39;=\r\nyes&#39; &#39;no&#39; that&#39;s all we \nwant  ::secretarytocapt3 begging::  -or- tell us w=\r\nhat other \nShinsengumi film you&#39;d like to see subtitled\n\nWE NEED YOUR INPUT=\r\n...\nIf a Shinsengumi haori (either blue or black) FROM JAPAN was the \nprize=\r\n...would you consider entering in a video/multimedia contest?  \nIt can be a=\r\n music vid, short live-action movie, your own animation, \npuppetry, audio d=\r\nrama, anything...the contest would occur early to \nlate summer.  The projec=\r\nt would be judged on creativity and \noriginality.  It can come from any &quot;un=\r\niverse&quot; however, if possible \nsome of the project should incorporate your o=\r\nwn work.\n\nWould anyone be interested?  I can host your project and it will =\r\nbe \nposted here:\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm\nIt can be as large as=\r\n 20-40 MB...or more\n\nI don&#39;t want to write up the rules etc, design a promo=\r\n page and then \nhave no entries (^_^).  In previous contests we had only a =\r\nfew \nentries I was able to give prizes to ALL contestants however this \ntim=\r\ne I wanted to give a haori.\n\nIf the competition is fierce I will also inclu=\r\nde a hakama with the \ncoat so all your cosplay dreams can come true. No I w=\r\nill not buy you \na sword....\n\n--------------------------------------\nTRIVIA=\r\n\nDid you know that the Ikedaya fight scene in the RK OVA was based on \nthe =\r\nscene in the film Byakkotai?  This can be seen easily because \nthe animator=\r\ns copied the live action movie frame by frame in the \npart where the Choshu=\r\n samurai pour out onto the balcony/rooftop.  \nI&#39;m not talking about the par=\r\nt where everyone is in the dark and the \nfireflies illuminate the swords bu=\r\nt a bit later on in that sequence. \nIt&#39;s so cool I will post screencaps lat=\r\ner.\n\n--------------------------------------\nWhen I get a block of free time=\r\n there will be even more updates on \nSHQ however lately I had to work on sc=\r\nanning some rare books such as:\n\nAuthor: Kusunose, Yasuma. \nTitle: Kondo&#7=\r\n72; Isami to Tosa Kinno&#772;to&#772; / Kusunose, Yasuma cho. \nPublisher: K=\r\no&#772;chiken : Inobe Sho&#772;saku, Sho&#772;wa 4 [1929] \nDescription: 2, =\r\n206 p. ; 19 cm. \n\n[status =3D OUT OF PRINT]\n\ncurrently on Worldcat which in=\r\ncorporates libraries in Japan too, \nlists that there is only *** ONE *** co=\r\npy available out there for \nlending purposes...we have it (^_^)\n\nThis book =\r\nis all in Japanese and it is about Kondo Isami and the \nTosa group.
