Because the maps are color coded and I used \nthe web pallet thing...we are talking about a bit over 50 maps \npeople ^_^\n\n*The book does not have an isbn you can&#39;t just order a collection of \nthese war maps anywhere...\n\nBook...\nShinpen Seinan Senshi Fuzushu\n1977\n\n*please get the free adobe acrobat reader because pdf files allow \nyou to zoom in on text, images and it keeps everything nice and neat\n\n*I scanned the book backwards because I thought it would be like \nmost Japanese books...wrong...so the first maps you see will take \nplace near the [end] of the war amongst hills and mountain passes \n(recall the newspaper article which mentions Fujita Goro)...as you \nprogress towards the beginning of the war you will see how all the \nfighting was around more populated/urban areas (this is why the \ngovernment ended up burning people&#39;s homes...more on that in the \nreport)...to get a good general overview go to map #3 (the maps are \nnumbered do not use the numbering system in the pdf file---use the \nnumbers the author actually wrote ON the maps)\n\n\n\n"
