And shouldn&#39;t you be saving\nup for our fantasy trip to Japan? ^_^\n\nI am skimming &quot;The True Story of The Siege of Kumamoto Castle&quot;\ntranslated by James H. Buck\nStandard Book Number (which I guess means isbn in the 1970s) 533-02324-6\nmentions how the Imperial Army used to suppress the Satsuma Rebellion\nhad low morale and little training so the gov. organized &quot;Special\nMobile Brigades&quot; consisting of [policemen] from the samurai class from\nall over Japan.  The book is (gasp) very very very PRO &quot;GREAT SAIGO&quot;\nhowever I think the detail about the [police] fighting &quot;hand-to-hand\ncombat with swords and bayonets so vigorously that they fought with\nSatsuma samurai on an equal basis&quot; (Buck, viii) was used to add some\nsort of balance to both sides in the conflict.  Like all books,\ndemographics were left out entirely seeing how many of those policemen\nwere from Aizu and all...\n\nMiss B, have you used jstor.org to look up journal articles?  I found\na totally cool journal article about the TMPD and how it was run\nduring Fujita Goro&#39;s time...but ODDLY not too much stuff on Aizu and\nHakodate...so we gotta come up with some keywords to use.\n\n\n"
