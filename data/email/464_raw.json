That \nit was either Satsuma or Choshu clan and any other person that wanted \nto war against the Shogun. Ryoma seemed to be the person that was \npreventing that. The movies I have about Ryoma tend to take this \ntheory, but that is fiction of course. I read someone talking about \nthe Peacemaker Manga on Ryoma&#39;s death, but I won&#39;t spoil that one. \nI&#39;ll post something on this on the other board eventually. \n\nThanks,\n\nKevin\n\n\n"
