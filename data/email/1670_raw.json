There were the traditional greetings\n&gt; after the arrival of the Shinsengumi parade, some\n&gt; words by Fujita Taro (the great-grandson of Fujita\n&gt; Goro), the memorial service and a demonstration\n&gt; (hounou enbu, actually) of Mugai-ryu iaijutsu. And I\n&gt; could get to meet Tama-san in person, which was really\n&gt; great ^.^\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who are interested, I have uploaded some\n&gt; pictures I took at the memorial service. They are in\n&gt; the Photos section of yahoogroups. Again, the images\n&gt; are very heavy...\n&gt; \n&gt; And I couldn&#39;t go to the Shinsengumi summit either.\n&gt; Pity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n\n\n\nIs there any signboard of explanation in present Fujita&#39;s grave? \nWhen I went there, it did not exist. \n\n(Ne, Fujitake no haka wa medatsu tokoroni atta deshou?)\n\nFurthermore, Fujita&#39;s grave did not appear in Aizu&#39;s sightseeing map \nbefore two years.\nEvery year, many tourists visit the place of the relation of a Taiga \ndrama. \nAizu is very kind this year.^^ \n\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\nP.S.\nThank you for answering about soy sauce. \nSince she is a cooking investigator, she may be sensing the smell of \nsoy sauce.^^\n\n\n\n\n"
