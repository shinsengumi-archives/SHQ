Basically the \nj=\r\nagged-edge design.  Although the Shinsengumi color scheme (and our \nguys di=\r\nd change their uniform later) may be different the intent to \nevoke the 47 =\r\nronin was the goal.\n\nOver time the black-white &quot;look&quot; was incorporated into=\r\n Shinsengumi \nmedia perhaps to add more variety.\n\nYou see the uniform/desig=\r\nn in many places.  Even in movements which \nalso claim to stand for &quot;loyalt=\r\ny&quot; for whatever reason:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DyRxK0wsgL4Q\n(2 mi=\r\nn 30 sec vid)\n\nplease click on the outstanding write up provided by &quot;ONIAZU=\r\nMA&quot;\n\nIt is also interesting to note that many Bakumatsu groups like the \nSh=\r\ninsengumi, Byakkotai (Aizu) and even the Sekihoutai! have all at \none point=\r\n or another been hijacked for right-wing, militarists \npurposes because his=\r\ntory belongs to &quot;everybody&quot; and they become fair \ngame for people with an a=\r\ngenda.\n\nThese crazy fringe groups ofcourse do not represent all Japanese \np=\r\neople.  They are just being outspoken due to the increasingly \nconservative=\r\n political climate in Japan.\n\n-------SHQ WEBSITE TECH REPORT--------\nwe are=\r\n in the testing phase of a database search engine thingy\nit is not just a o=\r\nne line [search] function...it will allow for \ncomparative and elimination =\r\ntype searches for example:\n\n[keyword 1]  (and/or/not) [keyword 2]\n\nfor inst=\r\nance:\n\nSaitou Hajime (not) Itou Kashitarou\n\nor \n\nSaitou Hajime (and) Itou K=\r\nashitarou\n\nunfortunately the search will not be &quot;yaoi&quot; dynamic such as Sait=\r\nou \n(x) Itou... (I&#39;m just kidding you sillies...but hey that does sound \nli=\r\nke a good idea!)\n\nsorry for many pages/images being screwed up...I am tryin=\r\ng to deal \nwith our programmer about this issue and warned her about the \nr=\r\nepercussions of taking stuff offline and starting new \ndirectories...certai=\r\nn areas of the site are totally non-functioning \nand this is very regrettab=\r\nle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
