My interpretation of the book so far is that\n&gt; the &quot;expulsion of foreigners&quot; was way up on the shinsengumi &quot;to do&quot;\n&gt; list according to hillsborough. As for the 105 - now I get it - there\n&gt; were only 105 members (aside from the ones who declined or fled) - I\n&gt; was thinking that only a percentage were chosen. And I&#39;d LOVE to see\n&gt; the list. UH might have the book, but I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be\n&gt; getting up there again, probably not for a few weeks anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"
