Although on one hand it seemed to be a \nmark of distinction to ob=\r\ntain the samurai status, economically speaking \nmany people, including the =\r\nsamurai themselves, knew that the money can \nbe found in the purportedly &quot;l=\r\nower&quot; classes.  For example during the \nMeiji era a survey of families who =\r\nsent their daughters to a public \nschool---across the board claimed samurai=\r\n descent, but many *before \n1868 had engaged in clearly merchant class busi=\r\nnesses (this flies \nagainst the widespread abhorrance of samurai to engage =\r\nin such work).  \nBy far the most econommically dynamic classes were the upp=\r\ner peasant \nand merchant classes.  What killed the samurai class was their =\r\nobsolete \nrole and drain on the economy---samurai no longer and never did \n=\r\nproduced &quot;anything&quot; unlike the lower classes, although as we now they \nfulf=\r\nilled critical administrative roles.\n\nI haven&#39;t finished this page yet but =\r\nwhen I&#39;m done I&#39;ll upload it to \nshinsengumihq.com:\n\nBefore Boshin 1868: A =\r\nSurvey of the Feudal System\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/BakumatsuBackgr=\r\nound.htm\n\nIt&#39;s really important to note this article\nThe Farmers of Edo and=\r\n the Warriors in Kyoto \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm\n\nBeca=\r\nuse the Shinsengumi, for the first time are mentioned in a non-\nwarrior con=\r\ntext, were right smack in the middle of the social pyramid \nblur---they wer=\r\ne close friends/associates/adopted siblings to ELITE \nPEASANTS, WELL EDUCAT=\r\nED PEASANTS.  Thus people like Kondou and Hijikata \nhad a deep understandin=\r\ng of what was going on because they valued these \nsocial relationships and =\r\nclearly, in no way abandoned their associates \nafter attaining that feudal =\r\n&quot;dream&quot; of samuraihood so to speak.\n\nI did pose the question to Mr. Hillsbo=\r\nrough of whether or not he would \naddress what was going in Tama at the tim=\r\ne and if he would discuss in \ndepth the social background of these figures.=\r\n  Specifically, rural Edo \nwhere many members from the Shinsengumi call hom=\r\ne has been studied by \nscholars specifically for all that social blurring. =\r\n During the Meiji \nEra that region produced incredibly politically active f=\r\narmers who \npushed for *real democratic change and surprisingly opposed som=\r\ne of the \nvictors of 1868.  Hillsborough asked if I was a sociology major. =\r\n I&#39;m \nnot---just a concerned and curious member of his audience, but the \np=\r\noint was ... it is absolutely important to get into the &quot;mindset&quot; of \nKondo=\r\nu and Hijikata.  Because they did see things differently, after \nall, trave=\r\nlling from rural Edo to Kyoto was an eye opening \nexperience...trying to na=\r\nvigate the capital&#39;s bureaucracy must&#39;ve been \nrather difficult for a bunch=\r\n of &quot;nobodies&quot;.  They were fish out of \nwater and treated as such.\n\nWhether=\r\n or not their later success contributed to their &quot;their \nconviction of self=\r\n-importance and their unyielding will to power&quot; \n(Hillsborough 147) and so =\r\nforth is a possibility, but a slightly \ndifficult abstraction to gauge accu=\r\nrately by any historian.\n\nThen again, lust for power is a universal, human =\r\ntrait, not something \nthe Shinsengumi monopolized.\nHillsborough probably ha=\r\ns not studied the aftermath of 1868 in great \ndetail.  His heroes are the m=\r\nost shockingly ruthless men to hold and \nmaintain, political, social, milit=\r\nary and educational power.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-=\r\nlistowner@...&gt; wrote:\nAs for the social classes, it looks\n&gt; like they got p=\r\nretty hazy near the end of the Edo period. Thanks for\n&gt; the clarifications.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
