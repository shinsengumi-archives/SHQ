It is amazing how much difference there can be between a child who starts school at the youngest age possible for public school entrance and one who is at the other end of that range... and it is only a matter of months.  It would be fascinating to see if being born at the end of the year and suddenly being considered 2 years old when you are only a month old caused problems as adults since they were age-mates with people, like Saitou, who would have been a full year older.  We could start a new reason for people to be troublemakers... look to see when they were born.  :-D\n \nThank you, momoiro-usagi, for the details!  I love the psychology that follows things like this.\n\nHirotada Tokugawa &lt;patriot014@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;(The child born at the end of December suffers troubles. He is born\n&gt;and becomes 2 years old immediately.)\n\nLike Tokugawa Ieyasu (the first Tokugawa shogun). He was born (I think) \nDecember 24, 1543, which, by the kazoedoshi system, made him 2 years old in \na matter of days...\n\n--M.\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
