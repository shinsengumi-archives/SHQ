The deputy relayed important matters \nto the Senior Council in Edo by couriers, who traveled the distance between \nKyoto and Edo in about six days. Bakufu decisions followed the same route \nback to the court messengers, but these latter had no direct access to the \nEmperor. They contacted the kampaku or imperial advisor who then conferred \nwith the Emperor.&quot;\n\nBut if it involved Aizu, and since the Shogun came to Osaka Castle and later \nNijo Castle, the communication could probably be done right there. Aizu was \nalso probably directly apprised of this stuff.\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
