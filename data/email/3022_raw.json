My biggest aggrivation with English\nhistories =\r\nof events in Japanese history is one mentioned in your\nreview - not enough =\r\nfootnotes or discussions in text of other\npossibilities or conflicting repo=\r\nrts/documents - almost like the\nhistorian writing the book either 1. doesn&#39;=\r\nt want to take away from\ntheir own POV, 2.Doesn&#39;t want to bother, 3.Doesn&#39;t=\r\n realize there are\nconflicting documents, or 4.Is just lazy.  The Evil Turn=\r\nbull is the\nworst offender in this sort of thing (I won&#39;t get into the coun=\r\ntless\nother issues I have with that guy&#39;s &quot;work&quot;, although I&#39;ll give him th=\r\ne\nonly credit I can, that he has probably done more to get people\nintereste=\r\nd in the subject that the academic rice-counters).  \n\nAlso, I have the same=\r\n problem a lot of people have in general - the\nscholars of Japanese history=\r\n in the West are forced to publish books\non the kokudaka output of XYZ prov=\r\nince or the &quot;intellectual history&quot;\n(which is a fancy word for writing long =\r\nrun on sentences with words\nonly found in the dusty pages of long out of pr=\r\nint Olde English\ndictionaries with an aversion to common adjectives) otherw=\r\nise they\njust won&#39;t get published.  I&#39;m still waiting for a Carl Sagan of\nJ=\r\napanese history to make things interesting.  Usually I gather a few\nrare us=\r\neful articles from the Journal of Japanese Studies or the\nMonumenta Niponic=\r\na (I did see the journal list SHINSENGUMI IN ACADEMIC\nJOURNALS, so I&#39;ll be =\r\ngetting those articles soon), but then since\nnothing of much interest has b=\r\neen published since Sansom, so I pretty\nmuch stick to reading Japanese hist=\r\nory books. It&#39;s a shame, too, since\nthe things I read in Japanese are far m=\r\nore colorful and interesting\nthan anything found in English.\n\nEnd Rant :-P\n=\r\n\nI just picked up the Gakken Shinsengumi book put out in 2003, and the\nGakk=\r\nen books to this point have always had good information and lots\nof interes=\r\nting &quot;extras&quot; - this one has about 100 shinsengumi\nbiographies, maps of var=\r\nious battles, a map of areas where important\nmembers were assasinated, and =\r\nall sorts of other goodies.\n\nI checked Hillsborough&#39;s book on Amazon.com - =\r\nshouldn&#39;t someone here\nwrite a more unbiased review? Only one review out of=\r\n 4 there seems to\nbe at all critical.\n\n\n"
