But I wish I will..\n   \n  Im living in Indonesia.\n  Here, I never met any person who knows Shinsengumi, so I never share and get anything.\n  I never met peole who love Japanese history either.\n  Here also, I can find ONLY one book bout Shinsengumi, so I have to order it and ask my sensei or my friend to send me from Japan. T__T\n  The only one I can talk, ask and share with.. is just my (japanese) friend.\n  (Umm.. sometimes I call him as my rekishi no sensei)\n   \n  Untill (fortunately), I found you guyz.. people who admire history and Shinsengumi of course.\n  Thank God Im not alone ... he he he\n   \n  Although I know Shinsengumi from anime, but I start to admire them since I read lots of their story of life and struggle.\n  The only moment I feel sooooo much influenced by them was.. when I read Kondo&#39;s poem.\n  ( I appreciate them-and this poem- in my site http://cyborg13.multiply.com/ )\n   \n  And now, even I never watch any (un)remarkable thing, even I stil now nothing bout Shinsengumi, even I can&#39;t talk english and japanese fluently, I try to make people know them from simply things, such as in speech contest, paper writings, sites, or by teaching and pushing my junior in campus to learn more bout history ..ha ha ha ( eventhough it seems useless cause theyre all more interesting in japanese society class T__T ).\n   \n   \n   \n  \n\nKitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n          --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.&quot; &lt;myoe112@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; In short, the history came alive in that set of somewhat\n&gt; unremarkable-looking, painted, sliding doors. And that is why, dear\n&gt; members, history compels me.\n&gt; \n&gt; -M.\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s why I love going to Japan - I had a moment like that in 2001,\nwhere I stood in the very spot Toyotomi Hideyoshi held his final Grand\nKitano tea ceremony. I was looking at the exact landscape everyone in\nattendance would have seen, although a lot of cherry trees had been\nplanted since then. It&#39;s sort of awe inspiring experiencing that sort\nof thing.\n\n\n\n         \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better Globetrotter.
