Apparently there&#39;s a possible black version as well. \n\nAs for yellow, remember that the names used to describe yellow and light blue on Serizawa&#39;s site are exactly the same, only the kanji is written differently. \n\nFrom a Japanese book I have, it&#39;s mentioned the light blue came from the light blue color of the formal kamishimo attire. \n\n---------------------\nNow, the real Shinsengumi uniform does not remain. \nBlue haori which we look at with an image is the clothes which \nresearchers produced based on testimony of people of those days. \nTherefore, nobody knows whether really the Shinsengumi uniform was \nthat form. \n\nIncidentally that haori was made of hempen cloth. \nA hempen kimono is a kimono for summer. \nI think that it is from June to September that they wore that haori.\nMembers stopped wearing it after Ikedaya.\n(In fact, it is about one year that they wore that haori, after \nforming Shinsengumi.) \nWhen Itou Kashotarou who wears haori of silk crape joined \nShinsengumi, the haori did not already exist^_^\n\nTheir uniform after a blue haori is stopped is not known well. \nAt testimony of a certain Shishi, it seemed to be the black haori \nand the black hakama. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Warg3791@... \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, March 21, 2005 5:20 AM\n  Subject: Re: [SHQ] Re: Shinsengumi uniforms\n\n\n  Hi. That makes sense to me. And I remember reading an interview with some man \n  who&#39;s great-grandfather I think it was had witnessed the Aizu war. He gets \n  some things wrong about the Shinsengumi (which would be understandable since he \n  probably has never really studied them from the way he talked), but he did \n  mention that this person had passed down that their uniforms were yellow. \n\n  -MissB\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
