For all I know (which isn&#39;t much) it may be the same and it was produced in Korea or something.  I just found it curious and thought maybe you knew more about it.  Maybe Kevin knows something, so I&#39;ll wait to see if he knows anything.  Even if it&#39;s not the same film, it&#39;s worth taking a look at for it&#39;s own sake.  I&#39;m fond of Korean cinema as well.  And thanks for making these things available to us.  I, for one, truly appreciate the opportunity to see things I might not otherwise get a chance to see... Shinsengumi related or not.  (And I&#39;ll love you forever for the RK manga scanlation!  I&#39;m in Saitou and Sano heaven!)\n \nphil\n\nGrace Battista &lt;mg_batt@...&gt; wrote:\nYa know what....

Hey, Kevin or Wounds!  Do you know, is this the same film as \nthe one with Sagara, or is this another film, a Korean film, with \nthe same title?  I&#39;ve downloaded it, but it&#39;s going to be a few days \nbefore I can get to it.
