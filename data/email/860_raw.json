From http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-\nCosmos/4774/page015.=\r\nhtml\n\n---\n\nSuzuki Mikisaburou\n\nBorn in the Shizuki domain of Hitachi Provin=\r\nce (modern-day Ibaraki \nPrefecture, Niihari Ward, Chiyoda City). Born on Te=\r\nnpo 8 (1837), July \n12, the 2nd son of the Shizuki domain chief inspector S=\r\nuzuki \nSen&#39;emon. His elder brother was Itou Kashitarou, whose original name=\r\n \nwas Suzuki Ookura.\n\nHis childhood name is rather obscure=97Suzuki Tamon (=\r\nthe kanji \nfor &quot;mon&quot; is misspelled, and is inconsistent with the rest of th=\r\ne \narticle). His older brother, while protecting the mansion (?), \nchanged =\r\nhis name to Settsu. Only after the Restoration did he change \nhis name from=\r\n Miki Izumi to Suzuki Mikisaburou. He trained in Shintou \nMunen Ryuu, but I=\r\ntou Kashitarou (his older brother) had to force him \n(?). He was better at =\r\nquoting the Chinese classics (?).\n\nAfter their father took part in the Heim=\r\non Incident, the his family \nname was abolished and he was exiled from his =\r\ndomain. Following this, \nthey went to Sakura mura (present Yasato ward), th=\r\ne village their \nfather&#39;s grandmother was from, and stayed in the house of =\r\nSakurai \nShirou Saemon.\n\nSubsequently, they were pardoned, but were not all=\r\nowed to return to \nthe domain. So they established themselves at Takahama v=\r\nillage, near \nTodai bridge (modern Ishioka city). They opened a school of C=\r\nhinese \nstudies called &quot;Shunjuku&quot; at Mitsui Temple.\n\nThe father&#39;s fame spre=\r\nad rather quickly, and soon several students \nfrom Sawayama joined, seeming=\r\n to indicate that the family&#39;s fortunes \nwere headed in a good direction.\n\n=\r\nIn February 1852, the father died. After this, Okura (the older \nbrother) j=\r\noined the Itou dojo, allowing Tamon to continue running the \nschool at Mits=\r\nui Temple.\n\nHowever, Tamon was able to finish his studies incredibly quickl=\r\ny, \nwriting &quot;A man should strive toward excellence in the martial arts&quot;, \na=\r\nnd &quot;Kusunoki Tamonmaru&quot; (an allusion to the famous warrior Kusunoki  \nMasas=\r\nhige?) on flags.\n\nEvery day, he would tell stories of battles to the childr=\r\nen and skip \nteaching altogether. The children&#39;s parents found out, and the=\r\ny began \nto pull their children out of the school one by one, and gradually=\r\n \nthe school failed.\n\nAfter this, Terauchi Souzaemon of the Shizuki domain =\r\nwanted to adopt \nTamon. Terauchi was 80 years old and had no wife or childr=\r\nen. \nApparently his mother had suggested it to him. Terauchi&#39;s house was \no=\r\nn the site of the old Suzuki house, so his mother apparently wanted \nhim to=\r\n adopt Tamon.\n\nAfter his adoption, Tamon was director of Yamabayashi. But, =\r\nas he was \naccustomed to drinking in Terauchi&#39;s house, he drank more and mo=\r\nre \nuntil he began to skip work. He was scolded, and in order to avoid a \ns=\r\ncandal was kicked out of the house.\nAfter this, he took the name Miki Araji=\r\nrou, just to make the \nseparation final. But, since he couldn&#39;t kick the ha=\r\nbit of drinking, \nit came to the point where he was shirking his duty to th=\r\ne domain, \nand he got in trouble. The lord spared Miki of being kicked out =\r\nof \nthe domain, and gave him a small stipend.\nThinking of his brother in Ed=\r\no, he started thinking of national \naffairs. It came to the point where he =\r\nwas part of the Tenka Shishi \n(proto-Ishin Shishi) for a time.\n\nJust then, =\r\nPerry arrived, the Ansei Purge occurred, and the Sakurada \nGate and Sakashi=\r\nta Gate incidents occurred, one after the other after \nthe other. Miki came=\r\n under suspicion in these days and feeling a \nsense of danger left Edo with=\r\n a friend.\n\nIn Sakurada-shi in Sendai, they were about to head to Tamura at=\r\n Taga-\ngun in Hitachi, but they got the news that &quot;traveling deep into the =\r\n\ncountryside is dangerous.&quot;\n\nThis being the case, he went to the home of Un=\r\no Kuratsukuri (wrong \nreading of the kanji, I think). Miki Arajirou stayed =\r\nat the Uno house \nfor several years, teaching literature and fencing. One d=\r\nay, when he \ntried returning to his mother, his mother appeared from Edo qu=\r\nickly \nand returned just as quickly, since the older brother was serving th=\r\ne \nnation (government?).\n\nFIRST YEAR OF GENJI\n\nAt age 28, Kashitarou assist=\r\ned in leading the Tengu party (which \nSerizawa was also in), in accordance =\r\nwith the advice of the ronin \nKomatsu Kanni of the Kurume domain. But becau=\r\nse Shizuki han is close \nto Mt. Tsukuba (north of Edo), Okura (Kashitarou) =\r\nwas worried because \nof the havoc they caused and how it would affect his h=\r\nome domain. \nAround this time he found Arajirou in Shizuki han. Miki and Ts=\r\nuchiura \nate at an inn in Shizuki han, where the Tengu party (Tanaka&#39;s \nbri=\r\ngade?) happened to be present,  but had entered Shizuki without \npermission=\r\n. Miki tried to clear their presence in the domain, saying \nthat they had a=\r\nrrived there through the efforts of his uncle Kawamata \nin Edo (?)\nHe was g=\r\niven a residence, and patrolled the domain with several \npeople and worked =\r\naround the inner gates.\nIt worked for awhile, however, he escaped  the fall=\r\n of the Tengu \nparty, making it back to Edo just in time.\nWhen he arrived i=\r\nn Edo, his elder brother Itou Okura had been \naccepted into the Shinsengumi=\r\n by Toudou Heisuke. That same year, \nOkura&#39;s disciples and the entire Itou =\r\ndojo entered the Shinsengumi.\nAt this time, he changed his name to Itou Kas=\r\nhitarou, and his younger \nbrother became Mikisaburou.\nSuzuki Mikisaburou wa=\r\ns the captain of the ninth unit and involved in \nkansatsu operations (obser=\r\nvations/spying, like Yamazaki Susumu).\nThe Satsuma clan now followed/enlist=\r\ned him as a double agent \n(DEFINITELY not sure=97 the kanji are vaguely fam=\r\niliar to me, and \nBabelfish says &quot;prohibited reverse side&quot;).\nAfter his olde=\r\nr brother&#39;s assassination on November 18th, he started \nthinking of ways to=\r\n kill Kondou in revenge. On December 9th, he was \nattacked on Kondou Street=\r\n in Kyoto and injured.\nHe took part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and then=\r\n joined the \nSekihoutai as 2nd unit captain. Shinsengumi revenge=85(can&#39;t u=\r\nnderstand \nthe rest of this sentence).\n\nIn the Meiji era, he became the chi=\r\nef of police of Tsuruoka, and \ncontributed funds to the construction of a h=\r\nospital. He retired to \nhis hometown in Ishioka, and lived to 1919, dying a=\r\nt age 83.\n\n\n\n"
