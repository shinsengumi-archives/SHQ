I mean that \n  this site was claiming that they wore a blue outfit on the day they were \n  forced to commit seppuku. I had never heard that story before and I thought that \n  samurai always wore white for that anyway?\n\n  -MissB\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
