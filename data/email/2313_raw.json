Secondly, thanks to Wu Jia-Xin \nand Yuki for answering as well.\n\nI can answer both of your questions at least a little bit.\n\nYes Tetsu and Tatsu were both real. And Tetsu really was Hijikata&#39;s \npage. However, they did not join the Shinsengumi until 1867. I think \nTatsu left the group after either Toba-Fushimi? Or Was it Kofu? But \nTetsu followed Hijikata all the way to Hakodate, Ezo (Hokkaido).\n\nAs for what happened to Hijikata up north... \n\nThe basic story as I have it so far is that he left Aizu on a mission \nto get reinforcements, but was unsuccessful for a reason I have yet \nto exactly determine. I think the domain he went to might have also \nbeen in trouble at that time? He eventually wound up in Sendai and \nhad a council of war with Enomoto&#39;s group. It was decided that they \nwould go to Ezo and try to build a new government there. Hijikata was \none of two men appointed as leaders of their army. (? I think this is \ncorrect. Not sure who the other guy was.)\n\nHijikata really had no hope of winning a battle at that point. He \npretty much knew that if he went to Ezo he would be going to his \ndeath. However he did not care. He said that if he ever made peace \nwith his enemies he would not be able to face Kondo in the next life. \nHe also told a doctor acquaintance (You&#39;ve probably read this \nbefore): &quot;I am not going to battle to win. With the Tokugawa \ngovernment about to collapse, it would be a disgrace if no one is \nwilling to go down with it. That is why I must go. I will fight the \nbest battle of my life to die for the country.&quot; It is believed that \nthis is about the time at least one of those pictures of him was \ntaken.\n\nSetting out by boat, Enomoto&#39;s group landed on Washinoki beach in \norder to keep Hakodate, an important seaport, from being destroyed in \na fight. They managed to enter Fort Goryokaku a few days later \nwithout a struggle. (This was sometime in October, but I do not have \nthe dates handy at the moment.) Goryokaku had only been completed a \nfew years before and was made for modern warfare, which is why they \nchose it for their headquarters. It was shaped like a star, making it \nhard to approach without being in the line of fire. It was destroyed \nafter the war by the Meiji government, but you can still see the \ngeneral outline of it today. They declared their new government \nthe &quot;Republic of Ezo.&quot;\n\nAfter this Enomoto&#39;s people began to take control of the rest of Ezo. \nthey sent word to the Matsumae clan demanding that they join with \nthem and were ignored. Enomoto sent Hijikata and his army to force \nthem to surrender. There were a few fights in this campaign that as \nfar as I can tell Hijikata won, including one surprise raid on his \ncamp. He finally succeeded in taking the castle itself. There seems \nto be some debate on how it happened, but the most reliable source \n(Shimada Kai&#39;s diary) says that they entered the fortress by using a \nladder to climb over a wall and caught the defenders off-guard.\n\nShortly after this, they held a democratic election and Enomoto was \nvoted President. Hijikata was voted Army Magistrate and had charge of \nthe defence of Hakodate. (People have critized this attempt at \na &quot;democratic&quot; government, but it seems to me to have been at least \nif not far more &quot;progressive&quot; the the Meiji government.)\n\nIt gets a bit fuzzy for me again here. They seem to have been left \nalone for the rest of that winter. It is said that at this time \nHijikata&#39;s personality was very mild and that his men adored him. The \npeople of Hakodate seemed to have respected him as well. \n\nSome attempt was made to gain outside help, but no one wanted to risk \ngoing up against Great Britain which was allied with the Meiji \ngovernment. Even France had long before withdrawn from its alliance \nwith the Shogunate. The sole exception was a few soilders who \ndeserted and joined up with Enomoto&#39;s forces. Among these Frenchmen \nwas a man named Jules Burnet who would later remember that Hijikata \nwas a &quot;true warrior&quot; and that if he had been in a European army he \nwould have been a general. (Burnet was the model for Tom Cruise&#39;s \ncharacter in The Last Samurai, BTW. But he was not nearly so heroic. \nHe hid on a boat during the final battle. -_-)\n\nThese outside &quot;specialist&quot; suggested a plan to Enomoto the next \nspring to take or sink an ironside warship that the Meiji government \nsent against the outlaw republic. It involved both a land and sea \nbattle. Hijikata lead the land forces. Both proved to be disasterous \nfor the Ezo forces and they retreated back to Hakodate to prepare for \nthe final showdown.\n\nDuring this time Hijikata finished settling things about him. On May \n5, 1869 he gave several items (a letter, the picture of him, a sword, \nand I think a poem?) to Tetsu and ordered him to get out of Hakodate \nand take these things to his family. \n\nTetsu tried to refuse, saying he wanted to stay and fight. Hijikata \nbecame angry with him and said that if he didn&#39;t go like he had told \nhim to then he would be the one to kill him. Tetsu went and \neventually managed to slip past the Meiji government&#39;s forces by \ndisguising as a beggar. (I am not sure accurate this is because I had \nto use a translator to get most of this part of the story. I could be \nwrong about a thing or two...)\n\nAt some point the remaining Shinsengumi members were sent to defend a \nfairly isolated fort called Benten Daiba. (No longer exists.) As head \nof the army Hijikata had to remain at Goryokaku. \n\n(This information came from Momoiro-usagi.)The Meiji government \nfinally began it&#39;s attack on May 11, 1869. Enomoto and the others \nwere determined to hold the fort, but Hijikata was opposed to their \nplan. &quot;Reinforcements do not come. It is meaningless to hold \nGoryokaku castle.&quot; He was also angry because this decision abandoned \nthe Shinsengumi members at Benten Daiba. Enomoto basically told him \nto shut up, but Hijikata would not be stopped. He took some men and \nled a sortie to save the men at Benten Daiba.\n\nWhat he could not know was that the Meiji government forces were \nalready between him and the fort. As his group came out of Hakodate \nand into an area called Ippongi-Sekisyo they encountered this army \nand there was a battle. He is said to have been shot in the abdomen, \nthe bullet shattering his lower back and killing him. However they \nnever had a body to prove it. It seems most likely that his men took \nit away from the battlefield and hid it someplace. To this day no one \nknows for sure where his final resting place is located.\n\nThe saddest irony was that the men he was trying to help remained \nfairly safe. Benten Daiba surrendered on May 15, 1869. It was only \nthen that they learned of his fate. One memeber later remembered that \nthey &quot;cried like babies who had lost their mother.&quot; Nakajima Nobori \nwould later repeat that sentiment on his famous painting of Hijikata.\n\nI remeber reading from one website that those who fought with \nHijikata in Hakodate said that he &quot;was more samurai-like than the \nreal samurai and more brave than any other men.&quot;\n\nAs for Tetsu, he sought out the Sato family in Hino as Hijikata had \ninstructed him. He was sheltered by them for three years. After that \nit became unclear what happened to him. Some say that he died of an \nillness at age 20. Others that he tried to fight the Meiji government \nagain during the Senian War and was killed in battle.\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
