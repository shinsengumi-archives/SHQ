And to \nanyone who knows a lot about Shinsengumi history. This has been on my \nmind ever since I saw the ep. \n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; P\n&gt; O\n&gt; I\n&gt; L\n&gt; E\n&gt; R\n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; P\n&gt; A\n&gt; C\n&gt; E \n&gt; \n&gt; The whole incident with the Osaka official Uchiyama Hikojiro is shown in \nthis episode. Now my question is, did this really happen in history? I&#39;m \nwondering since I never heard anything about this before. If anyone can \nanswer this it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Okita \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
