Does that give you any leads to follow?  Oh, and he retired in 1884.  I should be able to dig up the links (in Japanese) for that info... just can&#39;t get to it at the moment.\n \nphil\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n\nI know Miki ended up being a police chief and retired to his hometown \nto raise bonsai (common hobby amongst modern cops) and chickens (not \ncommon hobby amongs modern cops)...but do we know his jurisdiction?\n\nBecause there is alot of info on the Tokyo Metropolitan Police \nDepartment (Kawaji&#39;s pet project) and prestige attached to the \ncapital police as really were retainers to the royal family.  I was \nwondering if Miki worked in a more rural area...if so he would&#39;ve \nmanaged chuzaisho (rural versions of the &quot;koban&quot;* police boxes) and \nhad to deal with the army which was more dominant in rural areas.  \nPolice in rural areas are even more *closer* to citizens too.\n\n*during the Meiji Era another term was used for koban (which meant \ndormitory) but the term &quot;koban&quot; stuck to this very day\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Take Yahoo!
