I&#39;m working on a fic that it \nwould be helpful for.  Unfortunately, the pic is just a wee bit too \nsmall for me to make out any of the writing, either on the computer \nscreen or when I print it out.\n\nIs there a larger copy of this file somewhere online?  Or would it \nbe possible for me to get a larger copy from the author?  \n\nThanks!\n\nKalli\n\n\n"
