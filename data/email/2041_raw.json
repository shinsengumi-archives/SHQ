Maybe after WW2 during the occupation the division\n&gt; had to redefine itself so that it could continue to exist.\n&gt; \n&gt; Public Security Division perhaps *transformed* into Public Security\n&gt; Investigation Agency (PSIA) officially &quot;founded&quot; in 1952?  Just an\n&gt; idea....\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/PSIA/psia-01.html\n&gt; http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/japan/koancho.htm\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n(I will not include the info in my write up...I&#39;ll just concentrate \non the more concrete stuff, concerning inspectors and working with \nthe royal family, since Fujita Goro&#39;s possible connection to the \nPublic Security Division is a rumor)\n\nI have found references to the Public Security Division in the 19th \ncentury but there role is never ever defined clearly...usually it \nappears on organizational trees as a subsection of some other \ndivision...\n\nThe most clear definition of the PSD comes from Ralph Rinalducci&#39;s \nTHE JAPANESE POLICE ESTABLISHMENT Tokyo: Obun Intereurope limited, \n1972.\n\n*very BORING book but gives details about the Imperial Guard the \nstructure of the IMperial Guard in modern times emulates the Meiji \nstructure\n\nAgain this book comes out of the 70s when many scholars flocked to \nJapan to study the police system \n\nI need to point out again that after the OCCUPATION the system \nbecame &quot;recentralized&quot; and emulated the Meiji/Taisho model a couple \nof labels changed but many things stayed the same\n\nexcerpt from &quot;Police Law Enforcment Regulations&quot; proclaimed 1954 and \nrevised continuously to this day ofcrouse\n\nArticle 38-4 the PUBLIC SAFETY section shall administer the following \nduties 1 crime prevention, 2 public safety police 3 guarding and \npatrolling 4 security in congested areas 5 traffic police\n\n***directly under the Public SAfety category is the Public Security \nDivision and Foreign Affairs section (omitted)***\n\nArticle 38.6 The PUBLIC SECURITY DIVISION shall administer the \nfollowing affairs 1. security police (excluding cases involving \nforeigners) 2 enforcement of security measures, excluding the \nguarding of congested places 3 compilation of plans to cope with \nemergencies and their execution to meet any contingency 4 affairs \nother than those mentioned in the preceding items, not under the \njurisdiction of other sections\n\n*so I guess the PSD is defined by saying that it does things other \nsections do not handle....nice and clear (^_^)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
