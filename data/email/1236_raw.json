I don&#39;t know who chooses them, though.\n\nAs for what the Japanese Emperor is known as, it&#39;s important to understand \nsomething else first-- era names bear the Emperor&#39;s reign name, but this \nonly started with Meiji. Before then, the ruling military government, such \nas the Minamoto, Ashikaga, or Tokugawa shogunates, chose the era name so \nthat it would be an auspicious one, and would change it at a whim. However, \nfor example, if one era ended on June 6th, and the next era began the next \nday, the next day would not be January 1st-- the next day would be June 7th, \nbut it would be June 7th of the first year of the new era.\n\nThat being said (phew) as far as emperors from Meiji onwards go, let&#39;s take \nthe current one (Akihito) as an example.\n\nRight now, &quot;Akihito&quot; is his personal name. However, the era name is called \n&quot;Heisei&quot;. The Japanese people, however, do NOT call him &quot;Akihito&quot;-- now, as \nit will be after his death, tehy call him the &quot;Heisei tenno&quot; (&quot;Heisei \nEmperor&quot;).\n\nSimple as that.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
