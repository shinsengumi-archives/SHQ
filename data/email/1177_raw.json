And Nagakura make a\n&gt; proposal to march toward Aizu with \n&gt; current troop strength.\n&gt; *Nagakura who considers Kondo always as his fellow,\n&gt; is offended to see Kondo, \n&gt; now became a direct vassal of Shogun of 300 koku.\n&gt; *Kondo probably thinks it would be better to recrute\n&gt; more solders and after \n&gt; training, he&#39; ll go to Aizu with them as the Supreme\n&gt; Commander.\n&gt; *So their discordant is due to different strategic\n&gt; point of view as well as \n&gt; their sentimental confrict.\n\n\nThat&#39;s pretty interesting, since in Nagakura&#39;s\n&quot;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&quot; he says explicitly that they\nparted ways because Kondo wanted to accept Nagakura\nand Harada&#39;s proposal if and only if he (Kondo) would\nbe the supreme commander and the others would have to\nbe his vassals (&quot;kerai&quot;), without mentioning anything\non this strategic point of view.\n\nI don&#39;t have the Bunkyu Roshi Shimatsuki (don&#39;t\nremember if this was the correct name...) to check\nthis info, though. The Tenmatsuki is just too\nnovelized for my liking to be considered a trustworthy\nsource of info. I prefer Shinsengumi Shimatsuki and\nIbun in this aspect.\n\n \n&gt; I have no intenion to idealize Kondo, may be he\n&gt; became little bit haughty, \n&gt; but it was a point of view of Nagakura&#39;s side.\n&gt; As I know similer condition in the history, I guesse\n&gt; what might be happened \n&gt; in a defeated army. \n\n\nPerhaps...\n\nbtw, changing the subject:\n\n1) Sesshu (Setsutsu) sumi Ikeda Kijinmaru Kunishige:\nKunishige is the name of the swordsmith. Sesshu is the\nname of the place. This is a sword forged in the Tenwa\nEra and, as of 1986, it was worth about 50,000 US\ndollars. \n\nIt is a Shinto (newer than Koto and older than\nShin-Shinto), classified as Jo-josaku (2nd highest\nclass in the aesthetical aspect) and as a Wazamono\n(4th highest class in the blade sharpness aspect).\n\nSource: &quot;Touken Youran&quot;.\n\n2) For those who like old anime, try finding an old\nanime (from the 80&#39;s) called Haguregumo, produced by\nMad House. It features the Shinsengumi. I haven&#39;t\nwatched it, but I&#39;ve seen some screenshots of it and\nit&#39;s gorgeous, mixing sumi-e and ukiyo-e to draw\nscenes and background.\n\n3) Nagakura Shinpachi has lots of interesting tales...\nthe Kashiku pleasure woman thing, the murder of Haga\nGido (Yoshimichi?), the incident where he drank too\nmuch with Saitou Hajime and Itou Kashitarou and was\nalmost condemned to death, the Ryubi no Ken incident\nwhere he got wounded below the eye, the failed attempt\nof murder of Kiyokawa Hachiro and others that were\nalready listed and/or discussed here, like the meeting\nwith Suzuki Mikisaburo. :)\n\n4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider\nSaigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also\nplenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo\nTakamori, who could have understood the plea of\nYamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed in\nEdo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were\ngood men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin side,\nas well as bad men in both, IMHO :)\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
