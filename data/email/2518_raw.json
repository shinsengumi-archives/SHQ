I&#39;m going to get the movie and look for the TV series even samurai x and peace maker, but on the web site I saw the filmogrphy and saw a long list and i don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll be buying all of those movies. Can you tell me which ones are best to get? Also where in New York do get your movies from? I&#39;m from New York myself.\nDomo for your reply on your outfit that was very creative. Now is Getsumei Seiki the TV series or is it something different. Please get back to me I get payed on Thursday and would like to buy the important stuff to me started. Domo once again and have a safe trip to Japan. I&#39;ll be going soon myself. \n\nHirotada Tokugawa &lt;patriot014@...&gt; wrote:\nJust got Getsumei Seiki vol. 7 while in New York. Will scan soon, but all I \nhave to say is WOW.\n\nKondou- Ferocious, muscular, young but not too young...utterly cool in \narmor.\nHijikata- A lot like Kondou but more handsome in his own way.\nOkita- NOT a pretty boy, for once, though he is kinda childlike.\nHarada- HUGE guy with a HUGE sword and a HUGE spear.\nMatsubara- Usually nonexistent in other depictions, this time you see him in \naction with his naginata.\nInoue- Kinda weird-looking, but he&#39;s important.\nYamazaki- NOT a ninja, for once! Seems to like playing &quot;go&quot; with Shimada.\nShimada- Like Harada, a HUGE guy with a HUGE sword. The ending of the \nIkedaya attack is at the start of the manga, and maaaaaan...\nNagakura- Perpetually smoking a Japanese-style metal pipe, even when he \nfights! Really cool sideburns, too...and he&#39;s not an uber-chibi short guy!\nSaitou- Dark, brooding type with a scar on his left cheek.\nYamanami- Looks like he&#39;s about to cry most of the time, but still rather \nhandsome.\nSasaki Tadasaburo and the Mimawarigumi-- These guys make me think we were \nright in our guess...a turf war is a HUGE factor in this volume. Oh, and why \ndo all the Mimawarigumi guys look alike, I wonder?\nThere&#39;s also an Aizu retainer named &quot;Shiba&quot; something...\n\nEach volume&#39;s cover features a key member of the Shinsengumi-- this one had \nHarada, and inside the jacket flap, has a mini-bio. Turns out his father&#39;s \nname was Nagatsugu...all this time I&#39;d guessed it&#39;d be &quot;Sa-&quot; something, like \n&quot;Saemon,&quot; which would be in keeping with sons taking characters from their \nfathers&#39; names...\n\nAnyway...I&#39;m looking forward to getting ahold of more of that and Kaze \nHikaru when I finalyl make it to Japan in a couple weeks.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nAnime inuyasha Anime manga Anime movie Anime poster Dvd anime Plotting \n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
