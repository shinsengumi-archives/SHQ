Seymour was interviewing a yakuza who serves \nas the historian for the Aizu Kotetsu, a clan in Kyoto.  Speaking of the \nfounder of the Aizu Kotetsu, Ubesaki Senkichi, and Senkichi&#39;s boss, Senhachi \n(who was from another gang; apparently the yakuza gangs would occasionally \nspawn offshoots, and the sub-gang remained loyal to the leader of the main \ngang), the yakuza historian says:\n\n&quot;In the years right before the 1868 Meiji Revolution, there was turbulance \nin the samurai class.  There was also trouble among the lower ranks of \nguardsmen.  They were losing their jobs protecting damiyo (sic), feudal \nlords, residing in Kyoto.  A gang called Shinseigumi, headed by a man named \nIsao Kondo, found itself unemployed.\n\n&quot;Isao Kondo asked the gambling boss Senhachi for employment for the \nredundant Shinseigumi men.  Though Senhachi accepted these men into his \norganization, he decided to put his favorite understudy (Senkichi) in charge \nof these newcomers.  Senkichi accepted the position and brought along three \nfriends from his youth to assist him.\n\n&quot;This reorganized gang was now called Aizu Kotetsu-kai.  Aizu, for the \nregion where the gang originated, and Kotetsu, after Senhachi&#39;s favorite \nbrand of sword.&quot;\n\n(p.72)\n\nDon&#39;t know how accurate this is, but thought I&#39;d throw it out there for \ndiscussion or further research, if anyone is interested.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
