It starts by showing other Shinsengumi\nfighting (mostly in silhouette, but their trademark\nblue-and-white uniform can be clearly seen). Then it\nshows the mostly the same scenes from the manga, but\nin color and motion of course. :) Both Saito and\nChujiro are completely drawn in, so you can see their\nfaces. I wish I had the equipment to make a\nscreenshot, but I do not. :/\n\nTatsuko\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
