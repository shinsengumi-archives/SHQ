That&#39;s cool they wanted a pic of him to be in\nthe museum...\n\n[ANNOUNCEMENT] momoiro-usagi says that I can give his/her email to\npeople whom I trust...so anyone one here who knows Japanese and\nunderstands basic sentence structure and would like to be our contact\nwith this patient person please contact me off-list we&#39;ll work out\ndetails...just explain to momoiro that you got the contact info from\n-me- because he/she is concerned about privacy and offered this option\nin this 2nd message.  Ofcourse the messages to this person can be in\nEnglish but if you know Japanese then you&#39;ll know how to write your\nsentences and use words which would be &quot;clear&quot; once the software\ntranslates.  Kind of like the often used phrased in babelfish\ntranslations of message posts which end with &quot;impoliteness it is &quot; or\n&quot;shank&quot; (what is that supposed to mean?).\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n(Actually, I can understand it on an evolutionary psychology basis,\nbut I don&#39;t think you want me to get into that here...)\n\n***can you tell us about your theory?...I wanna hear it...wouldn&#39;t it\nbe hilarious if Saitou clean his armor and set it aside and other guys\nare like &quot;I&#39;m wearing his stuff---I can&#39;t stand using Harada&#39;s stuff\nLOL&quot; yeah I&#39;m combining PMK universe with history...\n\n\n"
