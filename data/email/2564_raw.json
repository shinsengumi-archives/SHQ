I immediately \npurchased the movie, and later found that it was not in the list at SHQ \n(or in IMDB, for that matter).  After watching it, I think I know why, \nbut I will offer this review to save anyone else who might come across \nit.  I will try to avoid revealing any spoilers (not that there is much \nto reveal in the first place).\n\nThe blurb from the back cover is more plot than you get in the movie \nitself:  &quot;During the Edo period of Japan, out of fear of losing \nauthority, the Tokugawa shogunate hires the Shinsengumi to bring down \nthe Imperial Court.  However, the Satsuma clan finds out about the \nTokugawa&#39;s scheme and sends the last five Kunoichi (female ninjas) of \nHiryu Ninja Clan to spy on the Shinsengumi.  Meanwhile, an evil skeletal \ndemon is brought to life to murder the Kunoichi ninjas and destroy the \nworld.&quot;\n\nThe most important thing to this audience, I&#39;m sure, is the Shinsengumi \ncontent; I&#39;ll cover that first, as it won&#39;t take long.  The only \nrecognizable members are Hijikata and Okita.  Hijikata was played by \nHiroyuki Watanabe, who went with the tried-and-true heartless killer \napproach to the character.  He actually was on the movie poster and DVD \ncover (because he actually has a career; he was in Ringu and a variety \nof rubber-suit monster movies), but he gets about two minutes of screen \ntime.  Okita was played by the standard young, cute, heart-throb type, \nand manged to be even more wishy-washy than the Peacemaker Okita; \nobviously he was still haunted by the death of Yamanami, which he talks \nabout over and over and over.   Every other member of the Shinsengumi \nshown is a generic extra, all of whom are dumb, poor swordsmen, and \nfated to die violently.\n\nThe overall feel of the movie is amateurish; it looks like a class \nproject from a film school.  The fight choreographer obviously quit \nafter the first fight scene (which wasn&#39;t _horribly_ bad), because the \ncombat gets progressively worse as the movie runs.  I think the director \nraided a kendo school for Shinsengumi extras, as most the extras seem to \nknow at least which end of the sword to hold.  The ninja and Okita, on \nthe other hand, look like they studied swordsmanship for about five \nminutes before shooting started; my four-year-old niece can use a sword \nmore effectively and more convincingly than these people.  By the end of \nthe movie, the fight scenes were almost painful to watch.\n\nThe special effects are perfect for anyone who has ever watched Dr. Who \nand said &quot;Those effects just look a little too convincing to me.&quot;  They \nwere poorly done on some PC graphics package (maybe the Paint program \nthat comes with Windows?); the edges of the overlays were poorly \ntrimmed, the CG effects didn&#39;t mesh at all with the live film, etc.  \nGranted, this movie was made in 1997, but this was bad by 1980&#39;s BBC \nstandards.  The &quot;skeletal demon&quot; and his zombie sidekicks looked weak, \nfought poorly, and barely moved.\n\nThe writing probably took at least a half hour; there were plenty of \nplot holes you could pilot the SDF-1 through.  The ninja&#39;s dialog seemed \nto consist entirely of &quot;You go on ahead, I&#39;ll hold them here as long as \nI can&quot; and determined-looking nods, while Okita whined his way through \nall of his scenes.\n\nThe costumes are the only decent thing about the movie.  The Shinsengumi \nhave their light blue jackets, the ninja are dressed 1980&#39;s style (full \nblack costumes (though the leader has a red vest), instead of the more \nmodern fishnet and miniskirt style, ala Ninja Scroll).  The sets look \nconvincingly Tokugawa-era.\n\nThere is a little gratuitous nudity (top only).\n\nOverall, I have to say it&#39;s probably not the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen, \nbut none that are worse come immediately to mind.  I don&#39;t even think \nit&#39;s worth renting; the only reason I&#39;m keeping my copy is that it is \nperfect fodder for a Mystery Science Theater make-over.\n\nI apologize about the length of the review; thanks to anyone who \nactually read this far.\n\n    Arigatou,\n    Chuck Harris\n\n-- \nChuck Harris               &quot;You can tame a dog with food, you can tame a\nchuckjharris@...      man with money, but no one can tame a wolf\nBaka soku zan!              of Mibu!&quot;  -- Saito Hajime, Rurouni Kenshin\n\n\n\n\n"
