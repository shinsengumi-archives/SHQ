I love how he uses\nthat=\r\n fan and his snooty expresions and how he always doesn&#39;t\nunderstand why peo=\r\nple don&#39;t like him.  I think he was a misunderstood\ncharacter in NHK, all h=\r\ne wanted to do was make suggestions and do this\nand that...and no one &quot;unde=\r\nrstood&quot;  ::LOL::\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/takeda_bio.htm (by Sanada)\n\nS=\r\nhosuke Tanihara NHK Itou...forever because I think he even fits the\nhistori=\r\ncal description of Itou very well.  Something about his eyes\nreally does re=\r\nmind me of the painting of Itou. Ofcourse I know the art\nwasn&#39;t meant to be=\r\n &quot;realistic&quot; it is in fact in the traditional style\nbut something about his=\r\n soft features emphasize his scholarly-ness and\nTanihara has that &quot;high cla=\r\nss&quot; air but he was believable as a former\ndojo owner because he has such a =\r\ngreat body (that&#39;s why I was so upset\nNHK didn&#39;t have him put up a better f=\r\night before he was killed).  My\nfavorite part with Itou was when he was abl=\r\ne to revert from calm cool\ncalculating to threatening his own life in that =\r\nscene with Saitou and\nNagakura---this really demonstrates Tanihara&#39;s skill =\r\nand I belive that\nhe really carried the &quot;drama&quot; very well for the series.\nh=\r\nttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/itou_profile.htm\n\nSato Koichi NHK Serizawa Kamo=\r\n...I really liked his Mibugishiden Saitou\nbut I think he did an even much b=\r\netter job as the &quot;wild duck&quot;.  He has\na rugged sexiness and loose canon att=\r\nitude down perfect.  I also liked\nhow he -handled- Oume (^_^) and I cannot =\r\nimagine him as a businessman,\npolitician or salaryman he will ALWAYS be tha=\r\nt sake swigging Kamo.\n\nI think JO was a fascinating Saitou and frankly I wo=\r\nuld have liked to\nsee him as Meiji Era Fujita Goro (even for a few seconds)=\r\n in an\nepilogue (but I know this was not part of the special).  I found his=\r\n\nperformance in Tanuki Goten (Racoon Princess) opposite Zhang Zhiyi to\nbe a=\r\nwkward and stiff and I&#39;m not sure if it was because I had a hard\ntime seein=\r\ng &quot;Saitou&quot; as a pretty dancing prince or not.\n\n[off-topic] &quot;Saitou&quot; with cu=\r\nte hair (from a screencap of Japan&#39;s\nAcademy Awards ceremony)\nhttp://1happy=\r\nturtle.com/JO/857711.jpg\n\n[This is from Tama and I didn&#39;t ask her permissio=\r\nn if I can share this\nwith you all but I hope it is ok with her (^_^;;)]\n\nT=\r\nhis is Fujita Goro in the TV Series I once mentioned on the list a\nlong tim=\r\ne ago &quot;Karakuri Jikencho&quot; (he is the guy on the right)\nhttp://1happyturtle.=\r\ncom/makoto/1040552.jpg\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiri=\r\ntus_saitou@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;   I&#39;ve discovered the same thing with Shosuke Tan=\r\nihara and Itou. \nHonestly, I can&#39;t imagine the image of Itou Kashitarou bea=\r\nring\nanyone&#39;s face but Tanihara&#39;s for the rest of my life.\n\n\n\n\n"
