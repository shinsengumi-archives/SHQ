Thanks Black Faery for me too... The first picture \ndefinitely reminds me of RK Saitou... The second well I guess he \njust looks more menacing and psycho... I&#39;m going to need to find \nthose discs and watch that episode again.. \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;spiritus_saitou&quot; &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Some time ago, MissB made note on the messageboard of a guy who \n&gt; looked like Saitou among Raijuta&#39;s henchmen (the episode in Izu \nwhere \n&gt; we meet Yutaro --- I&#39;ve forgotten the specifics, but I think it&#39;s \n&gt; episode 20?).  Unfortunately, Black Faery never got my &quot;HELP&quot; \nemail, \n&gt; but she&#39;s come through for us after I resent the info to her last \n&gt; night.  She sent me two screenshots, which I&#39;ve put in the Photos \n&gt; section in a folder titled &quot;Saitou in Disguise.&quot;  I don&#39;t think \nMissB \n&gt; or I are crazy --- that&#39;s got to be Saitou! (Keep in mind that in \nthe \n&gt; anime, when Saitou and Kenshin meet again after 10 years at \nKaoru&#39;s \n&gt; dojo, Saitou makes a comment about how Kenshin let a fool like \n&gt; Raijuta wound him in battle... hinting at maybe he was there to \nsee \n&gt; the fight.)  What do the rest of you think, hmmm?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to put the screenshots up on my shrine site (Let&#39;s Hear \nIt \n&gt; For the Boy!) and will post a link to them on shinsengumimb.com.  \n&gt; Give me a couple days, though, okay?  :-D\n&gt; \n&gt; phil (spying on the spies... what fun!)\n\n\n"
