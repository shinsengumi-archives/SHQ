So I&#39;m a wee bit confused on some of the stuff that I&#39;ve \nread on the internet... Please take note I have NOT read the manga \nnor have finished the Anime... \n\nSo for sure I know that there are two manga releases by Nanae-san... \nOne is the &quot;Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker&quot; and the other \nis &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;. Tying the anime to the manga, I would \nthink the anime started with Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker? Since I&#39;ve \nnever seen the ending, did it just end with the first manga series \nor the second? OR did the anime start with the second manga series, \nPeacemaker Kurogane?\n\n*Possible Spoiler*\n\nThe scanlations most of us have... The three volume one, is that \nPeacemaker Kurogane or Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker? I was talking to \nan acquaintance back in Singapore and she kept going on and on, on \nhow unhappy she was that Okita is slowly but surely getting sick. To \nthose who have read both manga series, does the second one mention \nthis at all?\n\nI&#39;m not a fan of manga (have not even read past volume 3 of RK) so \nplease can someone tell me since, I haven&#39;t read this at all. Thank \nyou!\n\n\n"
