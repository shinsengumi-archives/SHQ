Apparently Choshu, through \nSatsuma, dealt with a British arms dealer named Thomas Blake Glover. \n\nChoshu bought 4300 Minies and 3000 Gewehrs in October of 1865. Each \nMinie cost 18 ryo and each Gewehr was about 5 ryo. The total bill \ncame to 92,000 ryo!  \n\nIt also gives the original name of the gunboat Otchu-maru that Ryoma \ncommanded during the battle near Oshima-gun. It used to be the USS \nUnion of the (what else?) Union army. I did a search on the boat and \nall I&#39;ve been able to learn about her so far is that she was used to \nstop Confederate blockade runners and therefore unlikely to have seen \nany major action during our Civil War. \n\nThe boat cost the Choshu 37,000 ryo. The conservatives tried to get \nKatsura to settle for a 60 horsepower vessel, but he stubbornly held \nout for a 120 horsepower ship. (This would have been a steam engine \nof course.)\n\nThere&#39;s a lot more here about Nagasaki at the time and Ishin leaders \nand is in English. \n\nhttp://www.uwvsh.edu/home_pages/faculty_staff/earns/meiji.html\n\nI did some checking but could not find any gun called a &quot;Gewehr&quot; from \nthat time period. They do appear on searches from a slightly later \ndate. I assume that these could have been some sort of proto-type for \nthe later guns. Mauser, a German gunmaker, made the ones that I could \nfind info on:\n\nhttp://www.mauserguns.com/mauserHistory.asp \n\nAs far as the Minie rifles are concerned my guess is since they were \ndealing with a British arms merchant they would have most likely \nbought the Enfield Rifle Musket, which  was not only the most popular \nweapon of the time with British soilders but saw a great deal of \naction during the American Civil War. For further info on it go to \nthis site:\n\nhttp://www.nps.gov/anti/rifles.htm\n\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n\n"
