However, for the sake of clarification, I was\nhoping y=\r\nou could help address a bit of a discrepancy I&#39;ve found.\n\nI&#39;m looking at pa=\r\nge 26 of Kikuchi Akira&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi 101 no Nazo&quot;,\nand the death records o=\r\nf Soji at the family temple are quoted directly:\n\n&quot;Kenkouinjinmyoudou-koji.=\r\n Died last day of the 5th month. 2nd son of\nOkita Rintarou.&quot;\n\n(The first, r=\r\nather long word is his funerary name)\n\nYou&#39;ve said that he was listed as &quot;t=\r\nhe 2nd son of Okita Rintaro\nGenji&quot;-- as cited on Mori, p. 10. I don&#39;t doubt=\r\n the possibility of\nanother Okita Rintaro-- and in this case, the name that=\r\n you&#39;re reading\nas &quot;Genji&quot; is probably &quot;Motoharu&quot;, which, with one characte=\r\nr being the\nsame as &quot;Mototsune&quot;, would indeed suggest a common family backg=\r\nround\nwith Rintaro Mototsune. However, I can find no mention of an &quot;Okita\nR=\r\nintaro Genji&quot; in this text, so I was hoping that you could possibly\npoint t=\r\no a website where this name is mentioned.\n\nAlso, I can find no mention of &quot;=\r\nOkita Rintaro Genji&quot; when it comes to\nthe adoption of Rintaro Mototsune. Ri=\r\nntaro Mototsune is listed in\nShinchogumi records as &quot;Son of the late Okita =\r\nKatsujiro, retainer of\nLord Abe Noto no Kami&quot;. (Kikuchi, p. 26) As Soji was=\r\n still underage,\nRintaro Mototsune was adopted into the family, as was comm=\r\non custom\namong families in such a predicament, in order to carry on the fa=\r\nmily\nname. It seems improbable, though not impossible, that there was\nanoth=\r\ner Okita Rintarou that was adopted, and who adopted Rintarou\nMototsune. Kik=\r\nuchi&#39;s reference is the actual Okita family record, and\nso, you can see my =\r\nconfusion with your statement.\n\nAs such, I was hoping that you could possib=\r\nly help me out with regards\nthis.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n\n"
