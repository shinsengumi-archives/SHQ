And it dried with a\nsolar light.\nIt was beautiful as it ironned.\n \nThis talk is the episode which shows that Saitou was very clean.\nSamurai does not leave shame, after he dies. For them, the greatest\nshame has an unsightly body.\nSaitou is a really splendid samurai. \n\nSaitou is popular also in Japan.\nI like him to the 2nd in the member of Shinsengumi.\nBy the way, did you see the &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; movie?\nThe actor who was playing Saitou on that movie is playing Serizawa\nKamo in this drama.\nSimilarly, the actor who was playing Okita on that movie is performing\nYamanami in this drama.\nIt is very interesting if the 4th story is seen in consideration of it.\n \nIncidentally, the picture of Saitou of the top of the site is not him.\nThe picture makes Saitou&#39;s son (Fujita Tsutomu)&#39;s photograph the model.\nThe picture is in Aizu&#39;s Byakkotai memorial hall.\nThe memorial hall wanted to decorate with Saitou&#39;s photograph there.\nHowever, the photograph was not able to be got.\n(It was not in the Fujita family which is Saitou&#39;s posterity, either. )\nThen, Saitou&#39;s son&#39;s photograph was offered.\n\n****(secretarytocapt3)  momoiro-usagi is referring the pic seen\n&quot;everywhere&quot; on the internet...this is NOT the group photo.  I read on\nother Japanese sites that the photo/charcoal drawing was based on his\nGRANDson...but momoiro-usagi knows his/her stuff\n\n\n"
