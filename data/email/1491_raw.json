Does anyone here have any \ninformation/sites/sources where she can learn about it?  Many \nthanks, from her and me, in advance!\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n\nAbout the information which you are looking for, I seldom have \ninformation. \nCustom changes considerably with areas. \nFurthermore, although the class system of the Edo period was \nabolished in 1871, the vestiges existed. \n(Custom changed considerably with classes to which people of the Edo \nperiod belong.) \n\nhttp://www.osoushiki-plaza.com/institut/dw/199010.html\n\nhttp://www.tabiken.com/history/doc/K/K278C100.HTM\n\nIt seems that a customary change started many in the middle of Meiji \nEra. \n(Probably, I think that it is about Meiji 30 years.)\nI think that it seldom changes to the custom of the Edo period \naround Meiji 10. \n\nPeople wore the white kimono as a mourning dress till the middle of \nMeiji Era. \nThe present mourning dress is black.\nThis imitated Occidental custom and the Imperial Household began it \nin Meiji 30. \nNow, if I wear white dress and attend a funeral, I will be scolded \ncertainly. \nIncidentally, this custom has a difference at the time which changed \nin the city section and the locality section. \nIt is a talk in the city section that people&#39;s mourning dress \nchanged in the middle of Meiji Era. \nThere is a place which wore the white mourning dress till the time \nof the beginning of Showa Era locally. \n\nMoreover, people were holding the ceremony of &quot;Tamayobi&quot; till the \nmiddle of Meiji. \nThis was the ceremony which calls back a soul in this world, and \nwhen someone died, it was performed. \nIn order to revive the dead, the people with the duty of Tamayobi \nclimb a roof and call the dead&#39;s name. \nOr they look at the bottom of a well and call the dead&#39;s name. \nIf I perform this now, I will be taken to the police.^^;;; \n\nIt is the year of the beginning of Meiji that the company which \nholds a funeral was founded. \nAnd this is the talk of the city section. \nThe group which helps ceremonial occasions in a village was made \nlocally, and it helped each other to each other. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
