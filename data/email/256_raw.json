Did you see the film at some\n&gt; festival or university\n&gt; archive?  I really want to see a dramatized version\n&gt; of Ito Affair\n&gt; (&quot;Mibugishiden&quot; and &quot;Band of Assasins&quot;-starring\n&gt; Mifune doesn&#39;t really\n&gt; go into detail as much as I&#39;d like them to).  So\n&gt; does the Intrepid\n&gt; Captain of the Shinsengumi depict Saitou? \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
