Does one interpret this to mean that they\n&gt;were granted Samurai status (at least those who weren&#39;t already), or\n&gt;was this simply and official notice that thier actions were directly\n&gt;sanctioned by the Shogun?\n\nNo....that&#39;s not really it. You can&#39;t really talk about &quot;samurai status&quot; as \na hard and fast rule. In many domains, you had to buy the right of bearing \nswords, but by the 1860s, just the fact that you could have people from ANY \nstatus join a group like Shinsengumi and carry swords, without (barring \nknowledge to the contrary) needing to buy &quot;samurai&quot; status, shows that just \nby joining Shinsengumi and carrying swords, one could have de facto samurai \n&quot;status&quot;. The issue of sword-carrying and name-bearing is a problematic one, \nand yes, even despite the image of four airtight classes, there is no \nironclad rule, and there are a lot of exceptions. But I&#39;m getting off-topic \nhere, so I&#39;ll continue with a definition of &quot;bakushin-toritate&quot;.\n\nBakushin-toritate roughly rendered, means &quot;Conferring of the status of \nShogunal retainers&quot;. Shogunal *sanction* they already had-- why else would \nthey be included in the myriad of samurai who guarded the rivers that the \nShogun traversed to get to Kyoto in the early period? (1863-ish-- this is in \na map Hijikata drew, and included in a letter) Bakushin-toritate means that \nthey were now shogunal retainers, just like anyone else who was born into \nthat status (e.g. hatamoto like Takenaka Shigekata, and any of the myriad \ngokenin).\n\nIt was that status of Tokugawa retainer that allowed, for instance, Kondou \nIsami to meet face-to-face with someone like Nagai Naoyuki, who was a \nhigh-ranking hatamoto (senior Tokugawa retainer). Nagai started out as \nKondou&#39;s senior in terms of rank, back in early &#39;63, but by late 1867, \nfollowing the aforementioned bakushin-toritate, he could meet with Nagai \nface to face. Nagai, a man  born into a daimyo family and adopted by a \nhigh-ranking hatamoto, who had been involved with supervising naval training \nin Nagasaki, commanding one of the Shogunate&#39;s first Western-style warships, \nand was a wakadoshiyori (junior councilor) and at one time (during \nMatsudaira Katamori&#39;s, and later Kondou&#39;s, arrival in Kyoto) city magistrate \nof Kyoto, was most definitely WAY above Kondou in terms of birth status. \nHowever, thanks to this promotion, they were essentially equals in rank.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
