(who discovered Kai \nShimada&#39;s journal)\n&gt; Just before the lecture, the=\r\nre was introduction of some direct \ndescendants of \n&gt; Shinsengumi related p=\r\nerson attending the ceremony and the lecture, \nlike \n&gt; posterity of Mitsu O=\r\nkita, Hajime Saito, and Takeaki Enomoto.\n&gt; At this time, Mr,Fujita( Goro Fu=\r\njita&#39;s descendant indeed) said, &quot;I \nfound a \n&gt; photo of Hajime, and I&#39;ve gi=\r\nven a copy of it to Shinjinbutsu Ourai \nPublisher( \n&gt; famous publisher of m=\r\nany Shinsengumi books and organizer of the \nceremony).&quot;\n&gt; Appearently, Mr.F=\r\nujita didn&#39;t give detailed info any more, however \nthe author \n&gt; of the jou=\r\nrnal wondering if it meant a new photo of Hajime Saitou, \nother than \n&gt; tha=\r\nt unique photo of him ever known. \n&gt; \n&gt; Does it mean we could see an unknow=\r\nn photo of Saito soon?\n&gt; We can wait for the sequel.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A3=D4=A3=E1=A3=\r\n=ED=A3=E1\n\n\nSeeing the information from Tama san, momoiro carried out such =\r\na \nmisapprehension. \n&quot;At last, does the Metropolitan Police Department exhi=\r\nbit secret \ndata?&quot; \n.......It was different though it was regrettable. \n\nBu=\r\nt this seems to be large discovery. \nAccording to the information of the pe=\r\nrson who participated in this \nlecture meeting, it is the photograph of the=\r\n Fujita Gorou&#39;s second \nson&#39;s marriage ceremony. \nSince marriage of Fujita =\r\nGorou&#39;s second son (Tsuyoshi) is Taisho 3 \n(1914), Fujita Gorou is 71 years=\r\n old. \nProbably, I think that he will be the old man of sharp eyes. \n\nAltho=\r\nugh some Fujita Gorou&#39;s photographs existed, they have burned \nwith the ear=\r\nthquake disaster etc. \nIt seems that the Metropolitan Police Department has=\r\n his photograph \naccording to the rumor. However, it is a state secret and,=\r\n generally \nis not exhibited. \n(There is the rumor. There is an opinion tha=\r\nt he is related to \nestablishment of the public security division. Although=\r\n the \nMetropolitan Police Department has his detailed curriculum vitae, it =\r\n\ndoes not open to the public.)\n\nFurthermore, the misapprehension of momoiro=\r\nm in the information from \nTama san. ^^;;;\nSince it had written that the po=\r\nsterity of Enomoto Takeaki came to \nthe lecture meeting, I thought that Ish=\r\niguro Ken (The actor who is \nperforming Katsura Kogorou in the Taiga drama)=\r\n came. \nIn practice, he is someone else. (momoiro no obakasan.)\nThe actor w=\r\nho is performing Katsura Kogorou in the Taiga drama is \nEnomoto Takeaki&#39;s p=\r\nosterity. It is said that his mother&#39;s ancestor \nis Enomoto Takeaki. When t=\r\nhe cast of &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; was decided, it \nbecame news slightly among fans.=\r\n \n\nhttp://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/bakumatu/enomoto.html\nEnomoto T=\r\nakeaki\n\nhttp://www.ken-ishiguro.com/fr_main.html\nIshiguro Ken\n\nAre they ali=\r\nke? ^^;;;\n\n\n\nWhat was found by chance a while ago although the relation was=\r\n the \ntalk which is not. \n\nhttp://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/MPNames.=\r\nhtml#T\n\nAsteroid Shinsengumi is a registration number 5815. ^^\n\nmomoiro-usa=\r\ngi\n\n\n"
