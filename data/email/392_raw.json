I&#39;ve been \nwatching the last few episodes of the NHK Shinsengumi (un subtitled \n*sigh*) and I came into it when Kondou was trying to get in with the \nRoshigumi that was forming to  head to Kyoto.\n\nA bit ago I was looking at the characters&#39; pictures on the NHK website \ntrying to figure out who this kid is that Nagakura keeps having words \nwith, and while clicking through the name banners to find said kid I \nclicked on the pic of the actor playing  Sasaki Tadasaburo and the \nproverbial light bulb went off over my head, \n\nHe&#39;s one of the two main leaders of the Roshigumi! He and Serizawa Kamo \nhave a serious dislike for one another and he and the other top guy in \nthe Roshigumi (names escapes me) are always at odds.\n\nAccording to the previews at the end of last week&#39;s show Saitou finally \nhits Kyoto so maybe we&#39;ll see the connection?  I will do my best to \ndecipher something from the body language/facial expressions.\n\n\nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
