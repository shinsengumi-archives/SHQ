Do you know if its \ncurrently in any museum? \n&gt; During the later Edo period a lot of swords emerged that had very \nlittle curvature like Saitou&#39;s katana. I read on one Japanese site \nthat the use of shinai had an influence on the decrease in \ncurvature. \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you by chance have a site that has the kanji for the maker&#39;s \nname on Miki&#39;s katana? I have a small hunch that the name has \nsomething to do with the way it was made. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: secretary \n&gt;   To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, June 17, 2004 6:18 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [SHQ] Re: Miki+Saitou&#39;s Sword\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   For people unfamiliar with the obsession over historical \nSaitou&#39;s sword\n&gt;   {please cut and paste...yahoo messes up long link/addresses)\n&gt;   http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.\n&gt;   showMessage?topicID=1.topic\n&gt; \n&gt;   [doing some guessing here...]\n&gt;   http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~ikkaku/138saito.htm\n&gt;   &quot;Ikeda Kijinnmaru Kunishige made on Tennna 2nd,70cm length&quot;\n&gt;   says that kunishige/kunisige part of the sword&#39;s name is the in \nfact\n&gt;   the maker&#39;s name\n&gt; \n&gt;   https://www.topart.co.jp/cgi-local/cargo/goodsprev.cgi?gno=43379\n&gt;   ikeda seems to be the name of a place according to this \nsite...and the\n&gt;   sword was made in Edo\n&gt; \n&gt;   *we all followed, with great interest, stories of Okita&#39;s \nsword...but\n&gt;   I also recall that Saitou&#39;s sword was also an &quot;antique&quot;...(sigh) \njust\n&gt;   can&#39;t find the right link...upon reviewing sites which sell\n&gt;   reproductions of Saitou&#39;s sword I noticed that the blade is quiet\n&gt;   straight compared to other Japanese swords I&#39;ve seen on the\n&gt;   net...ofcourse each smith has a distinct style and stuff...but\n&gt;   straight edge perfect for those real life gatotsu-like thrusts\n&gt; \n&gt;   secretarytocapt3 still imagining that conversation Saitou and \nMiki\n&gt;   must have had about their swords possibly being of the \nsame/similar\n&gt;   make and model or from the same smith...they would totally chat \nit up\n&gt;   and then Hijikata (clears throat)...&quot;excuse me guys we&#39;re trying \nto\n&gt;   have a meeting here&quot;\n&gt;   *and what kind of sword smith names his work &quot;demon&quot;...@_@\n&gt;   *modern parallel is probably guys obsessed with cars...\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;   &gt; babelfish of Saitou&#39;s sword is Demon circular Kunisige Ikeda \n&gt;   &gt; Miki&#39;s sword is &quot;three tree Saburo demon circular Kunisige&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
