And, it was inconsistent in its presentation... some things just barely touched upon, then huge segments on something specific (anyone familiar with the Shimabara arc in RK, they go into detail about what happened there to set up the story in the anime, \n&gt;\n&gt;Actually the &quot;Real&quot; shimabara rebellion took place in 1637--38 so maybe \n&gt;they didn&#39;t mean *the* last battle.. I have no clue  ......\n\nSorry... that didn&#39;t come out right.  :-D   What I meant was that the program goes into the 17th century situation in Shimabara, which is the background for what takes place there in the RK Shimabara arc.  NOT that they were describing an incident in 1878, which as far as I know was pure fiction (and not even from the manga).\n \nphil\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
