This is currently being considered by the\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation legal staff.  The photos were not\ntaken by the newspaper.    However, I can send to you information on\nthe Wakamatsu site that is included in the state registry program.&quot;\n\nthings to keep in mind are...California is suffering a state deficit\nand -maybe- that is why these items have taken so long to go through\nthe preservation and recording process.  The California State Park\nreceived these items in 2001[!] and the museum which will in the\nfuture house the items is a very very small museum in the middle of a\nnature preserve complete with park rangers (this is based on a\nassumption that there are hiking trails etc).  Sadly, the individuals\nI contacted were not able to divulge even if the sword&#39;s tang bears\nany identifying feature such as the maker&#39;s name.  I also asked what\n-kind- of bowl is in possession of the park.  My other question was\nthe dimension of the white silk banner. \n\nI thought I would get the photos by now (basically I was expecting\nlike a brochure/pamphlet thing which museums print---wasn&#39;t looking\nfor anything fancy)...as the person even requested my mailing address.\n\nSo in conclusion...as of this moment we have nothing (-_-)\nHopefully, in the future, such educational facilities such as museums\nwill be able to address the enthusiasm the public may have for items\nin their possession.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This based on a post at http://www.shinsengumimb.com\n&gt; MissB found some intriguing info for us regarding Aizu settlers in \n&gt; California in 1869.  I have grabbed the pdf file and placed it in \n&gt; the &quot;Files&quot; section for future reference.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the meantime if you have Adobe Acrobat...\n&gt; www.parks.ca.gov/pages/712/files/wakamatsu.pdf\n\n\n"
