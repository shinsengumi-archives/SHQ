There is still some organization to be done, so I ask that files not be posted into the files sections yet, but I extend a very warm and big invitation for as many people here to join so we can continue our fun.  The address is http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/ .  When you join, in addition to the usual yahoo greeting, you&#39;ll get a second message that contains the submission template for fiction (still working on art) and list rules/guidelines.  That document is also available in the folder &quot;List Business&quot; in the Files section.\n \nPlease remember, you can set your membership preferences to receive no mail and check out fiction from the list site if you don&#39;t want it cluttering your mailbox.  See?  That means you have no excuse not to join.  :-)  Take a place around the table --- someone is bound to pour you a cup of sake --- and enjoy the stories that will be told, the pictures that will be passed around.\n\npachi (formerly known as phil before she got this new, really cool haori)\n\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail - More reliable, more storage, less spam\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
