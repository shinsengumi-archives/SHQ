However, given what you have\n&gt; said regarding Souji&#39;s formal nam=\r\ne being read &quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;, it may make\n&gt; better logical sense for this man&#39;s=\r\n name to be read &quot;Kanemasa&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for the additional information,=\r\n as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; -M.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
