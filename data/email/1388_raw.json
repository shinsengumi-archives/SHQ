It says: A promoter*: Matsumoto Ryoojun, Nakakura\n(Nagakura), and Saitoo\nIt means that Saitoo was also concerned with erecting this monument.\nIn short, Saitoo, at least, kept company with Nagakura Shinpachi in\nthe Meiji era.\n(secretarytocapt3 thinks...*promoter=contributed some money no doubt)\n\n*various possibilities regarding SAitou&#39;s timeline from Nagarayema to\nAizu...MIss B this is where I read about the transport of injured\nsoldiers etc\n\n*the possibility of Saitou as having a &quot;sweet and beautiful voice&quot;\n@_@ and the woman who recalled this remembered a bearded man (who has\ntime to shave during a war)...she incorrectly estimated his age (a\nnote to the guys out there--facial hair makes you look older) but he\ncalled himself Yamaguchi &quot;something&quot; (he would have gone by Yamaguchi\nJiro at this point)\n\n*A man named Torii Kason interviewed Shimada Kai...Torii Kason learned\nof Fujita Goro&#39;s address from Shimada Kai...Shimada Kai was in touch\nwith guys like Nakajima Nobori...\n\n*However, according to the letter which Kondoo Hoosuke wrote to\nTakahashi Masatsugu in 1906 (Meiji 39), it seems that he exchanged\nletters with Saitoo.\n\nNow that should get some of interested in these translations ^_^\nkeep in mind that the person who translated spells people&#39;s names\ndifferent e.g. Toudou Hosuke for instance or Saitoo...\n\n\n"
