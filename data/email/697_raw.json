I have\ntwo possible designs for Saitou, but don&#39;t know which, if either.  I\ntake it that the one used by...uh... &quot;sec&quot; on the message board is the\none he used as Fujita?  Just out of curiosity, where did that image\ncome from and are we sure it&#39;s the design he used?  (I thought I\nremembered a post either here or the mb about accessing images of\nmon... where did it go??)\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil (currently overhauling one of my sites... finally)\n&gt; P.S.  secretarytocapt3, you can delete the senna pics.  I&#39;m going to\ntake down the entry and repost when we get things cleared up with our\nisp.  The anniversary is passed and the need less urgent.
