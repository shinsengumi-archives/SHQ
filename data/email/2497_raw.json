Some of you may already know this, but . . . \n\nThere is a manga series published by Shonen Jump called Gintama; it \nis an extremely strange mix of aliens and the bakufu. O.o The \nShinsengumi do have a part, but some have slightly different names (I \nknow for a fact that Okita Souji has become Okita Sogo). They first \nappear in chapter 5 (Hijikata, Okita, and a mention of Yamazaki). \nMore of an appearance in chapter 6 (Okita, Hijikata, and a few random \nmembers). Beyond that, I have no clue. ^^; From what I can tell, \nthere are even some wackified Ishin Shishi. \nScanlations are at http://stoptazmo.com/gintama\nThere is also an online read of chapter one only at \nhttp://www.readmanga.com\n\nIn either volume 5 or 6 of Negima (another manga), there is a mention \nof the Shinsengumi, plus one of the characters dresses in a variation \nof their uniform. The translation notes in the back made a mistake \nthough; they seem to have mixed the Shinsengumi up with the Ishin \nShishi.\n\nFor those who rather &quot;decode&quot; kanji bit-by-bit rather than try to \nunderstand an online translator, there is a site that translates one \n(or sometimes a few) kanji at a time, also giving multiple meanings. \nI don&#39;t have the link for the translating page, but it should be easy \nto find. A warning though; sometimes the translator interpretes it \ndifferently that you&#39;d expect (&quot;Tennen Rishin Ryuu/Style&quot; \nbecomes &quot;Nature Riku Style&quot;). But, given the names of certain people, \nit will also spit out their birth and death dates. =3\nhttp://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdic.html\n\nAnd finally, for those who have an interest in older history, there \nis a book called Taiko, mainly about Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It shows the \nrelationships between lord and retainer, between lords of different \nprovinces, etc; basically the feel of the time period. In relation to \nthe Shinsengumi (sort-of . . . ), the book details the downfalls of \nthe Imagawa and the Takeda clans, both of which the Inoue family \nserved at that time.\n\n--Jia-xin\n\n\n\n\n"
