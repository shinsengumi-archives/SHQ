To lighten up the situation Kondou prods Hijikata \ninto singing some popular song of the day while he (Kondou) and Inoue \nGenzaboru do some dance. Nagakura and Harada join in the dance too \n(Harada taking yet another chance to show of his fundoshi--bright yellow \nthis time). I&#39;m guessing it was a popular song of the day because two of \nthe little kamuro girls in attendance wit their mistress sang along with \npart of it.\n\nAnyway, that boy can sing!!! It&#39;s a catchy little tune too, I just wish \nthe darn vcr was working properly to have taped it.\n\nIn other events, Yamanami, Todou and Saitou & Okita were in charge in \nsigning up new recruits. One guy was a total boob and Todou knocked him \nout with a small tap tot eh head. The next guy that came took Saitou on \n_Barehanded_ and won!!!!! Saitou was crushed and quickly went off to \nsulk alone. Apparently the boob knows the hand to hand combat guy which \nwould explain his lack of sword skills if he&#39;s also a judo specialist.\n\nForgive me for not being able to name them as they spoke so fast and I \ndon&#39;t have subtitles here since I get the show on satellite direct from \nNHK..\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
