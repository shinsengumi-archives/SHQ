Yamakawa Kenjiro notes that at this point, it was under the \ncommand of Yamaguchi Jiro-- also known as Saitou Hajime. While this briefly \nrepelled the Imperial army, the local population betrayed the Allied armies \nof the north and forced them to retreat. Chief among these traitors was the \nvillage headman of Shirasaka Village, named Odaira Hachiro, who had guided \nthe Imperial forces in this battle.\n\nEnter Aizu retainer Tanabe Gunji. In 1868, Tanabe Gunji was young-- 18 years \nof age. He survived the war and went, together with other Aizu samurai, to \nexile in Tonami, in the far north of the main Japanese island of Honshu. \nDuring his exile he heard of what this Odaira Hachiro had done. Unable to \nleave matters at that, he slipped out of Tonami, and after a month on the \nroad, arrived in Shirakawa.\n\nIn a scene that must have been quite horrific, Gunji found Hachiro and \nkilled him. After doing so, he immediately committed suicide. (His grave is \nto be found in the cemetery for Aizu samurai at Matsunami, in Shirakawa \nCity) (see http://baragaki.fc2web.com/aizukanjinbutsu/jintanabe.htm for a \nbrief biography of Tanabe)\n\nThis begs the question......if the village headman in question was the \nheadman of Shirasaka....could he have heard of the betrayal from Saitou \nHajime, who had been at Shirasaka and was in Tonami at the same time that \nGunji was?\n\nThough we may never know for sure, it&#39;s certainly worth some consideration.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
