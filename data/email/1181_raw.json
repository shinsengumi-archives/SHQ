Thus, the government did its part in public \nrelations to demonize him.\n\nWe all bring certain sensitivities to our study but people who have \npublished works forget a key element to the big picture---politics \nis always a dirty game no matter how well-intentioned the person was \nto start with and Saigo was involved with politics.  For example the \nincident of the weapons seizure at Kagoshima as well as the build up \nof potentially rebellious elements in the schools within the Satsuma \ndomain have been wildly interpreted...most opinions are extreme as \nto whether it is fair to blame Saigo.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Serizawa Kamo &lt;serizawakamo@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; 4) Masayoshi, no offense intended, but I consider\n&gt; Saigo Takamori a hero too :) The Ishin side has also\n&gt; plenty of good and worthy man. Weren&#39;t for Saigo\n&gt; Takamori, who could have understood the plea of\n&gt; Yamaoka Tesshu / Katsu Kaishu and avoided bloodshed in\n&gt; Edo? That&#39;s just one example to show that there were\n&gt; good men in the Shogunate side and in the Ishin side,\n&gt; as well as bad men in both, IMHO :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New and Improved Yahoo!
