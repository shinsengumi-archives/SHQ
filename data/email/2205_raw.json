He wants us to know hi=\r\ns story.  Maybe even especially us &quot;barbarians.&quot;  (Okay, so he chose a bunc=\r\nh of Shinsengumi fans to get it done... he&#39;s got the connections.)\n \nAs soo=\r\nn as I can get the thing uploaded into some usable space, I&#39;ll post a URL f=\r\nor the whole page so the caption can be read/translated.  The book itself i=\r\ns not easy to translate --- Tama and another man in Japan are both having d=\r\nifficulty reading the text as it&#39;s in such an old form.  I know the little =\r\nboy is Kawajirou, Sagara&#39;s son, and I&#39;m betting that one of the ladies (pro=\r\nbably the one seated) is Kimura Hama, Sagara&#39;s sister.  (At least, I hope i=\r\nt is.)  The man standing next to the monument in an image I uploaded yester=\r\nday is the grandson, Kimura Kametarou, when he was 28 --- just a year or tw=\r\no shy of his grandfather&#39;s age when he was executed --- and I think M manag=\r\ned to piece out that the picture was taken in April of Taisho 5.  Both his =\r\nmother and father were Kojima, so I expect he probably favors the family.  =\r\nI wish we could see the mon on his sleeve.  It&#39;s probably too much to think=\r\n he might&#39;ve worn a Kojima or Sagara mon in honor of being at the monument =\r\nin April.\n \nAlso, a comment about the fan that&#39;s in that previous image... =\r\nthat&#39;s Sagara&#39;s handwriting on the fan and it&#39;s a poem.  The fan and Sagara=\r\n&#39;s bloody topknot were sent to Kawajirou, who kept them hidden away.  Not s=\r\nure *who* sent the items to the boy, but it was either at Sagara&#39;s request =\r\nor the government sent them.  A very generous gentleman in Japan not associ=\r\nated with this list (at least I don&#39;t think he is) is going to be contactin=\r\ng the Folklore Museum in Shimosuwa to see if they can provide him with the =\r\ntext on the fan.  I&#39;m deeply touched he would do that.\n \nTo say I am extrem=\r\nely emotional after this is an understatement, but to everyone who has been=\r\n helping in this quest --- you&#39;re the greatest!!\n \nphil\n\nsecretary &lt;secreta=\r\nrytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/SSgrouppic.jp=\r\ng\n\nPhil need not thank me....it&#39;s her good luck I was able to get the \nbook=\r\n.\n\nThe image above is cropped because I used the maximum resolution as \na t=\r\nrade off...Phil has the entire photo to add to her collection.\n\n\n\t\t\n-------=\r\n--------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n The all-new My Yahoo! =96 What w=\r\nill yours do?\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
