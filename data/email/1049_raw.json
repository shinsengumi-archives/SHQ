Especially those who lived on the bases where the higher ups themselves would come around and inspect the housing of it&#39;s personnel. Anyway, it&#39;s a common complaint that the husbands become so used to the order and discipline of the military that when they come home they actually give their houses the &quot;white glove&quot; inspection.\n\nCan you imagine Saito doing that to Tokio?!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
