I&#39;m willing to setup an ftp server and keep my PC up \nmost of the time when I get my dsl back up again, although my upload \nspeed to you will only be 20kb because eventhough they say I have \nmuch more in reality I only get that. (Don&#39;t ask me why... Phones \ncompanies.. -_-) I would put up an http server but I never learned \nhow to... Maybe in two months or so I&#39;d learn how but no time right \nnow to set up http... Let me know what you guys think.\n\n\n"
