Right now am lurking for t=\r\nhe basic, first by Shisengumi and now am at lurking for Hijikata and Sauji.=\r\nThe first one well am been impress for what I had seen am not discarting ch=\r\necking out for his hometown and key places. Um, I was wondering what do you=\r\n study?\n\nsherlgirl &lt;sherlgirl@...&gt; wrote:I was wondering, other =\r\nthan Masayoshi (and Phil?),  how many of you on this list are doing targete=\r\nd research on particular regions/hans during the end of the Edo era?   \n\nAl=\r\nso, for those of you who lurk -- what are you dying to get your hands on th=\r\nat you think other Shinsengumi fans on this list are interested in?  I have=\r\n insane cultural refs - like hairstyle books for the era, a 400 page book o=\r\nn wagashi, Kyoto historical landmarks refs,  Shinsengumi manga galore, but =\r\nno idea how to prioritize what to tackle next (other than what I must retur=\r\nn to the library by such and such time) and then how to extract and distrib=\r\nute content.    \n\nAlthough, I am currently committed to finishing up some w=\r\nork on Katsura Kogoro&#39;s influences (yes, the &#39;other side&#39;) that might take =\r\nme through the summer, I do have other things that I am willing to try to p=\r\nush along if any of you doing your own work can benefit extensively from it=\r\n. \n\nAlso, I might as well just say that with Tama&#39;s help -- I managed to ge=\r\nt copies of the  Burai manga in duplicate. (As well as a few other lesser k=\r\nnown Shinsengumi manga.)   I would be more than happy to work with someone =\r\nreliable and work and getting the contents scanned if someone is willing to=\r\n do the raw translations.    If any of you have any contacts or are very in=\r\nterested yourself, please let me know.   \n\nThanks!\nS\nPS: Got the Watsuki sh=\r\nijitaki for the new Shinsengumi game. *dies*   Okita rules!   \nPPS:  I note=\r\nd the LJ community disappeared? Any plans to officially throw in support fo=\r\nr one of the other ones?  Or to restart?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------=\r\n-----------\nYahoo!
