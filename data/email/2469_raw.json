It is going to take \nforever to get caught up on the posts(sigh).  However, I have found \nthe time to post a few screen captures from the NHK drama at the &#39;Spy \nDivision&#39;.  And yes, they are a little Saito-centric....but it think \nthat will please several of the members.\n\nDid anyone else order a copy of Hillsborough&#39;s new book?  Has anyone \nelse had their shipment delayed? Again!  And here I thought it would \nbe waiting for me upon my return to civilization.  @#$^%!\n\n**stalks off to corner in disgust**\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Unfortunately, EZ-Board got hacked into and major damage done.  \n*All* of the messageboards supported there were damaged, some \ncompletely unrecoverable.  Secretary may have more up to date \ninformation about what they were doing to restore boards, but I think \nthey&#39;ve done all they could with back-ups that weren&#39;t damaged.  In \ntrying to better safeguard the system and repair it, I think they did \nsome additional damage, too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Cool idea with the reviews.  Best place to send them is to this \nlist, SHQ.  The Spy Division is more for member and other fan fiction \nand art.  ^_^\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; niwashi_1 &lt;labaker@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I found the Shinsengumi Headquarters message board\n&gt; http://p076.ezboard.com/bshinsengumiheadquarters\n&gt; not too long ago - just long enough to see that it had a bunch of \n&gt; interesting stuff posted there.  Unfortunately, before I had time \nto \n&gt; go through and read all that interesting stuff, it started \n&gt; disappearing.  At first it was just some of the posts missing, then \n&gt; all of the posts and many of the forums disappeared.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s going on???  And is it going to get fixed?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On a marginally related note, I recently bought the first volume of \n&gt; each of several different Shinsengumi manga.  I was thinking of \n&gt; writing up a little first-impression mini-review of each of them \nand \n&gt; posting it on the messageboard (if it were still there).  I guess \nI&#39;ll \n&gt; post to the Yahoo group instead (although I generally like message \n&gt; boards better than e-mail lists).  Is the SHQ group or the \n&gt; SHQ_Spy_Division group the better one to send reviews to?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Niwashi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
