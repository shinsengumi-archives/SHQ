I missed the beginning of the film, so I&#39;m not sure of all the connections... if this Kojima was meant to be from the family associated with Kondou.  I have the film recorded; just been lazy about spending time with it.  With all the initial Mito connections, though, it&#39;s becoming curiouser and curiouser to me about exactly who Sagara&#39;s family were and if he possibly had *any* association with the early group that became the Shinsengumi.  I&#39;m tired and I&#39;ve got so much searching to do... sigh.\n \n&gt;&gt;Anyways the same director, Kihachi Okamoto also does comedies such as Kiru! (Kill!) and Red Lion (which I have not seen). &lt;&lt;\n \nI haven&#39;t seen &quot;Red Lion&quot; either, but Sagara and the Sekihoutai are in it  (in a very minor role, I&#39;ve read).\n \n&gt;&gt;Kiru! pokes fun at the 7 bungling samurai&lt;&lt;\n \nThis one I&#39;ve seen (it&#39;s been shown on IFC) and it&#39;s a delight!\n \n&gt;&gt;Ryunosuke is just &quot;misunderstood&quot;...he isn&#39;t ~that~ evil...&lt;&lt;\n \nYeah, sure... :-D  The guy&#39;s exactly as his father said he was.  Saitou must&#39;ve been on patrol that night.  Now, if *he* had been at that party... shorter film.\n \nphil\nP.S.  And Barb, thanks for the release info on &quot;Zatoichi.&quot;  It might make it to Phoenix for about a week.  The problem is I don&#39;t have anyone to take me halfway across town where it&#39;ll show up... boooo...\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun.
