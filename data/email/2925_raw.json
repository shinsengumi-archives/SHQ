(In \n&gt;1876=\r\n, Yugorou married Isami&#39;s daughter, became the fifth master of \n&gt;the Tennen=\r\n Rishin-ryu, and changed his name to Kondou Yuugorou.)\n&gt;\n\nThanks for all th=\r\ne info - as you can tell, I&#39;m really interested in \nall the adopting that w=\r\nas going on.  I&#39;ve been asking all my \nquestions using Kondou and Okita as =\r\nexamples.  Yes, Yugorou became \nIsami&#39;s heir, but I guess what I really wan=\r\nt to know is - *what if* \nIsami had adopted an heir.  Would that person hav=\r\ne to go through \nthree adoptions (Miyagawa, Shimazaki, Kondou) to finally b=\r\necome \nKondou?  And why? (Since Isami had to become a Shimazaki before a \nK=\r\nondou.) \n\nIf anyone knows of a book or someplace online where there is some=\r\n \nexplanation of adoptions during this time, feel free to direct me \nbefore=\r\n I potentially drive everyone crazy with questions.  :)\n\n\n\n--Wanda\n    (Tha=\r\nnking everyone for their patience.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Se=\r\nven&quot; &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, Isami&#39;s nephew Miyagawa Yugorou became=\r\n his heir.

Yoshijirou cou=\r\nld \nalso be the head of the \n&gt; family after Souji and before Souji&#39;s son. M=\r\ny guess is relevantly \nbased on the Okita family \n&gt; history through four ge=\r\nnerations.    \n&gt; \n&gt; Ten years after Rintarou Kanemasa&#39;s death, Yoshijirou d=\r\nied in 1895, \nat age 43 (by East \n&gt; Asian age reckoning.) His grave is next=\r\n to Souji&#39;s, by the way. \nYoshijirou&#39;s heir/eldest son \n&gt; Juji (sp?) died i=\r\nn 1910, at age 23 (by East Asian age reckoning.) \nAfter Juji&#39;s death, his \n=\r\n&gt; younger brother became the head of the Okita family.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Souji had star=\r\nted a branch family, is that considered a separate\n&gt; &gt;family altogether, or=\r\n does that put Rintaro and his family in an\n&gt; &gt;inferior position within Sou=\r\nji&#39;s family?\n&gt; It&#39;s considered a branch family that doesn&#39;t put Rintaro and=\r\n his \nfamily in an\n&gt; inferior position within Souji&#39;s family (I think...)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zhusanna&quot; &lt;wsehome@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and he t=\r\nook the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;name Kondou when he became the 3rd master of the Tennen Rishi=\r\nn-\nryu \n&gt; &gt; &gt;in 1830. Therefore, Kondou Isami was first adopted as a \nShima=\r\nzaki \n&gt; &gt; &gt;before he took the name Kondou sometime after 1858.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, wait.....if Kondou Isami had adopted an heir, this heir=\r\n would \n&gt; &gt; have to be adopted first as a Miyagawa, then as a Shimazaki, th=\r\nen \nas \n&gt; &gt; a Kondou??  How much time had to pass between adoptions?  Didn&#39;=\r\nt \nall \n&gt; &gt; this adopting get confusing?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou co=\r\nuld have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;birth (but that&#39;s n=\r\not the point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served \nas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the head of the Oki=\r\nta family for a short time (possibly less \nthan a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;year) before Rintar=\r\nou Kanamasa became the head of the family. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was onl=\r\ny going to remain as the head of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;family until Souji got married. =\r\n Had Souji lived longer, \nRintarou \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s son Yoshijirou would pr=\r\nobably have become Souji&#39;s \nheir \n&gt; &gt; &gt;and would likely have married Souji&#39;=\r\ns eldest daughter.) I \nsuppose \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if S=\r\nouji&#39;s son married \nRintarou \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s daughter instead.  However, c=\r\nonsidering that Souji&#39;s \nson \n&gt; &gt; &gt;would&#39;ve been quite a few years younger =\r\nthan Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this would&#39;=\r\nve been the case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If Rintaro Kanamasa was only &quot;h=\r\nolding&quot; the heir position for \nSouji \n&gt; &gt; until he got married, why wouldn&#39;=\r\nt Souji&#39;s son (if he had had \none) be \n&gt; &gt; Souji&#39;s heir?  What would Rintar=\r\no&#39;s son have to do with anything \n&gt; &gt; now?  Because Rintaro was holding tha=\r\nt position, did that make \nSouji \n&gt; &gt; obligated to him?  Couldn&#39;t Souji hav=\r\ne done whatever he wanted \nsince \n&gt; &gt; he would be head of the family?\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Souji can start &quot;Bunke&quot;, a branch family of Okita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Souj=\r\ni received Bakushin status in 1967 so his Okita line could \nbe \n&gt; &gt; &gt;higher=\r\n than Rintaro&#39;s Okita line.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If Souji had started a branch fam=\r\nily, is that considered a \nseparate \n&gt; &gt; family altogether, or does that pu=\r\nt Rintaro and his family in an \n&gt; &gt; inferior position within Souji&#39;s family=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Wanda\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
