It s=\r\ntarted out as a manga, and the\n&gt; first story arc was made into an anime. It=\r\n follows a \n&gt; boy named Musashi (written with the kanji for 3, 6,\n&gt; and 4) =\r\nfrom his birth until young adulthood, as he\n&gt; learns kendo and tries to bec=\r\nome the top kendo\n&gt; practitioner in Japan. \n&gt; \n&gt; There is one flashback sce=\r\nne (to the Showa era) in\n&gt; which a swordsman named Yamamoto Chujiro is prac=\r\nticing\n&gt; tsuki (thrust) on an empty can hung by a string. One\n&gt; day, an old=\r\n man tries to do it. The can doesn&#39;t even\n&gt; move, so Yamamoto thinks he mis=\r\nsed. But when Yamamoto\n&gt; takes a second look at the can...he sees that the =\r\nold\n&gt; man had pierced a hole in the can without even moving\n&gt; it. It turns =\r\nout that the old man was none other than\n&gt; Saitou Hajime himself. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\ns for whether this has anything to do with the real\n&gt; historical Saitou, I =\r\ndoubt it, but I was amused to\n&gt; find yet another reference to him in a mang=\r\na or anime\n&gt; I&#39;ve read/seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tatsuko\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Tiffany &lt;makoto@s...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt; There was a post on\n&gt; &gt; www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/patio/patio.=\r\ncgi\n&gt; &gt; The title of the post is &quot;Anecdote of Late Year?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is =\r\nthe babelfish translation...telling of an\n&gt; &gt; old Saito Hajime\n&gt; &gt; appearin=\r\ng in an anime...(Usual warning about\n&gt; &gt; babelfish)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;It meaning th=\r\nat name of Saito one appears in the\n&gt; &gt; kendo cartoon,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;sword of 634&quot;, =\r\nit does.\n&gt; &gt; As a story of former times, the alone boy being\n&gt; &gt; Kawahara, =\r\nwhen you\n&gt; &gt; practice kendo, the old person coming, you say that\n&gt; &gt; try do=\r\ning the\n&gt; &gt; bamboo sword.\n&gt; &gt; It was less crowded in the string and hung th=\r\ne can,\n&gt; &gt; practiced\n&gt; &gt; piercing, but aiming for that can, the old person\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; extended the bamboo\n&gt; &gt; sword.\n&gt; &gt; But, the can does not move jerkily.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; When the boy tries seeing, you say that the hole\n&gt; &gt; opened in the can.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; You say that with the bamboo sword, the can was\n&gt; &gt; carried out.\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhat was Saito one of late year.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With it meaning that the anecdote =\r\nwhich is said is\n&gt; &gt; riding, it does,\n&gt; &gt; but is this how probably what?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; The =82=A4 - the =82=DE, you question, it\n&gt; &gt; becomes.\n&gt; &gt; Penetrating th=\r\ne being less crowded can which was\n&gt; &gt; hung to the string\n&gt; &gt; with the bamb=\r\noo sword how, being possible?\n&gt; &gt; As an anecdote of Saito one, such a story=\r\n it has\n&gt; &gt; been effective?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a reply to the post along t=\r\nhe lines that\n&gt; &gt; it is uncertain\n&gt; &gt; whether or not this story was associa=\r\nted with\n&gt; &gt; historical S.H.
