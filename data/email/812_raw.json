(like a friend or\nsomething) Because the second shows them &quot;an act of kindness&quot; in\nending their suffering after cutting open their stomach. Have you read\nor heard anything similar? \n\n[secretarytocapt3]\nyes, I read the same thing before in several books...if a friend is a\nsecond then he will do a &quot;good&quot; job and understand not to hesitate or\nwaver at the critical moment a secondary idea is that the person\ncommitting suicide will not attach any ill feelings to the\nsecond...basically everyone knows their role.\n\n&quot;Okita Souji&quot;\n&gt; For women, i&#39;ve read that seppuku is a bit different and involves\nsevering the arteries in the neck. \n\n[secretarytocapt3]\nin terms of killing women...I never read about the artery thing...all\nI read was that if a man was going to execute a woman there was some\nattention paid as to how she &quot;falls&quot;.  If she is kneeling...the\nexecutioner will cut her in a way that she falls either forward on her\nface or backward (I can&#39;t recall which is the right/wrong way).\n\nbut we all gotta remember that the etiquette for stuff like this can\nchange dramatically over the years...but I&#39;ve never found like an\nessay written on the topic...these details are mentioned here and\nthere in history books.\n\n\n"
