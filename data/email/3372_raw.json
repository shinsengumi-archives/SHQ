Visited Sakamoto Ryoma and Nakaoka \nShintaro&#39;s grave (and added a pebble to the collection), and Kido \nTakayoshi&#39;s (Kouin) grave as well. Also visited the bakumatsu museum \nnearby, but was sort of underwhelmed. It did have Kondo Isami&#39;s \nchainmail and the sword that Saigo Takamori used to kill himself, but \nbeyond that, there wasn&#39;t a lot to see. Also, there was a painting of \nKondo Isami&#39;s severed head by a Choshu samurai who painted it while \nit was sitting exposed by Sanjo bridge. Kondo didn&#39;t look too happy \nabout his fate.\n\n\n\n                           \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nYou rock.
