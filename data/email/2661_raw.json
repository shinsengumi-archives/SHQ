I have most of the characters and scenes \njotted =\r\ndown but I need a bit of help. I need a detailed timeline of \nthe battles b=\r\netween them, which has been hard for me to find.(I am \nconsidering writting=\r\n some of the novel, and it&#39;s sequel if I make one, \nin diary form, thus the=\r\n very very important need for a timeline.) \n\nAlso I need information on the=\r\n 4th-9th Captains. (I&#39;ve got a fairly \ngood idea of how I am going to write=\r\n Souji, Toshizou, Sanosuke, \nShinpachi, Saitou, and Kondou.) \n\nAnd last of =\r\nall, I need an opinion on whether I should start the novel \nin the Edo Baku=\r\nfu or Bakumatsu. The novel, or novels, will last until \nthe beggining of th=\r\ne Meiji Era. Thanks for the help. If you are \nintrested in reading the nove=\r\nl, which I hope to have finished before \nNov. 2007, then look for &#39;Makoto: =\r\nWolf in Maiden&#39;s Clothing&#39; by S. C. \nFaith or Serenity Christin Faith.\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"
