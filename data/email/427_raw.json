So, what you&#39;re \nsaying is that it was done on a regular basis in the past, right?  In \nother words, this would be something of a regular chore for Saitou \neven doing what he was doing in RK?\n\nphil (getting too curious... again)\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jon Mesina&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; That ball is actually filled with a powder called uchiko.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uchiko removes all the old oil and debris from a blade. It&#39;s made \nby taking a polishing stones and grinding them up. This process \nshouldn&#39;t be done too often on blades since it&#39;ll dull the polish and \nmar the details in the metal. Course in the old days this didn&#39;t \nmatter as the upkeep as a weapon mattered more than perservation as a \npiece of art.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Check this link for images. \n&gt; http://johndswordpolishing.com/swordaccessories/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: spiritus_saitou \n&gt;   To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, April 15, 2004 5:56 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [SHQ] Stupid question about sword care\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   In so many samurai movies I see swordsmen caring for their swords \nby \n&gt;   applying *something* with a *puff-ball* type thing.
