Well, there are=\r\n hundreds of Shinsengumi books and many\nfictional works have inspired resea=\r\nrch into the history. Some books\nfocus on one figure for instance.  Just go=\r\n to\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiNames.htm\n\nhighlight, copy and =\r\npaste the name you want into google.co.jp and add\n&quot;ISBN&quot; and you will find =\r\nbooks about the specific Shinsengumi figure.\n Then take that number and plu=\r\ng it into amazon.co.jp to find the book,\nread reviews.  You may also search=\r\n Japanese blogs and read fan reviews\ntoo once you get the book title.\n\nTher=\r\ne is also commentary that Akama Shizuko (a very old well respected\nShinseng=\r\numi researcher best known for her research into Saitou Hajime)\nwrites HISTO=\r\nRICAL FICTION.\n\nThis is partly true. \nHowever, making sweeping generalizati=\r\nons does ***damage*** her\nreputation.  \n\nInformation on her books has been =\r\nrecorded here for over a year(s).  I\njust bolded &quot;fiction&quot; vs &quot;non-fiction&quot;=\r\n for clarification today\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\n\nSin=\r\nce I don&#39;t know Japanese, how do I know which book is fiction or\nnon-fictio=\r\nn?\n\nSimple, I used Worldcat which has a database of Japanese books to note\n=\r\nits category and also read several blogs which reviewed her work (to\nconfir=\r\nm Worldcat&#39;s category).  If you visit major Shinsengumi sites\nwhich focus o=\r\nn history you will note how highly regarded her work is\n(her facts are care=\r\nfully quoted)...she by the way interviewed people\nnot just used texts, her =\r\nresearch was dynamic and very detail\noriented, from newspapers to public re=\r\ncords, you name it.\n\nThus, Akama, DID DO SERIOUS history research and put h=\r\ner OWN\nSPECULATION into novel form---in a totally [separate] work---not mix=\r\ned\nin with her serious work. \n\nPlease take care in posting information on w=\r\nebsites, especially in\nthis case.  Akama did stick to the golden rule and w=\r\nent through alot\nto bring details on Saitou to light (many of those details=\r\n can be\ninterpreted in a negative way).  Even though Akama is also a fan, s=\r\nhe\ndid her job as a historian as well.\n\nSo which book is the best?  We don&#39;=\r\nt know.  \n\nSHQ is using alot of English language texts and we have no probl=\r\nem in\nputting conflicting information side by side.  Examples can be found\n=\r\nhere on the still in progress timeline.\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/Shinse=\r\nngumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm\n\nNotice how we are going to try to get every sin=\r\ngle account we can\nfind.  We can&#39;t rely on one book because each historical=\r\n figure was in\na different place and interacted with different people. So t=\r\nhere are\n&quot;piecs&quot; of information everywhere.\n-------------------------------=\r\n--------\nEven *more* Shinsengumi cosplay photos\ncontributed by wolverinesg7=\r\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.htm\n\n(all we need now is a Shinsengum=\r\ni themed piercing my friends) (^_^)\n\nKondou Isami &quot;whoa, that tattoo is as =\r\nbadass as the skull on the back\nof my black training gi&quot;\n\nHijikata ::nods i=\r\nn agreement::\n\nSaitou &quot;it&#39;s a good tattoo, but not as good as MINE&quot; ::Saito=\r\nu whips\noff shirt to reveal his back::\n\nHijikata &quot;nice chrysanthemum flower=\r\ns there&quot;\n\nSaitou &quot;no they are cherry blossoms---can&#39;t you tell?&quot;\n\nHijikata =\r\n&quot;clearly -chrysanthemums- Saitou&quot;\n\nKondou &quot;cool carp there too&quot;\n\nSaitou &quot;Ca=\r\nrp?
