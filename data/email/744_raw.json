So here I&#39;m...\nHonestly Barbara, I share your opinion about Okubo and Omura. It seems to me that they have &#39;melt&#39; Okubo in Omura.\nPersonally I didn&#39;t like the movie, and I a disagree with many things in it, but then again, you need to twist history a bit when you are doing a film, or otherwise it might bee too gory, too boring (or not... some periods were really a rollcoaster) and even too unbelievable (sometimes reality surpasses fiction). Look at the &#39;The Alamo&#39; movie...\nI thought immediately about the Seinan wars and Saigo. it&#39;s almost the same time period, a similar conflict, and Saigo also died committing seppuku according to popular belief, though the circumstances were different. He also was kept in high esteem by general public and his popularity was so great that the Meiji government had to grant him a posthumous pardon. In fact, he is even enshrined... Some details of the movie fitted too well into this picture, especially concerning the characters, to be merely fiction, though you can say it&#39;s a story loosely based on real events, and as such, you cannot say it is &#39;real&#39; in the depiction of events.\nI like the ending of the last battle scene though, it had an emotive touch, and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what would have felt Algren at this point, when the respect of the victor over the defeated is so painfully obvious, and in such stark contrast with his experiences fighting the Indians. \n \n \n----- Original Message ----- \n  From:   Barbara Sheridan \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 8:45 AM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re The Last Samurai   (Possible Spoilers)\n  \n\nI _still_ wish the Saitou-like Ujio (Katsumoto&#39;s &quot;right   hand man&quot; would \nhave said something like  &quot;If you did not make us   take up arms with the \nChoshu we wouldn&#39;t be in this   mess.&quot;\n\n&gt;&lt;Sorry, Barb... I just couldn&#39;t feel sorry for Meiji even   knowing he was stuck between a rock and a hard place)&gt;&gt;\n&gt;    \n&gt;\nNo need to apologize to me I think Meiji was a total doofus. and I   think \nthe actor who portrayed him did a fine job in showing that (however,   his \nlast bit at the end was SO unbelievable to me). I found a copy of the   \nscript for the film online through www.simplyscripts.com and iI cannot   \nbelieve they cut this second bit out when Katsumoto goes to see the   \nEmperor---\n\nEMPEROR\n(subtitles)\nI am a living God as long as I   do\nwhat they think is right.\n\nKATSUMOTO\n(subtitles)\nYour   Highness, forgive me for\nsaying what a teacher must, **but\nsuch a   statement is pathetic\ndrivel not worthy of an ignorant\nstable boy, let   alone a young man\nI know to have some modest\nintelligence.**\n\nBit   of trivia that surprised me---I automatically equated the Omura \ncharacter   with Okubo but there was in fact an Omura who was the War   \nMinister.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit   \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour   companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n                Yahoo!
