The custom does not exist now.\nWhen I was a child, I heard the talk of the custom. And I regarded \nit as very strange.\nIn old Japan, a child becomes 1 years old on the next day, after \nbeing born. And a new year comes on January 1 and the child becomes \n2 years old. After that, a child grows older on January 1 every \nyear. That is, all Japanese grew old on January 1. \n(The child born at the end of December suffers troubles. He is born \nand becomes 2 years old immediately.)\n\nIt is meaningless to tell old Japanese &quot;happy birthday&quot;. They did \nnot regard the day as important. \nHijikata&#39;s birthday is on May 5. However, probably, he did not \ncelebrate the day.\nAs for Okita, record of a birthday does not remain. \nAlthough Saitou probably celebrated the new year, he has not \ncelebrated the day as his birthday. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
