Since I finally got that Burai \nTeaser scanlation and the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker. It&#39;s in the \nmanga section. There&#39;s another manga named Bakumatsu that I added but \nI don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about.\n\nNOTE: I&#39;m probably going to un-host the jdrama section from about \nright now before I go to sleep and will put it back up sometime in \nthe afternoon. The only reason for this is I&#39;d like to prioritize \nthose people first who wants to download manga since it&#39;s smaller \npieces and faster to download. \n\n\n"
