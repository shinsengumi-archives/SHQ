(In other words,=\r\n I listed all the \nShinsengumi books on my book shelf, except the only Engl=\r\nish one -  &quot;Shinsengumi: The \nShogun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps&quot; by Hillsborough.=\r\n) \n\nI&#39;ve always been interested in Aizu but since there&#39;s been an increasin=\r\ng interest in Okita&#39;s \nlife, I&#39;ve started buying books on him last year. An=\r\nyways, in regard of the date of the Aizu \nClan&#39;s surrender, I&#39;ve read it wa=\r\ns Nov 6 1868 from &quot;Shinsengumi Encyclopedia,&quot; p.122. \n(http://www.amazon.co=\r\n.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4122035414/qid=3D1150232731/sr=3D1-1/\nref=3Dsr_1_2_1/5=\r\n03-8662209-2817527)\n\nI&#39;ll give you the other sources later. (When I started=\r\n reading about the Shinsengumi, I had \nno idea that I&#39;d be so interested in=\r\n the subject for such a long time so I didn&#39;t list the \nauthor or the page =\r\n# in my notes.

There are books in English and Japa=\r\nnese on \n&gt; Aizu.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, you listed 20 Okita books as sources (all =\r\nof which were \n&gt; added to the Okita page \n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Ok=\r\nitaSoujiro.htm)\n&gt; \n&gt; all you have to do is &quot;....fact...&quot; (author last name,=\r\n page #)\n&gt; \n&gt; this is very easy for you to do since you are reading Japanes=\r\ne\n&gt; \n&gt; this was to help people who can afford to buy only 1 book (not all \n=\r\n&gt; 20 of the books you have)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nl=\r\nf7@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree with you 100%!  (I&#39;ve never implied that the Ai=\r\nzu forces \n&gt; were defeated on Oct\n&gt; &gt; 8 1868.
