T=\r\nherefore, Kondou Isami was first adopted as a Shimazaki \n&gt;before he took th=\r\ne name Kondou sometime after 1858.  \n&gt; \n\n\n\nSo, wait.....if Kondou Isami had=\r\n adopted an heir, this heir would \nhave to be adopted first as a Miyagawa, =\r\nthen as a Shimazaki, then as \na Kondou??  How much time had to pass between=\r\n adoptions?  Didn&#39;t all \nthis adopting get confusing?\n\n\n\n&gt; Katsujirou could=\r\n have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s \n&gt;birth (but that&#39;s not the =\r\npoint here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as \n&gt;the head of the Okita family fo=\r\nr a short time (possibly less than a \n&gt;year) before Rintarou Kanamasa becam=\r\ne the head of the family. \n&gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as =\r\nthe head of the \n&gt;family until Souji got married.  Had Souji lived longer, =\r\nRintarou \n&gt;Kanamasa&#39;s son Yoshijirou would probably have become Souji&#39;s hei=\r\nr \n&gt;and would likely have married Souji&#39;s eldest daughter.) I suppose \n&gt; th=\r\nat it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou \n&gt;Kanamasa&#39;s=\r\n daughter instead.  However, considering that Souji&#39;s son \n&gt;would&#39;ve been q=\r\nuite a few years younger than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s \n&gt;youngest daughter, I do=\r\nn&#39;t think this would&#39;ve been the case.\n&gt; \n\n\n\nIf Rintaro Kanamasa was only &quot;=\r\nholding&quot; the heir position for Souji \nuntil he got married, why wouldn&#39;t So=\r\nuji&#39;s son (if he had had one) be \nSouji&#39;s heir?  What would Rintaro&#39;s son h=\r\nave to do with anything \nnow?  Because Rintaro was holding that position, d=\r\nid that make Souji \nobligated to him?  Couldn&#39;t Souji have done whatever he=\r\n wanted since \nhe would be head of the family?\n\n\n\n&gt;Souji can start &quot;Bunke&quot;,=\r\n a branch family of Okita.\n&gt;Souji received Bakushin status in 1967 so his O=\r\nkita line could be \n&gt;higher than Rintaro&#39;s Okita line.\n\n\nIf Souji had start=\r\ned a branch family, is that considered a separate \nfamily altogether, or do=\r\nes that put Rintaro and his family in an \ninferior position within Souji&#39;s =\r\nfamily?\n\n\n--Wanda\n\n\n\n\n\n"
