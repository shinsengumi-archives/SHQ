Warning to Hijikata fans, this film contains a\n  very unflattering portrayal.  Kev&#39;s pdf file which has the excerpt\n  from the novel reveals that a tiny but significant part was cut from\n  the movie involving Hijikata.  You just have to compare the 2 versions. \n\n  Based on Momoiro&#39;s post about Grampa Nagakura...\n  If you were grandson/daughter who would you choose to spend your\n  Sundays with\n\n  a) Grampa Nagakura Shinpachi...every now and then during the movie\n  he&#39;ll ask you what the heck is going on in the plot (his memory/vision\n  aren&#39;t so good anymore)...its either the same movie over and over\n  again or the same story about the Shinsengumi over and over\n  again...you choose your own form of torture ^_^\n\n  b) Grampa Nakajima Nobori (who died young so he probably didn&#39;t even\n  see his grandkids)...who will have you repotting/fertilizing his\n  beloved plant collection [or] look after his firearms store (it&#39;s\n  never too early to have kids learn how to run an arms business)...on\n  the bright side you may get drawing lessons...be prepared to use lots\n  of red paint\n\n  c) Grampa Saitou...after a cup/saucer of sake maybe he&#39;ll tell you how\n  to deal with criminals who don&#39;t &quot;cooperate&quot;...and neat little tricks\n  for covert operations/espionage missions...heck if Grandmother Tokio\n  isn&#39;t around maybe you&#39;ll get a special tour of the museum after hours\n  using the special set of keys he duplicated so long ago...but without\n  the sake he just does the laundry and doesn&#39;t say much...\n\n  d) Grampa Miki who will instill in you a deep hatred for surviving\n  members of the Shinsengumi *especially* for that Nagakura who got away\n  (grrrrr) Nagakura probably said &quot;go after Saitou or should I say\n  Fujita Goro&quot;...then you&#39;ll have to put up with his -alternate- history\n  involving Sagara\n\n  e) or how about the guy who converted to Christianity...church church\n  and Sunday school (he probably won&#39;t get any votes)\n\n  f) Grampa Shimada Kai...frequent trips to the candy store ^_^\n\n  In the series Hatchobori 7...the officers use a neat little weapon\n  which is shaped like a &quot;U&quot; but with one leg of the &quot;U&quot; much longer\n  than the other...it basically looks like a weird fish hook with a red\n  tassle.  I&#39;ve seen much bigger versions as a Chinese weapon...the\n  officers use it to catch/hook swords and slash at criminals so I&#39;m\n  assuming it was designed to be non-lethal as Aoyama keeps saying to\n  catch criminals alive...the officers carry it in their waistband like\n  a sword.  It is a pretty small weapon too as the officers have to get\n  very very close to their opponents.\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bsher213&quot; &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; The Sword of Doom a/k/athe movie Miss B and I Always come into too\n  &gt; late when it&#39;s on tv is now available for buying!
