I thought I had seen it before, but maybe it was something else I saw.  This documentary seems much better.  Anyway, the program is &quot;Samurai&quot; and includes commentary by our friend Romulus Hillsborough and by Karl Friday (among others).  It&#39;s showing again later this afternoon on my cable system (4PM MST & PST).  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s also available for purchase on the History Channel website.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t tape it.\n \nAgain, it&#39;s nothing most of us here don&#39;t already know, but the 30 minutes I&#39;ve seen have been amazing with lots of old photographs of samurai and Japanese culture and very well organized --- much better than the PBS documentary.\n \nJust checked the History Channel site:\nhttp://store.aetv.com/html/search/index.jhtml?search=Samurai\nI&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the program &quot;The Samurai&quot; from History Matters.\n \nUh oh... Perry just arrived in Edo Bay!\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo!
