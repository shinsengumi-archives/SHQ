However, the fact of the matter, as we know, is that \nShinsengumi, as an organization, survived until mid-1869, when its last \nsurvivors, under the nominal command of Soma Kazue, surrendered together \nwith Nagai Genba-no-Kami Naoyuki&#39;s forces at Benten Daiba, in Hakodate.\n\nOne of the &quot;forgotten&quot; elements of this ignored history is Saitou Hajime&#39;s \nperiod in command of the Shinsengumi, during the Aizu Theater of the Boshin \nWar.\n\nBy the latter part of the 8th month of Meiji 1, Aizu was surrounded, and the \nmonth-long siege had begun. At this time, the former Shogunate army under \nOtori Keisuke abandoned Aizu, heading for Sendai. This force could have been \nput to good use in defending Aizu, however, its commander considered \nwithdrawal the better course of action. Despite this, the fact remains that \nby doing so he probably did as much to hasten Aizu&#39;s fall as Itagaki \nTaisuke&#39;s lightning-strike through Bonari Pass did.\n\nWhen Saitou Hajime heard of Otori&#39;s army having left Aizu, he spoke, and \nspoke harshly. For a man of little words, the following ones, as recorded in \nthe diary of Taniguchi Shirobei, a Kuwana-han retainer turned Shinsengumi \nsamurai (picture is here: \nhttp://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin3/sirobei.jpg), are \npowerful. Remember, Saitou and the Shinsengumi had just fought a long and \nbrutal battle at Bonari Pass in order to defend the people of Aizu, and had \nbarely managed to escape with their lives. Listen to what the taciturn \nwarrior has to say about Otori&#39;s army:\n\n&quot;If they are really our allies, then they should come back to Aizu and \nhelp-- and then we wouldn&#39;t have to see the castle about to fall like this. \nFor our so-called comrades to run like this is unjust!&quot;\n\n(cited from: Ito Tetsuya, &quot;Saitou Hajime Nenfu&quot;. pp. 223-243 of &quot;Saitou \nHajime no Subete&quot;. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 2003, p. 236)\n\nThe fall of the castle was still a month away, but in many people&#39;s eyes the \nfate of Aizu was already sealed...\n\nDefinitely words to think about.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
