But when I typed \nin &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; I got pages and pages of our favorite swordsmen \ngroup....It looks like that even though the Ishin Shishi won the war, \nit&#39;s the Shinsengumi that would be remembered, despite the belief \nthat &quot;the victors write the history&quot;. Talk about ironic...The \nShinsengumi at least won the media war.\n--A-chan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
