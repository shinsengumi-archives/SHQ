I&#39;d really appreciate it because of I&#39;m writing this \n&gt;fanfic where in my main antagonist going to be under Sasaki \n&gt;Tadasaburo&#39;s leadership.&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\nSasaki comes across to me as a guy who has some definite ideas of \nexactly how he wants things done and when. Sort of the type to say &quot;When \nI say &#39;Jump!&#39; you ask how high.&quot;\n\n&gt;By the way this may sound odd (you might be thinking I should know \n&gt;this but I don&#39;t), who is the Roshigumi? &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nThey were the group of 200 or so samurai who joined up to go to Kyoto to \nhelp the Shogunate quell the unrest/violence. The one backing/paying \nthem I believe was a Matsudaira can&#39;t-remember-just-now (not Katamori, \nhis father or grandfather)\n\nKiyokawa, the guy Sasaki is always pissed at just last week on the show \ntried to slip past everyone in the rules and regulations that they are \nnot working for the Shogunate but &quot;supporting the Emperor&quot; i.e.siding \nwith the Choshu rebels. The bookish/smarmy Yamanami has caught this bit \nof fine print and went to Sasaki with it and that&#39;s pretty much where it \nleft off. The synopsis for this week says:\n\n&lt;&lt;Since Hachiro Kiyokawaï¿½s plan to make Roshigumi serve for the Imperial \nCourt, instead of the Shogunate is revealed, the leaders of Roshigumi, \nincluding Tadasaburo Sasaki decides to take the members back to Edo. \n........ Keisuke Yamanami brings news that Roshigumi will be sent back \nto Edo. Toshizo Hijikata suggests Isami to form another Roshigumi group \nto stay in Kyoto. &gt;&gt;\n\nYou can read this synopses at the link below:\nhttp://www.nhk-jn.co.jp/wp/best_e.htm\n\nThere&#39;s a cool little side story where the daughter of the Yagi&#39;s (where \nKondou & Kamo&#39;s groups are staying has to disguise herself as a boy so \nas not to draw attention from the miscreants invading their home. Kondou \n& Hijikata come upon her and apparently make comments about her being \npretty puny to wield a sword. They mention the Tennen Rishin style and \nI&#39;m guessing they said &quot;We&#39;ll teach it to you and make a man out of \nyou!&quot; The poor girl runs crying to her mother the minute the guys walk \naway. It was hilarious to see the girl&#39;s look of terror as they&#39;re \nlifting her arms,squeezing her muscles, adjusting the sword she&#39;s \ncarrying in her belt.\n\n&lt;&lt;I really envy that you get to see this NHK drama... Over here in the \nmidwest, absolutely NOTHING. :O(&gt;&gt;\n\n\nI dropped the local cable service and signed up for Dish Network \nsatellite because they offer TV Japan for an additional $25 a month. Of \ncourse it&#39;s not like I&#39;m obsessed or anything..................\n\n\nBarb Sheridan\n\n\n\n"
