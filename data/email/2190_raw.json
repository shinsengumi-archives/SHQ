Photos of \nthe fire and earthquake disasters in Tokyo and drawings of \nuniforms,medals, hats and western style sabres.  Interestingly, \nthere seems to be a couple of drawings of what looked \nlike &quot;Rokumeikan&quot; scenes....hmmm I figure police officials attended \nthose dances as well.  As you guys know from my previous posts the \nTMPD had guys in the Imperial Guard which escorted members of the \nroyal family from point A to point B.  There were plenty of \nentourage photos.  Many of the drawings we&#39;ve seen are 100% accurate \ndown to the uniforms of the security on horseback.  The book even \nincluded a side by side comparison of hand drawings and photos.  The \ndrawings were able to show alot of detail compared to the grainy \nphotos. One interesting photo of a cop trying to hold back dozens of \nrioters I think.  Lots of stuff on the different buildings and \nheadquarters.  Humorous drawing of a cop shining a light on a group \nof people.  Some people were &quot;evil&quot;, they had smirking animal-like \nfaces, while some were &quot;good&quot;, they were 100% human.\n\nSerious Business Stuff....\nGIRLS OF THE SHINSENGUMI FANART CONTEST\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/contest.htm\n\n\n\n\n"
