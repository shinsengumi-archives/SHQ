That&#39;s why Tatsuo didn&#39;t know his real parents were \nFujita until \n&gt; he became teenager.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nYes I think Tatsuo&#39;s discovery of this actually made him bitter and \nangry. There was a discussion about this a few months ago but back \nthen it was agreed that Tatsuo was adopted INTO the Fujita \nhousehold.. But back then it didn&#39;t make sense to me because he \nwasn&#39;t in the record and his last name was different than FUjita.\n\nwounds\n\n\n"
