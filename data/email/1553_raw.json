I *think* that \na link through a university library webpage will allow unlimited searches.\nSome dissertations require a fee for example $27 some are FREE PDF \ndownloads ^_^\n[WARNING] enter in &quot;Meiji&quot; or related terms and you&#39;ll get DOZENS of \ndissertations.  Based on something I found the other night I understand that a \nJapanese student in the USA DID write a thesis on the Shinsengumi.  \nHowever I could not find his or her work...it may have been an M.A. paper and \nso it is not on this database :(\n-----------------------------------\nThis article IS NOT Free :( but I skimmed the first couple of pages and it is \nfascinating...I did chat with an SHQ member about how Aizu is considered to \nbe &quot;underdeveloped&quot; for various reasons...this article addresses that issue \nand how the lack of development has turned Aizu into a center for cultural/\nhistorical nostalgia.\n\nPolitics of furusato in Aizu, Japan: Local identities and metropolitan \ndiscourses\nhttp://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/preview/9429959\n$27.00 :(\n------------------------------------\nOKAY...now for the FREE STUFF ^_^\nhttp://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3\nFolder = &quot;Articles&quot;\nTitle = &quot; Modernization Through Colonial Mediations: The Establishment of \nthe Police and Prison System in Meiji Japan&quot;\nsize = 10 mb OVER 200 pages of info YAY!\npassword = makoto\n\n*this articles is FABULOUS because it was written in 2002, other articles on \nmy streamload account are older,  this article covers things like....\nExcessive Discipline in the Police/Prison System\nTokugawa Security Practices\nvarious &quot;colonial&quot; factors\n\nNow if anyone has the time please search for interesting dissertations and \nlocate the FREE ones and I&#39;ll host them in one place.  Give me the full title/\nauthor etc.  I just didn&#39;t have the time to go through all the dissertations which \ncame up on the search.  ALL DISSERTATIONS ARE PDF and allows for \nproper citation etc if you are going to quote the authors. THERE ARE SO \nMANY relevant articles including the women&#39;s rights movement during the \nMeiji Era and the education system.\n\nsecretarytocapt3\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumidb.com\n\n\n"
