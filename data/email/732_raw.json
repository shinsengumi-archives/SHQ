The name Fujita Gorou was given to SH by Matsudaira Katamori.\n2. One of Tokio&#39;s sisters married the son of Sagawa Kanbei, the chief \nretainer of Aizu.\n3. One of Saitou&#39;s grandsons is named Makoto (not THAT makoto, \nthough).\n4. Remember Tatsuo&#39;s original family, Numazawa? Well it turns out \nthat the Numazawa family was already related to Tokio, on her \nmother&#39;s side.\n\nI&#39;m also working on translating the family tree, which is somewhat \ndifficult given the amount of &quot;older&quot; characters in the names that \naren&#39;t used very much today. As soon as it&#39;s done, I&#39;ll upload it.\n\n--M.\n\n\n"
