I was only talking about membe=\r\nr(s) of the SHQ \nthat claimed Okita was born in Shirakawa and that he was c=\r\nlose to Hijikata.  Yes, I could be \na bit harsh in regard of Okita&#39;s place =\r\nof birth.  As you could see from the few history based \nwebsites I&#39;ve sent =\r\nyou, it wouldn&#39;t be hard for one to see that he was born in Edo. I did feel=\r\n \na little offended when you called this an issue of book &quot;A&quot; saying someth=\r\ning and book &quot;B&quot; \nsaying something (because no book would say that he was b=\r\norn in Shirakawa and the \nother party obviously made a mistake.) \n\nImagine =\r\nthis, if I confused Aizu with Ainu and claimed Matsudaira Katamori to be Ez=\r\no&#39;s \ndaimyo and if a third party in your position called it an issue of boo=\r\nk &quot;A&quot; saying something \nand book &quot;B&quot; saying something, wouldn&#39;t you feel a =\r\nlittle offended? If a third party \nconsidered such a situation to be discre=\r\npencies between two authors and used both your \ntext and my text, wouldn&#39;t =\r\nyou be eager to sort things out?\n\n~Seven\n\n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; however I need to ask you about this comment NLF7\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I believ=\r\ne that the volunteers from\n&gt; SHQ and the editors from Wikipedia might have =\r\nmade the very same\n&gt; errors of judgment. (For example,\n&gt; they might have be=\r\nen misled by the same website sources or have\n&gt; mistaken materialsfrom fict=\r\nional work as historical facts in a similar\n&gt; fashion...etc)&quot;\n&gt; -----------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m asking that you be careful with some o=\r\nf your comments nlf7\n&gt; \n&gt; WHICH members of the SHQ?  \n&gt; \n&gt; As I mentioned w=\r\ne are aware of the countless problems on\n&gt; wikipedia---if we post something=\r\n such as the Aizu information that is\n&gt; only very general information we us=\r\ne to help lead people to our\n&gt; website and especially to certain pages whic=\r\nh are well researched.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please don&#39;t ask me to repeat myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do=\r\nn&#39;t know all over 100 members here, but the ones I know---I assure\n&gt; you kn=\r\now the difference between *historical fiction and *fiction and\n&gt; *historica=\r\nl texts.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Some of us work with texts right out of that era...the prob=\r\nlem is they\n&gt; are in the process of being studied...and written in CHINESE.=\r\n Would\n&gt; you like to read them? Many texts are handwritten and cannot be ea=\r\nsily\n&gt; deciphered.  I am totally hapy to send you the entire Kyoto Shugosho=\r\nku\n&gt; Shimatsu...book which details Kyoto&#39;s security apparatus if you want\n&gt;=\r\n just email me at secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com I assure you this text\n&gt; h=\r\nas the detail you want.  We can sure use more people who are fluent\n&gt; in Ja=\r\npanese (or just studying Japanese).\n&gt; \n&gt; we have members in elementary scho=\r\nol all the way to those pursuing\n&gt; advanced degrees so when you say members=\r\n of the SHQ in a critical way\n&gt; you are in fact addressing a RANGE of membe=\r\nrs who are just trying to learn\n&gt; \n&gt; if you can teach us please do so in a =\r\nappropriate way\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
