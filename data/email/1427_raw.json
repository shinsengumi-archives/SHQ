Obviously I&#39;m missed some important list \nposts or totally misread them  until now if this has been clarified from \nthe original idea that Tatsuo was adopted into the family...----\n\n\nAlthough he was born as the third son of Fujita Goroo and Tokio, there \nwas no description in the family record.-\n\n*** So this means that Tatsuo was in act Tokio&#39;s and Hajime&#39;s natural child?\n\n\n***The thing that has me totally crazy is the following--\n\n\n&lt;&lt;The reason for this is that he was adopted from Numazawa Kohachiroo \nand Kuni immediately after his birth.&gt;&gt; Followed by this--&gt;&lt;&lt;Since there \nwas no child between Kohachiroo and Kuni, Numazawa family was in danger \nof extinction.  They had asked Fujita Goroo and Tokio to adopt their \nchild if it was a boy.  They had asked them even when Tatsuo was not \nborn yet.\n\nFujita family accepted this, and soon after the birth of boy, Numazawa \nfamily adopted him out.&gt;&gt;\n\n*** To me this says----The Numazawas had no children and were on the \nverge of becoming extinct as a family therefore they adopted the third \nFujita son they didn&#39;t have him then turn him over to Tokio and Hajime....\n\n\n-- \n\nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
