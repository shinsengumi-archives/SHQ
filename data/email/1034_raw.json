Obviously he \nplaced a great deal of trust in the man and wouldn&#39;t want to risk him falling \ninto enemy hands by going it alone. Others are probably the Aizu forces who have \nbeen mentioned as having been fighting beyond the domain borders to stop the \nImperial army&#39;s advance. Once the enemy broke through, I&#39;m sure there were \nmany men who found themselves suddenly cut off from returning to Aizu and had to \nfight elsewhere.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
