(or it&#39;s only me who has been panicked?)\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the saving flash, there is a free and\n&gt; practical one here,\n&gt;\nhttp://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dl/win95/art/se175326.html\n&gt; called FLASH MANIA, but the problem is this one has\n&gt; only Japanese \n&gt; language explanation.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I try to put some explanation as this one\n&gt; is quite simple to use.\n&gt; At first you put the link above to any translation\n&gt; site to find the \n&gt; download button.\n&gt; \n&gt; And once the soft is downloaded, and installed,\n&gt; started, you can see the \n&gt; black screen with some buttons below.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you click on the button &quot;S&quot; of the search, you\n&gt; can see the list of \n&gt; flashes you&#39;ve downloaded. (So you can download at\n&gt; first any flash \n&gt; normally on your browser) Then you can choose the\n&gt; flash you wish save and\n&gt; you right clicked the chosen file. There are two\n&gt; option in Japanese but\n&gt; you can see at least (S) for save and (D) for\n&gt; delete.\n&gt; Choosing (S) option you can save the file where you\n&gt; want on your PC.\n&gt; And the button &quot;O&quot; is open and &quot;M&quot; is misc.\n&gt; \n&gt; May be I explain badly and it seems complicated, but\n&gt; once you do try it, \n&gt; it would be more simple and easy, I think.\n&gt; And I don&#39;t know for the Mac, sorry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ktamae@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; According to the announcement on the official\n&gt; &quot;Shinsengumi! &quot;site on NHK,\n&gt;  &gt; they&#39;ll withdraw entire site at the end of\n&gt; January because of the\n&gt;  &gt; copyright.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Now it&#39;s time to save every stuff.( There are\n&gt; some soft which can save\n&gt;  &gt; even\n&gt;  &gt; flash thing)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n=====\nI Love Kouji\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
