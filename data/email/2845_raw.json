He was \na well-known genius swordsman, being =\r\none of the strongest out of the Shinsengumi, \nalong with Saito Hajime and N=\r\nagakura Shinpachi.\n\nContents\n\t \t1 Background\n\t \t2 Shinsengumi Period\n\t \t3 D=\r\neath\n\t \t4 Trivia\n\t \t5 References\n\t \t6 Okita in Fiction\n\nBackground\nHe was b=\r\norn Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai fami=\r\nly \nin the Shirakawa- han&#39;s Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His Great-grand=\r\nfather was Okita \nKan&#39;emon (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshir=\r\no (? - 1833.) His father, Okita \nKatsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older =\r\nsisters, Okita Mitsu (1833-1907) and Okita Kin \n(1836-1908.) In 1846, in or=\r\nder to marry the adopted son of the Okita family, Okita Rintaro \n(1826-1885=\r\n), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuk=\r\ne \nin name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and=\r\n Okita started \ntraining at the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. B=\r\ny that time, Kondo Shusuke had \nalready adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the late=\r\nr Kondo Isami), but Hijikata Toshizo had not \nyet enrolled at the Tennen Ri=\r\nshin-ryu school. Okita proved to be a prodigy and attained \nMenkyo Kaiden s=\r\ntatus (master of kenjutsu) at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 - p.11)\n\nIn 1861, =\r\nOkita became the Head Coach (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often =\r\n\ncommented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he w=\r\nas also \nknown to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (=\r\nMori, p.27 - p.28)\n\nAccording to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) an=\r\nd Satou Shun&#39;sen (Satou \nHigokorou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, a=\r\nnd thin man with high cheekbones, a \nwide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mo=\r\nri, p.56) In addition, he was known as a man who \nsmiled and laughed well (=\r\nnot very talkative, however.)\n\nShinsengumi Period\nOkita changed his name to=\r\n Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi shortly before his departure \nto Kyoto i=\r\nn 1863. He soon became a founding member of the Shinsengumi and a \nFukuchou=\r\n Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s Assistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou, also a \np=\r\nractitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryu, became a commander of the Shinchougum=\r\ni (the \nShinsengumi&#39;s brother league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)\n\nOkita was the s=\r\necond youngest among the Shieikan members, with Todo Heisuke being \nthe you=\r\nngest. He was one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (on=\r\ne of \nthe original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro=\r\n assassinations in \n1863. (Oji, p.132)\n\nEqually skilled with shinai, bokken=\r\n/bokutou, and katana, his signature technique was \nnamed the Mumyo-ken or S=\r\nandanzuki (which translates as &quot;Three Piece Thrust&quot;), a \ntechnique that cou=\r\nld attack one&#39;s neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. \n(=\r\nthe Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but thi=\r\ns is most \nlikely an embellishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own in=\r\nvention and it could \nhave been derived from an invention of Hijikata&#39;s (th=\r\ne Hirazuki.)\n\nIt was rumored that his tuberculosis was discovered when he c=\r\noughed blood and fainted \nduring the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say t=\r\nhat he contracted the disease after that. \nBoth are reasonable, as tubercul=\r\nosis can kill quickly (weeks), or very slowly (many years). \nWhile many of =\r\nthe Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaru was killed by Okita \ndu=\r\nring the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction), it is in fact=\r\n historically \ninaccurate. (Mori, p.92 - 98)\n\nBased on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fi=\r\nction, many also believe that Okita and Hijikata were like \nbrothers. In hi=\r\nstory, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly \nre=\r\nlationship with. Yamanami&#39;s seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was =\r\nan \nextremely painful incident in Okita&#39;s short life. (Mori, p.78) There is=\r\n no record showing \nthat Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whe=\r\nther Okita even got along with \nHijikata.\n\nIn 1865, Okita became the captai=\r\nn of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and also served as a \nkenjutsu instr=\r\nuctor ((Oji, p.175); later that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be=\r\n \nthe fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)\n\nAltho=\r\nugh highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana called =\r\nKikuichi-\nmonji. However, he surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana=\r\n and a wakizashi) and \nhis so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a =\r\nYamasiro Kunikiyo instead. (Oji, 96)\n\nDeath\nDuring the Boshin War, after th=\r\ne Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January of Keiou 4, Okita went \ninto Matsumoto =\r\nRyoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo. (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a guesthouse \nwith=\r\n Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces=\r\n (including \nthe Shinsengumi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku =\r\nregion, Okita remained in \nEdo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July=\r\n 19 (lunar calendar May 30th), 1868. Later \nthat night, he was buried at hi=\r\ns family temple in Edo (present Tokyo), under his birth name \n(with Okita S=\r\nouji listed in the death records.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is not open to the =\r\n\npublic. (Oji, p.252)\n\nThe information that Okita died when he was 25 is ba=\r\nsed on the theory that he was born \nin 1844 and therefore was 25 by East As=\r\nian age reckoning when he died in 1868 (or on a \nlesser-known theory that h=\r\ne was born in Summer, before July 19, 1842 and therefore was \n25 by Western=\r\n standards when he died in July 19, 1868.)\n\nTrivia\nIt is historical accurat=\r\ne that Okita loved children. During his time in Kyoto, he was often \nseen p=\r\nlaying with children and was a baby-sitter to Yagi&#39;s sons in Mibu. (Oji, p.=\r\n100)\n\nHe was not particularly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he lo=\r\nved sweets.\n\nOkita was a bit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)\n\nAside from bei=\r\nng treated by Matsumoto, Okita also took Kyorou Sanyaku (medicine for \nener=\r\nvation and coughing) for his tuberculosis (not to be confused with Ishida S=\r\nanyaku for \ntreating injures such as brusises and broken bones.)\n\nThere has=\r\n not been any evidence of an Okita photograph.\n\nReferences\n\t? \tMori, Makiko=\r\n. Okita Soji Feature. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999.\n\t? \tOji, Kazuko. =\r\nWalking with Okita Soji. Tokyo: Shin Chosha, 2003.\n\nOkita in Fiction\nIt is =\r\nimportant not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita with historical dat=\r\na about him.\n\nOkita is briefly mentioned and shown in the anime/manga serie=\r\ns Rurouni Kenshin, which \ntakes place during and after the Meiji Revolution=\r\n in Japan. A character later on in the \nseries, Seta S?jir?, was based on t=\r\nhe Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi Keppuroku (and \ntherefore, darker th=\r\nan the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in the anime/manga \nPeac=\r\nemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history. In an episode of =\r\nthe anime \nGS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted mo=\r\nvie about the \nBakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy wh=\r\no thinks only of killing \npeople (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which=\r\n also is a foil to the show&#39;s rendition of \nHijikata.) Okita is also the ma=\r\nle protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru, which is a fictional \nstory about =\r\nthe Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (where Okita trains a \ny=\r\noung girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her father and older broth=\r\ner.) He is also \ndepicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatto.) In the anime/ma=\r\nnga series Shura no Toki, \nOkita&#39;s (fictional) last battle before succumbin=\r\ng to his sickness is with a warrior from the \nMutsu, a clan that supposedly=\r\n practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a request from \nOkita himself fro=\r\nm years before.\n\nHis anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handso=\r\nme young man (sometimes a \nbish?nen). The Latin American dub of Rurouni Ken=\r\nshin, in fact, mistook Okita for a \nwoman, and the Hijikata/Okita yaoi pair=\r\ning is very popular among the fangirls of \nPeacemaker Kurogane.\n\nWhile only=\r\n briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a flashback and as a =\r\n\npossible ghost), Okita&#39;s (obviously) fictional daughter Kaoru (by an equal=\r\nly-obviously \nfictional unnamed wife) is one of the three main characters o=\r\nf the series.\n\nHis three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and his tuberculosis are =\r\nalso very similar to the \ncharacter Ukyo Tachibana from the video game seri=\r\nes Samurai Shodown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
