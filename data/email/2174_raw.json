Like many Shinsengumi \nresearchers she obviously went through a HIjikata &quot;phase&quot; and wrote a \nbook on him in the 1970s.  She is most well known ofcourse for her \nbooks on Saitou Hajime.  Most recently she mentioned that she would \nlike to continue writing on Fujita Goro and...TAKEDA.  She seems to \nbe pretty cool and if anyone out there, besides the usual \ntranslators, would like to try to translate this piece please do \nhelp.  She even interacts with fans, owns Fujita Goro&#39;s haori and \nfrankly without her dedication many mysteries surrounding Saitou and \nhis later career would have never been explored.  Personally, I wish \nI knew Japanese so that I could interview her and have her explain \nher own personal interpretations on things. But the most important \nquestion is...&quot;of all the fascinating members of the \nShinsengumi...why Saitou?&quot;  Because Okita and Hijikata and Nagakura \n(due to his memoirs) have always been the more popular figures, so I \nwonder why she picked Saitou.\n\nI don&#39;t want to burden our usual volunteers so someone please please \nhelp (^_^).\n\nShe is an elderly lady...this is a very old picture\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shizukoakamabio.jpg\n\n\n\n\n"
