How on earth did so many of us end up in the same RK RPG?\n \nAt least I don&#39;t have to come up with a reason why my character is still alive and give him a new persona in this one.  Bringing Sagara back to life in rk_onigokko is too cool, but exhausting. (So if I&#39;m flirting with Seta over on onigokko, is Saitou going to be flirting with Seta in this one? &lt;wink&gt;  And to think, I never liked Seta... ) \n \n&gt;&gt;On another note if you are going to watch more Chinese films try out Fong-Sai-Yuk and Fong-Sai-Yuk II...&lt;&lt;\n\nI&#39;ve never been a big fan of Hong Kong films but I love mainstream cinema from the People&#39;s Republic and Taiwan (geez... just thought about that... is Taiwan politically correct?), usually those that are period pieces (like director Zhang Zhimou&#39;s work... spelling probably off... the actress Gong Li is usually always in his films... &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; and &quot;Ju Dou&quot; come immediately to mind) or that explore current society.  The only martial arts films I&#39;ve really liked were the old samurai films (and probably the new ones when I get a chance to see them).\n\nI&#39;m interested enough in cinema history in general, though, that I&#39;ll watch the festival, especially the documentary.\nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
