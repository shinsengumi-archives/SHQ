I am very sorry- I had enjoyed this\nseries immensely and it inspired me to learn about the Shinsengumi.\nPerhaps the author can find a new publisher and finish her story.\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;momomanjyuu2004&quot; &lt;momomanjyuu2004@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I am lamenting it very much. \n&gt; The series of PMK manga was stopped with Vol.5. \n&gt; The author was hardly able to advance a story in a slump for one \n&gt; year. \n&gt; And it declared the stop of publishing formally by Vol.5. \n&gt; The story is the halfway portion of &quot;Aburanokoji no hen&quot;.\n&gt; It is very unfinished. \n&gt; It is not known whether it is serialized again. \n&gt; However, I think that production of the second season of PMK anime \n&gt; became impossible. \n&gt; \n&gt; Shinsengumi manga which I expect is only &quot;Getsumeiseiki&quot;.(cry) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, has &quot;SHOJO BEAT&quot; MAGAZINE already become the center of \n&gt; attention here?\n&gt; It is the Shojo manga magazine which BIZ will publish in July, this \n&gt; year. \n&gt; The series of Kaze Hikaru is determined by the magazine. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/2005/02_shojobeat.php\n&gt; \n&gt; momoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
