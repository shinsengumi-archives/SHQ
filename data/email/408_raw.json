Personally, for me \nif it did I&#39;d rather have the anime stop right there as I&#39;ve always \nfelt it went downhill after especially towards the end... If they \ndidn&#39;t even do the Kyoto arc yet, then yeah, I&#39;d definitely be upset. \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n&gt; In a message dated 4/14/2004 12:55:02 PM Eastern Standard Time, \n&gt; Warg3791@a... writes:\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if this is even a permanent thing though. They never \nshowed the \n&gt; Kyoto arc but once. Maybe they intend to move it around later? \nInclude it in \n&gt; the Adult Swim line-up at some point? They do that sort of thing \nall the time \n&gt; with their other anime. I wouldn&#39;t be a bit surprised to see it \nturn up again \n&gt; soon anyway. I finally gave up on them myself. I&#39;m slowing gather\n&gt; I was going to say slowy gathering the loose change from my sofa \ncushions, \n&gt; etc. to buy the final episodes I don&#39;t have. Sorry!
