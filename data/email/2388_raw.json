If that were true then many of us would completely ignore this site and group as just another random place.   The thing I think that Miss B. was trying to say was that nonhistorical things and people&#39;s imaginations also contributed alot to what we come to know today.   \n \nIn the case of the Shinsengumi, all manga, anime, and movies have based their stories on real life events and each have interpurted the happenings in some what diffrent ways from one to the next.   I.E. RK and PMK have two totally diffrent Saitous envisioned by two completely diffrent people (how boring would it be if they were both the exact same?).\n \nAnyways, getting back to the history that we&#39;re sharing here.   It is important to know it and share it amoungst ourselves.   If we didn&#39;t correct one another and put in our own two cents of what we know, many of us would still believe things like Okita passing out during the Ikedaya raid and other stuff you find on the internet that isn&#39;t correctly translated/interperted.   Personaly, thats the only reason I joined this group... to try and find out what the truth is.\n \n -Gladys\n         a.k.a.Bunneh\n \n \n\nHirotada Tokugawa &lt;patriot014@...&gt; wrote:\nIf history isn&#39;t welcome here, then kindly say so.\n\n--Masayoshi\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
