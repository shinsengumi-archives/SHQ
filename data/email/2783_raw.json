Edited \nby Elinor Barnes and James A.=\r\n Barnes. Introd. by Allan Nevins. \nPublisher: Bloomington, Indiana Universi=\r\nty Press [1963] \n\nand the description of the naval fighting (added by the e=\r\nditor) \nwhich involved Enomoto&#39;s doomed fleet was very intense and exciting=\r\n\n\nthrough the study of the Bakumatsu Battleships one will see that the \nfor=\r\neigners such as the *British were influential in the the fighting \nand mone=\r\ny loaned to the kangun Imperial Army for weapons\n--------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n\nSHQ UPDATES\nCOSPLAY!!!!  \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.c=\r\nom/cosplay.htm\nI&#39;m soooo jealous of Laura...she&#39;s right next to my RK Saito=\r\nu (^_^)\n[added: interview with the owners of the Saitou and Tokio tattoos]\n=\r\nThanks wolverinesg7 and Sarah for contributing!!!!\n------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n\nupdated with more details &quot;&quot;The Afflicted Swordsma=\r\nn: Tuberculosis \nand Okita Soujiro&quot; see [edits] on the page \nhttp://www.shi=\r\nnsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm\nso basically the argument being made is:\n\n1) =\r\nDr. Matsumoto Ryojun knew Kondou Isami (clearly mentioned in the \nHillsboro=\r\nugh book and also Japanese sites however we had to cite \nHillsborough on th=\r\ne timeline)\n2) Dr. Matsumoto was a top notch physician of his day\n3) Dr. Ma=\r\ntsumoto has used opium in the treatment of people such as \nTokugawa Yoshino=\r\nbu (thank you to Hirotada Tokugawa for find this \ndetail and translating it=\r\n)\n4) opium was used to treat tuberculosis (this method is totally \ncommon)\n=\r\n\n[conclusion: If in a fanfic you use the detail that Okita drank \nopium tea=\r\n to treat the *symptoms of TB then you would 99.9% \nhistorically accurate. =\r\n Does this mean that Okita was addicted to \nopium.  NOPE.  I never said tha=\r\nt.\n  \nOpium was used as medicine in many many ways since ancient times and =\r\n\nit was such a COMMON practice.  The method of extracting opium or \njust cr=\r\neating poppy tea was widespread in the EAst and West.  Think \nof it this wa=\r\ny...people were giving small opium pellets \nto &quot;difficult&quot; babies who would=\r\nn&#39;t stop crying.  It was like this \nweird &quot;cure all&quot;]\n\nSo please be sure to=\r\n read the page carefully because I don&#39;t want \npeople to go around saying &quot;=\r\noh no SHQ is saying that Okita is an \nopium adduct&quot;... LOL!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"
