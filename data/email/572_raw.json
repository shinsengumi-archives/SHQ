I wasn&#39;t aware that NHK made posters out of the drama?!  Are the fans saying that Saitou is groovy or are the &#39;posters&#39; saying it?\n\nBTW, those who watched the last episode of Shinsengumi . . . I think it was the 9th episode . . . who is the main character in that particular ep?  I just started watching it and my friend told me it started at 9:30 when it started showing at 9:00 so I missed the first half.  Anyway, nobody ever said his name again.  Just wondering  Is it Kondou Isami? cuz Hijikata&#39;s pretty young!  (and extremely handsome . . .^^;;;) yeah . . .oh, and the time is pre-Shinsengumi,right?\n\n\n\nSaitoh Worship\n~Anime Mystique~\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
