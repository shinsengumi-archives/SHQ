As a board\nadmin.  there is no way for me to determine if it is members or if the\nboard is just counting &quot;views&quot;.  At the bottom of the page it says\nTotal Visits: 7968?\n\nI did designate mods/admin way back but for some reason the names\naren&#39;t listed in the columns.  Presently I have the time to patrol the\nboard but just so you all know:\nBarbara=Moderator\nShimazuryu=Admin\nSpiritus_Saitou=Moderator\nMay they be just in wielding their powers.\n\nI posted a link to our board at http://www.hino-shinsengumi.com which\nseems to be one of -the- most active Shinsengumi branches in Japan.\n3-hajime.com which has very friendly gals and they know we exist\n(babelfish their comments)\nand a couple of other sites I can&#39;t recall.\n\nIf the GREAT fish allows I&#39;ll try to post on the official Fu-un\nShinsengumi site -if- I can figure out if they allow for advertising.\n\nI know from meeting with international students before that a majority\nof younger Japanese have pretty darn good English comprehension\nskills.  Many have studied English since elementary school 0_o and can\nread/write basic English so that is the rational behind my objectives\n we need to reach out across to the Pacific to our brothers and sistas\nwho are -even- more serious about their Shinsengumi than we are:) We\nalso would like Japanese agents to give us a heads up on anything\nShinsengumi related in the media/manga etc.\n\nWe need Pro-Ishin ShiShi folks....it&#39;s just not the same without\nopponents...just feel so obsolete.  Remember, as an anime fan I have\nno problem with more RK, PMK fans but we have to try to lure in other\nfolks too so we can -use- them errr learn from them to enrich\nfanfiction I mean contribute to our understanding of the\nhistory/politics of the time.\n\nIf anyone knows about an upcoming convention with Shinsengumi\ncosplaying team or something just invite them to join.  Or if anyone\nknows someone on the &quot;inside&quot; of a convention which can get us some\nfree advertising lemme know too.  I think we did more than enough to\n&quot;season&quot; the board with amazing threads and I bow deeply to everyone\nwho has taken the time to post...I just have the fate of\nwww.Saitou-hajime.com in the back of my mind.\n\nsecretarytocapt3\nwww.shinsengumimb.com \nTemple to the Omnipotent All Knowing Goldfish\n\n\n"
