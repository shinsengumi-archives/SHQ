Sherlgirl I will download it and read it.\nYes, the koban system is very unique but it seems, according to the \ntexts I have read, to be undergoing major changes in terms of its \neffectiveness.  And imagine the koban back in the Meiji Era!  The \nkoban system remains in modern times because of the narrow streets \nand extremely densely populated areas.  It is more efficient \nto &quot;spread out&quot; law enforcement rather than have one big police \nstation and dispatch personel.  Koban cops are often the first \nresponders in all situations.  Not surprisingly foreign students in \nJapan are encouraged to find out where their local koban is located \nshould they need assistance.\nsome references to Kawaji are in the books/sources here\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/NSNR/NOsleepNOrest_Bibliography.htm\n\nalot of Kawaji&#39;s writings are quoted *slightly* out of context and \ncertain things like how Kawaji may have distorted information \nregarding the French model to push some his own ideas. Not all of \nKawaji&#39;s writings have been translated into English.\n\nI have alot of ****interesting koban stories from western researchers \nwho shadowed koban officers.\n\nI think if the Shinsengumi are &quot;modernized&quot; in terms of fiction...you \ndo not get punished with KINSHIN...you get punished by being sent to \nbe a koban officer and have to spend your whole day babysitting lost \nchildren, give directions and go door to door collecting information \nfrom people in your jurisdiction.  Because all rookies have to work a \nkoban for a while.  Imagine chatty PMK Nagakura sent to a koban (^_^)\n\nI have to double check Fujita Goro&#39;s timeline but since he held the \nrank of sergeant at one point his job was actually to supervise koban \nin his jurisdiction.  BAck in that era, criminals were picked up and \nescorted to the big police stations by sergeants.  They had their \nhands tied and the officer would hold one end of the rope (there is a \nquick scene in the film LADY SNOW BLOOD the last episode of the \nseries).\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, sherlgirl &lt;sherlgirl@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sec - With respect to this topic, did you ever see this paper on \nthe Japanese Koban? (Found it while looking for info on Kawaji.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Christopher ALDOUS and Frank LEISHMAN, Enigma Variations: \nReassessing the Koban. 2000. \n&gt; http://www.nissan.ox.ac.uk/nops/nops31.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s part of the Nissan Institute white paper series...  found it \nwhile researching Kawaji.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I also have some info, somewhat anecdotal, on the Tokugawa prison \nsystem.... from Charles Dunn&#39;s text &quot;EVeryday Life in Traditional \nJapan.&quot;   Unfortunately he doesn&#39;t provide references in the text.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; S\n\n\n\n\n"
