(I need to verify this so that I don&#39;t screw up on my fanfic \n&gt;^^;;;) &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It wasn&#39;t Katsura so much as his more radical companions--Miyabe, Genzui, \n&gt;Yoshida.\n\nI&#39;ll second that. Katsura thought that burning Kyoto was stupid. Miyabe \nTeizou, Yoshida Toshimaro, and Matsuda Juusuke-- the leaders of the group at \nIkedaya-- were the ones in support of burning Kyoto to the ground, \nimpersonating Aizu troops, killing Matsudaira Katamori, and kidnapping \nEmperor Komei, taking him to Choshuu and &quot;reinstating&quot; the government.\n\nNHK Katsura, in the very first episode, put it best:\n\n&quot;If you burn Kyoto to the ground, many people will lose their homes, and \nmany will die.&quot;\n\nHowever, Ikedaya, to me, is also a very interesting place to see the \nattitude of Aizu toward Shinsengumi. Shinsengumi expected Aizu \nreinforcements, but Aizu took their time-- which makes sense in the light of \nthe &quot;Shinsengumi as spare parts&quot; theory that I&#39;d been thinking of earlier-- \nthe idea that if Shinsengumi takes the forefront of the assault, Aizu \nwouldn&#39;t have to dirty its hands as much. Those of you who know PMK can see \nthis in the Ikedaya episode-- when Katsuya Sakon shows up with the Aizu \nforces, he&#39;s so hesitant he&#39;s even desperate to keep Kondou from dirtying \nhis uniform.\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
