Shonai, of course, being close allies with Aizu.  Both \nincidents have been attributed to Sagara, but I don&#39;t know if anyone \nknows for sure.\n\nphil (who promises to go back resting in peace for a while)\nIt was the same night the &quot;suspicious fire&quot; broke out in Edo Castle and \ndestroyed the women&#39;s quarters. (Doesn&#39;t have the exact date listed here.) Someone \nthen fired a shot at the Edo villa of Shonai domain, a close shogunal ally. \nThe men of that domain gave chase and the assailants fled to Satsuma villa. It \nwas the enraged officials of Edo, ticked off from weeks of brigandage \nattributed to the Satsuma-led ronin, who attacked and burned the Shimazu villa \n(Satsuma&#39;s Lord&#39;s home) and killed several men.\n\nThis was all attributed to Saigo, via his orders to Sagara.
