Kondou vs. NHK \nKondou...we are all studying human beings so we can&#39;t expect them to \nbe perfect ^_^\n\n***according to the ladies at 3-hajime.com there was an amusing \nscene where Saitou and Shimada charge at a riceball offered at the \nYagi residence or something along those lines...is this true \nBarbara?
