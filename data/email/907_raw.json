LOL\n\nOh yes, the world definitely NEEDS another film featuring Koichi Sato \nand the still unknown (to me) wonderful actor who played Nagakura.\n\nOh, and Tama was kind enough to send me a brief clip of the &quot;Hijikata \nsings&quot; scene from last week&#39;s NHK show and it appears that the song in \nquestion is a traditional folk song from the region where \nKondou/Hijikata grew up.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
