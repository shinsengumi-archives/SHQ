Unfortunately, the resolution of \nthe image is too low for me to read the text and I was unable to find a \nlarger version.\n\nFWIW, there is also http://www.webvider.com/ikedaya/index.html , which \nmentions an estimated plan size, but I think the author extrapolated \nthat based on the tatami sizes (my Japanese reading skills are poor at \nbest, so please take my interpretations with a grain of salt). It also \nvarious other information like an elevation plan of the inn (which \nfinally let me get my head around the structure) and even a few photos, \nalong with information about where various members were during the raid.\n\nFinally, I found a company that sells a papercraft model of the Ikedaya \nat http://craft.dosue.jp/craft/machiya/ikedaya.html (along with some \nother interesting models, such as \nhttp://craft.dosue.jp/craft/others/doll.html). I have currently not been \nable to ascertain whether they will ship outside of Japan (their old \nsite would not allow it, but they have recently changed hosting \nproviders and their email from the new site bounces).\n\nKitsuno wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; None of the maps of the Ikedaya that I find indicate the dimensions of\n&gt; the building itself (which is making it hard to create an accurate\n&gt; architectural floorplan) - does anyone have a source that states the\n&gt; length, width, and height of the building? The sizes of the inside\n&gt; rooms help, but there is too much unaccounted space to accurately\n&gt; figure the length and width of the actual building from it.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Chuck \n&gt; Harris &lt;chuckjharris@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you to both Kitsuno and Seven for these images; they are\n&gt; perfectly\n&gt; &gt; timed for an adventure that I am putting together for my role-playing\n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do have a couple of questions, though. The first concerns the\n&gt; labeling\n&gt; &gt; on Kitsuno&#39;s map. The rooms have labels such as &quot;6巾� &quot; (hopefully \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; message encoding allows the kanji to display; if not, I&#39;m referring to\n&gt; &gt; the labels with a number followed by a three-stroke and a five-stroke\n&gt; &gt; kanji). I&#39;m familiar with the convention of expressing room sizes by\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; number of tatami, but I learned that as 6-jou (6 畳) and could not \n&gt; find\n&gt; &gt; the map&#39;s notation in my dictionaries. Does the notation on the map\n&gt; mean\n&gt; &gt; the same thing? If so, what is the distinction between the two?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The two maps are clearly derived from the same original source. Is this\n&gt; &gt; known to be a historically accurate map of the Ikedaya, or drawn from\n&gt; &gt; typical inns of the period (or perhaps the set of one of the\n&gt; Shinsengumi\n&gt; &gt; films)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What would the exterior grounds look like (other than the rear garden)?\n&gt; &gt; Narrow alleys between the\n&gt; &gt; adjacent buildings or a larger lot, potentially with a fence or wall\n&gt; &gt; around the whole property?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Finally, in the interest of giving due credit, what are the sources for\n&gt; &gt; these two maps?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"
