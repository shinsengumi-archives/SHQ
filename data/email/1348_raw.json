And from the screenshots there \nare beautiful shadows and stuff (not to mention that it shows the \nItou Affair).\n\nSerizawa Kamo wrote\n&gt; 2) For those who like old anime, try finding an old\n&gt; anime (from the 80&#39;s) called Haguregumo, produced by\n&gt; Mad House. It features the Shinsengumi. I haven&#39;t\n&gt; watched it, but I&#39;ve seen some screenshots of it and\n&gt; it&#39;s gorgeous, mixing sumi-e and ukiyo-e to draw\n&gt; scenes and background.\n&gt; \n\n\n"
