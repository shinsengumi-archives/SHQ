Unlike Kenshin he can control his two\n&quot;personas&quot;.\n\nIf you read the timeline at 3-hajime.com there seems to be some\noverlapping (or multitasking?) involved with his job in the\npolice...because it will say &quot;inspector&quot;, &quot;inspector probationary\nduties&quot; and so on and so forth with slightly different labels.\n\nSo in the RK world maybe the police know him as Lt. Fujita but have\nabsolutely no idea about the other stuff...it be between Lt. Fujita\nand Kawaji.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\nI wonder if it&#39;s a mistake by Watsuki since if those kind \n&gt; of rumors were up and about, being an undercover agent would be no \n&gt; good. Come to think of it, Fujita going about as a policeman by day \n&gt; and then also going undercover on the side, it&#39;s a little weird for \n&gt; me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if at this point in the manga, did it still matter? \n\n\n\n"
