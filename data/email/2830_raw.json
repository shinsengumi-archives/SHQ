Thanks a lot=\r\n! :)\n\n&gt;2) The authors of the page are at the TOP of the page\n&gt;&quot;special than=\r\nks to Jia-xin Wu of http://&gt;www.dreamfeather.net/\n\nI&#39;ve tried to link to th=\r\nat website countless times with no success.  I&#39;ll try again now,\n\n&gt;I did no=\r\nt write the page---I thought that was clear &gt;already that I just update pag=\r\nes\n\nI know that.  I was hoping your would forward my messages to the other =\r\nauthor(s.)\n\n&gt;3) for the RECORD, Shinsengumihq.com did not &gt;singlehandedly g=\r\no in and\n&gt;write those wikipedia articles---\n\nSorry I didn&#39;t make it clear e=\r\nnough again. I was trying to explain how easily people, like the \neditor(s)=\r\n from Wikipedia, could have  used Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s novels as references.\n\n=\r\n&gt;I&#39;m confused when you constantly say that you had to &gt;do this and that\n&gt;on=\r\n wikipedia because our volunteers are responsible &gt;for what is on\n&gt;the webs=\r\nite ONLY\n\nLet me try this again.  Please bear with me.  I believe that the =\r\nvolunteers from SHQ and the \neditors from Wikipedia might have made the ver=\r\ny same errors of judgment.  (For example, \nthey might have been misled by t=\r\nhe same website sources or have mistaken materials \nfrom fictional work as =\r\nhistorical facts in a similar fashion...etc) \n\nSince I couldn&#39;t just make c=\r\norrections on the SHQ website, I could only bring the issues up. \nSince I c=\r\nouldn&#39;t contact the authors directly to sort things out, I could only leave=\r\n my \nmessages with you. \n\n&gt;as I&#39;ve stated before in earlier posts I only po=\r\nsted a discussion\n&gt;question to your KOndou page and I did cite my informati=\r\non regarding\n&gt;Tani Tateki---the detail in the Hillsborough book, and his Ja=\r\npanes source. On the \n&gt;board you proceeded to &gt;SHOUT AND USE CAPS TO MAKE Y=\r\nOUR\n&gt;POINT LIKE THIS. You must take up the matter with Mr. Hillsborough AND=\r\n\n&gt;the Japanese author of the book he used (not with me---I just read the\n&gt;i=\r\nnformation). Please keep that in mind.\n\nAgain, I apologize for not making t=\r\nhings clear enough.  I wasn&#39;t taking the matter with \nyou; I was acknowledg=\r\ning your message and letting you know that I&#39;d also bought the \nsame book..=\r\n. I had used caps mainly to remind myself to look into it. (I&#39;ll delete my =\r\n\nmessage on the Kondo discussion page and I won&#39;t use caps again, I promise=\r\n.)\n\n&gt;however we do link to certain Wikipedia articles (with &gt;warnings) such=\r\n\n&gt;as the one on Teruhime and Aizu which we did &gt;contribute facts\n\nI&#39;m aware=\r\n of that.  The Wikipedia articles do link to your website though, \n\n&gt;It is =\r\npossible we have members who add information &gt;but individual actions should=\r\n not \nreflect on our entire &gt;group\n\nI agree with you 100%.\n\n&gt;for the record=\r\n we are one of SEVERAL Shinsengumi &gt;sites out there...it\n&gt;is possible you m=\r\nay be addressing the wrong group &gt;entirely...like I\n&gt;said this is an open c=\r\nommunity with hundreds of &gt;members\n\nLike I said, I could only leave message=\r\ns in hope that they would be forwarded to the right \npeople.\n\n\n\n\n"
