Thomas (Introduction)\nISBN: 0896597989 \n\n*those who would like to research tattoos should try to find books \nby Donald Richie who is an authority on the subject\n\n[NOTES]\n\nYa ku za = 893 (from a card game...the combination of numbers \nmeans &quot;worthless&quot;)\n\nYakuza is connected to the 17th century Banzuin Chobei a commoner \nhero bandit\n\n[tattoos]\nirezumi (ire-zumi) =insertion of ink or\nhorimoni (hori-moni)= a think &quot;carved&quot; or &quot;sculpted&quot; engraved  \nis connected to the Chinese novel (with history mixed in) SUIKODEN \n(Water Margin or All men are Brothers)...formally translated in \nJapanese in 1805...by 1850s the story was glorified in the ukiyo-e \nart from by various artists\n\nthe word SHINOBU &quot;to hide oneself&quot; is a very loaded term for people \nin the irezumi world who live in concealment (the author of the book \nabove emphasizes how people with tattoos are quiet normal and no \nthey aren&#39;t part of the criminal underworld...if anything they are \nsecretive due to the stereotype)\n\nin 1869 tattooing was outlawed temporarily and police raided the \nhomes of popular tattooists (horishi)\n\nHoricho (who was involved in a love suicide in 1900) practiced his \ncraft on KING GEORGE V and NICHOLAS 2 (last tsar of Russia)...both \nmen were involved in the navy and visited the artist on their days \noff to get dragon tattoos\n\nthe most famous artist right now is Mitusaki Ohwada (HORIKEN) he \nfather was an instructors at the Yokohama police academy...as a \nyouth he practiced on ham, sausage, daikon....at 20 he showed his \nparents his own work on himself...they were horrified and his father \nresigned from his position in the force (even though their son&#39;s \nfascination was kept a secret)\n\nHORIKEN is also the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department&#39;s walking \ndatabase of tattoos (identify dead bodies etc)...as he can identify \nthe tattoo artist (based on unique styles)....therefore tattoo \nartists can be more effective than a mere graphic database\n\nfull body tattoos can sometimes be &quot;donated&quot; or sold upon the death \nof the person to hospitals through a process called \ndecortication...the skin is basically removed from the \nbody...certain tattoos designs (river tattoo) was formulated for \nremoval after a person was flayed\n\na favorite motiff of tattoos is BENTEN KOZO (portrayed in \nkabuki)...a handsome thief who crossdresses as a woman and once \ncaught, revealed his full body tattoo\n\npeople who want more details (some are bit ::cough:: controversial) \ncan AIM me at &quot;BADGERTURTLE&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
