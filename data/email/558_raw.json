(Kenjutsu Teacher)\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=182392907\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: secretarytocapt3\r\n\r\nI posted the question as to whether or not S.H. was a kenjutsu teacher\nin a formal setting at the 3-hajime messageboard (by the way 3-hajime\nhas 2 messageboards...one devoted to fan-talk (they won&#39;t stop talking\nabout Shinsengumi dolls) the other devoted to the historical S.H.)\n\nA member (not the webmaster) did reply (babblefish)\n&quot;As for Saito one as for late year, became the teacher also you have\nheard. Will details probably be being referred to being this sight, how?&quot;\n[translation?]\nI ~think~ she said that she has [also] heard this rumor but like me/us\nshe isn&#39;t sure why this detail hasn&#39;t showed up on 3-hajime.com\n\n***Tiffany/secretarytocapt3 speculating (what a surprise huh?) \no.k. from past discussions we have &quot;concluded&quot; that S.H. very likely\ncrosstrained in many lineages/sword styles although Mugai-ryu\n(kenjutsu) seems to be the most widely accepted (mentioned on many\nJapanese sites+Serizawa Kamo&#39;s Bio).  To teach kenjutsu one must be\nable to cite one&#39;s lineage and preferably provide a certificate.  Now\nthe Shinsengumi, to me doesn&#39;t seem to be the most orthodox group so\nI&#39;m sure when/if the groups data keeper/scribe asked &quot;um Mr.Saito may\nI see your certificate&quot; I&#39;m sure historical Saito said &quot;if you&#39;ll step\noutside I&#39;ll show my martial arts style&quot; and that would be the end of\nthe discussion.  \nBut after the revolution and all would it be a good idea for him to\ntry to attach himself to let&#39;s say an educational institute and try to\nteach kenjutsu---these formal environments would definately ask to see\ncredentials.\nAnd what bothers me is was he ever formally certified at all seeing\nhow he was a ronin and all. I&#39;m assuming certification takes time and\nperhaps he studied at some dojo as child/adolescent and may be a very\ntalented studetn but never got certified. So ~if~ he did teach perhaps\nit was very informally on the side.\n\nside note = Yes he did live/work at the Yoshida dojo (after killing\nsomeone, a retainer to the shogun is a rumor) because of his father&#39;s\nconnections.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Actually I think I read some snippet somewhere eons ago about him  \n&gt; teaching kendo at some point which I suppose would be akin to gym class?\n\n\n\n"
