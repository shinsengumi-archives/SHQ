There are also \n&gt; interesting connections between the specific Byakkot=\r\nai who died on \n&gt; Mt. Iimori with the Fujita family (again it&#39;s all really =\r\ncomplicated, \n&gt; throught extension, friendships etc but still fascinating)\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The film\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; the history=\r\n\n&gt; http://www.byakkotai.net\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiritus Saitou is sharing some screencaps=\r\n of this new 2007 Byakkotai \n&gt; with me and I&quot;m going to look over them toda=\r\ny.  Now with a bigger \n&gt; budget and computer effects this epic narrative ma=\r\ny take be even more \n&gt; compelling to a new generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Byakkotai w=\r\nill always be the tragic &quot;poster boys&quot; of Aizu...and \n&gt; the only source of =\r\n&quot;rehabilitation&quot; of the domain&#39;s narrative.  On a \n&gt; national level, Aizu g=\r\not the attention of the rest of the country in \n&gt; much later years *after t=\r\nhe Meiji Era (at the height of Japan&#39;s \n&gt; fascism) due to the Byakkotai.  H=\r\nOwever specific reasons for the \n&gt; military actions against the domain in 1=\r\n868 have not been been made \n&gt; transparent (it has been written about but i=\r\nt needs to be brought \n&gt; into our modern era, our generation and in Eng.) b=\r\necause \n&gt; the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of teh Meiji Era with their fake Imperial =\r\n\n&gt; Edict, fake Imperial Banners and unwillingness to accept Aizu&#39;s \n&gt; earli=\r\ner attempts for negotiations points to a simple private grudge \n&gt; between t=\r\nhe Ishin and the domain (ofcourse it cost the lives of too \n&gt; many combatan=\r\nts and civilians and the long term stigamtization of the \n&gt; survivors).\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; At the same time Aizu leaders of the Boshin War generation sort of \n&gt; pai=\r\nnted themselves into a corner too...only a handful of them could \n&gt; actuall=\r\ny tell their domain&#39;s story in a published format (perhaps due \n&gt; to variou=\r\ns political and social pressures).  Incidentally those very \n&gt; Aizu leaders=\r\n had very close relationships with the Fujita family.  \n&gt; Thus what we get =\r\nfor Aizu is the Byakkotai and other details of the \n&gt; role of the domain du=\r\nring the Bakumatsu gets swept under the \n&gt; rug...again Aizu was the &quot;crimin=\r\nal&quot; domain in the eyes of many \n&gt; people.  Survivors who became successful =\r\nwere the lucky few and had \n&gt; to be grateful for whatever blessings granted=\r\n to them (even if they \n&gt; earned their properity in the Meiji Era through t=\r\nheir own sheer \n&gt; talent and effort).\n&gt; \n&gt; More Byakkotai/Aizu discussions =\r\ncan be found here\n&gt; http://community.livejournal.com/edo_meiji/tag/aizu\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; also Aizu stuff not related to the Shinsengumi can be posted here:\n&gt; http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/edojidai/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Se=\r\nven&quot; &lt;nlf7@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Byakkotai (SP) Part 1 [2007?.01?.06] (704x396 D=\r\nivX6)?.avi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://d-addicts.net/torrents/\n&gt; &gt; byakkotai%20%28sp%29=\r\n%20part%201%20%5B2007.01.06%5D%20%28704x396%\n&gt; 20divx6%2\n&gt; &gt; 9.avi.torrent\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
