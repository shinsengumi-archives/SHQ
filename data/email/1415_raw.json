He was crucified \nand \n&gt; pierced by spears.( Historical Izo is beheaded though) After death, \nas a revengeful \n&gt; ghost, Izo&#39;s soul possesses the body of a homeless living in \npresent-day \n&gt; Tokyo.\n&gt; Became a killing machine, Izo transcends between space-time to slay \neveryone \n&gt; who cuts off his way.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this film would be very violent and bloody one a la Miike, \nand \n&gt; perhaps recommendable for only fans of the genre. Nevertheless, \nthis film has also \n&gt; few Shinsengumi appearance and casts many stars like Takeshi Kitano\n( not as \n&gt; Hijikata this time. LOL)or Ryuhei Matsuda.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\nThanks for the info Tama.
