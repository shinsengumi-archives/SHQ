His mother sent for him and told him \nof her past. She was from a peasant family herself and she had been \njealous of Kondo, who was easily becoming a samurai. Now she understood \nhow Kondo wanted to be like a samurai.\n\nEpisode 12: To West! (March 28th)\n\nThe Roshigumi assembled at the appointed place. Kondo was appointed \nquartermaster.\nThere was a little quarrel concerning the seniority of captains. Kondo \nand his fellows belonged to the third company. The captain was Serizawa \nKamo. But Serizawa wanted to have the first company. The official had to \nexplain that there was no seniority among companies.\n\nThe other day, Okita saw Nagakura&#39;s excellent swordsmanship at a tavern. \nIn a clamped place, he instantly put the sword to his opponent&#39;s throat. \nToday, when he saw Serizawa&#39;s fellows were to attack Nagakura, Okita \ndrew sword at the same instant as *** and impressed him.\nThe Roshigumi at last started heading for Kyoto.\n\n~ Barbara Sheridan\n*Our bad boys have come out to play--Join them*\nSoul of the Night ~ Winter Song\nhttp://www.dragonsdisciple.com\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
