I may be biased, but I\nreally did like it - it&#39;s got a proper manga feel to\nthe way it flows, which I particularly appreciate\nbecause I always have the manga in mind when I write,\nand Souji is pure class. Ah, may Shinsengumi doujinshi\nthrive and prosper, thanks to the hard work of\ntalented people like you. \nActually, purely out of curiosity, I put it out there\nas a general question (this might belong on the Spy\nDivision list, and if so, feel free to chastise me),\ndo any of the Shinsengumi fans here have major\nproblems with the fic? I know I&#39;ve taken huge\nliberties in the writing process, but I do try to put\nthe history in there properly, and I was just\nwondering what criticisms the experts here had.... \n\nBest wishes, \n\nMio. (misaki toyodome) \n\n--- Bunny ^_^ &lt;shenlong71328@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nGreetings to all the Shinsengumi lovers of this world!\n^_________^\n  \n  Alright then, these are 8 pages I did because I was\ndeeply inspired  (and hooked) on a fanfic I&#39;m\ncurrently reading called &quot;The Courtship of  Lady\nTokio&quot; by Misaki Toyodome.   Now,  Misaki didn&#39;t  ask\nme to draw this, I did it on my own out of pure urge\nto see what  this one particular scene would look\nlike.   I was extreamly  nervous when I sent her the\nlinks to the pages and I am overly excited  that she\nloves them.   She loves them so much that she\nsuggested I  share these pages with the SHQ mailing\nlist (BTW are the SHQ & Spy  division under the same\ne-mail address for the mailing  list?).   So, without\nfurther adue, the small section of  fanfic turned\ndoujinshi:\n  \n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970162/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970267/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/24970380/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25006043/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25255863/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25256502/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25275526/\n  http://www.deviantart.com/view/25394256/\n  \n  If any of you haven&#39;t read this fic, you should.  \nIt is  exquisitly writen.   The fanfic can be found\nboth on  fanfiction.net\n(http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2049030/1/) & on \nhakubaikou.com ... the one on FF.net is more far ahead\nthen the one on  Hakubaikou&#39;s site.   Anyways, I hope\nyou guys all enjoy this  as much as Misaki did (I know\nsecretarytocapt3 enjoys the fic  ^.^).   So, &#39;till\nlater!\n  \n  -Bunneh/ WhiteRabbit/ Eeni\n\n            \n---------------------------------\n Yahoo! Personals\n Single?
