The Wikipedia articles do link to your website =\r\nthough\n--------------------------------------\nsecretarytocapt3\nthat is beca=\r\nuse some members of the Shinsengumihq.com DID author the\narticle on Aizu...=\r\nthe other Shinsengumi stuff (I) didn&#39;t touch--nor\ndid I care to touch, howe=\r\nver your differing opinion on Kondou&#39;s death\ndue to Tani&#39;s catalyzing the s=\r\nituation goes against, Tani Tateki&#39;s own\nmemoirs (his own words)---thus I h=\r\nad to correct your information nlf7.\n Other than that I have no interest in=\r\n the other articles.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizu\n\nI linked informati=\r\non from http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakamineHideo.htm\nand I should added h=\r\nttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\nas well\n\nDo you have a quest=\r\nion regarding the Aizu page?  \nOur work is cited in detail and can be scrut=\r\ninized.  \nAs I said before, we will defer to someone who knows Japanese---b=\r\nut\nyou said yourself that you aren&#39;t done reading those texts.\n\nWe have tex=\r\nts for you to read if you wish---they are considered\ndifficult by even educ=\r\nated Japanese.  \nI scanned them and can email them to you.\n\nas for dreamfea=\r\nther.net she did not give me her new webaddress or\nemail thus I cannot pass=\r\n along your comments (which are by the way\ncame across as harsh).  \n\nWhat I=\r\n&#39;m saying is, unless you are fluent in Japanese then please be\nnice to our =\r\ncontributors---dreamfeather did try her best.\n\n----------------------------=\r\n----------\nhowever I need to ask you about this comment NLF7\n\n&quot; I believe t=\r\nhat the volunteers from\nSHQ and the editors from Wikipedia might have made =\r\nthe very same\nerrors of judgment.

Would\nyou like to read them? Many texts are handwr=\r\nitten and cannot be easily\ndeciphered.  I am totally hapy to send you the e=\r\nntire Kyoto Shugoshoku\nShimatsu...book which details Kyoto&#39;s security appar=\r\natus if you want\njust email me at secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com I assure y=\r\nou this text\nhas the detail you want.  We can sure use more people who are =\r\nfluent\nin Japanese (or just studying Japanese).\n\nwe have members in element=\r\nary school all the way to those pursuing\nadvanced degrees so when you say m=\r\nembers of the SHQ in a critical way\nyou are in fact addressing a RANGE of m=\r\nembers who are just trying to learn\n\nif you can teach us please do so in a =\r\nappropriate way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
