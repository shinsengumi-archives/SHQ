You get to go to Aizu ^_^\n&gt; I have read of the Aizu fall festival here\n&gt; http://8614.teacup.com/hijikata/bbs\n&gt; if you attend the commemorative ceremony for Saitou Hajme please\n&gt; report to us every detail!  I am very interested in the cultural or\n&gt; religious aspects.\n&gt; For people who are new to SHQ, Aizu has a fall festival every year\n&gt; dedicated to the bravery of the people who defended their home.  \nYou\n&gt; can view pictures here http://www.linkclub.or.jp/~swing/ insert the\n&gt; link into http://www.nifty.com/globalgate if you cannot read \nJapanese.\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumimb.com\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumidb.com\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, ktamae@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I think now other people have given much info about spots in \nAizu.\n&gt; &gt; Personally, I&#39;m planning to go to Aizu on September at the \noccasion\n&gt; of the \n&gt; &gt; Aizu autumn festival and probably attending Saito Hajime\n&gt; commemorative ceremony \n&gt; &gt; which will be hold exceptionally on 25 Sep this year.(And seeing\n&gt; Koji Yamamoto \n&gt; &gt; as Hijikata in costume parade, I hope he wears that western \nsuit...) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wish visit most famous spots there and if I can find more info,\n&gt; I&#39;ll post \n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;ll indeed post the report here or SHQ site with photos. As \nfor\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; gravestone, I&#39;ll think over to find the best way to share with \nyou\n&gt; guys. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to respect those people&#39;s soul and I wont forget a \nprayer\n&gt; when I&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; visit the place, however personally I think their gravestones \nhave also \n&gt; &gt; historical value and it would be regrettable if I wont show them \nfor\n&gt; you who having \n&gt; &gt; real interest in these people&#39;s lives.\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestion or opinion about this are welcome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Serizawa san\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not Aizu people, living mostly in Tokyo when I&#39;m in Japan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And more OT staff for all\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if you are watching the olympic game, but if you \nhave\n&gt; the chance \n&gt; &gt; to see the final of synchronized swimming, in free routine \nsection, my \n&gt; &gt; compatriot will show the performance which has the theme of\n&gt; &quot;Bushido&quot;, apparently \n&gt; &gt; inspired by &quot;Last Samurai&quot;. It will start within one hour or so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tama\n&gt; &gt; (still crying for NHK Yamanami)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
