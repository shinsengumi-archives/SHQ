Those people who are not \nsupposed to be reading yaoi or squeamish, please do not download this \ntitle or other manga that has yaoi on it. Will fix the name of that \nso that it says &quot;yaoi&quot; somewhere...\n\n100% sure burai is not yaoi.. :O) But hey most of us like yaoi \nanyway...\n\nHmmm... I&#39;ve checked the server, it&#39;s telling me all the files are \nonline. The only thing I could think of is if someone is currently \ndownloading the same file as you are. Other than that I&#39;m stumped. \nHopefully it&#39;s not a whole lot of chapters that are missing. \n\nWell the server is telling me that the MBs for download is half-way \nthrough so I&#39;m not sure if it will last until the 21st. Those who are \ndownloading jdrama/jfilms are taking the most of the MBs so I took \nthem out last night. They&#39;re back online though so those people can \ncontinue. \n\nFinally, I plan to host the &quot;relevant&quot; files on a different server \nafter this one expires.\n\nThat&#39;s it for now...

Be patient with the service...I got server \nrelated\n&gt; messages saying &quot;x is not available right now etc etc etc&quot; so you \nmay\n&gt; be missing a chapter here and there and you will be informed:\n&gt; ones which gave me trouble RK, Lone Wolf and Cub, Blade of the\n&gt; Immortal, Mononoke Hime (haven&#39;t tried Ghost in the Shell).\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bakumatsu... title is 0_o is yaoi...Okita is basically a young\n&gt; teenage girl (in a man&#39;s body) who falls for Hijikata and fends off\n&gt; advances from the other captains (Saitou included)\n&gt; \n&gt; Burai however is not yaoi (according to other net resources...I&#39;ve\n&gt; only read the translations and scanlations Wounds has provided)...I\n&gt; love Tokio!
