I doubt\nmany people would dare to make that claim seeing how in the short time\nperiod the Shinsengumi existed, their intense record would cause\npeople to divide up different aspects of their duties and battle\ntheatres (Toba Fushimi, Nagarayema, Aizu and Hakodate).\n\nAt the request of SAitou, his secretary has made numerous calls now\nand spoke to 2 different people...all I can say is this JAL has\ncontact info for translators in San Francisco and Torrance...It is UP\nTO THEM to do their part.  If you guys are interested please call them\nand urge them to acquire translators...my goodness there are grad\nstudents who would do this for free.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan&quot; &lt;alanw1911@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m out of the loop, but is Jiro Asada an actual authority on \n&gt; the Shinsengumi?  I know he wrote Mibugishiden, but that&#39;s like \n&gt; saying Tom Clancy is a counter-terrorism expert because he wrote \n&gt; Rainbow Six.  Other than research for his book, is he any more \n&gt; knowledgeable than the next guy?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone have a link for the event, especially the San Francisco one?  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; good and BAD news...the speaker on sept 9 will be Jiro Asada who \n&gt; wrote\n&gt; &gt; Mibugishiden...now for the bad news...no translator...S. \n&gt; California is\n&gt; &gt; home to a huge population of Japanese Americans not to mention \n&gt; major\n&gt; &gt; universities with Japanese language dept.  if you are upset then \n&gt; so am\n&gt; &gt; I!!! I have PERSONALLY encouraged JAL to hire a translator for Mr.\n&gt; &gt; Asada because as a native of CA I know that many anime fansubs are\n&gt; &gt; from these universities.  So I was outraged that JAL would send Mr.\n&gt; &gt; Asada here without a translator.  The lady on the line said that \n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; will speak to her superiors about getting a translator for Mr. \n&gt; Asada\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the S. CA (Torrance) lecture you can only pay with personal \n&gt; check\n&gt; &gt; or money order over the phone and tickets will be mailed to you \n&gt; ASAP...\n&gt; &gt; ...furthermore there will be a second lecture again by Jiro Asada \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; San Francisco on Sept 10 call (415) 765-8545 at the Palo Alto Hotel\n&gt; &gt; but the focus will be more on the Bakumatsu.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bsher213&quot; &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just stumbled across this on a SHisnengumi LJ community I just \n&gt; found\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shinsengumi to Sono Jidai&#39; (Shinsengumi and Their Times)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sept. 9, 2004 - 7:00pm at the Torrance Marriott\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contact JAL&#39;s LA branch at (310)607-2330 for info.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know we  have Californians out there---Someone has to go and \n&gt; bring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us back information and pictures!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barb Sheridan\n\n\n"
