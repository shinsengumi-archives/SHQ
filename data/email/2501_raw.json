I highly \nrecommend these files for people who may in the future create their \nown fictional characters and needed reference material.  There are \nsome humorous moments in the article (^_^)  ::ice skating::\n\nThe article is basicallly about Nisshinkan a school for boys in \nAizu.  Nisshinkan was ranked in the top 5 schools of Japan before \n1868 (I read somewhere it was #3).  It educated boys who later were \npart of the Byakkotai when the domain was besieged by the Imperial \nArmy.\n\nAll domains are unique and this article focuses only on Aizu&#39;s \nNisshinkan however I assume that some of the disciplinary codes may \nbe easily found elsewhere in Japan---it is part of samurai culture.\n\nInterestingly, when I researched Takagi Tokio by examining her \nfamous cousin, Takamine Hideo, his biographer emphasized Nisshinkan \nbecause the dorms for young women in Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School \nemulated the &quot;format&quot; of Nisshinkan (which is not surprising given \nHideo&#39;s background as Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s page).  Ironically, \nduring the early days of the Meiji era dorms for boys lacked \ndiscipline, it was in the 1890s when they returned to their more \nSpartan roots.  Hence, the article was significant for me because \nthe three people from Aizu (Takamine Hideo, Takagi Tokio and \nYamakawa Futaba) all would&#39;ve been very familiar with \nthe &quot;traditional&quot; system and made some adaptions in the Meiji Era.\n\n[notes for the article]\nThe idea of the oldest student supervising the younger ones is \ncalled self-governance---something emphasized in the dorms Takagi \nTokio supervised. \n\nReading out loud still continued into the Meiji Era.  Many \nwesterners who taught at Tokyo University commented that some of \ntheir students had to learn how to read silently when they reached \nthe university level.  They often saw boys moving their lips as they \nread.  Reading out loud was believed to help in absorbing the \nmaterial.\n\nThe strong emphasis on camaraderie/teamwork ofcourse may reflect on \nthe sad end of one Byakkotai unit.\n\n\n\n"
