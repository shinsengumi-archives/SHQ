So I&#39;m refraining from\nsending him to Firuze, our enforcer of internal rules and regulations\n:)  Strangely the board he and I visit discusses violence in the world\nof martial arts (I just hope he understands the original, practical\npurpose of martial arts back in the day LOL)...the only difference is,\n-that- forum has {thousands} of members.\n\nIf anything his email clearly reveals how people don&#39;t really\nunderstand the true face of war...and sometimes they assume other\npeople are just as ignorant.\n\nsecretarytocapt3\n\n\n\n"
