Hijikata actually wasn&#39;t the only Vice-Commander. Yamanami was his equal, so if both Hijikata and Kondo were out that&#39;s the person you would have went to. Of course he was eventually forced to commit seppuku. Also, if you&#39;re doing a story about the very beginning of the Shinsengumi then there were two other Commanders besides Kondo. You&#39;ll probably want to have a look at Serizawa Kamo&#39;s Biography. That site has most all the important members listed and what their positions where, etc.\n\nhttp://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html \n\n-MissBehavin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
