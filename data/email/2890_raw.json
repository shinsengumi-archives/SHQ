Therefore=\r\n, Kondou Isami was \nfirst adopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name Ko=\r\nndou sometime after 1858.  \n\nKatsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamas=\r\na before Souji&#39;s birth (but that&#39;s not the \npoint here.) Rintarou Mototsune=\r\n served as the head of the Okita family for a short time \n(possibly less th=\r\nan a year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head of the family. \nRintaro=\r\nu Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family until Souji \n=\r\ngot married.  Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s son Yoshijirou wo=\r\nuld probably \nhave become Souji&#39;s heir (and would likely have married Souji=\r\n&#39;s eldest daughter.) I suppose \nthat it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s=\r\n son married Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s daughter \ninstead.  However, considering t=\r\nhat Souji&#39;s son would&#39;ve been quite a few years younger \nthan Rintarou Kana=\r\nmasa&#39;s youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this would&#39;ve been the case.\n\n&gt;If o=\r\nne could change their status through purchase or adoption then it&#39;s all jus=\r\nt a \nformality?\nDuring the Bakumatsu? more or less, perhaps.\n\n~Seven\n\n\n--- =\r\nIn SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zhusanna&quot; &lt;wsehome@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Calling on our =\r\nknowlegdeable history people...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why did people change their n=\r\names so much?  It was the samurai&#39;s \n&gt; custom!  Many samurai \n&gt; &gt; changed t=\r\nheir name twice, but Okita had only changed his name \n&gt; once.  Yes, a samur=\r\nai \n&gt; &gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he \n=\r\n&gt; changed his (full) \n&gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyo=\r\nshi.  Why?  I&#39;m \n&gt; not sure...\n&gt; \n&gt; From Wikipedia:\n&gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no t=\r\nime in adopting the young Katsugoro in 1849, who \n&gt; first took the name of =\r\nShimazaki Katsuta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So...What signifi=\r\ncance does the choice of name have?  I thought \n&gt; perhaps a male might choo=\r\nse (if he hasn&#39;t already been given) a name \n&gt; to honor someone in his fami=\r\nly.  In Souji shortening his name from \n&gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end =\r\npart that is like Katsujirou.  And \n&gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retain=\r\ned the Katsu part of his name, \n&gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t=\r\n he separating himself from \n&gt; the Miyakawa family?  Or was he adopted as a=\r\n Shimazaki first?  Could \n&gt; someone be adopted into one family and then int=\r\no another?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ****\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed,=\r\n it&#39;s generally believed \n&gt; that Okita Rintarou \n&gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Oki=\r\nta family for his samurai status (by \n&gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n family and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.)  He \n&gt; serve=\r\nd as a retainer for \n&gt; &gt; young Souji. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Okita family could have=\r\n needed the additional financial support \n&gt; from Rintarou \n&gt; &gt; Mototsune af=\r\nter Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as \n&gt; the head of the =\r\nOkita \n&gt; &gt; family for a short time (not sure how short...) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; First, =\r\nif Katsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be head of the \n&gt; Okita family b=\r\necause Souji was too young...what happened when Souji&#39;s \n&gt; mother married R=\r\nintarou Mototsune?  RM displaced RK as head of the \n&gt; family?  Then after R=\r\nM&#39;s death RK was reinstated?  And what would \n&gt; have happened if Souji had =\r\nlived longer?  Would he have replaced RK?\n&gt; Finally, if one could change th=\r\neir status through purchase or \n&gt; adoption then it&#39;s all just a formality?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks everyone for being patient with my questions!\n&gt; \n&gt; --Wanda\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
