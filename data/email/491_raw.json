It would&#39;ve been =\r\n\nso cool to see Shinpachi and Soujirou as main characters, but most of \nall=\r\n I&#39;ll still have more RK Saitou goodness to read... Remember Aoshi \nsaid Sa=\r\nitou was in Hokkaido... *cries* I wonder how Watsuki would&#39;ve \nportrayed Sh=\r\ninpachi, his relationship with Saitou and all that \ngoodness. \n\nI can&#39;t bel=\r\nieve he chose to deviate from writing historical manga... \nI mean yeah it&#39;s=\r\n been discussed before and many times that the his \nfollowing mangas were n=\r\not &quot;par&quot; with RK. Didn&#39;t he for once think \nthat &quot;I will be the King of His=\r\ntorical Manga&quot;. Why oh why did he \nstopped...\n\n~wounds\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Mary-Ann&quot; &lt;maryannsfanfic@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt; \n&gt; Barb and Tiffan=\r\ny=85 thanks for the quick feedback. It&#39;s good to know \n&gt; that the interview=\r\n interested you. (^-^) I hadn&#39;t thought about \n&gt; putting it in the files se=\r\nction, but it&#39;s a good idea and it&#39;s \n&gt; definitely the next thing I&#39;m going=\r\n to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who didn&#39;t knew, &quot;Gun Blaze West&quot; was Watsuki&#39;s next=\r\n \nmanga \n&gt; and its publication stopped after only three volumes as the stor=\r\ny \nwas \n&gt; not a huge success. After RK, the fans&#39; expectations were really =\r\n\n&gt; high=85 Those three volumes have been translated and published in \n&gt; Ger=\r\nman anyway and some group in France are trying to convince \nGl=E9nat \n&gt; (RK=\r\n&#39;s publisher) to translate it as well. I don&#39;t know if it will \n&gt; work, but=\r\n it&#39;s true that even if the story wasn&#39;t successful in \n&gt; Japan, many RK fa=\r\nns will probably buy it just to see=85 (I&#39;m \ndefinitely \n&gt; among them).\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Watsuki wrote the one-shot &quot;Meteor Strike&quot; for a contest in Shonen \n&gt; Jum=\r\np. That one-shot has been enclosed at the end of the French \n&gt; version of R=\r\nK vol. 28. In his notes about that story, Watsuki says \n&gt; that it revolved =\r\naround three themes: a meteor, a young boy wearing \n&gt; construction gloves, =\r\nand a young girl wearing a helmet. Watsuki \nsays \n&gt; that it&#39;s a &quot;moronic&quot; s=\r\ntory, but it&#39;s not that bad. There are a few \n&gt; very good jokes\n&gt; \n&gt; Mary-A=\r\nnn (^-^)\n\n\n"
