My IM name is: captsaitou \n\n2) How did you discover the Shinsengumi?\n\nIn 1910, I was on an archeological dig in Egypt and suddenly was\ntransported through a wormhole to Mibu, wherein I met Okita Souji and\nsold him my armwarmers for underneath his arm guards.  In return, he\ngave me food and tuberculosis.  After a few weeks, I died of\ncomplications, and was later reincarnated to the form you see now. \nUnfortunately, I recall nothing of this adventure, which has only been\nrevealed to me through the mystical sayings I find on fortune cookies.\n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?\n\nYes.  Okita Souji.  I find his life to be so symbolic and inspiring. \nI feel very awed by his abilities, especially his ability to continue\nfighting as long as he could.  I have had lung problems all my life,\nstemming from a rare lung disease I had as a child, so he is quite\ninspiring to me, and I wish to emulate his spirit and fervor in my\ndaily life.\n\nNext on my list would be Harada Sanosuke, or Genzaburou Inoue.  Harada\nbecause most of the portrayals I have seen of him crack me up, and\nGen-san because I think he is -most- misunderstood and not given his due.\n\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\n\nThe usual.  I haven&#39;t seen Band of Assassins, though.  And, I have\nmuch of NHK left to watch.\n\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you \nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?\n\nOh!  Most definitely, Shinsengumi Keppuroku best captured Okita.  I\nthink he is a very hard character to get right, so I applaud them.  It\nis too easy to make him -too- goofy or innocent, or just completely\ndrown him in the tragedy of his own life.  I think SK did a good job\nof balancing many aspects which are often taken to extremes.\n\nAs for Harada, I have not seen all of NHK, but what I&#39;ve seen of him\nso far really amuses me.  \n\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a decent portrayal, to my satisfaction,\nof Gen-san.\n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any \nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?\n\nNot at the moment. \n\nAngrybee\n\n\n\n\n"
