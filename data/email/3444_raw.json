With Aizu \nit&#39;s always interesting to think of it a bit like=\r\n the California State Military \nReserve being asked to travel across the co=\r\nuntry to Washington D.C. and \nprotect it from anti-government elements, som=\r\ne of whom are also from \nother states.  People in Kyoto must&#39;ve been distur=\r\nbed by the influx \nof &quot;foreigners&quot;.\n\nDuring the Meiji Era you also have a m=\r\novement of government personel \nfrom the center, Tokyo, outwards to all reg=\r\nions and in that era in the form \nof administrators, teachers and military =\r\nleaders.\n\n\n"
