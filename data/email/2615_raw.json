From the Okita family record, as quoted in &quot;101 Mysteries of the \nShinsengumi,&quot; by Kikuchi Akira. pp 24-25\n\nChicago-style reference:\n\nKikuchi Akira, Shinsengumi 101 no Nazo (Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 2000)\n\nAnd now, without further ado, the information:\n\nSoji&#39;s sisters:\n\n-Mitsu was born on Tenpo 4, April 8 (May 20, 1833 by the Western calendar).\n-Kin was born on Tenpo 7, April 11 (May 25, 1836 by the Western calendar).\n\nMarriage:\n\n\n-In Koka 3 (1846), at age 14, Mitsu married Inoue Rintaro, younger brother \nof Inoue Sozo, who was related to Inoue Genzaburo.\n\n-Inoue Rintaro, by marrying into the Okita family as an adopted heir, became \n(full name) Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Mototsune. Later became a captain in \nthe Shinchogumi.\n\n-Kin, according to the family record, married Tatebayashi senior councilor \nNakano Den&#39;emon Yoshihide. However, in reality, she married Mineyama \nretainer Nakano Dennojo Yoshihide (stipend-- 23 hyo, 3 retainer allotments).\n\nChildren:\n\n-In Man&#39;ei 6 Jan. 26 (Western style- 1853 April 5), their first son \nYoshijiro was born.\n-Ansei 2 Jul. 17 (Western style- 1855 August 29), 1st daughter Ishi was \nborn.\n-Genji 1, Oct. 26 (Western style- 1864 Nov. 25), 2nd daughter Kuma born.\n-Meiji 11 (1878) Jul. 12, 2nd son Sugukichi ��g born (not sure of the name \nreading).\n\nResidence:\n\n\n-In 1863, Mitsu and Rintaro moved to Yotsuya Tenmacho Itchome.\n\n-In 1863, Rintaro joined the Roshigumi, which went to Kyoto, came back, and \nbecame Shinchogumi, under the sponsorship of the Shonai domain. At that \npoint, they moved to a kumi-yashikiat the former site of the mansion of \nTanuma Harushige. They lived there until the Boshin War.\n\n-Keio 4, Feb. 26 (March 19, 1868 in the Western style), the family left Edo \nat the orders of Shonai.\n\n-Meiji 5, they returned to Tokyo, lived in a place called the &quot;Ume-yashiki&quot; \n(Plum Mansion) in Sumida-Mukaijima. Rintaro died on Feb. 13, Meiji 16 (1883) \nat age 58.\n\n-Mitsu then lived in Shiogama in the former Sendai domain.\n-On Jan. 26, Meiji 28 (1895), Mitsu returned to Hino, lived with Inoue \nKyuzaburo.\n\n-Soon after, Ishi married, and then Sugukichi went to Manchuria. Mitsu \nfollowed him there in Meiji 39, dying there on Nov. 2, Meiji 40 (1907), at \naround 10 in the morning, without returning home.\n\nNOTE: Even though the story about Harada Sanosuke escaping to Manchuria is \nprobably fake, it&#39;s very easy to imagine him checking in on Mitsu now and \nthen. Might be good material for a fanfic!\n\n-Kin died April 2, Meiji 41 (1908). According to her son Nakano Kanzaburo, \nshe died around the same time of the morning as Mitsu did-- 10 AM.\n\n\n\n"
