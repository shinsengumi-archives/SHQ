I missed it! I hate when I have to work on the weekends!\n\nKill was on last weekend too. If you didn&#39;t see it then you really ought to check it out when it comes on again. It had a pretty good story and plenty of humor. The fellow playing the former-Samurai-turned-Yakuza/hero wasn&#39;t bad looking either... \n\n-MissBehavin, who vows to never miss another Samurai movie on IFC again.\n\n"
