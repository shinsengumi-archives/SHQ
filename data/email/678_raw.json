But that is why I love him... I used to think of him as \na &quot;filler&quot;, a cameo... Actually I thought the same about Tetsu, \nprobably because I started watching only to see the Shinsengumi \nbishies ^_^ Back to Suzu, it&#39;s so obvious that there&#39;s promise in \nhis character. I just hope like you, that the writers handle the \nwhole thing correctly. Right now if the anime continued, he&#39;d be the \nguy hating both the Ishin-shishis and the Miburos, which is why he&#39;s \nso interesting. Which way will he go? What is the alternate route?\n\nAh! Yes.. I remember you posted that tour... I think I forgot about \nit since I didn&#39;t have decent internet connection back then... Will \ngo and see...\n\nThanks for trying to find out... From the stuff that I read it said \nit started with SIP not PMK. Miss Barbara took it a step further and \nsaid PMK is ongoing and just past the Ikeda-ya incident... I will \ncheck Fifay.net too....\n\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;tnamwong@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Really? Suzu?  I used to feel sorry for him too but now I feel \nkind of\n&gt; scared of him 0_O  I think the writers have to show some real skill\n&gt; and not just rely on the &quot;you killed my teacher&quot; excuse (which was\n&gt; parodied in Kill Bill Vol. 2)...PMK, I love it I love it, but \nthere is\n&gt; sooo much of the evil twin model.  Yoshida is the evil twin for\n&gt; Hijikata, Okita has an evil twin, and Susu is Tetsu&#39;s evil twin...I\n&gt; know even RK  kind of has the evil twin model but in PMK it is very\n&gt; very pronounced.\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw your Maekawa residence pics...there is an actual tour you can\n&gt; download at http://www.the-shinsengumi.com/ (the link is in the \nmiddle\n&gt; of the sword)...and they show the floorboards the rooms etc and the\n&gt; tour guides act like they are all scared etc...funny\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried to answer your question by going to fifay.net but the \naddress\n&gt; keeps &quot;timing out&quot;...and as of right now it is still &quot;timing out&quot; \nbut\n&gt; I think fifay.net has the answer to your question\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Somehow though, my favorite character \n&gt; &gt; changed from Susumu to Suzu. I feel so sorry for him... The \nending \n&gt; &gt; definitely gives good way for a second series which might not be \ntoo \n&gt; &gt; far off if ADV does license the anime... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;  whether the Anime started \n&gt; &gt; with the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker or Peacemaker Kurogane \nmanga. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maekawa residence particularly the storehouse where \n&gt; &gt; they did the interrogation of prisoners. The site is in Japanese \nand \n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t find it in my bookmarks right now... Sorry, I&#39;ll put it \nup \n&gt; &gt; once I find it. Anyway, the pics are in the location section of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; photos.\n\n\n"
