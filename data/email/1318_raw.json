Someone was \n&gt; apparently recreating the medicine Hijikata sold to see if it \nreally \n&gt; worked or not. Unfortunately the translator refused to make clear \n&gt; what the results were! Oh well... One thing of interest that did \ncome \n&gt; up was the fact that the method for making the medicine was \nsupposed \n&gt; to have been given to the family by a kappa through a dream. \n(Oddly \n&gt; enough there are many tales in the Faery lore of Western Europe \nthat \n&gt; have people learning medicine from river-dwelling faery.)\n&gt; The site is:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.tpa-kitatama.jp/shinsengumi/shinsengumi_index.html\n&gt; \n&gt; There was another site I glanced through that seems to have info \non \n&gt; the Shinsengumi&#39;s movements during various battles (like Toba-\n&gt; Fushimi), but the translator didn&#39;t make enough sense of them for \nme \n&gt; to know who was doing what or why. Perhaps someone else can make \n&gt; heads or tails of it, so I&#39;ll include the link here.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://haruna.on.arena.ne.jp/index.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin\n\n\n"
