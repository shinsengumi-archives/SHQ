This can be so much fun... like an early Christmas for the Shinsengumi fan.  November 8th we can log on and open up new fanfic. (And it&#39;ll be new to me, too, &#39;cause I won&#39;t be reading it until everyone else does. Screwy formats won&#39;t be *my* fault.)  It&#39;s always better to get more \nthan less, right?  Isn&#39;t that the way Christmas works?  :-)\n&gt;R you sure?  I heard it was the seson of giving . . . but I guess this works too ^ ^;;;\n\nphil (who&#39;d be NOWHERE with this story without Masayoshi)\n&gt;I totally agree with you on this one.  Can&#39;t forget Tiffany too.\n\n\nvisit \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n\nYahoo!
