I&#39;m an East Asian Studies major, focusing on \nJapanese history, although I have an active interest in world history, as \nwell. My recommendation to aspiring historians is to study historiography \nfirst, and if they are doing an area study like I am, learn to read, write, \nand speak the language of the area. I can NOT stress enough how helpful that \nit&#39;s been to know Japanese...\n\nIf you have any more questions, just feel free to contact me privately. It&#39;s \nmy mission to spread history, especially Japanese history, and make it \naccessible to all.\n\nOh...and if I could sum all this up in one sentence, it would be &quot;Keep the \nbigger picture in mind.&quot;\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
