BS know=\r\ns the review cannot be disputed because\nthose are facts which BS cannot rec=\r\noncile with the text which was\ndesigned a &quot;certain way&quot; to push a certain i=\r\nnterpretation.\n\nShinsengumi enthusiasts in their native land -do- read and =\r\ndiscuss the\nsame issues we do here, they review books as well too.  This is=\r\n not a\nmatter of taking &quot;sides&quot; if some Japanese read BS they may say worst=\r\n\nand they&#39;ll even throw more sources at BS to prove the text wrong\npoint by=\r\n point.\n\nAnyone can see the official page of BS on a well known internet bo=\r\nok\nstore.\n\nThere were some interesting reviews there too.\n\nThe difference b=\r\netween those reviews and what BS was unhappy is that\nthe review -deleted- b=\r\nasically nailed the text.\n\nBS needs to go and argue with the Japanese autho=\r\nrs not the messenger\nwho quoted those works.\n\n-----------------------------=\r\n----------------\nPeople have taken similar cases on free speech to the supr=\r\neme court\nyou know.  \n\nAnd look at us...I&#39;ve been fair and even pimped the =\r\nbook on SHQ! \nSerious, we probably comprise a large number of people who bo=\r\nught the\nwork too...\n\nWhat is BS saying? &quot;thanks for buying my BS, but you =\r\ncan&#39;t find errors\nin it otherwise I get unhappy&quot;\n\nThese posts do not mentio=\r\nn any names at all.  There are no grounds for\nlegal action or intimidation =\r\nwhatsover.  I had to delete stuff cuz\nsomeone wanted to exercise understand=\r\nably the utmost caution.\nAgain BS would have to prove the work is BS (^_^)\n=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWhen we post a short, concis=\r\ne essay about how the Imperial Army was\nfounded illegally:\n\n1) waged war il=\r\nlegally via the use of a FORGED IMPERIAL\nEDICT--resulting in the deaths of =\r\ncountless of civilians in Aizu and\nnorthern domains\n2) bore illegal Imperia=\r\nl standards (because some were made by Okubo\nToshimichi---this was from a &quot;=\r\npro&quot; Okubo bio! ^_^ )\n3) stole bakufu property (the STONEWALL battleship) a=\r\nnd in one\ncase...bakufu guns (this undermines the popular view that the\nsho=\r\ngunate was not modernizing, if it wasn&#39;t how come it had so many\ntoys the I=\r\nmperialists wanted? The bakufu not the Meiji had already\nbrought in French =\r\npersonel for modernizing the army!).\n4) first democratic elections (ok it&#39;s=\r\n just a small group of guys)\ntook place amongst samurai at Hakodate---buy t=\r\nhe remnants of the\nbakufu men (Enomoto, western educated, and our Hijikata =\r\nToshizo). \n\nThe list can go on and on and everything above is from good tex=\r\nts.\n\nThese are not popular views but they are the finer details sacrificed\n=\r\nfor the sake of a master narrative designed for a people to feel\nfierce pri=\r\nde for their nation---without understanding we&#39;re all human\nbeings, we&#39;re a=\r\nll good and bad---what&#39;s up with the LIES?  \n\nAnd all this info is gonna ap=\r\npear on a humble fansite, all shock full\nof citation (^_^).\n\nAnyone who wan=\r\nts to question us can go right ahead, cross check our\nwork a million times.=\r\n\n\nWe&#39;re not afraid of a different opinion because we stick to the facts.\n T=\r\nhey can present their facts in the same way and we&#39;ll put stuff side\nby sid=\r\ne.  \n\nSuddenly the Boshin war takes on a new dimension and then you start t=\r\no\n understand why people were mad, why they fought and why blood was shed.\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"
