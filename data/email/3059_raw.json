It is believed to have been\nrecorded by Shinsengumi off=\r\nicer Yamazaki Susumu, whose name appears on\nthe front and back covers. Alth=\r\nough it cannot be confirmed that the\ndocument was actually written by Yamaz=\r\naki, the Hino City Furusato\nMuseum, in Hino City, Tokyo, has issued a state=\r\nment that &quot;it was\ndefinitely written by someone who knew much about the inn=\r\ner-affairs of\nthe Shinsengumi.&quot;\n\nThe document measures 7.6 cm x 16.5 cm and=\r\n consists of 42 pages, some\nof which have been torn out. The contents inclu=\r\nde a copy of infantry\ntraining records and a list of 148 Shinsengumi corpsm=\r\nen =AD beginning\nwith the slightly elevated names of Kondo Isami and Hijika=\r\nta Toshizo.\n(Okita Soji, Nagakura Shinpachi, Inoue Genzaburo and Todo Heisu=\r\nke\nfollow in that order. Harada Sanosuke and Saito Hajime appear as\nnumbers=\r\n 7 and 8. Yamazaki Susumu=B9s name is 12th on the list.) Above\neach name is=\r\n a number between 1 and 8, indicating the number of the\nsquad that the man =\r\nbelonged to. Near some of the names are written the\nwords &quot;seppuku&quot; and &quot;de=\r\nserted&quot; =AD and even the date (June 21) that two\nof the men disemboweled th=\r\nemselves =AD adding to the value of the\ndocument as an on-the-scene report.=\r\n Although there exist several\nvaluable written and oral memoirs of former S=\r\nhinsengumi corpsmen,\nincluding Nagakura Shinpachi, Shimada Kai and Shinohar=\r\na Yasunoshin,\nthe &quot;Yamazaki Journal&quot; is one of few remaining documents writ=\r\nten\nduring the actual time period. It is also important as an indication\nof=\r\n the rank of the corpsmen and the Shinsengumi organization in\nmid-1865, alt=\r\nhough it differs slightly from another list of the same\nperiod recorded by =\r\nShimada.\n\n\nYamazaki Susumu, believed to have been an expert with a wooden s=\r\ntaff,\nserved as a spy for the Shinsengumi. He was involved in the arrest of=\r\n\nanti-Tokugawa activist Furudaka Shuntaro in June 1864, leading to the\nnoto=\r\nrious Ikeda=B9ya Incident, a turning point in the revolution.\n\nThe current =\r\nowner of the document claims to be a descendent of an\nOsaka merchant family=\r\n with ties to Kondo Isami. The document was\nexhibited at the Hino City Furu=\r\nsato Museum (Hinoshi Furusato\nHakubutuskan) in November and December of 200=\r\n4.\n\n\n[Sources: Asahi Shimbun, November 13, 2004; Hinoshi Furusato\nHakubutus=\r\nkan Web site]\n\n\n"
