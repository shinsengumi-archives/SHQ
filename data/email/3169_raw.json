It should work, though.  And I&#39;ve seen the site\nwith the info on who=\r\n went where, so I am going to incorporate that\ninfo into one version of the=\r\n floorplan as well.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Chuck Harris &lt;chuckjharris=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a small map at \n&gt; http://www.ryozen-museum.or.jp/=\r\n040424ikedaya.html that looks like it \n&gt; includes at least a few more dimen=\r\nsions (along with some photos of a \n&gt; very nice diorama of the Ikedaya and =\r\na couple of architectural drawings \n&gt; showing the outside of the building).=\r\n Unfortunately, the resolution of \n&gt; the image is too low for me to read th=\r\ne text and I was unable to find a \n&gt; larger version.\n&gt; \n&gt; FWIW, there is al=\r\nso http://www.webvider.com/ikedaya/index.html , which \n&gt; mentions an estima=\r\nted plan size, but I think the author extrapolated \n&gt; that based on the tat=\r\nami sizes (my Japanese reading skills are poor at \n&gt; best, so please take m=\r\ny interpretations with a grain of salt). It also \n&gt; various other informati=\r\non like an elevation plan of the inn (which \n&gt; finally let me get my head a=\r\nround the structure) and even a few photos, \n&gt; along with information about=\r\n where various members were during the raid.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, I found a compan=\r\ny that sells a papercraft model of the Ikedaya \n&gt; at http://craft.dosue.jp/=\r\ncraft/machiya/ikedaya.html (along with some \n&gt; other interesting models, su=\r\nch as \n&gt; http://craft.dosue.jp/craft/others/doll.html). I have currently no=\r\nt\nbeen \n&gt; able to ascertain whether they will ship outside of Japan (their =\r\nold \n&gt; site would not allow it, but they have recently changed hosting \n&gt; p=\r\nroviders and their email from the new site bounces).\n&gt;\n\n\n"
