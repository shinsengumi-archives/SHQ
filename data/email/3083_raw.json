Or does Hillsborough just jump around too much in his book?\n\nI&#39;ve never seen Hillsborough&#39;s book (yet) but I think he&#39;s mixing two \nevents. After Ikedaya, the Bakufu offered to give Kondou a position as a \n&quot;yoriki&quot;-- a police inspector. This would have made him a functionary of the \nBakufu and for all practical purposes, at least a gokenin (2nd-tier vassal) \nif not a hatamoto (direct vassal). He refused at that point. However, a few \nyears later when the bakushin-toritate of 1867 happened, he did not refuse-- \nhe became a hatamoto, and even became a wakadoshiyori (junior councilor). \nThis is, in my opinion, yet another instance of Hillsborough getting very \ncocky with his limited understanding of (a) Shogunal procedure and protocol \nand (b) his confused and confusing narrative, and creating something that, \nwhile not a lie, is not really the truth, either.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
