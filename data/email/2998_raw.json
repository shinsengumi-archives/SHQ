I&#39;ve read/heard many diffrent reasons, the most popular is that he wasn&#39;t happy with the way the Shinsengumi was heading.   He disagreed with many of Kondou&#39;s views and ways of doing things.    The Shinsengumi did not hold the same values (I guess you can say) from when they had first began and this seemed to trouble him.\n\nThats pretty much all I know it a nutshell ^^;\n\n-Bunneh\n\n^________________^\n\n \t\n---------------------------------\nEveryone is raving about the  all-new Yahoo!
