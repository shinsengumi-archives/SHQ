Basically the\n&gt; jagged-edge design. Although the Shinsengumi color scheme (and our\n&gt; guys did change their uniform later) may be different the intent to\n&gt; evoke the 47 ronin was the goal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Over time the black-white &quot;look&quot; was incorporated into Shinsengumi\n&gt; media perhaps to add more variety.\n&gt;\n&gt; You see the uniform/design in many places. Even in movements which\n&gt; also claim to stand for &quot;loyalty&quot; for whatever reason:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRxK0wsgL4Q\n&gt; (2 min 30 sec vid)\n&gt;\n&gt; please click on the outstanding write up provided by &quot;ONIAZUMA&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It is also interesting to note that many Bakumatsu groups like the\n&gt; Shinsengumi, Byakkotai (Aizu) and even the Sekihoutai! have all at\n&gt; one point or another been hijacked for right-wing, militarists\n&gt; purposes because history belongs to &quot;everybody&quot; and they become fair\n&gt; game for people with an agenda.\n&gt;\n&gt; These crazy fringe groups ofcourse do not represent all Japanese\n&gt; people. They are just being outspoken due to the increasingly\n&gt; conservative political climate in Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt; -------SHQ WEBSITE TECH REPORT--------\n&gt; we are in the testing phase of a database search engine thingy\n&gt; it is not just a one line [search] function...it will allow for\n&gt; comparative and elimination type searches for example:\n&gt;\n&gt; [keyword 1] (and/or/not) [keyword 2]\n&gt;\n&gt; for instance:\n&gt;\n&gt; Saitou Hajime (not) Itou Kashitarou\n&gt;\n&gt; or\n&gt;\n&gt; Saitou Hajime (and) Itou Kashitarou\n&gt;\n&gt; unfortunately the search will not be &quot;yaoi&quot; dynamic such as Saitou\n&gt; (x) Itou...
