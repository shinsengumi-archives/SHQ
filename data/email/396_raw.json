I think one can\nstart to understand how hard their job was to patrol the streets (if\nyou think about it they were easy pickings/moving targets/with their\nuniforms and all) at night.  The Ishin Shishi on the other hand, were\nhard to weed out from the populace.  Because my museum catalog has\ntons of scrolls/lists/poetry/letters I figure there may be info on the\ndaily official routine of these guys.  Time to wake up, Time to be\nready for patrols, Time to practice in the dojo, Time to be back at\nheadquarters [rumor] I read &quot;somewhere&quot; (again the mysterious\n&quot;somewhere&quot;) that no matter what the guys had to return to\nheadquarters at night---no matter how late...I wonder if a curfew was\nimposed at some point when the activities of the Ishin Shishi became\nmore bold.\n\nSecretarytocapt3\nwho is beginning to wonder if she is mixing fanfiction with reality\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n(oh, wouldn&#39;t it be so cool if we could camp out at the temple in Mibu??)\n\n\n"
