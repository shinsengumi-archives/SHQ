Thanks\nfor the translation of the newspaper article Miss B.  Actually the\nlocation Ichigo mentioned in relation to Fujita G is mentioned in\nSeinan War books (one of the 2 Japanese books I mentioned had a pic of\nKawaji which made sense seeing how he was actually one of the field\ngenerals in this war).  \n\nFrom what I&#39;ve read so far, it would be ridiculous if more recent\nbooks in English fail to mention the TMPD because they seemed to have\ndone most of the fighting (I also have stats to prove this as well)\nand you would come across an entire police unit under siege at\nKumamoto Castle.  I think that newspaper articles were based on spy\ninfo because even in the account of the siege of Kumamoto Castle we\nhave the name of one guy who ran around dressed as a peasant\ncollecting/delivering alot of info.  Furthermore, they seemed to have\nbeen put in front of alot of skirmishes which made me wonder how\nimportant demographics are in this war (government thinks: many of\nthese guys are from Aizu, might as well put them on the front lines).\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n&gt; In a message dated 6/5/2004 3:34:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time,\nsecretarytocapt3@h... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Subj:  [SHQ] Saigo vs. Toshiyoshi (you guys may know this already)\n&gt; &gt;   Date:  6/5/2004 3:34:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time\n&gt; &gt;   From:  &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   To:  SHQ@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;   Reply-To:  SHQ@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;   Sent from the Internet (Details)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~Sorry~ if this is old info for you guys -or- if it gives away a \n&gt; &gt; fanfic in progress....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [I will also be posting this message at http://www.shinsengumimb.com \n&gt; &gt; so when you see it in the history section just use the &quot;mark forum \n&gt; &gt; read&quot; feature]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; According to &quot;The Satsuma Rebellion of 1877 From Kagoshima Through \n&gt; &gt; the Siege of Kumamoto Castle&quot; by James H. Buck\n&gt; &gt; Monumenta Nipponica, Vol 28 no. 4 (Winter 1973) 427-446\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [my summary]...will appear in my Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept. \n&gt; &gt; write up too...I&#39;m just so happy that hours of research turned up \n&gt; &gt; something new for me atleast...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Imperial government attempted a secret ammunitions seizure from \n&gt; &gt; Kagoshima (officially under government but prior to the Restoration \n&gt; &gt; property of Satsuma clan)...the government was unsuccessful as 1,000 \n&gt; &gt; Satsuma men drove off the gov&#39;s naval force.\n&gt; &gt; Saigo T. was unaware of this situation.  When Saigo T. returned to \n&gt; &gt; Kagoshima, Nakahara Hisao was charged with plotting to assasinate \n&gt; &gt; Saigo T.  Furthermore, Nakahara H. confessed to meeting with Kawaji \n&gt; &gt; Toshiyoshi, Chief Inspector of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept \n&gt; &gt; (and native of Satsuma).  We don&#39;t know if Nakahara&#39;s words are to \n&gt; &gt; be trusted however at least 50 members of the Tokyo Police Dept who \n&gt; &gt; were natives of Satsuma returned to Kagoshima in 1876-1877 at the \n&gt; &gt; same time a high-ranking Tokyo official was sent to &quot;adjust Tokyo&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; relations with Satsuma leadership.&quot; &quot;Some even advocated immediate \n&gt; &gt; execution of the &#39;traitors&#39; from the Tokyo Police Department.&quot;(page \n&gt; &gt; 430)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, it is quiet obvious that Kawaji had been monitoring his own \n&gt; &gt; Satsuma domain for some time and used Satsuma policemen as spies.\n&gt; &gt; The article also give some more info on how Satsuma remained \n&gt; &gt; rebellious against various policies,from the government they put in \n&gt; &gt; power, imposed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
