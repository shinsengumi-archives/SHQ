In searching for the title, I came upon Roger Ebert&#39;s review of it and laughed all over again ---\n \n&quot;The hero is Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a lone rider with a quizzical smile, who rides a semi instead of a horse. Along with some friends, he stages a search for the perfect noodle restaurant but cannot find it.&quot;\n \nIn addition to the title, I&#39;d forgotten the main character was named &quot;Goro&quot;!!  :-D   Maybe there was something to this idea of Saitou/Fujita being a soba aficionado?  Sounds like the perfect plot for an RK parody.  (I can even imagine it as a PMK parody... the search being somewhat more mystical...)\n \nIt&#39;s a hilarious film... check it out if you get the chance.\n \nphil\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
