He later accompanied former Aizu retainer Yamakawa\nHiros=\r\nhi to the Seinan War (Satsuma Rebellion) in 1877.  Morinosuke\neventually be=\r\ncame a Chief Prosecutor and collaborated with other\nprominent Aizu men in v=\r\narious efforts to develop their home and\npreserve history.\nMore info and pi=\r\nc of his grave here\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\n\nThe bo=\r\nok NUMASAWA MICHIKO-KUN DEN was printed in **1913** by Numasawa\nKohachiro (=\r\nor Shichiro).\nTokio was 67\nFujita Goro was 69\nNumasawa Tatsuo (born Fujita =\r\nTatsuo) was 26 (secretly adopted out to\nNumasawa Shichiro/Kohachiro as an i=\r\nnfant).\n\nThe book was written by Takagi MOrinusuke and SAIGO TANOMO (one of=\r\n 2\nretainers who had warned MATSUDAIRA KATAMORI from accepting the post\nof =\r\n&quot;Protector of Kyoto&quot;).\n\nSaigo Tanomo died in 1905 thus this book seemed to =\r\nprimarily be the\neffort of Takagi Morinusuke.\n\nNumasawa Michiko was the aun=\r\nt of TOKIO.  \nNumasawa Michiko, her mother in law and daughters committed s=\r\nuicide\nduring the attack by the IMperial Army leaving Numasawa Shichiro to\n=\r\nfight at the age of 15.  \n\nThus the scans are of a book Tokio would have re=\r\nad...surely these\nwords took her back to 1868 and brought tears to her eyes=\r\n.  \n\njust sample pages\nhttps://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/TakagiM.zip=\r\n\n1.20 MB\n\nSomething to consider---did TOKIO herself assist in the preparati=\r\non of\nthis book?  I know that another major historical book prepared by\nYam=\r\nakawa Kenjiro came about through interviews at the Matsudaira\nestate in Kyo=\r\nto...did this book undergo a similar process?\n\nTo many of us just &quot;adopting=\r\n out&quot; a son is jarring to our modern\nsentiments---however our job is to und=\r\nerstand WHY.  Numasawa Shichiro\nand his wife requested Fujita Goro & Tokio&#39;=\r\ns child (if it was a girl\nthey would keep her) but the Numasawas needed a B=\r\nOY to continued their\nlineage.  Have an heir to the family name was crucial=\r\n to many 19th\ncentury Japanese.  Numasawa Tatsuo somehow became suspicious =\r\nabout his\nparentage and learned the truth in college from an aunt Ibuka Sak=\r\nu. \nUnderstandably the news devastated him.  \n\nTakagi Morinusuke and Numasa=\r\nwa Shichiro were close.\nWe know that Fujita Goro often stayed at Morinusuke=\r\n&#39;s home when\nvisiting his family&#39;s grave.  Was that how Fujita Goro and Tok=\r\nio kept\ntrack of their third son?  Did Numasawa Tatsuo&#39;s career in the fiel=\r\nd\nof law come from his uncle Morinusuke&#39;s mentoring? \n\nLastly, perhaps this=\r\n book wasn&#39;t enough...Tokio did write a letter to\nher last son 1 month befo=\r\nre Fujita Goro died in 1915.\n\n\n\n\n"
