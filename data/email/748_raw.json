He was a gradu=\r\nate of the =C9cole Polytechnique, and he \nspecialized in artillery. He arri=\r\nved in Yokohama in the beginning of \n1867. \nSNIP\n&gt;&gt;However, Jules Brunet ch=\r\nose to remain. He resigned from the French \narmy, and left for the North of=\r\n Japan with the remains of the \nShogunate&#39;s armies in the hope of staging a=\r\n counter-attack. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Jules Brunet helped set up the Ezo Republic, with th=\r\ne leader of the \nJapanese shogunate&#39;s navy, Admiral Enomoto Takeaki, as the=\r\n President. \nThe final stand occurred in the northern island of Hokkaido, i=\r\nn the \ncity of Hakodate, where in June 1869 the shogunate forces lost a \nfi=\r\nnal battle between 800 shogunate soldiers and an 8000-strong \nImperial army=\r\n. \n\nThank you so much, Firuze, for finding this!!!\n\nWhy, oh, *WHY* didn&#39;t t=\r\nhe writers leave the story as it was!!! Why \nchoose Saigou when they had En=\r\nomoto and Hijikata!  (I can just see \nthat final battle being led by Hijika=\r\nta... could Uijo have been \npatterned after him, I wonder?  So much fire, s=\r\nuch a demon!)  Make \nthe foreigner an American if they had to... things don=\r\ne in the US \nCivil War were gruesome enough (Tiff, I grew up near a Civil W=\r\nar \nbattlefield and while Arkansas never saw the bloodshed the deep South \n=\r\ndid, it was still very much felt... maybe all battlefields have this, \nbut =\r\nPea Ridge and other Civil War sites I&#39;ve been to felt haunted and \nthere wa=\r\ns a sense of deep reverence about that piece of land --- \ncompletely unlike=\r\n the scenes of bloodshed at locations here in \nArizona... Tombstone, the Sa=\r\nlt River Canyon (it doesn&#39;t take much to \nsee Apache braves standing guard =\r\namidst the rocks) and some of the \nancient Moqui (Anasazi) ruins are the on=\r\nly places I&#39;ve felt that kind \nof aura lingering) and there had been plenty=\r\n of fighting Native \nAmericans before Custer made an ignominious name for h=\r\nimself. \n(Naturally, the ONE thing I find believable about Katsumoto being =\r\n\nSaigou --- the connection to Custer --- and they completely buried it \nby =\r\nmaking him a victim... very subtle... too subtle for most people \nto get.  =\r\nI also much prefer referencing Thermopylae in regards to \nthose fighting in=\r\n Ezo, though it does apply to those honestly trying \nto keep the samurai wa=\r\ny of life alive in Satsuma.)\n\nPsht... this is just all personal thinking ou=\r\nt loud.  New things to \nthink about when I watch it the second time.  If an=\r\nything, I&#39;d \nrecommend it for the chance to step into Meiji Japan in living=\r\n color \nand Dolby sound (even if it was shot in New Zealand, which I knew \n=\r\nthanks to this household being Lord of the Rings crazy).  There&#39;s \nsuch a c=\r\nlaustrophic feeling to Yokohama & Tokyo and that odd \ndisparity between the=\r\n old world with telegraph posts and lines \neverywhere that is so unlike the=\r\n wide streets in anime, and the weird \nmix of men in western suits walking =\r\namong people still wearing \ntraditional clothing.  When Katsumoto walks int=\r\no the council, the \nonly one still in traditional garb... it was so suffoca=\r\nting compared \nto council scenes of earlier times you see from samurai film=\r\n.  The \natmosphere is worth taking in.\n\nAnd, MissB, that story idea I talke=\r\nd to you about has just been \nturned in a lot of new directions, for the be=\r\ntter I think... even if \nSaigou has to become more than a black&white bad g=\r\nuy.  What goes \naround, comes around, ne?  :-D\n\nphil (still reeling)\n\n\n\n"
