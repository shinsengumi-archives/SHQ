I emailed\na question knowing that answer in the back of my mind...I did so\nbecause if theories are still out there then websites should state\nthat rather than saying X killed X and not mention that there could be\nmore than one possibility.\n\nMr. Hillsborough says that he wrote a book on the Shinsengumi and it\nwill be released this fall...he will also address the above mentioned\nissue in the\nbook.\n\n\n"
