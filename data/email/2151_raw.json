Apparently there was a book or a series of some sort \nabout Hijikata when he was growing up in Ishida (about 15 years old) \ncalled &quot;Baragaki&quot;. He was supposed to be a real brat in it. It must \nhave not gone over so well. Anyway, I finally found some reference to \nthe thing here:\nhttp://rau.milkcafe.to/makoto/itadaki/book/baragaki.htm\n\nAlso, it seems there must be (or there was) some sort of Shinsengumi \ncard game out there:\nhttp://rau.milkcafe.to/makoto/itadaki/card.htm\n\nThis site had some pretty good fanart. Some of it was Takasugi and \nI&#39;m not sure who the other guys were. The Hijikata pictures (# 3, 4, \nand 7) were very well done. I think 3 edges the other two out a bit \nthough just from an emotional standpoint. Here&#39;s the url:\nhttp://bankara.hp.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatsu.gel.html\n\nAnd finally I came across reference to something called Hijikata \nToshizo: Shiru no Kiseki. Is this an anime or what?! One pic is \ndefinitely Hijikata in Hakodate. There&#39;s no mistaking him:\nhttp://www.catsuka.com/interf/forum/viewtopic.php?t=691&start=72\n\nUnfortunately it is not in English or Japanese.\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n\n"
