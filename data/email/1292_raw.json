For example we can ask Saitou...&quot;do you know anything\n&gt;about Hijikata&#39;s collection of love letters?&quot;\n&gt;Wounds, any version of Saitou will have to be sitting behind a glass\n&gt;panel and he will be armed...so an innocent game of tug of war may not\n&gt;be a good idea.\n&gt;Phil, please heed my warning, Tokio has been talking to her girls and\n&gt;they are not pleased that such and attractive young man such as Sano\n&gt;would be taken off the market by the wolf...an attack is imminent if\n&gt;Sano shows up.\n&gt;Barbara, great idea...now this means YOU will have to be cranky Sr.\n&gt;Citizen Saitou (Mibugishiden)...doting grandfather...I&#39;m sure Tokio\n&gt;tried to convince him that the grandson wasn&#39;t THAT sick.\n&gt;\n\n\n-Saito reads all the e-mails about the &quot;raid&quot;-  &quot;Hn. So now they&#39;re pretending to be me... I think I&#39;ll just stay here and polish my swords that night.&quot; -Stomps off-\n\nLOL! I think you guys scared him! I guess that means I&#39;ll have to fill in for him. I can do a pretty good impression of the RK Saito... \n-Saito&#39;s voice in the background- &quot;NO, actually you&#39;re rather bad! Ahou!&quot; ...Um... Anyway... I&#39;ll be there and I&#39;m willing to take a turn. And unlike SOME people would have everyone believe, I actually CAN share! In fact I gave Barb my full support the other night about investigating Saito&#39;s &quot;untidy&quot; habits! LOL! &gt;Sticks tongue back out at phil&lt; Anyway, it&#39;s touching my Hijikata-sama that will get you hurt...\n-Saito&#39;s voice again- &quot; Hn. Like anyone cares about him...&quot; -sigh- I have to go hurt the Wolf now. See you guys at the raid!\n\n-MissBehavin (Wonders why if everyone else is his &quot;most loyal fan&quot; he&#39;s always hanging around annoying her...)\n\n"
