As \nfor the \n&gt; gravestone, I&#39;ll think over to find the best way to share with you \nguys. \n&gt; I&#39;d like to respect those people&#39;s soul and I wont forget a prayer \nwhen I&#39;ll \n&gt; visit the place, however personally I think their gravestones have \nalso \n&gt; historical value and it would be regrettable if I wont show them \nfor you who having \n&gt; real interest in these people&#39;s lives.\n&gt; Any suggestion or opinion about this are welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa san\n&gt; I&#39;m not Aizu people, living mostly in Tokyo when I&#39;m in Japan.\n&gt; \n&gt; And more OT staff for all\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if you are watching the olympic game, but if you have \nthe chance \n&gt; to see the final of synchronized swimming, in free routine \nsection, my \n&gt; compatriot will show the performance which has the theme \nof &quot;Bushido&quot;, apparently \n&gt; inspired by &quot;Last Samurai&quot;. It will start within one hour or so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; (still crying for NHK Yamanami)\n\n\nIt seems that it becomes a quite grand event under the influence of \nTaiga drama this year. \nSaitou&#39;s commemorative ceremony will be held from this year. \nDoes Tama-san go the event? \n(Iinaa--- Urayanasii.   Yousou no Hijikata mitai desu.)\nI cannot go by relation between schedule and money anywhere \nSeptember ^^;;;\n\nAbout a grave, it is a sure very difficult problem. \nWhen I traveled Aizu, the photograph of a gravestone was not taken \nat all. \nHowever, it is the problem of my feeling. \nIf it is those who protect fundamental manners, I will not think \nthat I will say bad. \nIt is the most important manners in Japan that you pray with your \nhands joined and express respect to the dead of a grave.\n(Of course, even if I do not say such a thing, Tama-san knows it \nenough.) \nI met the family who takes a photograph loudly in front of the grave \nof Byakko-tai without protecting even it.\nNext to the schoolgirl who offers an incense stick and sheds tears, \nthey made noise.\nAnd without seeing a grave, they took only the photograph and \nreturned. \nI regarded them as really deplorable. \nThey did not express respect to the dead but also trampled down \nfurther the feeling of people who came there. \n(I think that this will be a very special example.\nProbably, most people who take the photograph of a grave think that \nthey are probably performing it with careful cautions.)\nThe dead lived the past time actually and the manners to them which \nare people who are sleeping in the place now are absolutely \nrequired. \nI think that expressing respect to them is the manners which we \nshould do.\nEverything but it is judgment of an individual.\n\n\n\nThe grave of the Fujita family is located in the very conspicuous \nplace of an Amida temple. \nIt separates from other families&#39; graves and exists only by one.\nIt is a very intelligible place. \nSince Tokio carried out some good deeds to Aizu, the place has seen \nthe opinion of having been given for the prize. \nHowever, since I have forgotten where it was seen, it may not be an \nexact talk.\nBut it is actually in the position which the fans of Saitou who \nvisits the place can look for immediately.\nTruly, everybody will be surprised if it is seen.^^\n\n\nAlthough the talk changes, I get information mail from Aizu&#39;s kimono \nstore. \nAccording to the mail, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; appears in Aizu recently.\nIt wears the clothes just like &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;. \nAnd he is standing, making a pose. \nAlthough he is witnessed by Aizu&#39;s people, it is unknown what is the \npurpose.\nIt is said that the information saw him around Aizu-Bukeyashiki.\nIf lucky, Tama-san may also meet him. \n(Deattemo betsuni uresiku nai desyou keredomo....)^^;;; \n\nOkiwotsukete itterashai mase.\n\n\n\nBy the way, does Kamo-san know &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;? \nTabun nigatsu goro ha mou inai to omoimasu...itemo komaru keredo.\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
