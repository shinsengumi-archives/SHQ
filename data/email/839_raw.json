I found it very disjointed in presentation of ideas.\n\nphil\n\nHirotada Tokugawa &lt;patriot014@...&gt; wrote:\nAbout Hagakure(&quot;The Book of the Samurai&quot;)-- read it with caution. Sure, it \nhas some great comments on bushido and what not, but it was written by a man \nwho had fallen on hard times, had become a Buddhist monk, and was basically \na bitter old man sitting in seclusion ranting about how the youngsters \ndidn&#39;t know nothin&#39; from nothin&#39;. Or, as my uncle puts it, this guy was \nsaying something to the effect of: &quot;Kid, when I was your age, we knew the \n_code_. We killed ourselves, and we enjoyed it, too!&quot;\n\n--M.
