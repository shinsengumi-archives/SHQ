(who discovered Kai Shimada&#39;s journal)\n&gt;Just before the lecture, there was introduction of some direct descendants of \n&gt;Shinsengumi related person attending the ceremony and the lecture, like \n&gt;posterity of Mitsu Okita, Hajime Saito, and Takeaki Enomoto.\n&gt;At this time, Mr,Fujita( Goro Fujita&#39;s descendant indeed) said, &quot;I found a \n&gt;photo of Hajime, and I&#39;ve given a copy of it to Shinjinbutsu Ourai Publisher( \n&gt;famous publisher of many Shinsengumi books and organizer of the ceremony).&quot;\n&gt;Appearently, Mr.Fujita didn&#39;t give detailed info any more, however the author \n&gt;of the journal wondering if it meant a new photo of Hajime Saitou, other than \n&gt;that unique photo of him ever known. \n&gt;\n&gt;Does it mean we could see an unknown photo of Saito soon?\n&gt;We can wait for the sequel.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ｔａｍａ\n&gt;\n\n\nGEEZ! I hope so! That would be fantastic! Hopefully this one will give us a clear view of his face too. Some of those old photos make it so hard to really tell what the person looked like.\n\nThanks for the news Tama! Keep us posted!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
