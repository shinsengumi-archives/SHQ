Ha!&quot; and so for=\r\nth\nSamurai &quot;A&quot; generally fought for his domain and what he felt was\nhappeni=\r\nng to it (for example Aizu and other allied northern\ndomains)---or if he fe=\r\nlt his domain would now rise to national power\n(for example Satsuma, Choshu=\r\n, Tosa, Hizen etc)\n\n***some of their leaders did not explain the details to=\r\n them just that\nthe bakufu was incompetent in handling the foreigners\n\n***s=\r\no many normal citizens at the time had no access to what was\ngoing, much of=\r\n the info they heard was incorrect, while there were\nnewspapers and so fort=\r\nh they were not at the level of media we have\ntoday ofcourse\n\nso while in l=\r\nooking back, the trade treaties played a key role in the\ncollapse of the sh=\r\nogunate they did not matter much to the common\npeople who were not aware of=\r\n the situation their country was facing\n\nfor me personally economics destro=\r\nyed the bakufu\nI think many of us here wandered in the Meiji era and are ve=\r\nry\nfamiliar with zaibatsu (monopolized family based industries---e.g.\nmany =\r\nbanks, mines etc) which played a role in the rise of fascist\nJapan and WW2\n=\r\n\nbut did you know that major families such as the MITSUI, by witholding\nmon=\r\ney they were to give to the bakufu...literally bankrupted the\nshogunate?
