XD soooo much emails... 204 in this group alone T_T\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\ngood and BAD news...the speaker on sept 9 will be Jiro Asada who wrote\nMibugishiden...now for the bad news...no translator...S. California is\nhome to a huge population of Japanese Americans not to mention major\nuniversities with Japanese language dept.  if you are upset then so am\nI!!! I have PERSONALLY encouraged JAL to hire a translator for Mr.\nAsada because as a native of CA I know that many anime fansubs are\nfrom these universities.  So I was outraged that JAL would send Mr.\nAsada here without a translator.  The lady on the line said that she\nwill speak to her superiors about getting a translator for Mr. Asada\n\nFor the S. CA (Torrance) lecture you can only pay with personal check\nor money order over the phone and tickets will be mailed to you ASAP...\n...furthermore there will be a second lecture again by Jiro Asada in\nSan Francisco on Sept 10 call (415) 765-8545 at the Palo Alto Hotel\nbut the focus will be more on the Bakumatsu.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bsher213&quot; &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I just stumbled across this on a SHisnengumi LJ community I just found\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Shinsengumi to Sono Jidai&#39; (Shinsengumi and Their Times)\n&gt; Sept. 9, 2004 - 7:00pm at the Torrance Marriott\n&gt; contact JAL&#39;s LA branch at (310)607-2330 for info.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know we  have Californians out there---Someone has to go and bring\n&gt; us back information and pictures!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Barb Sheridan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
