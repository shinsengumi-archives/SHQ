It is possible that the two names may be labels for the sam=\r\ne \nguy, an alternate reading of the name or this is discrepency which \nshou=\r\nld be noted (in any case I don&#39;t know Japanese so I&#39;m not helpful).\nIt&#39;s ou=\r\nr policy to put all details, whether or not they are conflicting \nside by s=\r\nide on the site and whatever information you have would \ngreatly enhance ou=\r\nr understanding.\n\nI&#39;d like to add that we have an enormous body of Japanese=\r\n texts \n(usually older and rare from the Aizu side which cannot be purchase=\r\nd) \nwhich needs to be translated.  Right now we only have Hirotada Tokugawa=\r\n \nwho has taken upon himself to do the work---if anyone would like to \nvolu=\r\nnteer please contact us. Ofcourse what interests the volunteer is \nmost imp=\r\nortant and we&#39;ll find something to match your passion. For \ninstance I rece=\r\nntly scanned a detailed narrative on the Kinmon &quot;the \ngate incident&quot; and we=\r\n have Yamakawa Hiroshi&#39;s Kyoto Shugoshoku.... book \na pillar text on Aizu&#39;s=\r\n role as head of security in the capital \ntherefore this text is incredibly=\r\n vital to understanding the context in \nwhich the Shinsengumi operated.\n\nHa=\r\nppy Holidays everyone...as soon as the computer lab opens I&#39;ll try to \ncatc=\r\nh up with updating http://www.shinsengumihq.com  (alot of stuff \nfrom Hirot=\r\nada Tokugawa and some stuff Michael recommended).  As for me, \nI&#39;m still ga=\r\nthering info for the timeline and doing some more work on \nUnmasking the Me=\r\niji Era http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Ishin-1.htm\nWe welcome any contributio=\r\nn.  Say wouldn&#39;t it be neat if we could make \ntrailers for Shinsengumi movi=\r\nes (like for instance our own fantasy \nmovie?)\n\nFor now please occasionally=\r\n check\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/updates.htm\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I notice here: http://www.sh=\r\ninsengumihq.com/inoue.htm it states &quot;He\n&gt; was born in Tama County (1829, Ma=\r\nrch 1st) in Hino, as the third son of\n&gt; Inoue Matsugorou, of the Hachiouji =\r\nSennin Toushin.&quot; - however a short\n&gt; biography I have of him in the Gakken =\r\nRekishi Gunzo Shinsengumi book\n&gt; (2003) states that he is the son of Inoue =\r\nTouzaemon. It goes on to say\n&gt; that Inoue Matsugorou is Genzaburou&#39;s (secon=\r\nd) older brother, and\n&gt; Inoue Taisuke is Matsugorou&#39;s son.  I see on that l=\r\nink that it\n&gt; mentions that the second son eventually changed his name to\n&gt;=\r\n Matsugorou, so it makes sense, but could I get some clarification\n&gt; here? =\r\nWas Inoue Touzaemon AKA Matsugorou?  Thanks!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
