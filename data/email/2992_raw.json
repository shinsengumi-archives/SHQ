(actually we are back logged 3 months, during this \nentire time of NO =\r\nUPDATES on SHQ.com people like Hirotada Tokugawa \nand myself have amassed e=\r\nven more info...like alot really ^_^ as \nusual we await more contributions =\r\nfrom anyone on this list or the \ngeneral public, be it fan-work, fanfic fan=\r\nart cosplay you name it, \nyou can post here, email the site and so forth) \n=\r\n\nwe got the graphics!  (the spiffy art)\n\nbut we need to make our site more =\r\n&quot;sleek&quot;\n\nif we can really do a good job with SHQ, future fans which may \nar=\r\nrive in the future won&#39;t have to start with point &quot;A&quot; (as we&#39;ve \nhad to do)=\r\n, they can just read some of our pages and then move on \nquickly to learn w=\r\nhatever they are most interested in...so we need a \nstrong layout to make t=\r\nhat all happen\n\nwith a strong layout the webmaster can cut back time on the=\r\n manual \nwork required in updating and instead use the time for research (I=\r\n&#39;m \ndown to like 6 months where I have access to a research library, so \nfo=\r\nr me personally I just want to get an understanding of the history-\n--the m=\r\nanga and stuff I can buy LATER when I have money).\n  \nSo if you see alot of=\r\n &quot;nerd&quot; history stuff on SHQ, that is because I \nam using what I have at my=\r\n disposal. If you hear otherwise that SHQ \nis not &quot;into&quot; pop-culture then i=\r\nt is a simple misunderstanding.\n\n--------------------\nGeneral Announcement\n=\r\n--------------------\nAs you may know Youtube was purchased by Google, thus =\r\nit discourages \nthe posting of copyright material\nfor example, if you post =\r\na clip of anime being broadcasted in \nJapan---you will get in trouble etc e=\r\ntc\nwe don&#39;t want anyone to have to deal with legal issues (^_^)\n\nEven thoug=\r\nh Youtube&#39;s upcoming policy and strict enforcement will \nreally annoy many =\r\nof us---this may force us to create our own \nShinsengumi films\n\noh no...Shi=\r\nnsengumi finger puppets (^_^)\n\n\n\n"
