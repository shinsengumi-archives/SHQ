NEW INFO!!!!!!!!\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=173227807\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: spiritus_saitou\r\n\r\nIronically, I&#39;ve been reduced to watching prison history on &quot;History \nChannel&quot; today...  I don&#39;t know how similar Japanese imprisonment \nsystems were to western at the time, but given that so much of the \npolice and armed forces were being patterned after European models, I \nwould expect them working on similar ideas in prison reform.\n\nIf they were incorporating western ideas (or maybe it was practiced \nin Japan, too, before westernization attempts), it would NOT be \nunusual for Fujita Gorou to be living at the facility as an \nemployee.  What I&#39;m getting from all of this history on prisons \n(again, US & European... unfortunately) is that it was more usual for \nprison staff to live on or near the prison grounds in the 19th into \nthe 20th centuries, from the warden on down.   Alcatraz, for \ninstance, had a community for staff families on the island itself.  \nWhat are the dates for this assignment?  Was it before he married \nTokio & his sons were born?  I can imagine the bachelor Fujita (or \neven married) living in quarters at the facility.  From what you are \nsaying the woman told you, it sounds to me that that was exactly the \ncase --- he was an officer working at the detention center and he \nlived there like other staff.  I don&#39;t come to the conclusion you \ndo.  (But then, my head is currently stuffed with prison history... :-\nD)  Needs to be explored!!\n\n*DEFINITELY* fascinating new info, though.  I&#39;ve been thinking \nrecently about how he might regard incarceration --- in terms of \npractices and who he could be seeing locked up... maybe more & more \nyoung people (ahem... like Sano)without opportunity and few options \nbut to turn to crime just to eat.  Anyone have any good sources for \ninfo about crime statistics during the Meiji, especially in the first \ndecade or two? (and more than how many were arrested for peeing in \npublic!)\n\nI&#39;d love to know more when you find out!\n\nphil\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n \n&gt; p.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern building\n&gt; used as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a prison/jail but a &quot;place where people could not leave until\n&gt; they know they did wrong&quot;...so I was trying to ask her if he \ncommitted\n&gt; a crime or did something &#39;bad&#39; (robbery, murder etc) of some sort \nand\n&gt; she said &#39;no&#39; and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he \nwas\n&gt; a police officer?  And I was like &quot;yes&quot; (so the pages must deal w/\n&gt; Fujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word &quot;discipline&quot; and \nso\n&gt; she was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,\n&gt; disciplinary issue and this detention center that he &quot;stayed&quot; at.  I\n&gt; kept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like \nyes\n&gt; he stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he \nWORKED\n&gt; there...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because if \nyou\n&gt; think about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a\n&gt; prison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he was\n&gt; formerly &quot;disciplined&quot; for something...because I trying really hard \nto\n&gt; be sure that he wasn&#39;t just a prison guard but she was trying to\n&gt; communicate that he did something &#39;bad&#39; but not &#39;criminal&#39;.\n\n\n\n"
