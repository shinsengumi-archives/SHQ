I started to write down ideas, then I thought up a plot so complicated it&#39;s almost impossible to write it in a logical order.  Do you guys have any suggestions as to how to write a story where it takes place over like 10 years?  and the setting jumps around like crazy too . . . do I just use lots of asterisks and dashes or maybe separate them into chapters - but there&#39;s a limit of 7.  Puhhleassse give me some tips, I&#39;ve never written anything so complicated before ^ ^;;; *wails*  one more question - are the police offiers who worked with Saitoh in Tokyo Boshin samurais?  How did they manage to not recognize Saitoh as a member of the Shinsengumi again?\n\n&gt; I&#39;m actually working on my Saitou-Holmes story.  Can&#39;t believe I \nactually hit on a beginning for it. (swipes forehead in relief)\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil (19th Century London isn&#39;t exactly my idea of a great escape, ya \nknow?)\n\n\n\n\nSaitoh Worship\n~Anime Mystique~\n\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
