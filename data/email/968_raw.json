Does anyone here know of any (preferably those that people can link to and watch/downlaod --- I know some RK titles are not available but still listed on AMV, including one that I really liked called &quot;Saito&#39;s Here&quot;)?  I don&#39;t need RK musicvids, just PMK.\n \nSpeaking of &quot;Saito&#39;s Here,&quot; does anyone know why heraldtalia stopped access to it?  It used to be available over on prettyanimeboys.com, but last time I tried to load the site it was unavailable (the site itself).  Is it available somewhere else?  (wondering if I can contact the artist... )\n \nThanks in advance!\nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo!
