In\nthis clip he depicts Ikedaya Jigen.  One voice actor Kiichi Nakai=\r\n will\ngo on to play Yoshimura Kani&#39;chiro in MIBUGISHIDEN.  This film is\nbas=\r\ned on the famous comic by Hiroshi Kurogane.  Back in 2000 the\nShinsengumi c=\r\nraze had not really taken root yet (aside from Rurouni\nKenshin based fandom=\r\n) thus making this small budget venture &quot;lost&quot; to\nlater fans.  Many online =\r\ncommunities love this depiction and I myself\nadmire the atmosphere and crea=\r\ntivity which went into this film.  It\nwould have been neat if when a sword =\r\ncuts through someone you hear the\nsound of tearing paper...\n\nI hope fans ev=\r\nerywhere will try making their own Shinsengumi films and\ntry any genre usin=\r\ng whatever means you have.  Last year I made\n&quot;IkeDIEya&quot; using Easter Eggs..=\r\n.it was fun and the exact opposite of\nKon Ichikawa&#39;s grim black and white a=\r\npproach...I went with a more\nbright colorful approach because it was &quot;filme=\r\nd&quot; in my refrigerator. \nEven if Shinsengumi media such as manga and film ha=\r\nve entered a\ndormant period fans can continue to have fun by producing thei=\r\nr work\nand sharing with a community.\n\nI endeavour to report on the progress=\r\n of the SHQ site very soon so\nthat all our supporter and donors can see whe=\r\nre their contributions went.\n\n\n"
