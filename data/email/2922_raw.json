(In 1876, Yugoro=\r\nu married \nIsami&#39;s daughter, became the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-r=\r\nyu, and changed his \nname to Kondou Yuugorou.) \n\nI suppose that Souji&#39;s son=\r\n could be Souji&#39;s heir. Yoshijirou could also be the head of the \nfamily af=\r\nter Souji and before Souji&#39;s son. My guess is relevantly based on the Okita=\r\n family \nhistory through four generations.    \n\nTen years after Rintarou Ka=\r\nnemasa&#39;s death, Yoshijirou died in 1895, at age 43 (by East \nAsian age reck=\r\noning.) His grave is next to Souji&#39;s, by the way. Yoshijirou&#39;s heir/eldest =\r\nson \nJuji (sp?) died in 1910, at age 23 (by East Asian age reckoning.) Afte=\r\nr Juji&#39;s death, his \nyounger brother became the head of the Okita family.\n\n=\r\n&gt;Souji had started a branch family, is that considered a separate\n&gt;family a=\r\nltogether, or does that put Rintaro and his family in an\n&gt;inferior position=\r\n within Souji&#39;s family?\nIt&#39;s considered a branch family that doesn&#39;t put Ri=\r\nntaro and his family in an\ninferior position within Souji&#39;s family (I think=\r\n...)\n\n~Seven\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zhusanna&quot; &lt;wsehome@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro(sp?) and he took the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;name Kondou when he became the 3rd master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;in 1830. Therefore, Kondou Isami was first adopted as a Shimazaki \n&gt; &gt;befo=\r\nre he took the name Kondou sometime after 1858.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So, wait.=\r\n....if Kondou Isami had adopted an heir, this heir would \n&gt; have to be adop=\r\nted first as a Miyagawa, then as a Shimazaki, then as \n&gt; a Kondou??  How mu=\r\nch time had to pass between adoptions?  Didn&#39;t all \n&gt; this adopting get con=\r\nfusing?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before=\r\n Souji&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;birth (but that&#39;s not the point here.) Rintarou Mototsune serv=\r\ned as \n&gt; &gt;the head of the Okita family for a short time (possibly less than=\r\n a \n&gt; &gt;year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head of the family. \n&gt; &gt; R=\r\nintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the \n&gt; &gt;family unt=\r\nil Souji got married.  Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou \n&gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s son =\r\nYoshijirou would probably have become Souji&#39;s heir \n&gt; &gt;and would likely hav=\r\ne married Souji&#39;s eldest daughter.) I suppose \n&gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been ac=\r\nceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou \n&gt; &gt;Kanamasa&#39;s daughter instead.  =\r\nHowever, considering that Souji&#39;s son \n&gt; &gt;would&#39;ve been quite a few years y=\r\nounger than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this w=\r\nould&#39;ve been the case.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If Rintaro Kanamasa was only &quot;holdin=\r\ng&quot; the heir position for Souji \n&gt; until he got married, why wouldn&#39;t Souji&#39;=\r\ns son (if he had had one) be \n&gt; Souji&#39;s heir?  What would Rintaro&#39;s son hav=\r\ne to do with anything \n&gt; now?  Because Rintaro was holding that position, d=\r\nid that make Souji \n&gt; obligated to him?  Couldn&#39;t Souji have done whatever =\r\nhe wanted since \n&gt; he would be head of the family?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Souji can st=\r\nart &quot;Bunke&quot;, a branch family of Okita.\n&gt; &gt;Souji received Bakushin status in=\r\n 1967 so his Okita line could be \n&gt; &gt;higher than Rintaro&#39;s Okita line.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If Souji had started a branch family, is that considered a separate \n&gt; =\r\nfamily altogether, or does that put Rintaro and his family in an \n&gt; inferio=\r\nr position within Souji&#39;s family?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --Wanda\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
