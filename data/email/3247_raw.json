So I&#39;m glad to \nsee you enter this field and hopefully=\r\n inform JAS or MN (by providing a \nnew venue). JAS and MN have very strict =\r\nrules on what they accept and \nwhat they publish.  I&#39;m not saying your publ=\r\nication was intended to \ncompete with JAS/MN but perhaps offer something di=\r\nfferent (^_^)\n\n*Our focus will be on pre-20th century Japan, although we&#39;ll=\r\n make \nallowances for\n&gt; Meiji era histories as well.  \n\n2) I noticed the st=\r\nrength of your staff are the prestigious \nqualifications of some individual=\r\ns and the wide ranging interests of \nothers which will serve as a key to yo=\r\nur future success. However, let&#39;s \nsay if I were to submit an article on th=\r\ne Meiji Educational system as \nit relates to the perversion of bushido and =\r\nrise of fascism (yes as \nearly as 1890s...predating good ole Italian model =\r\nbut it&#39;s evident in \nthe many works dealing w/ the topic)...your staff may =\r\nnot be able to \nprovide a peer evaluation.  \n\nWould you seek qualified gues=\r\nt editors to assist in oversight of the \nscholarship (even if it is from so=\r\nmeone not traditionally part of the \nfield?).  Have you approached maybe th=\r\ne young up and coming open minded \nprofessors to assist in this effort?  \n\n=\r\n&gt; ready to go, including publishing and distribution; we&#39;re in the\n\n3) how =\r\nwill SA-JJH sustain itself?  I am worried because I feel that \nit&#39;s tough i=\r\nf you guys have to pay out of pocket.  Have you acquired a \ngrant?  If so t=\r\nhen perhaps a grant to back you on this project will \nalso help this magazi=\r\nne be distributed to research libraries in the \nUSA.  My concern is, from m=\r\ny own experience many magazines after a \ncertain number of issues do have t=\r\no close down and in the process the \nmeticulously written work ends up beco=\r\nming a rarity for students to \nfind/read. Aside from the online format whic=\r\nh everyone can read and I \nassume the print formatting, will you consider C=\r\nD formats for libraries \ntoo?  Will you try to get this publication onto li=\r\nbrary databases \n(which can subscribe to you or link to articles?).  Ofcour=\r\nse the online \nformat will be most accessible however students in school wo=\r\nuld feel \nmore comfortable if perhaps their library&#39;s East Asian bibliograp=\r\nher \nhas approved of the journal as a source of info as well---and with the=\r\n \nqualifcations of your staff I&#39;m sure they would be able to devise a \ngood=\r\n strategy for penetrating academia and make this a valuable \nresource.\n\nwha=\r\nt are the long term goals of this magazine?  will it exist years \nfrom now?=\r\n  part of why JAS/MN are held in high esteem is that they are \nvery stable =\r\nand authors feel that their work will be preserved for \ndecades...do you ha=\r\nve a back up plan for your magazine if someone \nshould need to take a break=\r\n from it?  For the SHQ we are just \nvolunteers so we don&#39;t have to worry ab=\r\nout it really.  But your journal \nis a very ambitious effort and I was conc=\r\nerned with its stability.\n\n\n"
