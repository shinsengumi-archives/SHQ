Several sources record him as \nbeing the son of &quot;Yamanami, a sword instructor of the Sendai domain&quot;. It \njust so happens that I have copies of sections from &quot;Sendai Boshin-shi&quot; \n(written by Fujiwara Ainosuke, published (or more correctly, REpublished) in \n1980) that may have the answer to who his father was.\n\nAccording to p. 717, which lists all the hereditary sword instructor \nfamilies of the Sendai domain, there is *no* Yamanami. However, at the end \nof the list of instructor families, there is a name that is given-- family \n*and* given name, as though compared to the rest, he was a newcomer.\n\n&quot;Sakurada Keisuke, instructor in Hokushin-ittoryu&quot;\n\nNow, according to the Japanese Wikipedia article on Yamanami, he was \ncertified in Ono-ha Ittoryu, and later studied Hokushin-ittoryu under Chiba \nShusaku. I have no further confirmation of this; however, it is notable that \n&quot;Keisuke&quot; is spelled the same way, and that Yamanami did have training in \nthe same style. This is my theory (connected to the comments on his \nname-reading in the Japanese Wikipedia article)-- the family name &quot;Yamanami&quot; \ncan also be read &quot;Sannan&quot;-- which, this site elaborates, could be spelled \none of several ways, one of which reads &quot;Third son&quot;.\n\nFurthermore, &quot;Keisuke&quot; is a &quot;common name,&quot; (I believe the Japanese is \n&quot;tsuumyou&quot;) which in some families can be inherited. Case in point-- the \nsenior Aizu retainer Saigo Tanomo. There were many men in his ancestry who \ncarried the &quot;common name&quot; Tanomo-- his formal name sets him apart from them \n(Chikanori). For those who didn&#39;t know, Yamanami&#39;s formal name was Tomonobu.\n\nSomething else that any potential researchers should be on the lookout for, \nif possible, is if Sakurada Keisuke also claimed descent from the Fujiwara, \nas Yamanami did.\n\nGiven this preliminary evidence, it is my belief, and my tentative theory \nabout Yamanami-- that it would not be ridiculous at all, if Yamanami was the \n&quot;Sannan&quot;-- third son-- of Sakurada Keisuke, that he inherited the &quot;common \nname&quot; of Keisuke, and that when he left Sendai-- something that was \ntantamount to treason and often necessitated name-changing for the sake of \nsafety-- he made a pun on &quot;Sannan&quot;, changing the characters that spell that \nsound-- which gives us the &quot;Yamanami&quot; that we know today.\n\nJust a theory, but I believe it to be a not entirely meaningless one.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
