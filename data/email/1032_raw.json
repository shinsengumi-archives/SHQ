Just like in the Seinan War the gov. was \nextremely concerned with their image and they made a strong effort \nto enforce their &quot;do not &#39;harass&#39; the womanfolk policy&quot; but you know \nthey couldn&#39;t keep an eye on thousands of guys.\n\nWell, what I&#39;d like to know is when the Aizu samurai/troops went up \nto Hakodate because \n1) it means they escaped the clutches of the invading Imperial army \nright before the enemy entered the domain\n2) or they somehow escaped -after- the army secured the \ndomain...basically I&#39;m concerned with how the defense of the domain \nmust&#39;ve fallen apart.\n\nI have several books with me however NONE discuss the fall of Aizu \nextensively...sure it mentions Matsudaira here and there but only in \na political context in Kyoto.  It&#39;s kind of like how chapters on the \nSeinan War do not mention the Seige at Kumamoto Castle/Garrison when \nvery clearly many authors say it was THE act of war (point of no \nreturn) for Saigo&#39;s forces...up until this time the gov. was seeking \nnegotiations with Satsuma and was willing to pardon him [!].\n\nI did read a bit on Japanese funeral practices and there are some \nsimilarities to a culture I&#39;m studying...basically you cremate the \nbodies and interr the ashes/bone in a cemetary (it is common for \nfamily to take some home and worship the remains)...its like in the \ncase of Fujita Goro&#39;s grave...I assume only his ashes/bones are \nthere under the stone marker...not a &quot;grave&quot; in a Western sense.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;warg3791&quot; &lt;Warg3791@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ok, so there IS some Japanese on these pages. However the person \n&gt; behind these articles was kind enough to include an English \n&gt; translation, so there&#39;s no need to bring out the evil goldfish. \n&gt; \n&gt; This first article is about the place we discussed last Sunday \nduring \n&gt; the chat session. Serizawa Kamo very kindly translated a name the \n&gt; translator had mutilated beyond all recognition, so I know this \nplace \n&gt; is connected to Hijikata. \n&gt; http://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=83\n&gt; \n&gt; The next two sites I&#39;ve known about for a while actually. The \nfirst \n&gt; is about the war and Goryokaku. The next one is about the monument \n&gt; built to Hijikata and the other Tokugawa forces killed in battle.\n&gt; http://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=155\n&gt; http://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=140\n&gt; \n&gt; The next article is about my new hero, Yanagawa Kumakichi! This \nhas \n&gt; cleared up a bit of a mystery for me!\n&gt; http://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=139\n&gt; \n&gt; So this is the temple that the www.tamahito.com site keeps going \non \n&gt; about! While the EXACT location of Hijikata&#39;s grave remains \nunknown, \n&gt; it seems that it is probably somewhere on the side of Mt. \nHakodate. \n&gt; But I thought that the bodies were cremated? I guess they mean he \n&gt; buried the ashes? Or is the translator just messing with my head?! \n&gt; Well, maybe the mystery isn&#39;t COMPLETELY cleared up...-_-\n&gt; \n&gt; Now if I could just figure out what this &quot;Wood Eagle&quot; thing is. It \n&gt; seems to be the place that Enomoto (and of course Hijikata) first \n&gt; landed in Hokkaido. They keep showing pictures of some beach.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I&#39;m off the point now. The point is all you Ishin-haters out \n&gt; there will really find your blood boiling and know why I have such \n&gt; tremendous respect for this man!\n&gt; \n&gt; And if that isn&#39;t enough to condemn the new government&#39;s actions \nin \n&gt; Hokkaido, then check this article out. This appears to be dealing \n&gt; with some of the Aizu people who joined Hijikata in Hokkaido.\n&gt; http://www.donan.info/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=97\n&gt; \n&gt; So are you angry yet?\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We are the Shinsengumi! We have business!&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;Still thinks this \n&gt; should be our motto.\n\n\n"
