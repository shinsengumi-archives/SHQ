I&#39;ve never seen the kanji for Fujita so I wouldn&#39;t know what the name means, tho.  Can anyone besides Masayoshi answer this question, since he seems kind of busy at the moment?\n \n~SaitohWorship\n\nKalli &lt;kallipygia@...&gt; wrote:\nI thought I read on a web page that &quot;Saitou&quot; meant &quot;divine wisteria&quot; -- was that incorrect?  \n\nKalli\n\nOkita Souji &lt;okita_souji@...&gt; wrote:\nNo prob. \n\nAhh ok, that makes sense now.
