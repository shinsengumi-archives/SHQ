I thought it was an old \n&gt; protrait photograph.  The thing that gets me is that the men look so \n&gt; different . I&#39;m just not seeing enough similarity between them.\n\nIt is a charcoal sketch...done with soft charcoal so it does look like\na photo...there are bigger versions of this image with writing on the\nside and his name &quot;Saitou Hajime&quot; even though he was supposed to go by\nYamaguchi Jirou/o by the time this portrait was done.  1to5.net has a\nmini essay which debunks the charcoal sketch portrait we have gotten\nused to.  \n\nIf the man identified in the group photo is S.H. then -wow- either the\nartist who did the charcoal sketch was WAY off or perhaps someone\naccidently wrote in the wrong name on the wrong portrait...he is SO\nunattractive LOL...what a contrast to Tokio who looks very elegant in\nthe photo with their son :) well I&#39;m not a model myself:)\n\nMy Japanese books came with lots of inserts and advertisements listing\nShinsengumi books and on one ad it actually cropped the group photo to\nshow the REAL S.H....so it seems that the marketing is also changing\nto address what researchers have found rather than go with the image\nwhich is all over the internet.\n\n\n"
