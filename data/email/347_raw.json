I emailed\n&gt; a question knowing that answer in the back of my mind...I did so\n&gt; because if theories are still out there then websites should state\n&gt; that rather than saying X killed X and not mention that there could be\n&gt; more than one possibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Hillsborough says that he wrote a book on the Shinsengumi and it\n&gt; will be released this fall...he will also address the above mentioned\n&gt; issue in the\n&gt; book.\n\n\n"
