Iimori with the Fujita family (again it&#39;s all really complic=\r\nated, \nthrought extension, friendships etc but still fascinating)\n\nThe film=\r\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\n\nthe history\nhttp://www.byakkot=\r\nai.net\n\nSpiritus Saitou is sharing some screencaps of this new 2007 Byakkot=\r\nai \nwith me and I&quot;m going to look over them today.  Now with a bigger \nbudg=\r\net and computer effects this epic narrative may take be even more \ncompelli=\r\nng to a new generation.\n\nThe Byakkotai will always be the tragic &quot;poster bo=\r\nys&quot; of Aizu...and \nthe only source of &quot;rehabilitation&quot; of the domain&#39;s narr=\r\native.  On a \nnational level, Aizu got the attention of the rest of the cou=\r\nntry in \nmuch later years *after the Meiji Era (at the height of Japan&#39;s \nf=\r\nascism) due to the Byakkotai.  HOwever specific reasons for the \nmilitary a=\r\nctions against the domain in 1868 have not been been made \ntransparent (it =\r\nhas been written about but it needs to be brought \ninto our modern era, our=\r\n generation and in Eng.) because \nthe &quot;founding fathers&quot; of teh Meiji Era w=\r\nith their fake Imperial \nEdict, fake Imperial Banners and unwillingness to =\r\naccept Aizu&#39;s \nearlier attempts for negotiations points to a simple private=\r\n grudge \nbetween the Ishin and the domain (ofcourse it cost the lives of to=\r\no \nmany combatants and civilians and the long term stigamtization of the \ns=\r\nurvivors).\n\nAt the same time Aizu leaders of the Boshin War generation sort=\r\n of \npainted themselves into a corner too...only a handful of them could \na=\r\nctually tell their domain&#39;s story in a published format (perhaps due \nto va=\r\nrious political and social pressures).  Incidentally those very \nAizu leade=\r\nrs had very close relationships with the Fujita family.  \nThus what we get =\r\nfor Aizu is the Byakkotai and other details of the \nrole of the domain duri=\r\nng the Bakumatsu gets swept under the \nrug...again Aizu was the &quot;criminal&quot; =\r\ndomain in the eyes of many \npeople.  Survivors who became successful were t=\r\nhe lucky few and had \nto be grateful for whatever blessings granted to them=\r\n (even if they \nearned their properity in the Meiji Era through their own s=\r\nheer \ntalent and effort).\n\nMore Byakkotai/Aizu discussions can be found her=\r\ne\nhttp://community.livejournal.com/edo_meiji/tag/aizu\n\nalso Aizu stuff not =\r\nrelated to the Shinsengumi can be posted here:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/edojidai/\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bya=\r\nkkotai (SP) Part 1 [2007?.01?.06] (704x396 DivX6)?.avi\n&gt; \n&gt; http://d-addict=\r\ns.net/torrents/\n&gt; byakkotai%20%28sp%29%20part%201%20%5B2007.01.06%5D%20%287=\r\n04x396%\n20divx6%2\n&gt; 9.avi.torrent\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
