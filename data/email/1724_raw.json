He was one of 4 \nassassins working for the =\r\nShiShi and was from Higo.  After the war \nwas over he raised a stink about =\r\nthe direction the government was \nmoving in and raised a stink about it.  H=\r\ne was thereafter found \nguilty on some trumped up charges and executed.  Fa=\r\nr as I know \nthough he was only occasionally called Hitokiri Gensai, never =\r\n\nBattousai.  Watsuki had even said he used Kawakami as one of the \nmodels f=\r\nor Kenshin.\n\nHiten Mitsurugi Ryu DID NOT exist.  I&#39;m fairly certain I read =\r\nan \ninterview when Watsuki Nobuhiro said he invented the style for his \nKen=\r\nshin style.  (I&#39;m gonna have to bookmark that interview next time \nI manage=\r\n to find it.)\n\nThe Sakabato also never existed.  It&#39;s a creation for the ma=\r\nnga.  A \nwhile ago a custom smith named Rick Barret made it for a customer.=\r\n  \nHowever, it was never used by any samurai.\n\nBottom line, what that kid g=\r\noes off about, is a bunch of things I&#39;ve \nneither heard about let alone bel=\r\nieve.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hirotada Tokugawa&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; \nw=\r\nrote:\n&gt; Just got this in one of the other groups I&#39;m in. It&#39;s got some \ndet=\r\nails we \n&gt; NEED to investigate. This practically turns everything on its \nh=\r\nead...\n&gt; \n&gt; --M.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Marwin Tristan&quot; &lt;marwintristan@=\r\ny...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: kagetai@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: kagetai@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Subject: [kagetai] thought you should all know\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 11 Oct 2004 =\r\n07:40:34 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Being a fan of the Rurouni Kenshin series, i trie=\r\nd to acquire the\n&gt; &gt;hostorical background of the series. While I found out =\r\nsome\n&gt; &gt;interesting bits of info such as the real Saito and Yamagata and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;even Katsura, the others were depressing (no Kenshin!). a friend\n&gt; &gt;even h=\r\nelped me pst my requests for info but all I got were more of\n&gt; &gt;the same.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That is, until someone mailed me the info I was looking for. No\n&gt; &gt;ma=\r\ntter how much I wrote back, he/she never answered. Here is the\n&gt; &gt;summary o=\r\nf what he/she sent me:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hitokiri Batt=F4-sai - the legendary warrior =\r\nof Choshu did exist. \nHis\n&gt; &gt;name and true identity was unknown even today =\r\nexcept for the fact\n&gt; &gt;that he was called THE Batt=F4-sai (yep, that&#39;s how =\r\nthe sender said \nit\n&gt; &gt;should be spelled). He was one of the best warriors =\r\nunfortunately \nhe\n&gt; &gt;did not reach the customary cult status since no one e=\r\nven knew \nwhere\n&gt; &gt;he was buried. There are a few rumors here and there but=\r\nno\n&gt; &gt;substantial proof. He started as an assassin but became a warrior\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nafter the death of his wife (whom he did not accidentaly kill but\n&gt; &gt;rather=\r\n died of other circumstances). He became one of the \nbodyguards\n&gt; &gt;of Kido =\r\nTadayoshi known then as Katsura Kogoro. He was never\n&gt; &gt;defeated but he was=\r\n also not much known probably because of the \nfact\n&gt; &gt;that only Katsura kne=\r\nw his real identity. After Meiji took over \nthe\n&gt; &gt;government, he offered h=\r\nis sword in a shrine (unnamed) to a person\n&gt; &gt;who gave him another sword in=\r\n return: the Shin Uchi (Sakabatou \nwere\n&gt; &gt;pretty much in use as an alterna=\r\ntive weapon but Batt=F4-sai used it \nas\n&gt; &gt;self-defense. Arai Shatku was ru=\r\nmored to be that person but it is\n&gt; &gt;also unconfirmed. We all knew Kawakami=\r\n Gensai was caught and\n&gt; &gt;executed but we do not know why. Batt=F4-sai was =\r\nthe reason he fell\n&gt; &gt;(unfortunately again, the sender did not tell me how =\r\nBatt=F4-sai\n&gt; &gt;helped). Another note, after the edict forbidding the wearin=\r\ng of\n&gt; &gt;swords Batt=F4-sai carried his in a sort of bag the way Yahiko does=\r\n \nin\n&gt; &gt;Seisouhen. That way, he both did not break the law, and did not\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nprovoke the government soldiers. He settled down and faded into\n&gt; &gt;anonymit=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Makoto Shishio - here&#39;s the case: Watsuki said that Himura&#39;s real=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;life model was Kawakami Gensai. Correction, Kawakami Gensai is \nmore\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;like Makoto Shishio in the story. They were both isolationists, \nthey\n&gt; &gt;w=\r\nere both unbeaten assassins from Choshu, they were both executed\n&gt; &gt;after t=\r\nhe restoration and they fight pretty much the same way.\n&gt; &gt;Makoto Shishio w=\r\nas not and never will be Batt=F4-sai&#39;s successor. \nFor\n&gt; &gt;one, there are no=\r\nt only one Hitokiri or assassin of Choshu, there\n&gt; &gt;are literally dozens of=\r\n them. Kawakami Gensai was using Furanui\n&gt; &gt;style Ken-jutsu and not Batt=F4=\r\n-juttsu.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu - was a style of Kenjuttsu that origina=\r\nted ryt\n&gt; &gt;after the Battle of Sekigahara. Batt=F4-sai was reportedly the l=\r\nast\n&gt; &gt;master. The style persists but goes by another name today. The \nstyl=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;was not pure anymore and Hiko of the OVA was telling the truth \nwhen\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;he said that Mitsurugi Ryu ends with him although in real life, it\n&gt; &gt;was=\r\n Batt=F4-sai who said those words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Kagetai - while I doubt that =\r\nit was Hajime Saito really formed\n&gt; &gt;an assassination/espionage group, towa=\r\nrds the end of the\n&gt; &gt;Shinsengumi&#39;s life, Hijikata&#39;s tactics became dirtier=\r\n, resorting \nto\n&gt; &gt;assassinations and bribery and even threats. The group w=\r\nas formed \nin\n&gt; &gt;order to accomplish certain missions that were not approve=\r\nd by the\n&gt; &gt;powers that be (Kondou or Matsudaira or whoever else). They wer=\r\ne a\n&gt; &gt;band of mercenaries and/or ronin. And they never exceeded 20. \nTheir=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;actual name is unkown.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s it. And while there are other info=\r\n included, I think these\n&gt; &gt;are the things others may be interested, whethe=\r\nr you believe them \nor\n&gt; &gt;not. I am also interested on info about Bakufu Hi=\r\ntokiri. I am\n&gt; &gt;writing a book about Batt=F4-sai based on what I found out.=\r\n And \nmaybe\n&gt; &gt;I can borrow some characters from your wonderful group.
