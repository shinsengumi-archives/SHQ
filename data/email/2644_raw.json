Everyone bowed whenever they saw \nhim, and he was always accompanied by officials and a retinue.\n\nI am SURE he crossed paths with Hijikata Toshizo.\n\nAnyway, this might present somewhat of an interesting challenge to those of \nyou wanting to study or draw clothing of that era. I know I intend to do a \ndrawing of him in that outfit ASAP-- sounds delightfully eclectic!\n\n-M.\n\nP.S. But I think Hijikata in his suit looks cooler. :)\n\n\n\n"
