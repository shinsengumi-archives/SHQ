Wonder if there&#39;s a way to get it to create links \nfor the location ID so all one would have to do is click on it and \nPRESTO (assuming ff.net isn&#39;t down at the time).  Probably not \njust &#39;cause that would be too efficient.  :-)  I assume you were \nhoping it would create links when you created the table?  (Looks like \nit since you have the full URL for them.)\n\nJust out of curiosity, what criteria did you use for including a \nstory in the database?  There must be hundreds (over a thousand?) \nthat involve Saitou.  Is it only when the story involves the \nrevolutionary time period or other members of the Shinsengumi?  \n(uh... I think what I&#39;m trying to get at is &quot;Saitou other than just a \nMeiji cop&quot;?)\n\nYou should post a message over on SHQSD for newcomers to bump into if \nthey read past messages so they&#39;ll know it&#39;s there.  I think so far \nmost people on SHQSD are on this list, too (which I&#39;m really glad \nof), but there are always exceptions.\n\nThanks for starting it up!\nphil\n\n-- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I started a database at \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n&gt; everyone can add records\n\n\n\n"
