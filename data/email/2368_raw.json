I can tell you a little bit about him up until about \nautumn of 1863... (Please note that the book does make mistakes, so some of this \ncould possibly be wrong.)\n\n-Called &quot;Shinta&quot; by his friends.\n-1st son of a powerful village headman in the mountainous district of Aki. His\n family had been rewarded with the right to wear two swords and have a \nsurname years before.\n-He was one of the leading disciples of Takechi Hanpeita. (commonly referred \nto as Zuizan). This is how he orginally knew Ryoma, who had started out as \nTakechi&#39;s right-hand man in his Tosa Loyalists Party.\n-Began his formal education early in childhood under a Buddhist priest.\n-Later studied under a doctor of Chinese medicine and taught at this man&#39;s \nacademy at age 14.\n-Then moved to Kochi and entered Takechi&#39;s dojo. At age 20 he was studying \nliterature, philosophy, and fencing under &quot;Master Zuizan&quot;.\n-By the end of August, 1863 he realized that it was no longer safe for \nLoyalists in Tosa. He urged Takechi to get their men out of the han, but the other \nrefused to believe that Lord Yamanouchi Yodo was not on their side. Nakaoka \nthen made up an excuse that he wanted to see what the situation in Choshu was and \nleft the han. (Choshu had just that month been driven out of the Imperial \ncourt by the Satsuma-Aizu alliance.)\n\nI am not sure how he hooked back up with Ryoma later on. Again, I have yet to \nread that far. It was fairly well known though that Ryoma was working at the \nKobe Naval Academy under Katsu Kaishu however. I do know that they worked very \nclosely together on several schemes later on and he was indeed assassinated \nwith Ryoma. He lingered for two days and was able to give some account of what \nhappened that night, but did not know the identity of the men who had attacked \nthem.\n\nOf course the Shinsengumi were blamed for the murders and Kondo was later \nexecuted for this crime. \n\n\nA word about who Takechi was - He ran a dojo in Kochi, taught Japanese and \nChinese history and philosphy with an emphasis on Confucianism, and was the \nleader of the Tosa Loyalist Party. He was also a good friend of Ryoma&#39;s. In fact \nhe was the one who introduced him to Katsura and Takasugi of Choshu clan. But \nRyoma had a very unique way of thinking for a man of his era and this caused \nhim to eventually abandon Tosa han. He and Takechi never really saw eye to eye \nafter that.\n\nTakechi went on to have han regent Yoshida Toyo murdered. At this time the \nproper lord, Yamanouchi Yodo, was still under housearrest from the Ansei Purge \nof Ii Naosuke, so this was the official running things in Tosa. Through \nmanipulating the replacement officials he became almost the defacto leader of the \nhan. Later when the clan was in Kyoto he ordered a great many of the \nassassinations (often carried out by the infamous hitokiri Okada Izo) that had the Bakufu \nso terrified that they eventually called up a group of ronin from Edo to deal \nwith the problem...\n\nUnfortunately for Takechi, Yamanouchi eventually took back control of his han \nin April, 1863 and ordered everyone back to Tosa. Once the Bakufu was in \ncharge at the Imperial Court again he began hunting down those he felt was \nresponsible for the death of Regent Yoshida. Despite numerous warnings Takechi \nrefused to believe that Yamanouchi was not a Loyalist at heart and remained in the \nhan, confident that the murder could not be traced back to him or his men. He \nwas arrested in September of 1863. Again, I have yet to read that far into the \nbook,  but I believe he was executed not too long after this.\n\nHope this helps some.\n\n-MissB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
