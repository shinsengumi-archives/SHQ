It is clear that hist. Saitou was a really consistent guy\nset (disciplined) in his ways...he was probably really really strict\nwith his sons too.  Soba is really a fast/easy dish to make so I\nwonder if Tokio chose soba as a shortcut to making a real meal :P\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; One thing I&#39;ve always liked about RK Saitou... his general laid back\nnature and his little &quot;rebelling&quot; at not wearing his jacket completely\nbuttoned-up... \nI&#39;m glad N.Watsuki streamlined the design could you imagine how dorky\nSAitou would look in the uniform?  I always loved RK Saitou&#39;s\njacket/collar.\nPhil...I just read that although the French Police placed great\nemphasis on the appearance of their personnel certain ranks were\nallowed to go to work in casual wear (basically high ranking guys note\nthe pic of Toshiyoshi Kawaji with arms folded wearing a suit). I\nimagine that if indeed Fujita Goro was somehow involved in information\ngathering (French police ofcourse had an equivalent division basically\none guy can have as many as 10-20 other guys doing the footwork and he\nwould write up a report)...I imagine that he wouldn&#39;t have to wear a\nuniform all the time either...only on formal occasions.\n\n[OT SOBA THEORY]\n*I have a hunch based on other Japanese sites about when the group\nwhich would become the Shinsengumi had to check into inns--they signed\nguestbooks...and back then there was a &quot;tab&quot; system at\ninns/restaurants maybe someone found Saitou&#39;s tab at a soba restaurant\nor something (usually sold in stalls like seen in the manga because it\nis a cheap dish but I&#39;m sure some restaurants had it as a specialty).\n Otherwise why would PMK rip off of RK SAitou&#39;s love of soba?  A long\nlong time ago I used to post a link to an Aizu tourist type site and\nthere was an ad for a noodle dish (soba I think based on the bamboo\nrack thing under the noodles).\n\n\n\n"
