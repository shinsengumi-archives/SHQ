In the chronological table it seems to \n&gt; have a great deal about his what he was doing from the battle of Toba-\n&gt; Fushimi until he goes to Aizu. But of course I can&#39;t understand the \n&gt; names of any of the places or people because they&#39;re mangled. It does \n&gt; seem that he was &quot;at the rear&quot; with Nagakura during the fighting on \n&gt; January 6. It also says something about him takeing &quot;a treatment of \n&gt; wound in a medical place&quot; and something about Izumi Bridge on January \n&gt; 19. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the section on the different names he went by it&#39;s trying to \n&gt; explain the origin of the name &quot;Fujita Goro&quot;. It&#39;s saying something \n&gt; about he was &quot;granted&quot; the name &quot;of an old Aizu feudal lord according \n&gt; to the traditions of the Fujitas&quot;. It states there are no historical \n&gt; records to back the story up, but then the webmaster speculates it \n&gt; could be true because he was able to marry Tokio and something about \n&gt; who one of the go-betweens was. I&#39;m guessing they mean one of the men \n&gt; other than Matsudaira.\n&gt; \n&gt; The family register now lists Yaso too. I can&#39;t figure out what it&#39;s \n&gt; trying to say about her brothers though. It seems to indicate her \n&gt; father was killed in battle, but I might be misreading it.\n&gt; \n&gt; One amusing thing at least. When it was trying to explain something \n&gt; about where the name &quot;Saito&quot; came from it said: &quot;...no singing from \n&gt; door to door for money&quot;. Ok...  I have no idea what that has to do \n&gt; with his name, but I&#39;ll take that advice to heart!\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin (Swears she never sang door to door for money in her \n&gt; life!)\n\n\n"
