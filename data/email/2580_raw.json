ONe which I recently read has \nFujita =\r\nTsuyoshi (Tokio+Goro&#39;s 2nd son) as the main character.  \nSomehow he ends up=\r\n in England and meets Queen Victoria who was \nsharing her bed with Hijikata=\r\n.  \n\nFor people who dislike alternate pairings, think about this one.\nFujit=\r\na Goro x Okubo.  \nNifty translates some things very well like &quot;you are my d=\r\noll&quot; and \nOkubo running his hands through Goro&#39;s hair etc etc etc\nI believe=\r\n the author justified it due to Okubo and his connection to \nthe whole Itou=\r\n affair business.
