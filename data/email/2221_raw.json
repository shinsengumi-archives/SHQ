So the biography illustrates how dangerous it is to make\ncultural generalizations.  I did my best to arrange his bio in my\n&quot;SILVERDRUM&quot; notes in the FILES section but be warned I may have left\nout some of his jobs (he held many posts).  His life demonstrated that\nthe ideals of the &quot;revolutionaries&quot; were shared by the pro-shogunate\npeople as well.  \n\n&quot;Taka&quot; (the nanny from Aizu)\nwell, lots of fanfic, and even in our private Aim chats we try to\n&quot;recreate&quot; or formulate the personality of Aizu women.  We draw upon\nthe legacy of the Joshitai, the writings of Shiba Goro and even the\nlater model provided by Yamakawa/Oyama Sutematsu.  Taka, is very very\nstrong willed and if you check out my notes she was a major figure in\nthe family and played a critical role during the wedding.  I love her.\n Oh, before I forget---Taka was connected to Yamakawa Sutematsu (who\nwas also Princess Chichibu&#39;s heroine).  Taka&#39;s diary was important in\nthis biography.\n\nit&#39;s easy to remember dates now\nFujita Goro died on Sept 18 1915\n\nwedding ceremony, officially restored the honor of Aizu, and in which\na former possession Fujita Goro became an important gift occurred on\nSept 18 1928\n\nThe book is an &quot;official&quot; memoir and the Princess was restricted when\nit came to writing about the royalty during WW2.  In fact the second\nhalf of the book right after her husband succumbed to TB and she\nassumed his role/duties...the book turned into a &quot;list&quot; of activities.\n\nI will try to scan pics tomorrow.\n\nI received a WONDERFUL entry for the contest\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/contest.htm\nbut HOTMAIL has prevented me from logging on for the whole day...I\nwill post this new entry ASAP\n\n\n\n\n"
