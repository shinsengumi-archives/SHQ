Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t answer my question.   I wanted to know, other then swordmanship, what other sort of martial art (if any) were young boys taught as they grew up?   I would imagine some for of jujitsu would be taught just in case you somewhow were unable to use your sword.\n\n-Bunneh\n^.^\n\n \n---------------------------------\nWant to start your own business?
