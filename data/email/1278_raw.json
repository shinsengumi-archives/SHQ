So Saito didn&#39;t stayed all along during his real kinshin times, \nin Hijikata&#39;s room. :-)\n\nNevetherless, webmistress wonders also, why it was Saito who stayed with \nHijikata instead of Nagakura, and she gave her own supposition; [Hijikata gave \nSaito a mission to approach Ito as a spy before this affair.Only, Saito went a \nlittle bit too far, and Hijikata was displeased about it. But Saito who knew \nHijikata would never really punish him, could laugh about it.\nProbably, Hijikata heard Saito&#39;s report, though grunted.]\n\nI put also the definition of &quot;Kinshin&quot;.\n&quot;One of the punishments with which the person of the status more than Samurai \nwas sentenced at the Edo period. The place in which concerned person lives \nwas appointed, the entrance was closed, and free action was not allowed.&quot;\n\nI think, NHK drama would show this episode too(and I hope so. I want to see \nthis epispde with these actors!), as I constate some tendency of the \nscriptwriter up till now.\nI&#39;ll post about Sano&#39;s legend and Matsubara affair later.\n\nTama\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
