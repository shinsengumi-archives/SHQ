Let me rephrase this.\n\nAre there=\r\n questions on where Nagakura and the others with question marks came from? =\r\n\nPerhaps there are questions regarding a few members&#39; origins (2-3 at most)=\r\n.\n\nFor example, Nagakura was born in Matsumae-han&#39;s residence in Edo. (clan=\r\n=3DMatsumae of \nEzo, place of birth=3DEdo, Musashi). Okita was born in Shir=\r\nakawa-han&#39;s residence in Edo. \n(clan=3DShirakawa of Mutsu, place of birth=\r\n=3DEdo, Musashi).  \n\nIf the editor(s) had wanted to list everyone&#39;s clan, t=\r\nhen Nagakura should&#39;ve been under Ezo \nsection instead (and without a quest=\r\nion mark).  If they had wanted to list everyone&#39;s place \nof birth, then Oki=\r\nta should&#39;ve been under Musashi section instead.  \n\n~Seven\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I don&#39;t know the h=\r\nistory well enough, but are there questions\n&gt; on where Nagakura and the oth=\r\ners with question marks came from?
