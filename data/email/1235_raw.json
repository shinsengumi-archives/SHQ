Who chooses them?\n \nWhich brings me to something I was thinking about earlier today... during his lifetime... let&#39;s say during the time period of RK to keep it easy to think about... did people refer to the emperor as Meiji or did that come after his death?  I only ever knew the Japanese emperor as Hirohito before his death and now it&#39;s something else (Showa? or was that earlier?).  I&#39;ve read about how that name is decided, but I began to wonder about Meiji and the usage of Meiji to number the years as they were passing.  Is it actually wrong for characters in RK to be referring to 1878 as Meiji 11?  When is that decided?  What would they have actually have used to specify the year?\n \nphil (confused as usual)\n\nHirotada Tokugawa &lt;patriot014@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom www.toshizo.com.
