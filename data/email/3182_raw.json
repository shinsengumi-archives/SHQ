All our info on Nakajima=\r\n \nNobori is now here\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/nakajimabio.html\n(images =\r\nare offline because we are reorganizing the server right now) \nbut you can =\r\nstill read his bio just fine.\n\nI also made a tribute video to Nobori here:\n=\r\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/shinsengumi/NAKAJIMA_0001.wmv\n\nThis page:\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.shinsengumihq.com/nakajimastudio.html\nhas the rough translation of the im=\r\nage you are referring as well as \ninformation on other paintings (Hirotada =\r\nTokugawa translated them). \nHowever that page was pulled offline for reform=\r\natting (basically we \nneed to get the code a certain way to allow the datab=\r\nase to pick up \nkeywords).  Sorry for the inconvenience everyone, but I hav=\r\ne to take \nmy orders from the programmer, she does the sophisticated stuff =\r\nand \ndo the grunt work.  I have asked her to keep pages online but she has =\r\n\na different work style etc etc\n\nThe painting is of Yamaguchi Jiro (we know=\r\n him as SAitou Hajime).  \nYamaguchi Jiro led the Shinsengumi in the defense=\r\n of Aizu.  Ofcourse \nHijikata Toshizo was the official leader, however due =\r\nto a foot \ninjury Yamaguchi had to step up and take charge.  Later on after=\r\n \nHijikata and many SHinsengumi had to depart, Yamaguchi Jiro and a \nhandfu=\r\nl of Shinsengumi stayed behind.  Nakajima Nobori mentioned on \nthe painting=\r\n that Yamaguchi Jiro had DIED in Aizu---this is ofcourse \ninnaccurate (^_^)=\r\n.  You see &quot;Yama&quot; (mountain) on his jacket.  \nYamaguchi Jiro later changes =\r\nhis name to Fujita Goro (his last name)\n\nNakajima Nobori&#39;s art is also now =\r\na tattoo!\nCHECK IT OUT here:\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/cosplay.html\n\n\n--=\r\n- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lokieternal1&quot; &lt;lokieternal1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I cr=\r\neated a file in photoes and added the pic I was talking about if\n&gt; anyone h=\r\nas the time or inclanation. I found a site dedicated to the\n&gt; art of Nakaji=\r\nma Nobori. This picture I had found months ago.. but I\n&gt; can&#39;t remember whe=\r\nre... it is also featured on this site.\n&gt; here is the link\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1hap=\r\npyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NN.html\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
