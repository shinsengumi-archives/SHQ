In my \n  area the local law enforcement agencies frequently change the paint jobs of \n  their patrol cars for the exact same reason. \n\n  On another note, I ran across a reference which stated that the reason the \n  Shinsengumi uniform was blue was because this was the color that the 47 ronin \n  when committing seppuku?! (Sorry, I forgot to take down the url.) I am not \n  understanding this statement since I thought that samurai -always- wore white for \n  this, unless the act was spontaneously performed on the battlefield or \n  something.\n\n  -MissB\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
