Most interestingly, hi=\r\nstorical Kondou compared himself to one of the characters in the film.\n\nThe=\r\n film ultimately is the highest level of &quot;fanfiction&quot; of Romance of the Thr=\r\nee Kingdoms by a master director.  \n\nDon&#39;t miss this film!\n\n--- In SHQ@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Follow up to:\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/3412\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw the first half of=\r\n RED CLIFF and it&#39;s SPECTACULAR.  \n&gt; \n&gt; John Woo&#39;s vision of RED CLIFF, the=\r\n most well known chapter of China&#39;s \n&gt; epic THREE KINGDOMS is everything it=\r\n promises to be to people who know \n&gt; the story.  I&#39;m concerned that when t=\r\nhe movie is released in the west it \n&gt; will simply not have the same impact=\r\n and the first 20 minutes are so are a \n&gt; bit rocky.  Most people who know =\r\nthe story can tell which character is \n&gt; which such as &quot;guy on white horse&quot;=\r\n has a name we all know already.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Understandably trailers of RED CLIF=\r\nF make it seem like another empty, \n&gt; soul-less CG extravaganza but if you =\r\nacquire the film you&#39;ll be in for a BIG \n&gt; SURPRISE and part two will be ev=\r\nen better.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Warning: there is another &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; film by Sammo =\r\nHung---it \n&gt; looks really &quot;iffy&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; But back to Three Kingdoms and why K=\r\nondou and men of his generation \n&gt; loved this work---to the point that Kond=\r\nou somewhat identified himself \n&gt; with the character of Guan Yu.\n&gt; \n&gt; There=\r\n are many versions of THree Kingdoms but the &quot;basic&quot; Guan Yu we \n&gt; know fro=\r\nm history was simply a self-made man.  A farmer with no distinct \n&gt; backgro=\r\nund.  We assume that although he came from an incredibly \n&gt; humble backgrou=\r\nnd he seemed to be able to read---atleast in one \n&gt; memorable episode he re=\r\nads  (or he may have pretended to read).  More \n&gt; importantly Guan Yu was v=\r\nery loyal/sincere and had a warrior&#39;s sense of \n&gt; pride well before his swo=\r\nrn brother was able to establish a kingdom/feud \n&gt; which in the process rai=\r\nsed his rank.  His pathetic capture and death is \n&gt; often dramatized in fic=\r\ntion and over the centuries he became a &quot;stock \n&gt; character&quot; for loyalty, w=\r\narrior prowess and masculine power however the \n&gt; historical Guan Yu was su=\r\npposedly much more cunning and seemed to put \n&gt; up a better fight than his =\r\nfictional self. Kondou would have had access to \n&gt; the fictional Guan Yu vi=\r\na traditional story tellers and then he could have \n&gt; come across poetry an=\r\nd the full-length &quot;novel&quot; as he matured.  With each \n&gt; retelling a person e=\r\nxperiences the story becomes more &quot;badass&quot; to the \n&gt; young warrior.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sa=\r\nmurai easily related to the Three Kingdoms as a historical and literary \n&gt; =\r\nwork because the epic is about warring feuds yet it has so many delicate \n&gt;=\r\n episodes which remind readers that in between the blood and gore there \n&gt; =\r\nis still life beyond the battlefield and even the possibility of averting c=\r\nonflict.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
