My name is Bruno Ern and I am a new member from this group. \nI am 17 and I&#39;m from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n&gt;   I am member since 3rd August, but is the first time I write.\n&gt;   \n&gt; --&gt;  I&#39;m writing in order to know if there is any member from \nBrazil and to ask if Kondo Isami and Choshuu samurais like Katsura \nKogoro and Sakamoto Ryoma were friends, as it is shown on \nShinsengumi taiga drama. Sorry my poor english =/\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruno  \n\nHello, Bruno-san.\nI am momoiro-usagi. \nI am also poor English. \nPlease allow, even if I write strange English. \n\nThe setup from which Kondou, Sakamoto, and Katsura became friends is \nthe fiction of Taiga drama. \nHowever, it is the fiction which may be a true story. \nWhen they live in Edo, there is no information that they were \nfriends. \nBut there is also no information that they were not friends. \nWhen the dramatist of a drama proposed this setup, the researchers \nwho do history historical investigation were perplexed. \nIt was a setup which is likely to be severely criticized by the \nserious Shinsengumi fan. \nHowever, they confirmed the contents of the scenario and issued O.K. \nTo be sure, this is a fiction.\nHowever, Kondou, Sakamoto, and Katsura were in Edo rightly as a \nhistorical fact in 1854 set as the 1st episode. \nThere is no proof that they were not friends. \nThey are not unable for them to meet in somewhere in Edo city, and \nto become friends. \n(But people of 1,500,000 lived in Edo city of Bakumatsu. \nI think that it is quite difficult for them to meet in it.)^^;;;\nThis Taiga drama is the fiction of the boundary which is not \nimpossible. \n\nIncidentally, as for a setup of an acquaintance of Katsura and \nKondou, Taiga drama is not the first.\nI regard it as &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; of Shiba Ryotarou having been the \nbeginning. \n(This is a novel and, of course, a fiction.) \nWhen a Dojyo challenger comes to Shieikan, Katsura is called in \norder to play a game in a substitute. \nIn fact, when the Dojyo challenger came to Shieikan, Kondou called \nstrong sword man from other neighboring Dojyoes, and had him do an \nacting game.\nIt is not known whether Katsura came to Shieikan. \nHowever, Katsura was a student&#39;s representation in big Dojyo called \nRenpeikan. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
