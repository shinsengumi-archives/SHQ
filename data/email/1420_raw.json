Or the \ndiscription says that he had beautiful voice, so \nit might mean his voice was like the one of singers and a \npenetrating voice.&quot;\n\n20 secretarytocapt3 asks &quot;good-natured person&quot; is given in the \nsoftware translation http://www.nifty.com/globalgate do you see this \nword in the Japanese?  &quot;Good personality&quot; also appears in Nakajima \nNobori&#39;s portrait.  To Japanese people what is &quot;good-natured or good \npersonality?&quot;\n\n[Answer] &quot;The literal tranlation is &quot;he looks like the person who is \nliked by many people.&quot; So, it might indicate that he looks like a \nrespected person or an important person. Also, a good personality \nmeans he looks very kind and gentle.&quot;\n\n@_@ Kind? Gentle? This cannot possibly be Saitou (or in this case \nthe bearded Mr. Yamaguchi)\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;momomanjyuu2004&quot; &lt;momomanjyuu2004@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; If you read the translations you will notice the phrase &quot;sweet \n&gt; &gt; voice&quot; I asked a Japanese person and he said it means &quot;low \nvoice&quot; \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; in other words soft spoken.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; However, Japanese of a basis is &quot;kawaii koe&quot;.\n&gt; Although this has the meaning of &quot;sweet&quot;, there is a meaning \n&gt; of &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;cute&quot;.\n&gt; Saitou&#39;s kawaii koe .....I cannot imagine. lol \n&gt; \n&gt; This woman regarded Yamaguchi as their being about 35 years old. \n&gt; However, Yamaguchi of those days was 25 years old. \n&gt; (This is the episode in 1868.) \n&gt; It seems that she was mistaken in his age. \n&gt; I am surmising that she probably heard his voice very youthfully. \n&gt; Therefore, I rather think that it would be high voice. \n&gt; \n&gt; momoiro-usagi\n\n\n"
