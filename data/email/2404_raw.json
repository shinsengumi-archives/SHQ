The novel discusses \nShimabara/Mibu and more details on Hijikata/Kondou as well.\nThe articles near the bottom are not directly connected to the \nShinsengumi so they are more supplemental in nature.  Please \ndownload stuff when you can even though you can&#39;t read the novel \nright away.  Remember it was written a long time ago so the language \ntakes a while to get used to.\n\nNow, this &quot;ULTIMATE BOSHIN WAR ARTICLE&quot; as I call it (^_^) has a \nreal title called &quot;Female Combatants and Japan&#39;s Meiji Restoration: \nthe case of Aizu&quot; by Diana Wright 22 pages long (BUT) if you want \n*THE BEST* maps you will ever see on the Boshin War then this is the \narticle to download.  It is also really easy to understand.\n\nNow for the women who kicked ass---for REAL!\n(Learn more at and see their pics \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/WB.htm)\nRead the article here...\nhttps://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/FemaleCombatantsAizu.pdf \n(email me if you have problems downloading anything)\n\n[Quick Recap For the new people]\nIn NHK Shinsengumi! You will see a guy named Matsudaira Katamori (he \ngoes to the sumo event at Mibu in disguise).  Matsudaira Katamori is \nthe daimyo or lord of Aizu, the guy in charge of security in Kyoto \nand he basically sanctioned the Shinsengumi.  Without Aizu, the \nShinsengumi would&#39;ve all had to go home or hangout in Kyoto without \na paycheck. Remember, that episode where Kondou went to talk to \nMatsudaira Katamori?\n\nWhen the Boshin War, 1868 started, Aizu was on the hit list for \nsupporting the Shogunate.  Satsuma, Choshu etc also wanted to &quot;pay \nback&quot; Aizu for prior military and political actions.  Aizu was \ndefended by lots of samurai included a small number of the \nSHINSENGUMI and JOUSHITAI (Women&#39;s Brigade).  It was one member of \nthe Joushitai, Yamamoto Yaeko the gun expert, who gave testimony of \nTAKAGI TOKIO&#39;s whereabouts during the siege and her role in the \ncastle.  If you want to visit Shinsengumi graves you go to Kyoto, \nAizu and Hakodate (battles occured at Sendai but Japanese fans never \nlisted graves there).  You want to visit Fujita Goro&#39;s grave you \nvisit Aizu.  Aizu is super important basically to the Shinsengumi \nand specifically to Saitou Hajime/Fujita Goro as he is widely \nbelieve to be Aizu&#39;s spy in the Shinsengumi.  In the world of \nKenshin you DO have a woman from Aizu looking for her \nfamily...MEGUMI! (^_^).\n\nYour humble but wordy servant,\nsecretarytocapt3\nsome interesting updates will go online soon at \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com\n\n\n\n\n"
