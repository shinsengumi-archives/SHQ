I&#39;ll paste \nboth relevant p=\r\narts, hoping to help clarifying the issue (Hijikata \nfans: notice the term =\r\ntekiya):\n\nNEW HEROES AND VILLAINS\n\nThe Koga and Iga Ninja who remained at t=\r\nhe capital were soon \npromoted.\nSome where assigned to an elite gun corps, =\r\nothers became personal \nguards,\nand some even joined the local police force=\r\n. Some of the most \nprominent\nNinja and Samurai became &quot;Hatamoto,&quot; or &quot;Dire=\r\nct vassals to the \nShogun.&quot;\nThese positions were fleeting. In all respects,=\r\n they were unemployed,\nforcing many of them to become &quot;Ronin,&quot; or &quot;Masterle=\r\nss warriors.&quot; \nMany\nbecame known as &quot;Kabuki-mono,&quot; which meant &quot;Crazy ones&quot;=\r\n. These \neccentric\nNinja and Samurai took on colorful names, wore strange c=\r\nlothing, and \ntook\npleasure in terrorizing any who crossed their path. They=\r\n were \nextremely\nloyal to one another, and in time, the Kabuki-mono numbere=\r\nd over \n500,000,\nmany of whom wandered throughout Japan looting towns and v=\r\nillages. \nHowever,\nto every coin there are two sides. Another group emerged=\r\n \nsimultaneously.\nThese people were called &quot;Machi-yakko,&quot; or &quot;Servants of t=\r\nhe town,&quot; \nand they\nconsisted of merchants, laborers, fishermen, renegade N=\r\ninja and \nRonin who\nhad become professional gamblers as a means of earning =\r\na living. \nEveryone in\nthis group took up arms against the Kabuki-mono, ser=\r\nving as \nprotectors\nagainst their tyranny. The Machi-yakko became heroes, p=\r\nraised by \ntown and\nvillages across the country for their bravery.\n\nELITE N=\r\nINJA\n\nIn 1716 Tokugawa Yoshimune was named Shogun. When he assumed the \ntit=\r\nle, he\nbrought in many of his own people to run the government. Among those=\r\n \nin his\nemploy were Kishu-Ryu Ninja who were descendants of the Ninja who =\r\n\nfled to\nthe Kii province after the battle of Iga 135 years earlier. The \nS=\r\nhogun\norganized the Kichu Ninja into a group called &quot;Oniwaban,&quot; which was \n=\r\nto be a\nlarge scale intelligence unit that would serve as the countries \nin=\r\nternal\nsecurity network. The agents in this network were called &quot;Metsuke,&quot; =\r\n\nwhich\nliterally meant &quot;Eyes.&quot; This new breed of Ninja was no longer \nrestr=\r\nicted to\nthe shadows. Their positions were very high profile and respectabl=\r\ne. \nThe\nShogun assigned a Metsuke to serve a Daimyo in every province in th=\r\ne \nland.\nThese agents were very polite, diplomatic and most importantly, \na=\r\nttentive to\nthe events of the province. This made it very difficult for any=\r\n \nDaimyo to\nplot against the Shogun without the risk of being discovered. I=\r\nn \nessence,\nthe Metsuke, because of their elite status, could openly map al=\r\nl the \ndetails\nof a castle in full view of everyone, noting its strengths a=\r\nnd \nweaknesses.\nThey could keep track of the number of Samurai employed by =\r\nthe \ndaimyo, and\nthey could investigate any issue that seemed suspicious to=\r\n them. This\ninformation would then be sent directly to the Shogun reference=\r\n.\n\nA SECRET UNDERWORLD\n\nBy the late 1700&#39;s the Machi-yakko (servants of the=\r\n town) had \nevolved into\na group known as Yakuza. This word, which roughly =\r\ntranslated means\n&quot;worthless&quot; comes from a card game called &quot;Hanafuda,&quot; or &quot;=\r\nFlower \ncards&quot;. The\ngoal of the game is to gather three cards that total 19=\r\n or under. \nAnything\nover 19 is a losing hand. The word YA meant 8, KU mean=\r\nt 9 and ZA \nmeant\nthree. This hand would total 20, which is a worthless han=\r\nd, thus the \nname\nsignifies someone who is an outsider of society. This gro=\r\nup was \nmostly made\nup of the poor, landless misfits of society, which was =\r\nperfect for \nmany\nrenegade Ninja and Ronin who could use their skills to at=\r\ntain high \npositions\nof power within the Yakuza hierarchy.\n\nThe Yakuza fami=\r\nlies were based on a Father (oyabun) Child (kobun)\nrelationship. The leader=\r\n of a Yakuza family was considered to be the \nparent\nto all those in his gr=\r\noup. Initiation into a Yakuza family was a \nvery ornate\nritual. Unlike a cl=\r\nassical martial tradition which required a blood \noath\nwritten on a scroll =\r\nin the applicants own blood and then burned at \nan alter,\nthe Yakuza simply=\r\n exchanged sake (rice wine) cups, filled to a level\nconsistent with their r=\r\nank, to symbolize their Oyabun-Kobun \nrelationship.\nThis act was performed =\r\nbefore a Shinto alter, which gave it religious\nsignificance. The Kobun posi=\r\ntion, although always subservient to the \nOyabun,\nconsisted of many levels.=\r\n These levels included; under-boss, \nofficers,\nenlisted and apprentices. Ag=\r\nain, this structure was not unlike the \nhierarchy\nused by the Ninja familie=\r\ns of Iga and Koga.\n***********\n\nSecond article:\n\nThe Yakuza Introduction \nI=\r\ntaly has the La Cosa Nostra. America has the Mafia. The Irish and \nJews hav=\r\ne their own crime organizations in America. Southeast Asia \nhas the Triads.=\r\n China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have the Tong. Truly \nwell-known organized cri=\r\nme organizations indeed. \nHowever, there is one organization that was not m=\r\nentioned in the \nabove list, a group that has been around for over 300 year=\r\ns. A group \nthat has as much honor and principle as the Mafia, and is just =\r\nas \nstrong, if not stronger. \nThe group is yakuza.=A0\n\nHistory of the Yakuz=\r\na --- Feudal Japan Kabuki-Mono \n\nThe yakuza can trace its origins back to a=\r\ns early as 1612, when \npeople known as kabuki-mono (&quot;crazy ones&quot;), began to=\r\n attract the \nattention of local officials. Their odd clothing and haircuts=\r\n and \nbehavior, along with carrying long swords at their sides, made them \n=\r\nquite noticeable. Kabuki-mono made a habit of antagonizing and \nterrorizing=\r\n anyone at their leisure, even to the point of cutting \none down just for s=\r\nheer pleasure. \nThe kabuki-mono were eccentric samurai, taking outrageous n=\r\names for \ntheir bands and speaking heavily in slang. Their loyalty to one \n=\r\nanother was remarkable. They would protect each other from any \nthreat, inc=\r\nluding against their own families. In fact, the kabuki-\nmono were servants =\r\nof the shogun, also taking the name of hatamoto-\nyakko (&quot;Servants of the sh=\r\nogun&quot;). The groups were comprised of \nnearly 500,000 samurai that were forc=\r\ned into unemployment during the \ntime of peace during the Tokugawa era, for=\r\ncing them to become ronin \n(&quot;Wave man,&quot; a master less samurai). Many had tu=\r\nrned into bandits, \nlooting towns and villages as they wandered throughout =\r\nJapan. \nThe hatamoto-yakko cannot truly be seen as the forebears of that \ny=\r\nakuza. Instead, the yakuza see the machi-yokko (&quot;Servants of the \ntown&quot;) as=\r\n their ancestors. These people were the ones who took up \narms and defended=\r\n the villages and towns from the hatamoto-yokko. \nThese people consisted of=\r\n such occupations as clerks, shopkeepers, \ninnkeepers, laborers, homeless w=\r\narriors and other ronin. Everyone \nwho was part of the machi-yakko was an a=\r\ndept gambler, which helped \nthem develop a closely-knit relationship with e=\r\nach other and their \nleaders, much like today&#39;s yakuza. \nThe machi-yakko so=\r\non became folk heroes, praised by the townspeople \nfor their actions agains=\r\nt the hatamoto-yakko, though they were, for \nthe most part, untrained and w=\r\neaker than the hatamoto-yakko. They \nwere very similar to England&#39;s Robin H=\r\nood. Some of the machi-yakko \nwere even subjects of stories and plays. \nThe=\r\n early yakuza did not surface until the middle to late 1700&#39;s. \nThese membe=\r\nrs include the bakuto (traditional gamblers) and the \ntekiya (street peddle=\r\nrs). These terms are still used today to \ndescribe yakuza members today, al=\r\nthough a third group, gurentai \n(hoodlums) has been added in the post World=\r\n War II era. Everyone in \nthose groups came from the same background: poor,=\r\n landless, \ndelinquents and misfits. The groups stuck closely in the same s=\r\nmall \nareas without problems, as the bakuto remained mostly along the \nhigh=\r\nways and towns, and the tekiya operated in the markets and fairs \nof Japan.=\r\n \nThe yakuza began organizing into families, adopting a relationship \nknown=\r\n as oyabun-kobun (father-role/child-role). The oyabun was \nthe &quot;father,&quot; pr=\r\noviding advice, protection and help; the kobun acted \nas the &quot;child,&quot; swear=\r\ning unswerving loyalty and service whenever the \noyabun needed it. The init=\r\niation ceremony for the yakuza also \ndeveloped in this period of time. Inst=\r\nead of the actual bloodletting \nthat was practiced by the Mafia and the Tri=\r\nads, the yakuza exchanged \nsake cups to symbolize the entrance into the yak=\r\nuza and the oyabun-\nkobun relationship. The amounts of sake poured into eac=\r\nh cup \ndepended upon one&#39;s status, whether the participants were father-\nso=\r\nn, brother-brother, elder-younger, etc. The ceremony was usually \nperformed=\r\n in front if a Shinto altar, giving it religious \nsignificance.=A0Tekiya \nT=\r\nhe tekiya&#39;s history is still widely debated. The most widely \naccepted theo=\r\nry was that the tekiya came from yashi, an earlier word \nmeaning peddler. T=\r\nhe yashi were travelling merchants of medicine, \nmuch similar to the Americ=\r\nan West&#39;s snake oil merchants. Over time, \nyashi became a catch-all for all=\r\n merchants and peddlers. \nThey tekiya united with each other for protection=\r\n and mutual \ninterest from the Tokugawa regime. They began to control the b=\r\nooths \nat fairs and markets. Their reputation for shoddy merchandise was \nw=\r\nell known and well-deserved. Their salesmanship was deceptive. They \nlied a=\r\nbout origins and quality of products. The would act drunk and \nmake a show =\r\nof selling their wares cheaply, so it would appear that \nthey were unaware =\r\nof what they were doing. They would delude the \ncustomer. \nThe tekiya follo=\r\nwed the usual yakuza organization: oyabun, \nunderboss, officers, enlisted a=\r\nnd apprentices. The oyabun controlled \nthe kobun and the allocation of stal=\r\nls along with the availability \nof the goods. He also collected rents and p=\r\nrotection money, and \nwould pocket the difference between the two. Everythi=\r\nng they did was \nlegal work. In the middle 1700&#39;s, the feudal authorities r=\r\necognised \nand therefore increased the power of the tekiya. Oyabun were giv=\r\nen \nthe authority of supervisor, now being able to have a surname and \ncarr=\r\ny two swords similar to samurai, in order to reduce the threat \nof turf war=\r\ns due to widespread fraud. However, the tekiya still \nembraced some crimina=\r\nl traits, such as protection rackets, the \nharboring of fugitives and known=\r\n criminals, and brawling with other \ntekiya and gangs. \n\nBakuto --- the Gam=\r\nblers=A0\n\nThe bakuto were first recognized during the Tokugawa era, when th=\r\ne \ngovernment hired them to gamble with contraction and irrigation \nworkers=\r\n in order to regain a portion of the substantial wages the \nworkers receive=\r\nd. \nThe bakuto contributed to Japan&#39;s tradition for gambling, as well as \nt=\r\nhe yakuza&#39;s traditional &quot;finger-cutting,&quot; and the origin of the \nword &quot;yaku=\r\nza.&quot; \nThe word comes from a hand in a card game called hanafuda (flower \nca=\r\nrds), similar to blackjack. Three cards are dealt per player, and \nthe last=\r\n digit of the total counts as the number of the hand. A hand \nof 20, the wo=\r\nrst score, gives the score of zero. One such losing \ncombination is 8-9-3, =\r\nor ya-ku-sa, which began to be widely used to \ndenote something useless. Th=\r\nis term began to be used about bakuto, \nas they were, on the whole, useless=\r\n to society. \nYubitsume, the custom of finger-cutting, was introduced by th=\r\ne \nbakuto. The top joint of the little finger is ceremoniously severed, \nsi=\r\ngnifying a weakening of the hand, which meant that the gambler \ncould not h=\r\nold his sword as firmly. Yubitsume was performed was \nusually performed as =\r\nan act of apology to the oyabun. Further \ninfractions would either mean the=\r\n severing of the next joint or the \ntop section of another finger. It is al=\r\nso used as a lasting \npunishment just before expulsion. \nThe use of tattoos=\r\n also came from the criminal aspect of the bakuto. \nCriminals were usually =\r\ntattooed with a black ring around an arm for \neach offense he had committed=\r\n. However, the tattoos soon became a \ntest of strength, as they were applie=\r\nd by undergoing 100 hours for a \ncomplete back tattoo. The tattoo also mark=\r\ned a misfit, always \nunwilling to adapt themselves to society.=A0\n\nThe Rest=\r\noration Years \n\nThe Meiji Restoration, starting in 1867, gave Japan a rebir=\r\nth and \nits first of many transformations into an industrial nation. \nPolit=\r\nical parties and a parliament were created, as well as a \npowerful military=\r\n. \nThe yakuza also began to modernize, keeping in pace with a rapidly \nchan=\r\nging Japan. They recruited members from construction jobs and \ndock working=\r\ns. They even began to control the rickshaw business. \nGambling, however, ha=\r\nd to be even more covert, as police were \ncracking down on bakuto gangs. Th=\r\ne tekiya, unlike the bakuto, \nthrived and expanded, as their activities wer=\r\ne not illegal, at least \nnot on the surface. \nThe yakuza began to dabble in=\r\n politics, taking sides with certain \npoliticians and officials. They coope=\r\nrated with the government so \nthey could get official sanction, or at least=\r\n some freedom from \nharassment. \nThe government did find a use for the yaku=\r\nza --- as aid to ultra \nnationalists, who took a militaristic role in Japan=\r\n&#39;s adaption into \ndemocracy. Various secret societies were created and trai=\r\nned \nmilitarily, trained in languages, assassination, blackmail, etc. The \n=\r\nultra nationalist reign of terror lasted into the 1930&#39;s, consisting \nof se=\r\nveral coups d&#39;etat, the assassination of two prime ministers \nand two finan=\r\nce ministers, and repeated attacks on politicians and \nindustrialists. The =\r\nyakuza provided muscle and men to the cause and \nparticipated in &quot;land deve=\r\nlopment&quot; programs in occupied Manchuria or \nChina. \nThings changed, however=\r\n, when Pearl Harbor was bombed. The \ngovernment no longer needed the ultra =\r\nnationalists or the yakuza. \nMembers of these groups either worked with the=\r\n government, put on a \nuniform, or were put into jail. \n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Bonnie Johnston&quot; &lt;kallipygia@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, everyone!\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m reading &quot;Yakuza Diary,&quot; by Christopher Seymour, and came \nacross a=\r\n \n&gt; reference to the Shinsengumi.  Seymour was interviewing a yakuza \nwho s=\r\nerves \n&gt; as the historian for the Aizu Kotetsu, a clan in Kyoto.  Speaking =\r\n\nof the \n&gt; founder of the Aizu Kotetsu, Ubesaki Senkichi, and Senkichi&#39;s \nb=\r\noss, Senhachi \n&gt; (who was from another gang; apparently the yakuza gangs wo=\r\nuld \noccasionally \n&gt; spawn offshoots, and the sub-gang remained loyal to th=\r\ne leader of \nthe main \n&gt; gang), the yakuza historian says:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;In the yea=\r\nrs right before the 1868 Meiji Revolution, there was \nturbulance \n&gt; in the =\r\nsamurai class.  There was also trouble among the lower \nranks of \n&gt; guardsm=\r\nen.  They were losing their jobs protecting damiyo (sic), \nfeudal \n&gt; lords,=\r\n residing in Kyoto.  A gang called Shinseigumi, headed by a \nman named \n&gt; I=\r\nsao Kondo, found itself unemployed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Isao Kondo asked the gambling bos=\r\ns Senhachi for employment for \nthe \n&gt; redundant Shinseigumi men.  Though Se=\r\nnhachi accepted these men \ninto his \n&gt; organization, he decided to put his =\r\nfavorite understudy (Senkichi) \nin charge \n&gt; of these newcomers.  Senkichi =\r\naccepted the position and brought \nalong three \n&gt; friends from his youth to=\r\n assist him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This reorganized gang was now called Aizu Kotetsu-kai.  =\r\nAizu, for \nthe \n&gt; region where the gang originated, and Kotetsu, after Senh=\r\nachi&#39;s \nfavorite \n&gt; brand of sword.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (p.72)\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t know how accura=\r\nte this is, but thought I&#39;d throw it out \nthere for \n&gt; discussion or furthe=\r\nr research, if anyone is interested.\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________=\r\n________________________________\n&gt; Express yourself instantly with MSN Mess=\r\nenger!
