That would take a=\r\nlot of money and time due to the \nneed of assembling a team of translators.=\r\n  So I cannot really say his \ninformation is bad.  However in terms of *sch=\r\nolarship* the book \napproaches the topic by using themes.  Instead of the c=\r\nause and effect \nof historical circumstances he for instance highlights the=\r\n ambitions \nof the Shinsengumi.\n\n\n&gt; it is just not well written, Is it a re=\r\nliable historical reference? \nOr\n&gt; are there just issues with the conclusio=\r\nns he draws?  \n\n\n*Personally I think his work is very immature due to the s=\r\narcasm he \nconstantly uses to describe the Shinsengumi.  If he wanted to wr=\r\nite a \ntext on history such a tone is entirely inappropriate.  I think he d=\r\nid \nnot use the most recent nor best sources...as Hillsborough \nknows..ther=\r\ne are MANY books on the Shinsengumi\n\nfor example:  http://www.shinsengumihq=\r\n.com/bibliography2.htm\nyou will see books which have collected letters writ=\r\nten by the \nShinsengumi\n\nHillsborough should have used those books to creat=\r\ne a more complete \nnarrative\n\nthe author also noted that his book is not 10=\r\n0% &quot;historical&quot; because \nas he fairly noted---writing such a book on the Sh=\r\ninsengumi would be \nincredibly difficult\n\nMaybe he should add that his hero=\r\nes, the Ishin Shishi were 100% \nresponsible for &quot;revising&quot; Japan&#39;s history =\r\nand suppressing what \nthe &quot;other side&quot; (losers) had to say---THAT IS WHY IT=\r\n IS HARD TO WRITE \nA BOOK ON THE SHINSENGUMI.  Alot of info has been lost, =\r\ndestroyed or \nstill hidden.  Even some descendents of the Shinsengumi today=\r\n feel \ninconvenienced to discuss their ancestors.\n\nI&#39;m starting to\n&gt; read u=\r\np on the Shinsengumi with a few Japanese books on the way via\n&gt; amazon.co.j=\r\np, but it is always nice to get a foundation in my native\n&gt; language. I che=\r\ncked the archives here, and it seems that people tend\n&gt; to dislike it, but =\r\nI&#39;d probably have to read every post to get the\n&gt; full picture, so I hope y=\r\nou don&#39;t mind me cheating with a direct \nquestion.\n\nI think many of us disl=\r\nike it not because Hillsborough holds a \ndifferent opinion on the Shinsengu=\r\nmi.  For me personally, I was \nangered by the fact that \n\n1) he was writing=\r\n the FIRST BOOK IN ENGLISH on the Shinsengumi---\ntechnically it makes his t=\r\next &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.  Rather than providing \na straight up text which is b=\r\noth neutral in tone and helpful in \nestablishing a foundation for future se=\r\nrious research he comes across \nas a bitter man annoyed by the popularity o=\r\nf the Shinsengumi.  I \nwould&#39;ve been eternally grateful if he was a bit civ=\r\nil in his text.  \nAnd imagine how much money he can make if he followed up =\r\nwith an \nattempted biography of let&#39;s say Okita?  The man shot himself in t=\r\nhe \nfoot IMHO.\n\n2) He abused that golden opportunity of being the first wes=\r\ntern author \nto introduce the group in text by using the Shinsengumi to pro=\r\nve his \nown personal view that the restoration was glorious and led by \ninf=\r\nallible idealists who were not filled with personal ambition, greed \nor &quot;pr=\r\nopensity to kill&quot; ---we know this to be innaccurate.\n\nHillsborough is a bla=\r\ntant Ishin &quot;worshipper&quot; and fanboy who thinks \nthat he is ripping the mask =\r\noff the Shinsengumi HEROES.\n\nUnfortunately, Hillsborough is not aware of th=\r\ne fact that even \nShinsengumi fans have a mature view of the miburo and the=\r\nir record.  \n\nWe know they were not perfect.\n\nWe get it.\n\nHillsborough shou=\r\nld put his journalism background to use and \ninvestigate his own &quot;heroes&quot; a=\r\nnd what foundation they laid for Japan!\n\nA Japan which was neither democrat=\r\nic, nor enlightened.\n\n1868 was the restoration of feudalism.\n\nIf he feels t=\r\nhat the Shinsengumi were just the dogs of the \nbakufu...why did he write a =\r\nbook on them?  If they held historical \nsignificance why did he simplify th=\r\neir narrative so much?\n\nBecause the Shinsengumi were/are a hot topic and he=\r\n wanted a piece of \nthe pie.\n\nsecretarytocapt3 (incredibly hormonal today)\n=\r\n\nP.S.  Shinsengumihq.com has quoted Hillsborough&#39;s book extensively.  \nWe h=\r\nave fans who did find the book very useful and therefore we have \nnot poste=\r\nd harsh criticism of his work anywhere on our site.\nI respect HIllsborough =\r\nfor some &quot;effort&quot; and the fact that he has \nstudied Japanese for 15 years.\n=\r\n\nIn fact our home page recommends the book because gosh darnit there is \nno=\r\n other book to overshadow his text.\n\nwe tried our best to be fair and direc=\r\nt people to what is &quot;out there&quot; \nwithout making our personal opinion a deci=\r\nding factor.\n\n\n\n"
