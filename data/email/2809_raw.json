As we \nsee in that volume, Kenshin never inte=\r\nrvened at Ikedaya, only becoming aware of the \nevents once everything is ov=\r\ner. He then assists to the Shinsengumi &quot;parade&quot; and exchange \na long look w=\r\nith Saito. Kenshin then thinks &quot;J&#39;ai l&#39;impression que je reverrai souvent c=\r\net \nhomme...&quot; or if I&#39;m translating from the French version &quot;I was under th=\r\ne impression that I \nwould often see that man in the future...&quot;, implying t=\r\nhat they didn&#39;t knew each other yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, in volume 21, once Tomoe is=\r\n dead (sorry, if I&#39;m spoiling that to anyone, but... \nwhere have you been?)=\r\n Kenshin returns to Kyoto and soon engage in a duel with Saito for \nthe fir=\r\nst time. Seeing him, Saito says &quot;Je me disais bien que ce n&#39;=C3=A9tait pas =\r\nun sabreur \nordinaire... c&#39;=C3=A9tait donc cela&quot; or &quot;I thought he was no or=\r\ndinary swordsman... this explains \nit...&quot;, meaning that he just understood =\r\nthat the man he saw in the crowd after Ikedaya is \nBattosai. \n&gt; \n&gt; So knowi=\r\nng this, it then becomes clear that the scene in volume 7 (or episode 28) d=\r\noes \nnot happens at Ikedaya, like many people thinks, but WAY after Ikedaya=\r\n. It really is a \ncommon mistake as I&#39;ve also been under that impression fo=\r\nr a long time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mary-Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; nlf7 &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:                =\r\n               Only one word has to be corrected, &quot; Ikedaya.&quot; \nPlease refer=\r\n to my original \n&gt;  message for more information.
