I am interested in a few more info about Yagi Hide (aside \n&gt; from the NHK show) ^__^*\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, I cannot find any good sources on her and her \nfamily \n&gt; per se. If someone can point me to the right direction, that will \nbe \n&gt; very much appreciated. Thanks guys/gals.\n\n\nProbably, I think that you will be disappointed about this answer. \n(My conscience pricks me when I think of it.)\n\nThe girl called Yagi Hide does not exist really. \nShe is the fictitious person of Taiga drama.\nThe elder brother and younger brother of a name who are called \nHidejirou and Tamesaburou were in the actual Yagi family. \nThe present Yagi family is the posterity of Hidejirou. \n\nIncidentally, although the old woman was in the Yagi family of a \nTaiga drama, she does not exist really in practice, either.\nThe actual Yagi family is also holding the funeral at the same time \nas death of her of Taiga drama. \nIn practice, it was the funeral of the child of Yagi family.\nProbably, other brother would exist in Hidejirou and Tamesaburou.\n(Although Japanese television has little regulation compared with a \nforeign country, it becomes nervous at a child&#39;s death.) \nSerizawa Kamo did not help a funeral in the Taiga drama. \nHowever, actual he acted as a visitor&#39;s receptionist together with \nKondou.\nThe scribble which Serizawa wrote to the note remains then still \nnow.^_^ \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
