Uh... I received 2 copies of their message to me.  (giggle) \nAny of you continuing to have problems receiving list mail into your \ninboxes (very late, multiple copies, not at all), would you contact \nme off-list and let me know what you&#39;re experiencing in case Yahoo \nwants more info from me to help them figure it out?  \n(spiritus_saitou@...)
