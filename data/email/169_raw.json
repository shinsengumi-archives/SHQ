Thank you for \n  telling me about this list, and welcome to Saitoh fandom.\n\n  Sith\n\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Firuze&quot; &lt;firuzekhanume2002@y...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Hi...\n  &gt; I suppose it&#39;s time to introduce myself... *fidgets slightly*\n  &gt; By now, some of you already know that all time RK favorite character \n  is Enishi, and might wonder what I&#39;m doing here. Hell, I even feel \n  myself like some kind of intruder... However, I think it&#39;s not exactly \n  a mystery that my second favorite character in the series is Saitou, \n  and that&#39;s why I tend to give him an important role in my fics. So, \n  well, I find tempting any place where I can find interesting \n  information  as well as to hear interesting discussions about him, his \n  past and the Shinsengumi. So here I&#39;m. \n  &gt; Yet, there is a second reason, since I am in love with PMK series. \n  The guilty party here is composed by Barbara Sheridan and Miss Behavin \n  *points at both* and their deliciously funny Mibu Times/Dispatch. I \n  found that to understand certain jokes I had to know about PMK, so I \n  decided to download several episodes. Since then, I&#39;m lost in \n  addiction. *wails*\n  &gt; A wave of sadness enveloped me over the past weekend, after I saw \n  episode 23, since it announced that next one would be the ending. Is \n  there any news on any kind of continuation? Is there any place where I \n  can read/download scanlations/translations of the manga? I live where \n  the world ends, in deep South America, so you can imagine, no dreams \n  of getting any copy of the manga at all for a very long time. Any info \n  will be deeply appreciated.\n  &gt; Firuze\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  visit \n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n  our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n        Yahoo!
