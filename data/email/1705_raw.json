Kondou was running \noperations for the Koyochinbutai (Shinsengumi-like unit serving the Shogun) \nat the time, and that&#39;s when he was captured. Hijikata, under the pseudonym \nNaito Hayato, tried to sneak a rescue attempt, but ultimately failed. Kondou \nwas beheaded, his head was displayed in Kyoto (I think), and then the rest \nof the Shinsengumi retreated with Hijikata and Saitou to Aizu.\n\nMomoiro-usagi-san, is this correct?\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
