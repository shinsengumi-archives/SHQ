I believe it is a novel and \nthat the setting is in China, Shanghai to be exact. The characters \nare historic men like Okita Soji, Ryoma Sakamato, etc. What makes \nthis bizzare is that it is a romance novel with &quot;guest&quot; stars like \nDracula, Sherlock Holmes, Billy the Kid, etc.... Oh it also \nincorporates elements from every country including Russia???\n\nIf anyone has this book PLEASE let me know the gist of it! Thanks.\n\nJapanese Language\n\nRelease Date : April 30, 2003 \n\n\n\n"
