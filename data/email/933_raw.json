I&#39;ve been wondering about this with the \nfic I was doing... It&#39;s nice to know my instincts were right after \nall! WEEEE!!!! The Mimawarigumi&#39;s also have a patrol site close to \nthe our boys, ah you have no idea how easier you made my life get... \nThanks again!!!\n\nON another note I never did thank you for the Saitou family tree... \nReally you are so GREAT!\n\n~wounds\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shimazu Masayoshi&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; You guys!!!! (jumps up and down) Get this! On page 7 of the \nguidebook\n&gt; to the NHK series, I found a map of Kyoto with the different \ndistricts\n&gt; that the different patrol groups ran, as of July 1866!!! I&#39;ve \nposted a\n&gt; sketch of it (I don&#39;t have access to a scanner right now) in the\n&gt; Photos section!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting thing of note-- Shinsengumi didn&#39;t patrol a large area,\n&gt; but they DID patrol the area around their HQ which included \nShimabara\n&gt; (w/courtesans and all), which is on the left side of the map I \nposted,\n&gt; AND, they patrolled what I think is Gion (the geisha/teahouse\n&gt; district), which is the one on the right side. Leave it to our \nguys to\n&gt; get all the babes....lol\n&gt; \n&gt; --M.\n\n\n"
