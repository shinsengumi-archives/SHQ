I don&#39;t know all the \n&gt; details, but here&#39;s a small summary i found on it\n&gt; \n&gt; With a famous samurai of Shinsengumi, Soji Okita as a woman, \nToshizo \n&gt; Hijikata and Ryoma Sakamoto rival for her affections.\n&gt; Director Mitsuyuki Yakushiji \n&gt; Cast Ken Watanabe / Riho Makise / Tetta Sugimoto \n&gt; Running time 105min \n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunetly i haven&#39;t found any place where they&#39;re selling it.\n\nOhh i just found a better summary\n\nIn the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, there was a cute warrior, \nSouji Okita, who belonged to the armed police of the shogunate in \nKyoto. Very few knew that Souji was not a boy, but a woman. Souji \nloved the vice-leader of the armed police, Toshizou Hijikata. Souji \nsuffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and coughed up blood during a \nbattle. Toshizou helped her but said that he did not care for the \ngirl with a smell of blood. Souji had a real talent for swordsmanship \nand no one but Ryouma Sakamoto could compete with her. Ryouma was a \nliberal intellectual and tried to carry out a revolution without \nblood. However, the bloody Meiji Restoration broke out and Souji \nkilled Ryouma who lost his dream. Because a friendship had sprung up \nbetween Toshizou and Ryouma, Toshizou got angry and slashed at Souji \nwith a sword. Unwillingly, she unsheathed her sword and thought that \nshe might get love if she was killed by the man she loved.\n\n\n\n\n"
