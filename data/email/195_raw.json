I&#39;ll try to locate the more specific info I have on this because, like most things, it&#39;s not quite THAT simple.\n \nWhen my mother was competing in flower arranging, there were many men involved in it.  Some of them were some pretty tough lookin&#39; dudes, too.  ;-)  \n \nThere&#39;s another fun image to contemplate... Kenshin coming in on RK Saitou arranging flowers (maybe after Kenshin&#39;s just had green tea with Aoshi?)  :-)\n \nphil\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
