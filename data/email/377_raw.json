There&#39;s \nreally not much info about them... I did come across another \ninteresting rumor from a livejournal somewhere (can&#39;t remember right \nnow)... Saitou seems to be related by blood to Mr. Sasaki? I know.. I \nknow... All I ever bring to the tables are rumors, just like that \nother woman of Saitou-sama... But really? This just sparked my \ninterest because, Saitou joined the Shinsengumi why did he not join \nthe Mimawarigumi? If he was related to Mr. Sasaki, wouldn&#39;t it have \nbeen easy? Or was it because his father was a Ronin that it would be \npreposterous for him to join the other patrol group who were composed \nof &quot;higher blood/lineage/ etc&quot;.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nBy the way... You can find more photos on the shinsengumi and \nSasaki&#39;s grave at this site...\n\nhttp://www.fc.a-vst.jp/location_library/shinsengumi/sasaki.html\n\n\n"
