The Shinsengumi had such\nfascinating demographics.\n\nImagine that you are a relative of one of these guys.  You travel to\nKyoto to visit let&#39;s say your beloved little brother...you get to\nheadquarters and say &quot;I came here to visit XXXXX, my beloved little\nbrother&quot; and the gatekeeper says &quot;oh you mean the ogre demolition man\nXXXX? Yeah, that&#39;s what we call him here&quot; 0_O \n\n\n\n"
