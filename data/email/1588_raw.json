One of the characters,\nMatsunosuke, is an Aizu samurai and good archer.  Although not\nmentioned in the book, Japanese archery kyudo/kyujutsu, has a feature\nwhere the bow rotates as the arrow is released, hence the need for an\narm guard because it rotates and hit the other side of your arm.  I\ngot screen caps to illustrate this from 1/47 ronin\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/147RoninBowRotation.jpg\nI thought I mentioned this because many mainstream martial arts book\ndo  not illustrate this detail very well...movies can be great\nlearning tools ^_^\n\nWill someone please recommend this book to an English language teacher\nwho works in Aizu...selected excerpts from the book can be used to\nenhance the learning experience.\n\nsecretarytocapt3\n\n\n"
