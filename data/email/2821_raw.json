To get to chat with others, and for a w=\r\nhile I&#39;ve \nbeen thinking about reviving the chatroom created in mIRC from a=\r\n couple of months ago.  \nIf anyone still remembers, the chatroom is still o=\r\nn the same server (caelestia.net)  with the \nsame channel name (#shinsengum=\r\nihq).   I myself am only available on Wednesdays & \nThursdays, but I would =\r\nlove to chat with all of you in order to get more information (as \nwas my o=\r\nriginal intention for the chatroom).   \n&gt; \n&gt; Also,  I was also intrested in=\r\n getting the information about when and how the \nShensengumi began to divid=\r\ne themselves into units.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Bunneh\n&gt; ^_____________^\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; secretary &lt;=\r\nsecretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:                               ok so we are all=\r\n in \nagreement that there is some conflicting info on\n&gt;  Okita but there ar=\r\ne issues regarding citation\n&gt;  \n&gt;  as of today this page is now a mess  ::R=\r\nOFL!!::\n&gt;  http://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I can&#39;t kee=\r\np up with you intense researchers (I work on the timeline,\n&gt;  Saitou Hajime=\r\n post 1868 because there is more info in English on the\n&gt;  Meiji Era, Takag=\r\ni/Fujita Tokio and some Aizu folks) so I have a ~weak~\n&gt;  grasp of Okita (b=\r\nut I wrote that article on TB, that counts for\n&gt;  something right?)...now t=\r\nhis is an idea...\n&gt;  \n&gt;  why don&#39;t all the Okita specialists form a team an=\r\nd revise Okita&#39;s\n&gt;  info page (^___^) get in a chatroom, or work on someone=\r\n&#39;s blog and do\n&gt;  some revising etc...but really you don&#39;t have to be a spe=\r\ncialist you\n&gt;  can be a fan who joins the group and asks questions, this wi=\r\nll help\n&gt;  the main writers understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of the hundreds of thousan=\r\nds of\n&gt;  Okita fans out there\n&gt;  \n&gt;  again it is totally important to cite =\r\ndetails this would be very\n&gt;  helpful to visitors of the site\n&gt;  \n&gt;  also y=\r\nou may right some mini articles on Okita as well and I can\n&gt;  create a sub-=\r\nmenu\n&gt;  \n&gt;  for example I split the Saitou Hajime page into sections (by th=\r\ne way\n&gt;  I&#39;m in the process of converting my word document essay into html =\r\nto\n&gt;  enhance the info on the page) you can take a peak here:\n&gt;  http://www=\r\n.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\n&gt;  \n&gt;  and when you are all done, just =\r\nemail the text, your names (real or\n&gt;  user names) to shinsengumihq(a)yahoo=\r\n.com\n&gt;  \n&gt;  a similar approach was adopted with the gigantic still in progr=\r\ness\n&gt;  timeline where several people over a couple of months emailed\n&gt;  upd=\r\nates/entries\n&gt;  \n&gt;  so promise me that you will all think about it!  It is =\r\nreally\n&gt;  impossible for one person to study ALL the Shinsengumi members or=\r\n all\n&gt;  facets of the history/culture\n&gt;  \n&gt;  specialize. divide and conquer=\r\n!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;      \n&gt;                        \n&gt; \n&gt;  _________________________=\r\n_________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
