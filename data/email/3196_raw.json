Though, I&#39;ve read from books that people in Ky=\r\noto were pro-\nChoshu a long time ago. I just can&#39;t remember which books I r=\r\nead that from and I&#39;m \nwondering whether you guys have also read it before =\r\n(from books, I mean.)  If so, can \nanyone provide a few citations?\n\n--- In =\r\nSHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think =\r\nthat it is impossible to truly determine if people in Kyoto \n&gt; were Pro - [=\r\ninsert faction] and the reason is that there was \n&gt; no &quot;polling&quot; done in th=\r\nat era.  Even in our modern era polling is \n&gt; unreliable and manipulated to=\r\n get people on a &quot;bandwagon&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, Fukuchi Genichiro was able=\r\n to print some of his \n&gt; arguably pro-bakufu opinions (Fukuchi later was a =\r\nMeiji newspaper \n&gt; editor and became pro-Meiji government due to the desire=\r\n to seek \n&gt; stability in Japan).  We do not know if his pro-bakufu stance d=\r\nuring \n&gt; the Bakumatsu years were popular or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; The truth is the peo=\r\nple in Kyoto or any situation will have a hard \n&gt; time expressing themselve=\r\ns because they will side with whichever side \n&gt; can bring stability and pea=\r\nce---at any cost.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps the question can be answered with how peop=\r\nle interpreted the \n&gt; events of  Kinmon no Hen (1864) during which many pro=\r\n-bakufu domains \n&gt; clashed with Choshu forces.  Was this viewed as an attem=\r\npt BY Choshu \n&gt; to aggressively retake political power in Kyoto? OR was thi=\r\ns viewed \n&gt; by many as Aizu&#39;s attempt to suppress another domain.  We must =\r\nask \n&gt; Choshu experts to explain details to us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rekishi Dokuhon is a m=\r\nagazine type publication with a mixed \n&gt; reputation however one can be clev=\r\ner and see if the information \n&gt; printed can be confirmed with OTHER source=\r\ns.  We also have to keep in \n&gt; mind that publishing in general is difficult=\r\n and that some \n&gt; researchers may find it easier to get things recorded in =\r\n\n&gt; Rekishi...than in other books.  For example let&#39;s imagine a \n&gt; researche=\r\nr without mainstream credentials like for instance a PHd in \n&gt; history with=\r\n a specialization in Japan---an &quot;amateur&quot; researcher may \n&gt; have found some=\r\nthing VERY valuable but may have to publish in Rekishi \n&gt; Dokuhon due to th=\r\ne simple circumstance of lack of credentials but \n&gt; more likley due to the =\r\nfact that it is just hard to get published.  I \n&gt; think that we as fans mus=\r\nt judge on a case to case basis.  \n&gt; www.shinsengumihq.com for instance has=\r\n had to cite Rekishi Dokuhon. \n&gt; Things such as rare Shinsengumi photos hav=\r\ne even appeared in \n&gt; Rekishi....  We also have to keep in mind that many b=\r\nooks (not just \n&gt; the history magazine Rekishi...) on the shinsengumi were =\r\nwritten in a \n&gt; non-academic tone with dubious citation and the information=\r\n therefore \n&gt; at times is unreliable as well.  So Rekishi is not the only p=\r\nroblem.\n\n\nThanks for the reply and the pro-Aizu information.\n\n~Seven\n\n\n"
