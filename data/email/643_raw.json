I&#39;ve been trying to learn more about the town where Saito moved \nto and it seems to be located between two rivers. Unfortunately I&#39;m \nnot sure if I&#39;m reading the names of these rivers correctly. It looks \nlike one is called the Shingo river and the other says Izumisawa five \nTogawa. Would that be Izumisawa Goro Togawa? Or could they be named \nsomething else entirely? That sounds really odd for a river name. The \nsite is www.gonohe.net/ \n\nIncidently, Gonohe is located near the city of Hachinohe, way below \nthe area actually known as the Shimokita peninsula. This region is \nstill fairly barren though. In fact, even today it seems farmers and \nothers who live in the area move to Tokyo during the winter season.\n\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
