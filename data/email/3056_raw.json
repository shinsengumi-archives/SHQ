I&#39;ve\nflipped through hillso=\r\nborough&#39;s book trying to find it, but since I\ndon&#39;t know what to look for, =\r\nI haven&#39;t had much luck. At first I\nthought it might mean they were given &quot;=\r\nofficial&quot; status, but the\nJapanese term used in the Shinsengumi Rekishi Gun=\r\nzo book is\n&quot;Meshikakae&quot;, which seems to mean someone hired for thier martia=\r\nl\nability, like a mercenary, so that seemed a bit odd, although the\nactual =\r\nverb means &quot;To make one a vassal/retainer&quot;, or to &quot;take one\ninto employment=\r\n&quot; - so I&#39;m trying to figure out exactly what this edict\nor whatever it was.=\r\n.. was.  If anyone with Hillsborough&#39;s book knows\nwhat page it is covered o=\r\nn, that would be great too.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n"
