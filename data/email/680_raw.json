But that is why I love him... I used to think of him as \n&gt; a &quot;filler&quot;, a cameo... Actually I thought the same about Tetsu, \n&gt; probably because I started watching only to see the Shinsengumi \n&gt; bishies ^_^ Back to Suzu, it&#39;s so obvious that there&#39;s promise in \n&gt; his character. I just hope like you, that the writers handle the \n&gt; whole thing correctly. Right now if the anime continued, he&#39;d be the \n&gt; guy hating both the Ishin-shishis and the Miburos, which is why he&#39;s \n&gt; so interesting. Which way will he go? What is the alternate route?\n\n\n"
