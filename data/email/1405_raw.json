Ikkyusan is called ikkyusan in the Thai dub or an \n&gt; alternate pronoun is the Thai word for novice+Ikkyu.\n&gt; But the most popular manga and anime is still Doraemon it seems.\n\nOh, I see! \nIt seems that Draemon is popular in Asia. There was Manga of \nDoraemon, before I was born. As for the Japanese below 40 years old, \nmost is looking at Doraemon at childhood. From when was there any \npopularity of Doraemon in Thailand? \n\n&gt; Manga is so popular in Thailand that we have problems with \nofficial \n&gt; compared to unofficial translations and companies have to clearly \n&gt; state that they have purchased the copyrights from Japan usually \n&gt; with a holographic sticker or some other symbol.\n\nMy friend traveled Thailand and bought the comic of Thai of &quot;One \nPiece&quot; for the souvenir to me. She bought it, after confirming that \nthe character of &quot;Shueisya&quot; was printed by the cover of a book.^^\n \n&gt; A Thai man invented ultraman SK ^_^ and it was exported to Japan \nin \n&gt; one episode of ultraman he fights with the monkey king from the \n&gt; Indian epic Ramayana the costume of the monkey king is in the \n&gt; traditional Thai dance style.  The Japanese company purchased the \n&gt; rights to ultraman for a certain number of years and continued to \n&gt; expand the ultraman universe.  The creator of ultraman is still \n&gt; alive and well and he explained in a documentary that ultraman was \n&gt; based on the BUDDHA @_@ !!!!\n\nYes. The foreign student of Thailand who was working for the \nTsuburaya production invented Ultraman. To be sure, he resembles the \nimage of Buddha.^^;; \n\n\nAnd I have to thank to you. \n\n&gt; ***The name of Saitoo Hajime is written on the back of the memorial\n&gt; monument.  It says: A promoter*: Matsumoto Ryoojun, Nakakura\n&gt; (Nagakura), and Saitoo\n&gt; It means that Saitoo was also concerned with erecting this \nmonument.\n&gt; In short, Saitoo, at least, kept company with Nagakura Shinpachi in\n&gt; the Meiji era.\n&gt; (secretarytocapt3 thinks...*promoter=contributed some money no \ndoubt)\n\nThank you for finding this episode. Since this was not found, I was \nmelancholy about one month. Before, I read these contents with the \nbook partly. Although I wanted to write this talk when I wrote to a \nboard about the episode of the grave which Nagakura built, I was not \nable to remember this correctly. \nI looked at the books of Shinsengumi which I have. However, no books \nwas written about this. My knowing is having engraved the side of \nthe grave with the dead&#39;s name. Therefore, about Saitou&#39;s name, I \nthought that it was my misapprehension. \nThank you very much again. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
