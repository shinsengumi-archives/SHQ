We accept and   understand that the Shinsengumi are a\ncontroversial group.&quot;\n\nI hunted   down this individual at the other forum and noticed that he\nis ALSO not   Japanese LOL but he is studying a Japanese martial art.  \n\nI   believe that this person was greatly affected, as we all are, by\ngraphic   images currently shown in the mass media as one of his many\ncomments dealt   with executions.  The person presumes that we cannot\ncomprehend or   even deny the violence and brutality of that time period\nand so on and so   forth.  He made some really horrible accusations on\nhow we seem to be   glorifying violence.\n\nSo from now on please call me &quot;sec&quot; on that   messageboard (abbreviation\nof secretarytocapt3) because this guy kept   calling me by my first name\n  Now I must try to do something about my   email :(\n\nI just wanted to share.\nHopefully non of you here will   receive a message from this person.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit   \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour   companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n                Yahoo!
