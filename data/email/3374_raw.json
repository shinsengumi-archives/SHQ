I&#39;ve organized them into three groups s=\r\no far,\n&gt; &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;, which contains all of the Shinsengumi and Bakumatsu=\r\n\n&gt; related images, &quot;Nijo palace&quot;, which has all of the Nijo palace\n&gt; images=\r\n, and &quot;Other&quot; for the ones that are sort of random.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here they are, let=\r\n me know what you think:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/\n&gt; \n&gt; E=\r\nnjoy!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
