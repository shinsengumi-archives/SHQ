I will try to chat with \nthe=\r\nm on Monday.  Fortunately our moderator Barb had a back up of the \nsite and=\r\n so if the tech people can&#39;t assist---we still have our data.\n\nSo what will=\r\n happen now?\n\nI will devote as much as possible to arrange the data into a =\r\ndraft for an \ne-book and then work with another researcher who can oversee =\r\nother \ndetails.  The book will have many footnotes and the citations will b=\r\ne in \nplace to allow readers to do their own double checking if they desire=\r\n.\n\nAs we work on this new phase of the SHQ data I will post requests here \n=\r\non the list to encourage contributions from members here.  \n\nThe e-book wil=\r\nl not incorporate details regarding the Shinsengumi in \nfiction, with the e=\r\nxception of the filmography (written by Michael of the \nNinja Dojo) and mor=\r\ne general mentions (such as popular manga/anime \nwhich are already part of =\r\nthe Shinsengumi legacy).  Details regarding \nminor fiction releases (like S=\r\nhinsengumi trading cards or non-exported \nvid games) will be posted on the =\r\nsite and also \nhttp://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com because there is new in=\r\nformation \nevery month (I keep up with the new with the google alert system=\r\n using \nthe keyword &quot;shinsengumi&quot;).\n\nThus, SHQ will provide data in the for=\r\nm of an e-book which can be \ndownloaded, however images (many of which are =\r\nfrom the Kyoto \nMuseum book or other Japanese sites) cannot be part of the =\r\ne-book---\nwe will continue to host those images on the site in such a way y=\r\nou can \nmatch images chapter by chapter.\n\nWe are currently researching copy=\r\nright options---however if the cost is \nsimply too high or the legal matter=\r\ns too complex then we will go ahead \nand risk being plagiarized because we =\r\ndo want to make the info \navailable.  Certain parts  of SHQ is not only der=\r\nived work or &quot;quoted \nfrom such and such a book&quot;, there was also some prett=\r\ny original \nresearch and we still have so many leads we can&#39;t follow up on =\r\nright \nnow.  I will take advantage of this opportunity (during the e-book \n=\r\nadaption) to include recommendations on how to further specific angles \n(on=\r\nly on chapters I will assist in writing).\n\nSo thank you for staying with th=\r\nis list for all these years and please feel \nfree to post your thoughts on =\r\nthe list or you can contact me or any one \nelse by sending emails (just cli=\r\nck on the yahoo profile).\n\n\n"
