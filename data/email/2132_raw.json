Just 2 days ago, I was doing some research involving Arthurian legends and Soseki&#39;s name came up in association with translating themes across culture.  He reset 5 stories into Japanese context in &quot;Kairo-ko: A Dirge,&quot; first published in 1905.  How ironic if he *was* a friend of Saitou&#39;s and a totally unrelated study of mine should still lead back to him.  :-D\n \nphil\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n\nI was trying to clean my desk and went through layers of notes (the \nprocess is almost like an archaeological dig) and found a note \nsaying &quot;Natsume Soseki??? knew Fujita Goro&quot;....this is based on a \nVERY old post from a Japanese messageboard and was confirmed by one \nmember here at the SHQ (confirmed in terms of the name of the writer \nNOT whether it was true or not).\n\nI know Natsume Soseki from &quot;I AM A CAT&quot; I only saw the movie...never \nread the translation.\n\nInfo on Natsume Soseki...notice his dates and where he became a \nprofessor\nhttp://www.fact-index.com/n/na/natsume_soseki.html\nhttp://www.eldritchpress.org/ns/soseki.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_Soseki\nhttp://www.wuacc.edu/reference/bridge24/Soseki.html\n***one of the pages mentions that a major theme of his work is \nindividualism versus group psychology (which is by the way the heart \nof many AIM discussions we have had over several months in regards to \nthe Shinsengumi)***\n\nAll of my &quot;side research&quot; on the Meiji era has started from these \nrandom posts on Japanese messageboards (for example Higuchi Ichiyo, \nher father worked for the TMPD too by the way,  living very close to \nthe Fujita Family, the Yamakawa family and overall Aizu connection \nwhich we have known for quiet some time and on and on)....\n\nNatsume Soseki is always mentioned in connection to Mori Ogai...Mori \nOgai is connected to HIguchi Ichiyo (she had ALOT of guy friends).\n\nI know this is a very OBSCURE connection but I did in fact get this \noff a messageboard and sadly so many of the old sites have crashed or \ntheir boards have been closed down so I would not be able to find the \nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
