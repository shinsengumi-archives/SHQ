Do we know how old &quot;Aa Shinsengumi&quot; is... when \nit was composed... the recording date?  It reminds me of the old \nnightclub type musicals, which I know became popular in the 1920&#39;s \nin Japan.  Fascinating song... I really like it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Read only the mail you want - Yahoo!
