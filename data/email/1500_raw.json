I know he wrote Mibugishiden, but that&#39;s like \nsaying Tom Clancy is a counter-terrorism expert because he wrote \nRainbow Six.  Other than research for his book, is he any more \nknowledgeable than the next guy?\n\nAnyone have a link for the event, especially the San Francisco one?  \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; good and BAD news...the speaker on sept 9 will be Jiro Asada who \nwrote\n&gt; Mibugishiden...now for the bad news...no translator...S. \nCalifornia is\n&gt; home to a huge population of Japanese Americans not to mention \nmajor\n&gt; universities with Japanese language dept.  if you are upset then \nso am\n&gt; I!!! I have PERSONALLY encouraged JAL to hire a translator for Mr.\n&gt; Asada because as a native of CA I know that many anime fansubs are\n&gt; from these universities.  So I was outraged that JAL would send Mr.\n&gt; Asada here without a translator.  The lady on the line said that \nshe\n&gt; will speak to her superiors about getting a translator for Mr. \nAsada\n&gt; \n&gt; For the S. CA (Torrance) lecture you can only pay with personal \ncheck\n&gt; or money order over the phone and tickets will be mailed to you \nASAP...\n&gt; ...furthermore there will be a second lecture again by Jiro Asada \nin\n&gt; San Francisco on Sept 10 call (415) 765-8545 at the Palo Alto Hotel\n&gt; but the focus will be more on the Bakumatsu.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bsher213&quot; &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I just stumbled across this on a SHisnengumi LJ community I just \nfound\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shinsengumi to Sono Jidai&#39; (Shinsengumi and Their Times)\n&gt; &gt; Sept. 9, 2004 - 7:00pm at the Torrance Marriott\n&gt; &gt; contact JAL&#39;s LA branch at (310)607-2330 for info.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know we  have Californians out there---Someone has to go and \nbring\n&gt; &gt; us back information and pictures!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Barb Sheridan\n\n\n"
