Thank you for \ntelling me about this list, and welcome to Saitoh fandom.\n\nSith\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Firuze&quot; &lt;firuzekhanume2002@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi...\n&gt; I suppose it&#39;s time to introduce myself... *fidgets slightly*\n&gt; By now, some of you already know that all time RK favorite character \nis Enishi, and might wonder what I&#39;m doing here. Hell, I even feel \nmyself like some kind of intruder... However, I think it&#39;s not exactly \na mystery that my second favorite character in the series is Saitou, \nand that&#39;s why I tend to give him an important role in my fics. So, \nwell, I find tempting any place where I can find interesting \ninformation  as well as to hear interesting discussions about him, his \npast and the Shinsengumi. So here I&#39;m. \n&gt; Yet, there is a second reason, since I am in love with PMK series. \nThe guilty party here is composed by Barbara Sheridan and Miss Behavin \n*points at both* and their deliciously funny Mibu Times/Dispatch. I \nfound that to understand certain jokes I had to know about PMK, so I \ndecided to download several episodes. Since then, I&#39;m lost in \naddiction. *wails*\n&gt; A wave of sadness enveloped me over the past weekend, after I saw \nepisode 23, since it announced that next one would be the ending. Is \nthere any news on any kind of continuation? Is there any place where I \ncan read/download scanlations/translations of the manga? I live where \nthe world ends, in deep South America, so you can imagine, no dreams \nof getting any copy of the manga at all for a very long time. Any info \nwill be deeply appreciated.\n&gt; Firuze\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
