I go by MissBehavin (MissB) on \nthe list. \n\n2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi? The first time I saw the \nShinsengumi was in the RK OVA. \n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why? Anyone here can tell you I \nam completely obsessed with the Shinsengumi Fukuchou (Vice-Commander) \nHijikata Toshizo. His strength of character, his conviction to follow his own \nbeliefs, and his loyalty to his cause are inspiring to me. Over time it has become \nclear to me that his character has been much maligned by history and the media. \nHe was not the evil &quot;demon&quot; that some would have people believe.  Rather he \nwas a man dedicated to both his friends and his followers, who willingly rode \ninto danger in a futuile attempt to save his &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;.\n\nThe accounts we have of him actually suggest that he was very well liked and \nrespected by the Shinsengumi members. Many followed him all the way to \nHakodate, despite their cause being hopeless. An account one of them left behind said \nthey &quot;cried like babes who had lost their mother&quot; when they were later told \nof his death.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing thing about him was the fact that he was born a \nmere farmer. By law he should have never held a sword or any position of \nauthority. However it was his dream to become a samurai and through a strange mix of \nluck and sheer determination he and Kondo both rose to unheard of heights of \npower for men of their class. By the end Hijikata was leading the army in Ezo. \nThose who fought with him said he &quot;died more samurai than the real samurai&quot;.\n\nI believe Katsu Kaishu summed his life up best when he said Hijikata was &quot;one \nman of great caliber.&quot;\n\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen? I have seen the RK OVA and \nanime and I am reading the Viz version of the manga now. I have seen PMK and most \nof NHK. Saw Gohatto, Sword of Doom, and Shinsengumi Keppuroku. I would love to \nget my hands on one of those Shinsengumi video games, but that is probably a \npipe dream...\n\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do you think \ncaptured your favorite members(s) the best and why?\nSo far, I think that Shinsengumi Keppuroku did the best job of presenting \nHijikata Toshizo&#39;s character. He did not come across to me as unnecessarily cruel \nor &quot;grumpy&quot;, nor does he seem blinded to all else by his convictions. Case in \npoint, he tells Okita after Yamanami&#39;s &quot;escape&quot; that &quot;if you -don&#39;t see him-, \ncome back and report.&quot; Okita presses him by saying &quot;you mean let him escape?&quot; \nHijikata replies &quot;I mean if you -don&#39;t see him- come back and report.&quot;  While \nit is made perfectly clear that he must and will uphold the beliefs of the \nShinsengumi even against a friend, it is equally clear that he does in fact care \nabout his friend and has no intention of hounding him mercilessly to his \ndeath.\n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any particular \nShinsengumi members or events?\nI would love to find out exactly what happened at Utsunomiya. I know that \nHijikata was injured there, but not much else. I would also love to find out more \nabout the famous Sanjo bridge incident. Any information about Hijikata&#39;s \nvarious lovers would be nice too. The only one I have heard anything about is the \nwoman he was supposed to marry back in Tama...\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
