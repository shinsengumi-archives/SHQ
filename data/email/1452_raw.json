Let&#39;s not overexert\n&gt; ourselves. Maybe we can have an RPG as part of the Fiction group \nthat\n&gt; we&#39;re forming.\n&gt; \n\nPer Phil who strongly encouraged me to read prior post... I saw this \none... Since we&#39;re doing an RPG... Well back in the day when the \nshole SHQ was still in it&#39;s infancy stage Masayoshi and Phil \ndiscussed this (see above)... Kind of funny when I think about it...\n\n~wounds\n&gt; --Yoshi (Kondou? Shimazu? Who knows?)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
