Just be warned, I am *insanely* curious, so I&#39;m likel=\r\ny to have a ton more.\n\n\n&gt;He was actually the youngest of nine children, alt=\r\nhough maybe only six \n&gt;survived to adulthood...\n \nHmmm... an industrious lo=\r\nt, those Hijikatas &lt;grins&gt;\n \n&gt;Onobu&#39;s original name was Otoku-- and she ind=\r\need \n&gt;married Satou Hikogorou, who was Toshizou&#39;s first cousin.\n \nIs it kno=\r\nwn if those two had any children of their own? I haven&#39;t been able to find =\r\nany facts on that, though the fact they took Toshizou in and Hikogorou got =\r\nhim involved in his family&#39;s business might suggest they didn&#39;t have a son,=\r\n at least...\n\n&gt;- According to one site, both his parents died when he was v=\r\nery young (IIRC \n&gt;it even said that his father was already dead by the time=\r\n Toshizou was \n&gt;born). The older of his sisters also died early.\n\n&gt;IIRC?\n\nI=\r\nf I Recall Correctly. I often don&#39;t.\n \n&gt; Following that, he was brought up =\r\nby his formerly \n&gt;separated (comment: might be =93estranged=94, but I don=\r\n=92t know=85) elder &gt;brother Kiroku and his wife.\n\nHmmm... as in Kiroku had=\r\n been out of touch with the rest of the family? He still lived in the Tama =\r\narea, right?\n\n&gt; Watsuki Nobuhiro-sensei \n&gt;elaborates on this, using it as (=\r\nor so I&#39;ve heard) the historical basis for \n&gt;why Shinomori Aoshi looks so m=\r\nuch like Hijikata.\n\n...&#39;cause he&#39;s his son or something? Could you give me =\r\na few quotes?\n\n&gt;If there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like to know, please don&#39;t h=\r\nesitate to ask.\n\n...and with this sentence, M-sama seals his or her own doo=\r\nm. &lt;smiles&gt;\n \nThanks for the help! \n \nLinda/Enma-O\n\nH=F6strusk och gr=E5 mo=\r\nln - k=F6p en resa till solen p=E5 Yahoo!
