Bring it on!  Give me more dirt to accuse Saigou of murdering Sagara.\n\n&gt;&gt;From what I read today its sounds like these three were as back stabbing as a bunch of high school girls all after the same football player boyfriend.&lt;&lt;\n\nThis *so* reminds me of Sanosuke&#39;s reactions to Ookubo in anime RK... his turned away face in disgust as Megumi explains to Yahiko who the Three Great Imperialists were... his refusal to be as polite to him as Kawaji thinks he should be... &quot;dirty governments like this one DESERVE to be overthrown... we&#39;d all be better off for it!&quot;... his telling Kenshin not to listen to Ookubo, that he&#39;s as dirty as the rest, just using Kenshin...  Kenshin&#39;s reply:  &quot;Sano really hates the Meiji government from the bottom of his heart, that he does.&quot;  &quot;Got a problem with that?!&quot;\n\nGood boy, Sano!  :-D\n\n\n&gt;&gt;A) Saigo waited till katsura & Okubo were both out of the country to forward his own agenda of getting the Emperor to go along with invading Korea to solve the &quot;samurai problem&quot;  i.e. send them to invade Korea and the ones that weren&#39;t killed (the idea was to thin their ranks) could/should stay in Korea in various positions thus sparing the Japanese government the necessity to see that they had gainful employment etc.&lt;&lt;\n\nI love how Ookuba returned just in time to squash that idea.  From general readings I&#39;ve done on Saigou (sorry... no citations... it was a period of exploration & I didn&#39;t keep track), Saigou also made an &quot;offer&quot; to go to Korea himself, knowing he was more than likely to be killed and that would give Japan a reason to launch an attack on Korea.  Wasn&#39;t that noble of him????  (yeah, right...)\n\n\nphil (growling)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
