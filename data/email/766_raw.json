Everytime they advanced it was with that type of step. And from what I understand, yes it&#39;s something not used in most koryu. Something I notice in my ryu and others.\n\n***only the more advance students seem to understand the value of\n&quot;follow through&quot; when they aren&#39;t practicing on an opponent because\ne.g. how at the end of the motion your head tends to tilt slightly\nforward and the teacher tries to keep correcting this error and there\nis the whole issue of shinai&#39;s tip almost hitting the floor.  There\nare definate advantages and disadvantages to practicing on an opponent\nand on your own...the mirror is pretty cool to work with ^_^ so you\ncan check to see if the sword tip is pointed at your throat and your\nfeet are straight (without having to looke &quot;down&quot;---you have no idea\nhow funny when some of us are looking down at are feet and saying &quot;are\nmy feet okay I don&#39;t want sore ankles&quot;)\n\n\nBtw, when you mean follow through do you mean cut big? Like cutting all the way like you&#39;re cutting tameshigiri? The mirror thing is pretty cool though, something I use often to check the angle of my sword. One of the reasons why the tip of the sword is pointed at the opponent&#39;s face/throat is that they cannot judge the length of your sword which gives you an advantage. This concept might help next time you work with the mirror to help where you place your sword. (if you can&#39;t see the length of your sword, then you&#39;re pretty much right on) Course this will vary depending on where your immaginary opponent is supposed to be distance wise. The angle will change depending on this distance.   \n\n\n***all newbies such as myself are okay when we are practicing on our\nown and the instructor says our posture is good...but when we practice\non each other we end up messing up on footwork and our left wrists\nstart rotating under the shinai hilt...which got me thinking that its\ndue to our lack of stamina and the length of practice in hot/humid\nconditions as well as what I call the &quot;sloth&quot; factor--we get\nlazy...now for samurai or any medieval warrior back in the day on the\nbattlefield how in the world did they take on multiple opponents and\nconserve strength and maintain efficiency in movement is simply beyond\ncomprehension.\n\nI wonder the same....I know battles waged on for hours on end. I can only image the amount of stamina warriors of the past had.  \n\n \n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 2004 12:48 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Some kendo stuff\n\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Okita Souji&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Ahh that makes sense...the shinai bouncing off due to the say it&#39;s\n  designed. I guess thats another difference in JSA, how in kendo you\n  hit, and in iai you cut. It feels really weird to go through kata\n  where I continuously cut through/into your opponent and then go to\n  partner prractice where I have to stop short of hitting my partner.\n  Course to hit or cut in reality it doesn&#39;t matter since as long as you\n  reach your opponent with the weapon, thats all that matters in the\n  end. Do you by chance have a training manequin(sp)? When I was at my\n  former iai school that also happened to teach kendo, they used to\n  bring out a sort of training dummy (vs each other) for cutting\n  exercises for the new students.   \n\n  ***reaching your opponent in an efficient and timely manner is really\n  REALLY hard because the proper kendo walking technique is always\n  enforced...your right foot pushing off with left foot in mind and your\n  trying to move fast is hard...but kendo &quot;walking&quot; best on smooth\n  wooden floors is not necessarily used in old kenjutsu lineages I\n  understand.\n\n  ***only the more advance students seem to understand the value of\n  &quot;follow through&quot; when they aren&#39;t practicing on an opponent because\n  e.g. how at the end of the motion your head tends to tilt slightly\n  forward and the teacher tries to keep correcting this error and there\n  is the whole issue of shinai&#39;s tip almost hitting the floor.
