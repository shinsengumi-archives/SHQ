I was \n&gt; wondering if Miki worked in a more rural area...if so he would&#39;ve \n&gt; managed chuzaisho (rural versions of the &quot;koban&quot;* police boxes) and \n&gt; had to deal with the army which was more dominant in rural areas.  \n&gt; Police in rural areas are even more *closer* to citizens too.\n&gt; \n&gt; *during the Meiji Era another term was used for koban (which meant \n&gt; dormitory) but the term &quot;koban&quot; stuck to this very day\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;  Take Yahoo!
