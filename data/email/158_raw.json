He looks like most of the portraits of\n&gt; Amakusa that I&#39;ve seen. Plus, I&#39;ve seen several crosses in scenes \nwith\n&gt; Maro or that spellcaster. And , in Episode 17 of PMK, Maro is burned\n&gt; alive-- much like the &quot;mino odori&quot; (&quot;raincoat dancing&quot;) torture with\n&gt; which many of the Japanese Christians died-- forced to wear straw\n&gt; coats and then set alight...seeing that was almost too creepy for \nme...\n&gt; \n&gt; --M.\n\n\n"
