Many of us here who have written\n&gt; articles for th=\r\ne website, also use historical references extensively,\n&gt; please see this ar=\r\nticle as an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; The Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis and Okita S=\r\noujiro\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm\n&gt; see how if a quote o=\r\nr detail is taken from a book...the exact\n&gt; book/author and page number are=\r\n noted OR the author is mentioned in\n&gt; the text.\n\nPlease don&#39;t misunderstan=\r\nd me,  I was only commenting on the Okita article (http://\nwww.shinsengumih=\r\nq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm) I understand that you also use historical \nreferenc=\r\nes, but please double check whether your own information is correct when th=\r\nere&#39;s \nconflicting info. (I believe some mistakes to be human errors or/and=\r\n typos.) \n\nAlso, make sure your &quot;historical references&quot; are actually in the=\r\n history section and are not \ncategorized as (historical) fiction. For exam=\r\nple, many regard the trilogy by Shimozawa Kan \nas &quot;historical references&quot; b=\r\nut in fact, his Shinsengumi books are categorized as (historical) \nfiction.=\r\n \n \n&gt; and about Okita&#39;s birthday\n&gt; have you seen his updated page?\n&gt; http:/=\r\n/www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n\nI was NOT talking about his birthd=\r\nay earlier today.  \n\nquote from www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n&quot;Bor=\r\nn in Tenpou 13 (1844) (some say Tenpou15)&quot;\n\nI was saying that Tenpou 13 =3D=\r\n 1842 (not 1844.) \n\n&gt; but imagine this:\n&gt; (visitor to Okita page) &quot;wow lots=\r\n of cool info from nlf7---but which\n&gt; book did that detail come from?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n we cannot tell people to just &quot;believe us&quot; just because we can post a\n&gt; we=\r\nbsite on the internet---we want to give people the tools to learn on\n&gt; thei=\r\nr own\n\nI&#39;ve already given you a list of books.  However, I haven&#39;t used quo=\r\ntes in regard of the \nShinsengumi. \n\nAgain, almost all the books/chapters i=\r\nn regard of Okita contain this (rather basic) \ninformation. For example, \n\n=\r\nMori, Makiko.  Okita Soji Feature (Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1999)\nOji,=\r\n Kazuko. Walking with Okita Soji  (Tokyo: Shin Chosha, 2003)\n\n&gt;  I hope you=\r\n can head up the Okita Team if you have the time and\n&gt; get in touch with ot=\r\nher mailing list members and put your fabulous\n&gt; minds together.  \n\nI&#39;d rat=\r\nher &quot;chat&quot; on the Okita Soji discussion page at Wikipedia.  I understand th=\r\nat some \nfans of the Shinsengumi/Okita don&#39;t have access to SHQ nor want to=\r\n join it. (To tell you \nthe truth, it took me a while before I decided to j=\r\noin this group.)\n\n\nIn addition, I suggest that we merge the Okita Soji arti=\r\ncle at Wikipedia and the Okita article \nat SHQ.\n\nI&#39;ve been keeping an eye o=\r\nn all the Shinsengumi articles at Wikipedia since March.  It&#39;s true \nthat a=\r\nnyone could edit or delete information at Wikipedia and I had a problem wit=\r\nh it when \nI started editting the articles (as all could see on my talk pag=\r\ne.)\n\nNevertheless, the Wikipedia&#39;s linked to library networks so improving =\r\narticles at  at \nWikipedia is certainly more than worthwhile. (At least, th=\r\nat&#39;s what I tell myself when I feel \nlike giving up.) \n\nAs anyone could see=\r\n from the history of every article on the Shinsengumi, I&#39;ve done many \ncorr=\r\nections and whenever there was any conflicting info, my version would alway=\r\ns end up \non top (since my edits could be backed up with research and histo=\r\nrical references.)\n\nThat being said, Ito and Todo don&#39;t have their own arti=\r\ncles yet and the new Inoue and \nTakeda articles need  a lot of help.  (I&#39;ve=\r\n done most research on the members of the \nShieikan so I could only write m=\r\nore about Inoue when I get the chance.)\n\n~Seven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
