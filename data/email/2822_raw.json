Many of us here who have written\narticles for=\r\n the website, also use historical references extensively,\nplease see this a=\r\nrticle as an example:\n\nThe Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis and Okita Souj=\r\niro\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TBandOkita.htm\nsee how if a quote or detai=\r\nl is taken from a book...the exact\nbook/author and page number are noted OR=\r\n the author is mentioned in\nthe text.\n\nand about Okita&#39;s birthday\nhave you =\r\nseen his updated page?\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n\nI did=\r\n note some of your major contributions (^___^) as I said in my\nprevious pos=\r\nt I want to revise the page ASAP but I will need to have a\nfinal format to =\r\nwork with  so I would need your help because I am not\nknowledgeable on Okit=\r\na.\n\nas for the conversion of dates we have a link to a good converter on\nth=\r\ne timeline page:\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.=\r\nhtm\n\nbut imagine this:\n(visitor to Okita page) &quot;wow lots of cool info from =\r\nnlf7---but which\nbook did that detail come from?&quot;\n\nwe cannot tell people to=\r\n just &quot;believe us&quot; just because we can post a\nwebsite on the internet---we =\r\nwant to give people the tools to learn on\ntheir own\n\nthere are hundreds of =\r\nShinsengumi books----I made a list of Okita\nbooks here:  http://www.shinsen=\r\ngumihq.com/bibliography2.htm\nI will add your list ASAP\n\nFor example next to=\r\n your information on Okita&#39;s alternate birth year\nwe would add (author last=\r\n name and page number from the book).\n\nI don&#39;t want you to misunderstand (e=\r\narly on 2 years ago we made minor\nerrors so we quickly changed our strategy=\r\n, so now we want to be\ncareful to prevent SHQ.com from becoming a source of=\r\n innaccurate\ninformation)--- with certain details especially coming from En=\r\nglish\ntexts, we know the information is *solid however we still need to cit=\r\ne\nthem so people can find the book and read details themselves \n\n*if we did=\r\n not cite our sources, we would be plaigiarizing---those\nauthors are very w=\r\nell respected academics I dont&#39; think they would be\nhappy to see their word=\r\ns posted without proper credit\n\n-WE- believe you 100%!!! But we want any vi=\r\nsitor (from all over the\nworld) to also understand where the information ca=\r\nme from so they can\n*double *check or they can buy the right books\n\nNlf7, I=\r\n hope you can head up the Okita Team if you have the time and\nget in touch =\r\nwith other mailing list members and put your fabulous\nminds together.  If w=\r\ne split up the work we can accomplish many things\ntogether .TEAM.WORK.\n\nso =\r\nnlf7, Bunneh, Kaneyoshi are anyone, if you guys are going to meet\nsomewhere=\r\n, sometime or use a blog/livejournal just post here to\norganize your effort=\r\ns\n\nAgain, Shinsengumihq.com doesn&#39;t &quot;own&quot; the Shinsengumi or history, we\nju=\r\nst study it---any contribution to the site such as fanart, fanfic\nand artic=\r\nles remain the property of the individual we just make it\navailable to the =\r\npublic.

When the shogunate forces (i=\r\nncluding the\nShinsengumi and the \n&gt; Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku r=\r\negion, Okita remained in Edo\nalone.\n&gt; \n&gt; #7 Keiou 4 did NOT become Meiji 1 =\r\nuntil Oct 23 1868 (lunar calender\nSep 8), 3 months \n&gt; AFTER Okita&#39;s death. =\r\nHis date of death should NEVER be written as\n&quot;Meiji 1, May 30 (Lunar \n&gt; cal=\r\nendar).&quot; It&#39;s either Jul 19, 1868 or  Keiou 4, May 30 (lunar\ncalendar).\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ok so we are all in agreement that there is some conflicti=\r\nng info on\n&gt; &gt; Okita but there are issues regarding citation\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; as of=\r\n today this page is now a mess  ::ROFL!!::\n&gt; &gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com=\r\n/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t keep up with you intense researchers (I =\r\nwork on the timeline,\n&gt; &gt; Saitou Hajime post 1868 because there is more inf=\r\no in English on the\n&gt; &gt; Meiji Era, Takagi/Fujita Tokio and some Aizu folks)=\r\n so I have a ~weak~\n&gt; &gt; grasp of Okita (but I wrote that article on TB, tha=\r\nt counts for\n&gt; &gt; something right?)...now this is an idea...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; why do=\r\nn&#39;t all the Okita specialists form a team and revise Okita&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; info page =\r\n(^___^) get in a chatroom, or work on someone&#39;s blog and do\n&gt; &gt; some revisi=\r\nng etc...but really you don&#39;t have to be a specialist you\n&gt; &gt; can be a fan =\r\nwho joins the group and asks questions, this will help\n&gt; &gt; the main writers=\r\n understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of the hundreds of thousands of\n&gt; &gt; Okita fans out th=\r\nere\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; again it is totally important to cite details this would be ve=\r\nry\n&gt; &gt; helpful to visitors of the site\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; also you may right some min=\r\ni articles on Okita as well and I can\n&gt; &gt; create a sub-menu\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; for ex=\r\nample I split the Saitou Hajime page into sections (by the way\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m in t=\r\nhe process of converting my word document essay into html to\n&gt; &gt; enhance th=\r\ne info on the page) you can take a peak here:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.=\r\ncom/saitouhajime.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and when you are all done, just email the tex=\r\nt, your names (real or\n&gt; &gt; user names) to shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; a similar approach was adopted with the gigantic still in progress\n&gt; &gt; ti=\r\nmeline where several people over a couple of months emailed\n&gt; &gt; updates/ent=\r\nries\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; so promise me that you will all think about it!  It is really=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; impossible for one person to study ALL the Shinsengumi members or all\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; facets of the history/culture\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; specialize. divide and conquer!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
