Even the way his arms are folded in the outdoor shot.\n&gt;&gt;It&#39;s Saitou with a wig...which kind of worries me and adds the\npossibility of Saitou with Kamatari tendencies. 0_0 &lt;&lt;\n \nCan&#39;t help thinking of Yamazaki in PMK... :-D  Personally, I just can&#39;t see RK Saitou being believable as a woman.  He&#39;s gorgeous as a man, but he&#39;d make one big, ugly woman (heh... like the Big Bad Wolf trying to pass as a granny?).  Still, there is that academy award winning act he pulled off with Itou&#39;s group.\n\nphil (who&#39;s just gone through the fight between Saitou & Sano outside Katsu&#39;s house frame by frame and is amazed yet again at how many faces Saitou shows!)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
