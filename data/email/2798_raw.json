(Most of the sources=\r\n are in Japanese. I don&#39;t read \nJapanese that well so I&#39;ve been reading the=\r\nm rather slowly since 2003.) Anyways, almost all \nof the ones on Okita cont=\r\nain the information I&#39;ve given you.\n\nI&#39;ve been editing all the Shinsengumi =\r\narticles from Wikipedia.  (My user name is &quot;nlf7&quot; and \nmy nickname is &quot;Seve=\r\nn&quot;.) You could just mention Wikipedia as the source or/and the \ncontributor=\r\n. ( I&#39;ve written about 2/3 of the current Okita article and have also left =\r\nseveral \nnotes on the Okita discussion page. )\n\nYes,  I&#39;ve also bought &quot;Shi=\r\nnsengumi: The Shogun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps&quot; by Hillsborough, \nbut I haven&#39;t =\r\nhad the chance to finish reading it.\n\n\n------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\nOkita Soji article\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okita_S?ji\n=\r\n\nOkita Soji discussion page\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Okita_S?ji\n\nm=\r\ny talk page \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nlf7\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hello &quot;nlf7&quot;,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I enjoyed all of your posts very much and we appreciate the time you\n&gt; t=\r\nook in giving us info on the mysterious Okita.  I would like to add\n&gt; your =\r\ninformation to the Okita webpage (with your permission)\n&gt; http://www.shinse=\r\nngumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; If you notice on that page (and other pag=\r\nes) we name the sites we used\n&gt; as sources and we mention the name of the c=\r\nontributor.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you recall from which book you got all this informati=\r\non?  If you\n&gt; can give atleast the author and title that would be great so =\r\nwe can\n&gt; add that to the page as well---and I try to add a link to the book=\r\n so\n&gt; people can buy it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pursuit of history is filled with contrad=\r\nictory facts: that&#39;s the\n&gt; name of the game.  \n&gt; To deal with discrepencies=\r\n, it is necessary to put everything side by\n&gt; side and so we&#39;ve endeavoured=\r\n to do that.  I think all of us would\n&gt; appreciate your advice and knowledg=\r\ne in improving the website and\n&gt; adding more to this mailing list.\n&gt; \n&gt; You=\r\n may remember from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kondo_Isami\n&gt; where I =\r\ncite Romulus Hillsborough.  Generally, I don&#39;t like to use his\n&gt; work but i=\r\nt is unavoidable because he is unfortunately the *first*\n&gt; westerner to pub=\r\nlish a text which focuses on the Shinsengumi.  You\n&gt; will notice I mentione=\r\nd the book and page number (the original source\n&gt; for Tani Tateki&#39;s words a=\r\nre Teihon: Shinsengumi Shiroku).  \n&gt; \n&gt; So if there is an incorrect detail =\r\nanywhere it is necessary to just\n&gt; say &quot;this book says different&quot; and so fo=\r\nrth so all of us fans will\n&gt; understand where the information came from.  N=\r\none of were actually\n&gt; there so we have to rely on texts. \n&gt; \n&gt; Generally, =\r\nin the world of academic publishing it is also very\n&gt; necessary to cite, de=\r\ntail by detail where information was originally\n&gt; found---although http://w=\r\nww.shinsengumihq.com is only a fansite we\n&gt; still want it to follow that st=\r\nandard whenever possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have anymore correction please post h=\r\nere because many people\n&gt; are grateful for your help. Most of us aren&#39;t flu=\r\nent in Japanese\n&gt; (^__^) you will note how on pages like the \n&gt; \n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; we had to use th=\r\ne best English language books we can find\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; We have a second entry for our Multimedia Contest:\n&gt; http://www.shinse=\r\nngumihq.com/ikedaya.swf submitted by (V.P.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Shinsengumi site (Japanese=\r\n)\n&gt; http://www.tachikawaonline.jp/shinsengumi/013/013.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Fujita Goro =\r\nfanart (part of a community of &quot;Aizu fans&quot;)\n&gt; http://mgalsips.web.fc2.com/1=\r\n-17.html\n&gt; \n&gt; really great cosplay site\n&gt; http://animexx.4players.de/fotos/=\r\ncosplay-thema.php?thema=3D1634&alle=3D\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
