Kondou was \nrunning \n&gt; operations for the Koyochinbutai (Shinsengumi-like unit serving \nthe Shogun) \n&gt; at the time, and that&#39;s when he was captured. Hijikata, under the \npseudonym \n&gt; Naito Hayato, tried to sneak a rescue attempt, but ultimately \nfailed. Kondou \n&gt; was beheaded, his head was displayed in Kyoto (I think), and then \nthe rest \n&gt; of the Shinsengumi retreated with Hijikata and Saitou to Aizu.\n&gt; \n&gt; Momoiro-usagi-san, is this correct?\n\n\nShinsengumi in which Toba-Fushimi war was lost has returned to Edo \nby ship on January 15, 1868. \n(This date is the thing of an old Japanese calender.) \nThey stayed at a hotel called Kamaya on the first day. \nOkita and Kondou were hospitalized in the hospital of Tokugawa. \n(Okita has tuberculosis. Kondou was shot by the member of the Itou \ngroup and his shoulder was injured.)\nAnd they stayed with a samurai called Akizuki Ukyounosuke. \nFrom February 15 to the 25th, they guarded Tokugawa Yoshinobu who \nhas behaved himself (kinsin). \n\nThe Tokugawa government ordered them to protect Koufu castle. \nThis was an artifice for driving out inconvenient Shinsengumi from \nEdo to reconciliation of new government army and Tokugawa. \n(Or there is an opinion that there was a secret contract between \nShinsengumi and Tokugawa government official.) \n\nThey organized the army for going to Koufu. \nThis is Kouyouchinbutai. \nKondou changed the name into Okubo Yamato. \nHijikata changed to Naitou Hayato. \nThey left Edo on March 1. \nThey marched through the Koushu Highway (Kousyukaidou) toward Koufu.\nOn the way to Kofu, there was Tama area which is their hometown.\nPeople of their hometown welcomed their army.\nThe party was held in many villages along which they passed. \nTheir pace became late and the schedule was overdue. \nFurthermore, the mountain path which goes to Koufu from Busyu was \nheavy snow. \n\nTo the contrary, the new government army was very quick. \nBefore Kouyouchinbutai arrived there, the new government army went \ninto the Koufu castle.\nThe new government army had more soldiers and arms than they.\nHijikata returned for demanding reinforcements to Edo. \nHowever, the battle started on March 6 before Hijikata returns. \nThe result was the crushing defeat of Kouyouchinbutai. \nThey escaped to Edo. \nWhen they returned to Edo, Nagakura and Harada resisted Kondou and \nwent away. \nFurthermore, many soldiers escaped. \n\nKondou and Hijikata made their army stay at a place called \nGoheishinden (March 13). \nGoheishinden is present Adachi-ku, Tokyo.\nThey hid true character and stayed at Kaneko&#39;s residence which is \nthe influential person of this place. \nKondo read books in this place. \nHijikata did fishing on the river. \n\nEpisode which Miss.B may like ^^;;;\nWhile Hijikata is doing fishing on the river, all the girls of the \nvillage have gathered. \nThey stood on the bank and saw Hijikata. \nThey did not know that the man was Hijikata of Shinsengumi. \nGirls gathered for seeing that the very handsome samurai is doing \nfishing. \n&quot;A nice man&quot; They gossiped. \n\n\nThey moved the army to Nagareyama on April 2. \nHowever, their transfer was known by the new government army which \nwas staying in Kasukabe. \nThey were surrounded by the new government army on April 3. \nKondou reported to the new government army as Tokugawa&#39;s samurai&#39;s \nOkubo Yamato.\n(However, his true character has become clear immediately.)\nThey were disarmed by the new government army and they escaped to \nAizu on April 4. \nHijikata infiltrated into Edo, in order to save Kondou. \nEdo was governed by the new government army and was in the very \ndangerous state for him. \nHijikata visited Katsu Kaishuu and requested rescue of Kondou. \nHijikata made the petition write to Katsu. \nHowever, Hijikata&#39;s efforts were useless. \nKondou was executed in Itabashi on April 25. \n\nHijikata joined Tokugawa&#39;s army on April 10. \nThey gathered in a place called Kokufudai and composed the army \nwhich made Ootori Keisuke the top on April 12. \nThey were divided into three groups and aimed at Aizu. \n\nI&#39;m sorry for the ability not performing detailed explanation. \nIt is difficult for me to explain in English. \n \nIn fact, I do not understand this question. (Maria-san gomennasai)\nSeeing the answer of M-san, I understood somehow.\n\nOkage de totemo wakariyasukatta desu. M-san.\n\n\nmomoiro-usagi \n\n\n\n\n\n"
