Wouldn&#39;t it be \nfunny if these two senior citizens went to the movies together and \nwatched let&#39;s say the Three Musketeers...I&#39;m sure they would take \ngreat interest in the fencing.  Momoiro-usagi&#39;s post brought a smile \nto my face as I imagine his children and grand-children thinking &quot;uh \noh if Grandpa Nagakura get&#39;s bored he&#39;s going to start talking about \nhis days in the Shinsengumi for the 1,043rd time let&#39;s send him to \nthe movies&quot; LOL!\n\n\n"
