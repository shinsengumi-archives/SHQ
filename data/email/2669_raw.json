The reply came from the person who uploaded the torrent (a longtime member), stating that fansubbers don&#39;t tackle taiga dramas because of the difficulty of the language used for those and they rely on the subtitling that is provided by professionals.  Unfortunately, in this case, neither of the two main sources that have previously provided subtitles for taiga have provided them for this.  **shrug**  Like I said, we&#39;ll just have to see if someone does considering the drama itself was so popular.\n   \n  And, yes, d-addicts is an incredible source of all kinds of drama from East Asia and there are a lot of wonderful fans who take the time to provide soft subs (srt files, which I prefer actually).  We&#39;re gearing up for a new season in Japan in the next week and the likes of Odagiri Jo (Saitou), Tanihara Shosuke (Itou), Yashima Norito (Takeda), and Sato Koichi (Serizawa and Saitou in &quot;Mibu gishi den&quot;) have parts in new dramas from January to March.  I didn&#39;t look closely enough, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Eguchi Yosuke (Sakamoto) also has a new one... he shows up regularly.  If you had a favorite in &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;, you&#39;re bound to find plenty more of the actor.  Jdorama is a lot of fun!  (And &quot;Densha otoko&quot; (Train Man) is one of my very favorites... it speaks to us computer-dependent otaku.  ^_^)\n   \n  phil\n\nonigiribeanie &lt;jungleguuchan@...&gt; wrote:\n  Did anyone post a request for help with translating at d-addicts?  A\nnumber of other shows they&#39;ve put up without subtitles, fans from\nthere have made srt files available (which are not hardcoded subs, but\nbetter than nothing).  These usually appear within a few weeks of the\noriginal file going up there. (I watched Densha Otoko and a number of\nrandom J-dramas from there that way.) \n\nAnyways == thanks for the heads up.  It&#39;ll be nice to watch some\nShinsengumi(!) again.  \n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Dvd anime   Flash animation web design   Flash animation web site design     Anime movie   Flash animation design   Flash animation software \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
