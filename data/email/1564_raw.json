I think the problem \nwas I typed something wrong. The correct url is:\nhttp://www.directcon.net/pharmer/Wakamatsu/Wakamatsu.html\n\nThe name of the site is Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony at Gold \nHill, California. If the url still won&#39;t work, then type the name \ninto Yahoo. It will definitely come up that way.\n\nFor those of you who are a bit confused, during the Boshin War a man \nnamed J. H. Schnell smuggled refugees out of Aizu and brought them to \nAmerica. One was a young woman named Okei. They founded the Wakamatsu \nTea and Silk Company at Gold Hill in 1869 (near modern day \nPlacerville, CA), but it folded after only two years. Everyone went \ntheir seperate ways. Okei remained in the area as an employee of a \nlocal family. She seems to have died very young of tuberculosis and \nher grave is on a hill near where the community once existed.\n\nWhile searching for the site again I came across two more pdf files:\nco.el-dorado.ca.us/bos/pdf/ang8-27.pdf\nco.el-dorado.ca.us/bos/pdf/cang08-27-2002.pdf\n\n(The first url might end /cang8-27.pdf. I have no idea if these two \nfiles are the same or not. Still need to download that reader...)\n\nBut wait! I found something even more exciting! A man named Jonathan \nPearce has actually writen a book about the colony! It&#39;s called The \nFar Side of the Moon. ISBN# 1-59411-011-5  (Note I saw more than one \nISBN# for this book. The one I listed appears to be more recent.)\n\nHe explains the reason he wrote the book at the below url:\nhttp://www.balona.com/moonwhy.html\nThere is mention of another book called Samurai at Gold Hill by \nYoshiko Uchida. I guess that means this book should be available here \nin the U.S.? Worth checking into anyway.\n\nThere is also a brief letter to the author from a decendant of the \nfamily that Okei worked for:\nhttp://www.balona.com/moontestimonial.html\n\nI MUST find The Far Side of the Moon!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
