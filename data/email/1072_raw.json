My site also has larger\nversions of Nakajima N, Kondou, Hijikata and Saitou&#39;s pic I scanned\nfrom my museum catalog.  So unfortunatly, I can&#39;t give this to SHQ as\nthe Japanese owner would probably kill me if he/she found this site.\n\nand I spent so much time on it (sob)\n\nOT: ways to TORTURE kendo students\nhave them hop---yes &quot;hop&quot; with their shinai (downward slash)\ndoesn&#39;t it sound easy and *cute*?  We all look like bunny rabbits with\nbamboo swords...now do this across the length of an indoor basketball\ncourt (full court not half court)...I promise you that after going\nback and forth oh 4 times (you are doing it WRONG if you back is not\nperfectly straight during the hop)...you won&#39;t look like a bunny\nrabbit anymore...just a gasping exhausted frog hugging a bamboo sword\n(forget swinging it just hopping will kill you)...now our instructor\nsays that in no time we will develop a fluid motion...sure\nwhatever...it&#39;s cruel and inhumane!!!! my knees feel like jello\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"
