Unlike NHK and Mibugishiden, he was NOT eternally smiling in this \nrole.\n\nKikukawa Rei (Ikumatsu in NHK Shinsengumi) was also great as Izumo no Okuni.\n\nTabata Tomoko (Kondo Tsune in NHK Shinsengumi) was SO incredibly cute and \nadorable in the film &quot;Daiteiden no Yoru Ni&quot; (Before the Lights Come On).\n\nMy favorite depictions of Kondo (and the ones that I feel are most \nrealistic) are Shinsengumi Keppuroku and &quot;Byakkotai.&quot; I can&#39;t remember the \nname of the actor in Byakkotai, but I&#39;m looking for him in other depictions. \nAs for the one in Shinsengumi Keppuroku, that was none other than the \ntalented Watari Tetsuya. In last year&#39;s Yoshitsune taiga, he was Taira no \nKiyomori...and I gotta say, both as Isami and as Kiyomori, for Watari \nTetsuya the voice makes the role!\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
