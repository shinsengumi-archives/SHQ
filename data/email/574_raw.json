It&#39;s Isami and \nTsune&#39;s baby daughter, Tama, who was just born few months ago. Isami \nleans over to Tama and gently press his cheek against the baby&#39;s cheek \nfor a few secs. Then, he gets up, smiling, &quot;Father is going now...&quot;.\nTsune sees Isami off outside. Isami is going to Kobusho with Toudou \nHeisuke, today is his first day to teach kendo at Kobusho.\n\nTsune serves breakfast for Okita, Yamanami, Nagakura and Harada. Okita \nis wondering where Hijikata is, Tsune said he has left in the early \nmorning. &quot;Hee....lately, he always goes out frequently, ne...&quot; Okita \nsaid. Harada believes it must because of a woman...\nOn the bridge, Hijikata sees Okoto is happily throwing little rocks to \nthe river. She notice Hijikata&#39;s there, then wave to him excitedly. \nHijikata just smile, then walk forward.....\n\nTsune ask for Mitsu and Okita Rintarou(Mitsu&#39;s husband)&#39;s help to take \ncare of Tama, while she&#39;s going out to visit her parents in law(Shusuke \nand Fude)&#39;s house.\n\nAt Kobusho, suddenly Isami is told that he is no longer a Kobusho&#39;s \nteacher, and it was Matsudaira Chikaranosuke&#39;s words. Isami is shocked \nand ask them to confirm to Chikaranosuke once again, coz its very clear \nthat he was appointed to teach at Kobusho several months ago.... \nHowever, the result is still a &#39;no&#39;......\nInside, Chikaranosuke is talking to Sasaki Tadasaburo. He just got the \ninformation that Isami Kondou was born in Tama, a farmer&#39;s birth son. In \nan underestimating tone, &quot;We can&#39;t let him stay here to teach...its \ngoing to be a farmer kenjutsu dojo, what a joke!&quot;.\n\nMitsu is trying to stop Tama from crying, she tried everything to stop \nher cry, but none worked. She ask Yamanami to carry Tama for awhile, but \nhe refused, he said he&#39;s not good with babies. Harada offered Mitsu to \nlet him carry Tama, but Mitsu think impossible for him to stop Tama from \ncrying. Then, Harada showed his scar on his belly to Tama....then, Tama \namazingly stop crying and looking at the scar ^_^ (note: Tama is such a \ncute baby!!^o^)\n\nMitsu told Rintarou to join Shieikan pupils to train under Okita&#39;s lead. \nOkita start the training and teach them Tennen Rishin Ryuu&#39;s stance \nposition. Stick is straight to the front, with their body leans to the \nleft a bit, right foot and left foot forming a 90 degrees angle to the \nleft. However, Rintarou takes the stick along to the left. Okita tells \nhim, that its wrong, he should positioned his stick still straightly to \nthe front. Rintarou keeps doing the same mistake... Mitsu then calls \nOkita to come over for a moment....\nMitsu tells Okita to carry Tama, and she stops crying, reaching on \nOkita&#39;s face. &quot;Why are you so good at that?&quot; Mitsu asked him, referring \nto Okita&#39;s nature with little kids, including babies.\n\nNagakura takes over the training hall. He tells the pupils the right \nstance position, and he tells them according to Shindo Munen Ryuu...his \norigin kenjutsu style. Nagakura criticize Rintarou&#39;s position as a bad \nstance position, which is actually what Okita has taught him \nearlier...its a Tennen Rishin Ryuu&#39;s stance^^;\n\nDissapointed, Isami is about to go back to Shieikan with Toudou, when \nsuddenly he meets again Sakamoto Ryoma on the street. Isami ask \nSakamoto, how&#39;s the Tosa plan going...Sakamoto said, there is no longer \nTosa clan. Recently, he has been hanging out frequently with Katsu \nKaishuu, the Shogun&#39;s direct retainer who found the Shogun&#39;s navy.\n\nHijikata&#39;s head is lying on Okoto&#39;s lap. He tells her how everyone at \nShieikan make a big fuss about the bakufu and all, and how he feels \npeaceful now here. Okoto said, that her mother asks to bring Hijikata \nover to her house sometime. Hijikata tells her, that he has already told \nher from the start, he&#39;s not going to marry her. Okoto said yes to that, \nhowever she thinks that was a long ago. They have been meeting a lot in \nthis one year, their relationship have to develope anyway. Hijikata \nstill holds his principal, &quot;Afterall, isn&#39;t it better if our \nrelationship stay like this?&quot;. Okoto is really dissapointed.....they get \ninto a little fight, then Hijikata leaves her......\n\nBack in Shieikan, this time, Yamanami takes over the training hall. He \nteach the pupils the Itou stance position, one of them, is to move the \nstick a bit. Okita, who is carrying Tama on his back, comes to the \ntraining hall and calls over Yamanami. He said, a man named Yamaoka \nTetsutaro is looking for him. Yamanami leaves the hall....when Okita is \nabout to leave the hall, too...he takes a glance to Rintarou, &quot;Wait, \nwait...that&#39;s not what I taught, haven&#39;t I told you several times?! And \nwhat is that stance?? Kakko warui jannai ka??(such a bad position..)&quot;. \nThen, Rintarou gives up......^-^;;;\n\nSakamoto brings Isami and Toudou to Katsu&#39;s house, which has lots of \nWestern furnitures inside, including sofa, dining table, etc. Isami is \namazed with all the Western stuff. Sakamoto also showed Isami, the \nglobe...Isami do not understand. Sakamoto tells him, that its the world \nand the little islands he pointed, is Japan. Isami still do not \nunderstand ^-^;\nThen, Katsu show up and serve them champagne. Isami ask them where did \nSakamoto and Katsu meet. Katsu tells Isami, their first meet is a bit \nfunny, there was a misunderstood. Later, Sakamoto tells Isami, that \nKatsu is Sakuma Shozan&#39;s brother in law.\n\nTsune visits Shusuke and Fude&#39;s house, and finds Inoue Genzaburou in the \nbackyard, sweeping. Shusuke and Fude moved to another house several \nmonths ago, due to Fude&#39;s unhappiness to the new people(aka guest \nswordsmen), who keeps coming to Shieikan. Tsune meets Shusuke and gives \nhim a basket of oranges, and tells him to eat it together with Fude. \nTsune also shows Tama&#39;s hand print on a paper. Shusuke gives Tsune a \nmochi cake to give it to Isami later...\n\nIn Katsu&#39;s house, Isami and Toudou are served champagne in Western \nglasses. Toudou throw up the champagne, it seems he cannot stand the \nhard taste. Katsu and Sakamoto are laughing at Toudou. Sakamoto ask \nIsami, whether he&#39;s okay. Isami said he has once drink champagne at the \nBritish Legation.\nSakuma Shozan comes to the house. And, Sakamoto tells him, that Isami \nKondou is here. Sakuma said, he do not know who he is. &quot;Sensei...!! He&#39;s \none of the young lad who joined us to see the Kurofune 9 years ago!&quot; \nSakamoto reminds him. &quot;I dont usually remember people&#39;s face,&quot; Sakuma \nsaid ignorantly.\n\nTsune is back to Shieikan and thanked Mitsu and Okita for taking care of \nTama, while she&#39;s gone. Yamanami ask whether Isami is already \nhome...Okita tells him, Isami is not back yet. Then, Yamanami calls \nTsune to come for a moment.\nYamanami writes a letter and tell Tsune to give the letter to Isami. The \nletter contains information on the establishment of roushigumi in Kyoto, \nwhich news he just received from the man named Yamaoka Tetsuro.\nTsune doesn&#39;t look happy with this......\n\nBack to Sakamoto-tachi&#39;s place...Isami is telling Sakamoto how he is \nappointed by Matsudaira Chikaranosuke to teach at Kobusho several months \nago, and suppose to start to teach today, but suddenly told that he is \nno longer a Kobusho&#39;s teacher. Isami is really upset and ask them, if \nthey might know what is wrong. Katsu then, tells Isami, that \nChikaranosuke suddenly dont want him to teach at Kobusho anymore, \nbecause of Isami&#39;s earlier status. Isami was born in a farmer&#39;s class in \nTama, not born as a samurai. Chikaranosuke holds the principal that a \nfarmer would never be a samurai. Isami is shocked with this, and \ntogether with Toudou, he runs back to Kobusho.\n\nHijikata, who&#39;s just walking on the bridge, stopped by a group of men, \nleads by Okoto&#39;s older brother. Okoto&#39;s brother thinks Hijikata just \nwant to play around with his sister, so he has to get what he deserved. \nOkoto&#39;s brother tells his men to beat him up. Hijikata do not fight \nback. Okoto comes running, and shocked to see Hijikata is being beaten, \nshe&#39;s about to stop them, but her brother holds her back. Then, Okoto&#39;s \nbrother tells his men to stop, and leave the place. And drag Okoto \nalong, while Okoto keep staring to her back, not saying anything...but \nher face expressing sorry to Hijikata....\n\nIsami arrive at Kobusho. And coincidentally, finds Chikaranosuke walking \nexits the training hall. Isami calls him loudly, &quot;Matsudaira-sama!!!!!&quot;, \nand runs towards him, but is stopped by Chikaranosuke&#39;s men. &quot;It&#39;s true, \nthat I was born in a Tama farmer family!!! But, I am, now, a Tennen \nRishin Ryuu follower, the 4th generation Shieikan&#39;s owner!!! I am now \nKondou Shuusai&#39;s son!!! I&#39;m a samurai!! Matsudaira-sama!!!!!&quot;. \nChikaranosuke glance at him cynically, ignores him and just goes inside. \nSasaki is out and tells Chikaranosuke&#39;s men to let go Isami and Toudou. \nSasaki then, kneels before Isami. Isami tells Sasaki in a small voice, \n&quot;Sasaki-sama.....I am a samurai...&quot;. Sasaki shake his head, &quot;You were \nborn as a farmer, not a samurai...&quot;.\n\nMitsu and Tsune are in a room, putting Tama into bed. Tsune tells Mitsu, \nthat Yamanami all think about is the bakufu problems. While, Tsune only \nwants to lead a peaceful life together with Isami and the baby. Mitsu \nsuggested Tsune, to hide the letter from Isami, and not to tell him \nabout the letter.\n\nOkita and Nagakura are playing (jap traditional)chess, with Toudou and \nHarada watching them playing. Hijikata is back, with bruises on his \nface. Okita ask him what happened. But Hijikata is not answering... \nToudou then ask Nagakura where he has been today(coz earlier, together \nwith Isami, Toudou found Nagakura working as labour, building a house \nwith other few men). However, Nagakura is not giving a straight answer. \nHarada jumps in, &quot;You&#39;re not asking about me?&quot;. &quot;ahh...Harada-san wa?&quot; \nToudou asked. &quot;Me?? I&#39;m eating such great foods today!&quot;. Okita mumbles, \n&quot;Sanosuke-san is the type that always relaxing all day, ne...&quot;. It \nstrucked Harada, &quot;Sou ka? Sou desu ne...my life has always been like \nthat.....if I think of it, I never had meaningful incidents nor anything \nthat worried me in my life,&quot;. &quot;I envy you!&quot; Okita said.\n\nIsami tells Tsune to sit in front of him. Isami tells her, that he has \nfailed to become a Kobusho teacher, it seems no matter what, he can \nnever do something great in his life, he hopes that Tsune feels alright \nto have a husband that cannot do anything great. Tsune says, all that \nmatters for her, is Isami and their child leads a good life together \nwith her. Isami is touched with that, and tells her, that they should \ntake Tama someday to hanami(to see and enjoy sakura&#39;s beauty). Tsune is \nreally happy to hear that, she&#39;s about to leave to prepare dinner, but \nshe stopped and goes back to the room, &quot;Is there anything you want for \ndinner tonight?&quot;. Isami answers, &quot;Anything would be fine..&quot;, &quot;Please, \njust say it, anything,&quot; Tsune insist. &quot;Jaa....fuwafuwa tamago(note: a \nkind of egg cooks),&quot;. &quot;Hai!&quot;.\n\nTsune is holding the letter from Yamanami, and is now assured, that she \nshould just hide it from Isami. She keep the letter inside the cabinet \ntogether with the mochi cake from Shusuke. Then she goes to the market \nand runs back to Shieikan bringing a basket of eggs. She bumped someone \nand falls.....she immediately check the eggs, then smile relieved to see \nthe eggs are okay.\n\nIsami and Hijikata are in the training hall. Isami tells Hijikata that \nhe always admire Sakamoto and Katsura Kogoro, who always discussing and \ncare about the country&#39;s situation, and they are able to serve and do \nsomething for the country. He wants that too, he really wants to be able \nto serve the country, to serve the Shogun. When he was appointed as a \nKobusho teacher, he was so excited and thought that at last, he can \nserve the country with this, he feels he has find his life path. But now \nits all gone, his hopes are all gone, his paths are all gone...\nHijikata is not saying any words, just listening to his bestfriend&#39;s \nsorrow... Isami gaze at Hijikata, &quot;Your face really bruised badly, \nna?!&quot;. &quot;No need to talk about me...&quot;, &quot;What happened? Got into a fight \nagain, huh? Coz of woman?&quot;, &quot;I told you, dont talk about me...!&quot;.\n\nHarada looks for Tsune in Tama&#39;s room, to ask for foods. Tsune is not in \nthe room, so he search around....and finds the mochi cake in the \ncabinet. He excitedly takes it away, unaware that he left the cabinet \nopen, and the letter is halfway out of the cabinet........\n\nTsune is working hard, cooking for Isami....\n\nIsami is in Tama&#39;s room now. He keeps staring at Tama. Tama lift her \nhand tries to reach his father. Isami smile, then he lies besides her, \ncoindentally bump on the cabinet, and the letter falls off its \nplace...right in front of Isami....\nIsami takes the letter, read it...........and.............he is \nstunned......!!\nHe rush off to the kitchen and excitedly ask Tsune, &quot;Tsune!! What is \nthis??&quot;. Tsune is shocked, she doesnt know what to say. &quot;This \nletter...?!?&quot;. Then Tsune says, &quot;I&#39;ve forgotten!!!! Sumimasen(sorry)!!&quot;. \nIsami hugs Tsune happily, &quot;Tsune, do you know?! With this......I have \nfound my own path!! The path I&#39;m gonna choose!&quot;. &quot;I&#39;m going now!&quot; but \nIsami see the mixed eggs Tsune just made, so he hesitates. But Tsune \nimmediately says, &quot;Okiotsukete(pls, becareful)!&quot;. Isami smiles, then he \nruns outside............on the bridge, he jump and shouts excitedly!\n \n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
