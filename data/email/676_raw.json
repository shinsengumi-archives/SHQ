Suzu?  I used to feel sorry for him too but now I feel kind of\nscared of him 0_O  I think the writers have to show some real skill\nand not just rely on the &quot;you killed my teacher&quot; excuse (which was\nparodied in Kill Bill Vol. 2)...PMK, I love it I love it, but there is\nsooo much of the evil twin model.  Yoshida is the evil twin for\nHijikata, Okita has an evil twin, and Susu is Tetsu&#39;s evil twin...I\nknow even RK  kind of has the evil twin model but in PMK it is very\nvery pronounced.\n\nI saw your Maekawa residence pics...there is an actual tour you can\ndownload at http://www.the-shinsengumi.com/ (the link is in the middle\nof the sword)...and they show the floorboards the rooms etc and the\ntour guides act like they are all scared etc...funny\n\nI tried to answer your question by going to fifay.net but the address\nkeeps &quot;timing out&quot;...and as of right now it is still &quot;timing out&quot; but\nI think fifay.net has the answer to your question\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n Somehow though, my favorite character \n&gt; changed from Susumu to Suzu. I feel so sorry for him... The ending \n&gt; definitely gives good way for a second series which might not be too \n&gt; far off if ADV does license the anime... \n&gt; \n whether the Anime started \n&gt; with the Shinsengumi Imon Peacemaker or Peacemaker Kurogane manga. \n\nMaekawa residence particularly the storehouse where \n&gt; they did the interrogation of prisoners. The site is in Japanese and \n&gt; I can&#39;t find it in my bookmarks right now... Sorry, I&#39;ll put it up \n&gt; once I find it. Anyway, the pics are in the location section of the \n&gt; photos.\n\n\n"
