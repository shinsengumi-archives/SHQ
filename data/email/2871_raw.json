I have a \nquestion on the screen saver, though, as I don&#39;t have ready access to a \nMac. Is it a slideshow-type screensaver, or something more complex? If \nit is a slideshow, are the pictures actual captures of the game screens, \nor promo artwork like the wallpaper you posted?\n\n    Thanks,\n    Chuck\n\nSeven wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t buy the game but i did buy the special edition CD.\n&gt;\n&gt; Screen Saver (OSX)\n&gt; http://www.savefile.com/files/1697676 \n&gt; &lt;http://www.savefile.com/files/1697676&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wallpaper\n&gt; http://www.savefile.com/files/2103138 \n&gt; &lt;http://www.savefile.com/files/2103138&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"
