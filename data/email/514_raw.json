There are four main books listed =\r\n\nin the Kaden, along with a short summary of each of them. A more \ncomplete=\r\nly list is then enclosed in the Kaden but quite \nunfortunately, only a Fren=\r\nch translation of the original titles was \ngiven and the authors&#39; names wer=\r\ne not mentioned. As none of these \nbooks were published in French, it&#39;s qui=\r\nte useless information, so \nit&#39;s a little hard to do research to check if t=\r\nhey had been published \nat least in English.\n\nI would particularly have enj=\r\noyed learning more about the following \nbook\n\n&quot;Recueil de photographies sur=\r\n le Shinsengumi&quot; published by \nShinjinbutsu ourai-sha. In English, it would=\r\n be something \nlike: &quot;Collection of pictures of the Shinsengumi&quot;\n\nAnyway, h=\r\nere is a description of the four main sources of information.\n\n\nMary-Ann (^=\r\n-^)\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n&quot;Moeyo ken&quot; =96 2 volumes =96 by Ryotaro Shi=\r\nba\n\n&quot;According to the sayings, when they were in private, Isami Kondo \ncall=\r\ned Toshizo Hijikata by saying &quot;Hey Toshi!&quot; =96 that&#39;s how this \nBakumatsu n=\r\novel, which relates the life of Toshizo Hijikata, starts.\n\nThe author is Ry=\r\notaro Shiba, one of the greatest historical writers \nin Japan, who sadly le=\r\nft this world in February 1996.\n\nIn this remarkable book. The readers can f=\r\nollow Hijikata from his \nbirth in a peasant family in de town of Ishida-mur=\r\na (now a the Tama-\nku district in Kyoto), to his childhood where he used to=\r\n fight a lot \nand during which he already showed a great potential for orga=\r\nnisation \nand as a strategist, to different phases of his life, always a sw=\r\nord \nin his hand and with a strong unbreakable will (as the Ikedaya \nincide=\r\nnt, the Toba-Fushimi battle, the Aizu battle and all the \nheartbreaking eve=\r\nnts where he lost his two best friends: Isami Kondo \nand Soushi Okita). The=\r\n story goes on until the battle of Hakodate at \nthe end of the Boshin war, =\r\nwhere he died under the enemy&#39;s bullets, \nstill a sword in his hand. Either=\r\n they first read it for the man \nitself, or to learn more about the Shinsen=\r\ngumi, many people declared \nhaving become a Shinsengumi fan after having re=\r\nad this book! Watsuki \nhimself consider this book as his &quot;bible&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s w=\r\nhy it is, sooner or later, an essential book for every \nKenshin fan.\n\n\n\n&quot;Su=\r\ngata Sanshiro&quot; (&quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot;) =96 3 volumes =96 by Tsuneo Tomita\n\nIt&#39;s=\r\n after having read this book that Watsuki decided to set his \nstory in the =\r\nMeiji era. The story takes place during the fifth year \nof the Meiji era, a=\r\nt a time when the popularity of traditional \nJapanese martial arts was rapi=\r\ndly declining, due to the social \nchanges underway. Sanshiro Sugata, a youn=\r\ng man who&#39;s a real judo \nprodigy, is then slowly becoming a very mature fig=\r\nhter. There are a \nlots of sports manga featuring Sanshiro learning judo, k=\r\narate or even \nboxing: fans of that category of manga among our readers wil=\r\nl \nprobably know what we are talking about. Even those who never heard \nSan=\r\nshiro&#39;s name probably heard about his unbeatable technique &quot;yama \narashi&quot; (=\r\nmountain&#39;s storm). Look for drawings of fights where&#39;s there \na sensation o=\r\nf speed, as if the characters where going to come out of \nthe book, and you=\r\n&#39;ll probably find something=85\n\nTo learn more about the Meiji era this is a=\r\nn essential book for every \nKenshin fan.\n\nThe author, Tsuneao Tomita, was t=\r\nhe Ghokugi award&#39;s first winner \nafter WW2.\n\nOne of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s movies=\r\n is based on this book.\n\n\n\n&quot;Shinengumi keppuroku&quot; =96 by Ryotaro Shiba\n\nAft=\r\ner having introduced the Shinsengumi in his previous work, &quot;Moeyo \nken&quot;, Ry=\r\notaro Shiba then published a book consisting of many short \nnovels. The mai=\r\nn difference between the two books is that, instead of \nkeeping the same po=\r\nint of view as in &quot;Moeyo ken&quot;, &quot;Shinsengumi \nkeppuroku&quot; explores different =\r\nShinsengumi&#39;s members&#39; point of view, \neach short novel staring one of them=\r\n. The novels are not linked \ntogether, which allows a wide diversity of sty=\r\nles. Kenshin fans will \nbe happy to learn that Saito is one of the main cha=\r\nracters of &quot;Yari \nwa hozoin ryu&quot;. Kanryusai Takada, makes an apparition in =\r\n&quot;Kamogawa \nzenitoribashi&quot; (episode where he is murdered by Saito). The most=\r\n \npopular Shinsengumi member, Soushi Okita, is the main character of a \nwho=\r\nle chapter &quot;the love of Soushi Okita&quot;. Be sure not to miss this \nbook.\n\nThe=\r\nre is a TV series based on this book and there is also another one \nbased o=\r\nn &quot;Moeyo ken&quot;, which are both remarkable, especially the one \nbased on &quot;Shi=\r\nnsengumi keppuroku&quot;.\n\n\n\n&quot;Katsura Kogoro&quot; =96 2 volumes =96 by Kaoru Furukaw=\r\na\n\nThis is a biography of Kagoro Katsura, who was Kenshin&#39;s superior \ndurin=\r\ng the Bakumatsu in the manga, and who was one of the three most \nimportant =\r\nmen of the Meiji restoration. This is the story of his life \nand of the man=\r\n who had to changed his name to Takayoshi Kido during \nthe restoration, to =\r\nfinally die of sickness in the tenth year of the \nMeiji era. The author him=\r\nself, Kaoru Furukawa, says that between the \nBakumatsu and his life as a po=\r\nlitician, Kido/Katsura not only changed \nhis name, but his personality as w=\r\nell, loosing all of this vitality. \nWe can see different aspects of his per=\r\nsonality throughout the book. \nFor those who wants to learn more about a ma=\r\nn who was close to \nKenshin in the manga.\n\n\n\n"
