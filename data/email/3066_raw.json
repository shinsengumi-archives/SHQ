For \ninstance, many domains operated by a system of paying retainers from the \nrice storehouses and making them live within the castle town or elsewhere in \nterms of important domain/municipal locales, but some, like Sendai, actually \nallowed their men to reside on their own land.\n\nBut you&#39;re right, a work on the topic would be useful.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
