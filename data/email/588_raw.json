That&#39;s it-- no names of the sons and daughters, no \nnames of their children just the generic 7 sons and 8 daughters.\n\nWell, I _need_ to know the names of those 7 sons and 8 daughters and \ntheir wives/husbands and children, dammit!\n\nOkay I&#39;ve settled down now. *grin*  If any of you fine people out there \nin Shinsengumi fan land have come across a real chart type family tree  \nfor the Imperial family in the 19th century can you let me know?\n\nIf anyone should happen to want to know similar information on the \nBritish royal family for the Sherlock Holmes Meets Saitou fanfic \nchallenge I&#39;ll be happy to help. I have a big detailed family tree for  \nthe British royal family. Those historians know how to make a writer happy.\n\n----Barbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
