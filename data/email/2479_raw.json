I can&#39;t wait till you have those fansites up. \nI know a few people who buy manga just -because-, and it doesn&#39;t \neven matter if they can&#39;t read them since they are fans (myself \nincluded). A place where we can at least read a summary per chapter \nor volume is great than having nothing at all (except beautiful \nimages *snicker*). Let me know if I can help you in anyway and \ngoodluck!\n\n~Kizu\n\np.s. Niwashi my apologies for not getting your name right.. *kicks \nself*. I shouldn&#39;t really respond when I&#39;m running out the door. ^^;;\n\n\n --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Niwashi&quot; &lt;labaker@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Kizu wrote:\n&gt; &gt; aside from the beautiful artwork I cannot make a lot of\n&gt; &gt; sense to it by just trying to figure out what&#39;s happening through\n&gt; &gt; the images.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m thinking of setting up a fan site for some of these.  While \nfull\n&gt; translations seem a bit too daunting, I might put up detailed \nchapter by\n&gt; chapter (or story by story in the case of Okita-Kirameki no \nZanzou) plot\n&gt; descriptions along with a &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; gallery with images of each\n&gt; significant character.  Perhaps after reading a full summary, the \nbooks&#39;\n&gt; images would make more sense.  It would take me a while to get \nsomething set\n&gt; up, but then I&#39;ll probably start with Getsu Mei Sei Ki and some of \nthe\n&gt; stories from Okita Souji - Kirameki no Zanzou, to be followed by \nHokusou\n&gt; Shinsengumi and later Burai and perhaps some of the others.  I&#39;ll \npost a\n&gt; link once I have something to point it to.\n&gt; \n&gt; Niwashi\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s.  I just ordered Shinsengumi Hijikata Toshizou Mibu no Ginrou \n(the\n&gt; companion volume to Shinsengumi Okita Souji Kirameki no Zanzou), \nthe next\n&gt; couple volumes of Getsu Mei Sei Ki, and the first volume of \nOnikami Shinsen.\n&gt; With ground shipping from halfway around the world, I won&#39;t get \nthem for a\n&gt; month or so, but eventually I&#39;ll have a few more reviews to add.\n\n\n\n"
