I&#39;m sure we all will. Good luck on all your continuing \nresearch and any future projects!\n\nThird (Sorry to cram everything in one post . . . ): Re-intro.\n\n1) Name/Nickname/Screen name whatever (+ anything you would like us \nto \nknow about you)\nName: Wu Jia-xin (Mandarin; yes, it&#39;s real. No, it&#39;s not really what \nmost people call me, but I like it.)\nNickname/Screen name: if I&#39;m not using my Mandarin name, you will \nfind me registered under &quot;Kitsunehime&quot;\nCurrently trying to learn Japanese . . . give or take a few months \n(*cough*years*cough*) I may be of help in the field of translation. \n^^;\n\n2) How did you &quot;discover&quot; the Shinsengumi?\nWell . . . I first came across them from watching RK . . . but I \nnever really developed an interest in them until I watched PMK. From \nthere . . . it pretty much amounts to an obsession. ^^;\n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?\n . . . Okita Souji-san. X3 Because of his (supposedly?) wonderful \npersoality and humor. *ahem*not to mention good looks*ahem* One \ncannot overlook his renowned swordsmanship and somewhat tragic demise \neither.\nHijikata-san may come in second . . . his resolve regarding the \nShinsengumi is just amazing.\n\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\nJust PMK, RK tv, part of Kaze Hikaru, Soshite Haru no Tsuki, and one \nother manga I can&#39;t quite remember . . . In short, I&#39;m pretty much \nlimited to what I can get online. ^^; I tried to rent Mibu Gishi Den \nand Gohatto, but the store didn&#39;t have it . . . TT_TT\n\n5) In terms of film/television portrayals what film (or series) do \nyou \nthink captured your favorite member(s) the best and why?\nI don&#39;t think I can really answer this well . . . I haven&#39;t seen any \nof the live-action versions.\nBut I have to say, I love all the PMK portrayals. X3 For example, \nOkita-san . . . is just too cute. I also love how he is portrayed as \na demon of the sword. Hijikata-san . . . Good looks. X3 Charisma. \nWhat seems to be a nice person under the gruff exterior he must \npresent for the world. The joker trio . . . need I say more? Saitou-\nsan . . . can&#39;t even begin to explain with this one. X3\nBut the KH incarnations are fun too . . . Okita-san has that same \ncute, almost whimsical personality. Hijikata-san, again, seems to \nhave something besides what he wants others to see. Saitou-san . . . \neven if he might not be quite as aesthetically pleasing as other \nversion, still kicks a$$.\n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any \nparticular Shinsengumi members or events?\nTetsu and Tatsu were (possible) real people?\n . . . *mind goes blank* . . . I can&#39;t recall the other one. O.o\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
