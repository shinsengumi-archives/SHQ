Book page are \navailable upon request.  Meanwhile, heres the Japanese =\r\nOkita article at Wikepedia. \nhttp://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/????\n\nAnyways, Th=\r\nanks for the message, &quot;M&quot;. I&#39;ll use &quot;Mototsune&quot; from now on until I find an=\r\ny\nevidence agains it. As you probably are aware of, figuring out one&#39;s Japa=\r\nnese formal given\nname/middle middle is harder than figuring his family nam=\r\ne, given name, or family\nclan name (even for well-educated Japanese.)\n\n~Sev=\r\nen\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shimazu Masayoshi&quot; &lt;patriot014@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Nlf7:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for posting those pages, and for the insights int=\r\no this data\n&gt; which you shared. However, I wanted to comment on your note o=\r\nn the\n&gt; Okita Rintaro page at Wikipedia.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;However, with a family clan=\r\n name &quot;Fujiwara&quot;, this &quot;Fujiwara no\n&gt; &gt;Mototsune&quot; would have shared an iden=\r\ntical pronunciation with Fujiwara\n&gt; &gt;no Mototsune (836-891). Wouldn&#39;t a 19t=\r\nh century Japanese man avoid a\n&gt; &gt;name like that? If this Inoue Rintaro was=\r\n born with the formal given\n&gt; &gt;name/middle name &quot;Motosune,&quot; wouldn&#39;t he hav=\r\ne also changed it when he\n&gt; &gt;changed his name to Okita Rintaro?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If he=\r\n received the formal name &quot;Mototsune&quot;, it would probably either\n&gt; be in hon=\r\nor of that ancestor, or a coincidence. After all, the two\n&gt; names are writt=\r\nen with different characters, though they&#39;re pronounced\n&gt; the same-- so the=\r\nre wouldn&#39;t be a pressing reason to avoid use of the\n&gt; name.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, on =\r\na purely linguistic basis, the name still would be read\n&gt; &quot;Mototsune&quot;. To p=\r\nronounce it &quot;Gentsune&quot; would be, at best, irregular,\n&gt; as that makes it hal=\r\nf &quot;on-yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese reading) and half\n&gt; &quot;kun-yomi&quot; (Japanese reading=\r\n). I&#39;m not ruling out the possibility of\n&gt; this being an exception, as read=\r\ning Japanese names-- particularly\n&gt; premodern ones-- is a tricky business; =\r\nhowever, I&#39;m just saying that\n&gt; it&#39;s not necessarily probable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Further=\r\nmore, with regards to your information on Rintaro Fusamasa:\n&gt; Serizawa Kamo=\r\n&#39;s webpage (Serizawa Kamo being another member of this\n&gt; ML)-- http://victo=\r\nrian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html#,\n&gt; indicates that at one point,=\r\n Okita used the formal name &quot;Fusanaga&quot;. To\n&gt; have a formal name that had a =\r\nfirst character &quot;Fusa&quot; would suggest a\n&gt; closeness with someone who had the=\r\n same character in their name--\n&gt; which you have brought to our attention a=\r\ns being Rintaro *Fusa*masa,\n&gt; as illustrated in the quote from Mori, p. 12,=\r\n with young Souji calling\n&gt; him &quot;Nii-san&quot; (elder brother). \n&gt; \n&gt; Once again=\r\n, thank you for your interaction, and for your insight.\n&gt; \n&gt; -M.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
