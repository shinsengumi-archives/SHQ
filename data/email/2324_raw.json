And Tetsu really was \nHijikata&#39;s \n&gt; page. However, they did not join the Shinsengumi until 1867. I \nthink \n&gt; Tatsu left the group after either Toba-Fushimi? Or Was it Kofu? \nBut \n&gt; Tetsu followed Hijikata all the way to Hakodate, Ezo (Hokkaido).\n\nProbably it is Goheishinden or Nagareyama that Tatsu escaped. After \nthat, he returned to the hometown and became a merchant. He died of \nan illness in Meiji 5. However, his posterity exists. \n\n\n&gt; During this time Hijikata finished settling things about him. On \nMay \n&gt; 5, 1869 he gave several items (a letter, the picture of him, a \nsword, \n&gt; and I think a poem?) to Tetsu and ordered him to get out of \nHakodate \n&gt; and take these things to his family. \n\nTetsu is not sending the sword to Hino. This is the fact which many \nJapanese Shinsengumi fans&#39; people also misunderstand. I also thought \nthat Tetsu sent the sword to Hino. It is only Hijikata&#39;s photograph \nand letter which Tetsu sent. It is the fiction of &quot;Moeyo ken&quot; of \nShiba Ryotaro that Tetsu sent the sword. Kanesada which Hijikata&#39;s \nposterity has is the sword which it left to the Hijikata family, \nwhen he goes to Kofu. \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
