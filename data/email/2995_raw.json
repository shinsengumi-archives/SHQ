Receiving reward \nmoney from the Emperor for, say, distinguished service at the 8.18.1863 \nincident, or the Ikedaya incident, was a big thing-- THAT was big money. \nAnother issue to bear in mind is that these men started out poor, so even if \nthey received a lot of money, they wouldn&#39;t go about making themselves *not* \nlook poor right away.\n\nLater on, when they were paid by the Shogunate, they also weren&#39;t paid an \nincredibly high amount...but they were better off than before (this appears \nin Mibugishiden-- the Shinsengumi go through &quot;bakushin toritate&quot;-- which \nmeans they are made hatamoto, or retainers of the Shogun). The best off the \nShinsengumi were going to be monetarily and status-wise, at least on paper, \nwas right before they headed to fight the Imperial army in Kai Province. \nKondou was to become a daimyo with a 100,000 koku income, Hijikata would \nhave 50,000, the captains would have 30,000, and the junior officers 10,000 \n(see page 102 of Kikuchi Akira&#39;s &quot;Toba-Fushimi no Tatakai Kara Nagareyama \nMade,&quot; in &quot;Saitou Hajime no Subete) However, this was never to become \nreality.\n\n&gt;   Could anybody tell me, except &quot;Kiyokawa Hachirou/Serizawa Kamo&#39;s probs&quot;, \n&gt;are there another &gt;internal problem in Shinsengumi????\n\nYes. There were periodically issues with people leaving. Also, early on, \nthere was the issue of Okura Isetake, Arakida Samanosuke, and Kusunoki \nKojuro, the Choshu spies who joined Shinsengumi early on, and were killed in \nthe fall of 1863. (see Itou Tetsuya&#39;s timeline which appears at the end of \nthe book &quot;Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot;.) Most famous is the incident of Itou \nKashitarou&#39;s group leaving-- this would later come back to haunt Kondou, who \nwas shot by the survivors of the group in early 1868 (see page 157 of \nNagakura Shinpachi&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&quot;). Another survivor of that \ngroup, Kano Washio, was the man who positively identified the newly captured \nKondou later that year. Here is a picture of him: \nhttp://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/syashin/kanou.jpg\n\nThere were also many other people who were executed for various reasons. \nHowever, Nagakura records even those who were executed on the memorial that \nhe inscribed for Shinsengumi, a translation of which appears here: \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiMonument.htm\n\nI hope that helps answer your questions.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
