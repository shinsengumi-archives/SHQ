I haven&#39;t run across enough about Shinto beliefs yet. Sounds like an interesting religion from what I do know about it,though.\n\nAs far as why the Shinsengumi kept Okita&#39;s condition secret goes, I always thought it had more to do with them being afraid the group would be demoralized if they found out their strongest member had a fatal illness. This just adds a new twist to it. Maybe they were afraid some of their followers would think it was a sign the Shinsengumi were angering the kami or something? Knowing how forward-thinking Hijikata was, I can&#39;t see him giving in to superstitions. He had a very practical reason for hiding Okita&#39;s condition I&#39;m sure, but that doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t recognize what the knowledge might lead others to think.\n\nBut what about the other stuff? Was the site correct about the raid at the Masuya and the Ueno War do you think?\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
