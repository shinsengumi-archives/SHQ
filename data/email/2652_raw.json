Again, I can only=\r\n read English\nso this research was difficult but rewarding...\n\nhttp://www.s=\r\nhinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\n\nplease do an &quot;edit find&quot; in the body =\r\nof the page (not the top\nnavigation bar) for all references to &quot;Emma&quot; and t=\r\nhe new information\nwill appear in the chronology for the years 1887-9 {look=\r\n for the info\non a green background}.  Her letters contain a description of=\r\n her\nworkplace---which was Tokio&#39;s world.  So if Tokio worked at the school=\r\n\nduring those years or even AFTERWARDS--she had in fact several foreign\nco-=\r\nworkers.\n\nDid this American interact with other Japanese? Yes, the handful =\r\nof\nJapanese women who could speak English and missionaries such as Tsuda\nUm=\r\ne.  Often her Japanese friends would visit her at her home which was\nright =\r\non campus.  \n\nWhat can we learn from Emma&#39;s words or other description avai=\r\nlable\nthrought out the page (yes I know about the typos and how huge the\npa=\r\nge has become--I didn&#39;t expect all this info ^_^)...you can learn\nalot like=\r\n:\n\nthe work schedule---Emma was up and writing letters at 6:30 am\nI know th=\r\nat Tokio&#39;s cousin, the director Takamine Hideo, worked from\n6am-8pm where d=\r\noes that leave our dorm mother?  Well she had to be\nsure her young students=\r\n were out of bed and off to class---so Tokio\nwas BUSY!  (^_^)\n\nYou can trul=\r\ny imagine the atmosphere of the school--note the beautiful\nsurroundings, yo=\r\nu can see Mt. Fuji from the campus, the trees near the\nConfucian temple gro=\r\nunds.  The school however did move in the late\n1890s under the director&#39;s l=\r\nast term to even more spacious\nsurroundings to accomodate the increase in s=\r\ntudents.\n\nWhat do we want?  We want Emma to tell us about the dorm mothers\n=\r\nofcourse.  I spent some time going over the microfilm (which focused\non her=\r\n son&#39;s bio) and illegible handwriting (some brave researcher did\ntype a few=\r\n of her letters) and could not find this detail.  What we do\nhave reveals a=\r\n woman who loves detail and LOVED to talk about her job.\n\n[However] more bi=\r\nographical can be found in papers not microfilmed and\ntherefore not availab=\r\nle --- you have to go to Cornell&#39;s special\ncollections and look for a box o=\r\nf notes by Mr. Herbert Croly who did\nresearch Emma&#39;s time in Japan!  Croly =\r\nmust have interviewed Emma&#39;s\nfriends as well because he had details not men=\r\ntioned in the letters I\nread.  Emma&#39;s friends were teachers so she listed t=\r\nextbooks she used\nat Tokio&#39;s school, and refers to the director by his firs=\r\nt name\n&quot;Hideyoshi&quot; (with a &#39;y&#39;) throughout.  Who know maybe Takamine Hideo\n=\r\nintroduced his cousin Tokio to this American woman.  Ofcourse from\nreading =\r\nthe Meiji era novel about a fictional teacher Botchan by\nNatsume Soseki for=\r\nmal introductions were unavoidable....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
