Although on one hand it seemed to=\r\n be a \n&gt; &gt; mark of distinction to obtain the samurai status, economically s=\r\npeaking \n&gt; &gt; many people, including the samurai themselves, knew that the m=\r\noney can \n&gt; &gt; be found in the purportedly &quot;lower&quot; classes.  For example dur=\r\ning the \n&gt; &gt; Meiji era a survey of families who sent their daughters to a p=\r\nublic \n&gt; &gt; school---across the board claimed samurai descent, but many *bef=\r\nore \n&gt; &gt; 1868 had engaged in clearly merchant class businesses (this flies =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; against the widespread abhorrance of samurai to engage in such work). =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; By far the most econommically dynamic classes were the upper peasant =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; and merchant classes.  What killed the samurai class was their obsolet=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; role and drain on the economy---samurai no longer and never did \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n produced &quot;anything&quot; unlike the lower classes, although as we now they \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n fulfilled critical administrative roles.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t finished this =\r\npage yet but when I&#39;m done I&#39;ll upload it to \n&gt; &gt; shinsengumihq.com:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Before Boshin 1868: A Survey of the Feudal System\n&gt; &gt; http://1happyturtl=\r\ne.com/Hosting/BakumatsuBackground.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s really important to not=\r\ne this article\n&gt; &gt; The Farmers of Edo and the Warriors in Kyoto \n&gt; &gt; http:/=\r\n/www.shinsengumihq.com/FarmersofEdo.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Because the Shinsengumi, f=\r\nor the first time are mentioned in a non-\n&gt; &gt; warrior context, were right s=\r\nmack in the middle of the social pyramid \n&gt; &gt; blur---they were close friend=\r\ns/associates/adopted siblings to ELITE \n&gt; &gt; PEASANTS, WELL EDUCATED PEASANT=\r\nS.  Thus people like Kondou and Hijikata \n&gt; &gt; had a deep understanding of w=\r\nhat was going on because they valued these \n&gt; &gt; social relationships and cl=\r\nearly, in no way abandoned their associates \n&gt; &gt; after attaining that feuda=\r\nl &quot;dream&quot; of samuraihood so to speak.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did pose the question to M=\r\nr. Hillsborough of whether or not he would \n&gt; &gt; address what was going in T=\r\nama at the time and if he would discuss in \n&gt; &gt; depth the social background=\r\n of these figures.  Specifically, rural Edo \n&gt; &gt; where many members from th=\r\ne Shinsengumi call home has been studied by \n&gt; &gt; scholars specifically for =\r\nall that social blurring.  During the Meiji \n&gt; &gt; Era that region produced i=\r\nncredibly politically active farmers who \n&gt; &gt; pushed for *real democratic c=\r\nhange and surprisingly opposed some of the \n&gt; &gt; victors of 1868.  Hillsboro=\r\nugh asked if I was a sociology major.  I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; not---just a concerned and =\r\ncurious member of his audience, but the \n&gt; &gt; point was ... it is absolutely=\r\n important to get into the &quot;mindset&quot; of \n&gt; &gt; Kondou and Hijikata.  Because =\r\nthey did see things differently, after \n&gt; &gt; all, travelling from rural Edo =\r\nto Kyoto was an eye opening \n&gt; &gt; experience...trying to navigate the capita=\r\nl&#39;s bureaucracy must&#39;ve been \n&gt; &gt; rather difficult for a bunch of &quot;nobodies=\r\n&quot;.  They were fish out of \n&gt; &gt; water and treated as such.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whether =\r\nor not their later success contributed to their &quot;their \n&gt; &gt; conviction of s=\r\nelf-importance and their unyielding will to power&quot; \n&gt; &gt; (Hillsborough 147) =\r\nand so forth is a possibility, but a slightly \n&gt; &gt; difficult abstraction to=\r\n gauge accurately by any historian.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then again, lust for power is =\r\na universal, human trait, not something \n&gt; &gt; the Shinsengumi monopolized.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hillsborough probably has not studied the aftermath of 1868 in great \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; detail.  His heroes are the most shockingly ruthless men to hold and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n maintain, political, social, military and educational power.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- =\r\nIn SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; As for th=\r\ne social classes, it looks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like they got pretty hazy near the end of =\r\nthe Edo period.
