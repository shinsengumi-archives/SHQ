From now on,\nevery acquaintance. To tell the truth my wife with Ki=\r\ntakata city\ngraduate something, the lineage of the grandmother is the Aizu =\r\nfeudal\nclan loyal retainer. You think that there is a memorial stone monume=\r\nnt\nof the person, &quot;Nakane United States seven&quot;, in Kumakura, but that\nperso=\r\nn becomes the grandfather of the grandmother of the wife. It\nseems that as =\r\nfor this person at the time of =E6=88=8A =E8=BE=B0 war being in blue\ndragon=\r\n party, it survives, causes &quot;thought bridge incident&quot; incident,\ngoes to Sei=\r\nnan war. It is drawn Saigo prosperously and together with\nthe brocade pictu=\r\nre of Seinan war. After that, returning to Kumakura,\nbeing to commit hara-k=\r\niri, it does, but that time, Saito one where had\nbecome the policeman helpe=\r\nd the United States seven from the spy, so\nis. Naturally, as for the blood =\r\nof that United States seven it is not\nflowing to me, but when you think, th=\r\nat that blood is succeeded in the\nchildren, you think very in pride. When t=\r\nhis time, going home in\nKitakata, you think that I would like to go to visi=\r\nting a grave.\n\nbasically his wife is related to an Aizu retainer who served=\r\n in the\nblue dragon party (for those of you who are new the defense of Aizu=\r\n\nwas split into age groups, genbu/turtle (oldest), seiryu? dragon,\nphoenix =\r\n(Saitou was part of phoenix) and white tiger (youngest\nguys)...the rest I&#39;m=\r\n not clear...the man is happy that his kids have\nAizu blood in their veins =\r\nit seems\n\n\n"
