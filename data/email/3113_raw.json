I&#39;m not sure what=\r\n\ntype of database you&#39;re planning, but I use Wikimedia (of wikipedai\nfame a=\r\nnd infamy) on the Samurai Archives (as of August or so of last\nyear), and t=\r\nhe ability to update instantly on the fly, and to have\nmultiple contributor=\r\ns has absolutely revolutionized the website, and\nhas given me renewed energ=\r\ny in research, because now I don&#39;t have to\ncreate a &quot;full and polished&quot; art=\r\nicle, format it with HTML, manually\nupload it, manually change all of the r=\r\nelated pages, etc. That was\nsuch a chore that even the thought of adding ne=\r\nw research to the page\nhad been daunting.  The new software is the reason I=\r\n&#39;ve been getting\ninto the Shinsengumi, it&#39;s given me the opportunity to do =\r\nmore\nresearch with &quot;immediate&quot; results. Counting myself, there are about 3\n=\r\npeople working on the Bakumatsu, and if anyone is interested in given\nme so=\r\nme feedback (or pointing out any glaring errors), I&#39;d really\napprecite it -=\r\n Barbara said she wouldn&#39;t mind if I mentioned it, so\nhere is the &quot;Shinengu=\r\nmi&quot; category (still at least half the articles\nare stubs, but it&#39;s a start)=\r\n:\n\nhttp://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=3DCategory:Shinsengumi\n=\r\n\nMy goal is to make this the Japanese history version of wikipedia.\nI&#39;ve al=\r\nways been extremely unhappy with wikipedia&#39;s &quot;failure&quot; to cite\nsources with=\r\n the Japanese history articles, and the overall poor\nquality of many of the=\r\n articles, so I run a pretty tight ship to keep\nout bad info (and the Shins=\r\nengumiHQ makes it clear that academic\nveracity is top priority as well).  O=\r\nnly people I &quot;approve&quot; can\ncontribute (I decided to disallow &#39;anyone&#39; from =\r\nediting because of\nsome vandals and some poor or outright copied articles t=\r\nhat kept\nshowing up), but if anyone does feel inclined to help out, let me\n=\r\nknow.  I created the wiki as an alternative to Wikipedia, as a public\ndatab=\r\nase that anyone can use, and although for now most of the\narticles have com=\r\ne from the Samurai Archives, I consider this more of\na &quot;public forum&quot; (for =\r\nlack of a better term) than &quot;my website&quot;.\n\nI&#39;m looking forward to seeing th=\r\ne new improvements on ShinsengumiHQ as\nwell - I&#39;m really looking forward to=\r\n a streamlined search. The\nshinsengumiHQ is great, but admittedly I have tr=\r\nouble pinpointing what\nI&#39;m looking for - but this could just be because of =\r\nmy own lack of\nknowing exactly what I&#39;m looking for most of the time.\n\nAlso=\r\n, I&#39;m coordinating a &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; research-discussion group\nstarting Febru=\r\nary 10th (which will last a month), which I&#39;d like to\ntry and somehow coord=\r\ninate with this group, since the discussion and\nresearch will be starting &quot;=\r\nat the beginning&quot;, and most people signed\nup really don&#39;t know much about t=\r\nhe shinsengumi - so if anyone has any\nideas on how or what would be a good =\r\nidea to do on that front, I&#39;d\nappreciate it! A coordinated effort could ben=\r\nefit the shinsengumiHQ as\nwell - further discussion and research is always =\r\ngood.  I don&#39;t expect\nany groundbreaking discoveries, but based on the last=\r\n 2 discussion\ngroups, it should result in some good foundations for article=\r\ns and\nhelp with the &quot;big picture&quot;.\n\n\n"
