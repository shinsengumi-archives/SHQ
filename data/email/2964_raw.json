(1833? - February 6, 1868) was a Shinsengumi officer an=\r\nd spy \n(Kansatsu.)\nHe was a ronin from Osaka and an expert in Katori Ryu. I=\r\nn 1864, Yamazaki and Shimada \nKai were assigned by Kondo Isami to investiga=\r\nte the situation which led to the Ikedaya \nJiken on July 8. However, there =\r\nis a theory that Yamazaki&#39;s participation in the Ikedaya \nJiken is merely f=\r\niction by Shimozawa Kan and Shiba Ryotaro.\nYamazaki was said to be excellen=\r\nt in literary and military arts. His scholastic talent was \nnecessary when =\r\ndiscussing politics with a court noble.\nIn 1865, he accompanied Kondo to Hi=\r\nroshima. It is believed that Yamazaki did not return \nto Kyoto with Kondo u=\r\nntil the next year in order to further investigate Choshu&#39;s status.\nYamazak=\r\ni studied medicine under Matsumoto Ryoujun. According to Matsumoto, \nYamaza=\r\nki was a gentle and taciturn man.\nDuring the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in 1868=\r\n, Yamazaki was severely injured and died on \nFebruary 6. The exact location=\r\n of his death is debatable. He had Kondo and Hijikata \nToshizo&#39;s full confi=\r\ndence and was one of the most faithful member of the Shinsengumi till \nthe =\r\nvery end.\n\nYamazaki in Fiction\n\nYamazaki is featured in Peacemaker Kurogane=\r\n (anime/manga), Kaze Hikaru (manga), \nGetsumei Seiki (manga) and Bakumatsu =\r\nRenka Shinsengumi (video game series.)\nHan&#39;nya from the anime/manga Rurouni=\r\n Kenshin is loosely based on Yamazaki.\nAlthough his anime, manga, and TV de=\r\npictions tend to be as a trained ninja, the real \nYamazaki was not a ninja.=\r\n\n\nReferences\n\nRekishi Dokuhon, December 1997 issue &quot;The Ten Captains of The=\r\n Late Tokugawa Period&#39;s \nStrongest Shinsengumi&quot;\nShinsengumi Chronicle.
