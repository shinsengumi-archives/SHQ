Some possible scenarios:\n \n1) he didn&#39;t join the police force until after the Seinan (wasn&#39;t it discussed here that many of Saigou&#39;s Satsuma samurai joined after the Seinan?) and fought with Satsuma forces against the Meiji;\n \n2) he had as much reason for vengeance as Saitou, only his reasons were directed at Saigou (who, until someone comes forth with evidence against it, I maintain played a part in the destruction of Sagara and the Sekihoutai), and therefore he fought as part of the Meiji forces against Satsuma;\n \n3) he&#39;d left old animosities behind him (as Saitou *might* have done as well) and gave his support to the Meiji government for the security of Japan;\n \n4) he stayed out of it completely for personal and/or philosophical reasons (I don&#39;t think anything is mentioned of his being involved in the Seinan on the one site we have).\n \nAny thoughts?  Any information that might point us to the truth?\n \nphil (determined to have Miki remembered along with the others)\n \n \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
