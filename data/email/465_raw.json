That \n&gt; it was either Satsuma or Choshu clan and any other person that wanted \n&gt; to war against the Shogun. Ryoma seemed to be the person that was \n&gt; preventing that. The movies I have about Ryoma tend to take this \n&gt; theory, but that is fiction of course. I read someone talking about \n&gt; the Peacemaker Manga on Ryoma&#39;s death, but I won&#39;t spoil that one. \n&gt; I&#39;ll post something on this on the other board eventually. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n\n\n"
