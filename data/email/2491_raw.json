I wanted to give it as a gift to \nsomeone to a few months ago but alas the January release never came \nand my pre-order on Amazon... Well at least it is on pre-order or \ndoes that mean nothing at all? ^^;;\n\nI think it&#39;s been discussed a long time ago in this list about how \nthe book might be ridden with innacuracies and or generalities \nbecause Hillsborough was not really an &quot;authority&quot; and because he \ndid a speech and made mistakes? I don&#39;t remember which thread it was \nsince it&#39;s been almost a year... But all I can say is if this book \never gets released I&#39;d still buy it since it is in English and I do \nlike the feel of a book in my hands. Although I think SHQ research \nis probably more thorough on certain subjects... \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Shogun&#39;s Most Dreaded Samurai Corps: The Bloody Legacy Of The \n&gt; Shinsengumi (Hardcover)by Romulus Hillsboroughsomeone went to a \n&gt; bookstore to inquire about the status of this book and was told \nthat \n&gt; Tuttle Publishing &quot;dropped&quot; this book-&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; How odd I heard this week that it finally went to the printers.
