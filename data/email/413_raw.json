If they \ndidn&#39;t even do the Kyoto arc yet, then yeah, I&#39;d definitely be upset. \nThey showed the Kyoto arc...Once. Last summer. That was it. And I missed the \nfinal showdown with Shishio! That&#39;s why I got mad and rounded the entire thing \nup on DVD. They were too slow about showing anything. Now they&#39;re not even \ngoing to show it a second time (at least not yet).
