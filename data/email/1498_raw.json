California is\n&gt; home to a huge population of Japanese Americans not to mention major\n&gt; universities with Japanese language dept.  if you are upset then so am\n&gt; I!!! I have PERSONALLY encouraged JAL to hire a translator for Mr.\n&gt; Asada because as a native of CA I know that many anime fansubs are\n&gt; from these universities.  So I was outraged that JAL would send Mr.\n&gt; Asada here without a translator.  The lady on the line said that she\n&gt; will speak to her superiors about getting a translator for Mr. Asada\n&gt; \n&gt; For the S. CA (Torrance) lecture you can only pay with personal check\n&gt; or money order over the phone and tickets will be mailed to you ASAP...\n&gt; ...furthermore there will be a second lecture again by Jiro Asada in\n&gt; San Francisco on Sept 10 call (415) 765-8545 at the Palo Alto Hotel\n&gt; but the focus will be more on the Bakumatsu.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bsher213&quot; &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I just stumbled across this on a SHisnengumi LJ community I just found\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shinsengumi to Sono Jidai&#39; (Shinsengumi and Their Times)\n&gt; &gt; Sept. 9, 2004 - 7:00pm at the Torrance Marriott\n&gt; &gt; contact JAL&#39;s LA branch at (310)607-2330 for info.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know we  have Californians out there---Someone has to go and bring\n&gt; &gt; us back information and pictures!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Barb Sheridan\n\n\n"
