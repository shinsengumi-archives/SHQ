But for those who do not..\n&gt; \n&gt; Well I was just over at animenewsnetwork forum and was I surprised! \n&gt; Geez go away for some weeks and miss out on things... ^_^*\n&gt; \n&gt; ADV has announced that it will license 1000 volumes (not titles) of \n&gt; manga, so far 37 had gone through and this includes Peacemaker \n&gt; Kurogane. I could not find reference to whether they will be \n&gt; translating the prequel SIMP but translation of the second part PMK \n&gt; is ongoing. \n&gt; \n&gt; About the Anime, ADV (at least from what I know right now) has not \n&gt; announced ownership of the Anime but there are rumors that they are \n&gt; or very soon will be dubbing the series... Wow that was fast. If \n&gt; this is true then I&#39;m glad I got the fansub version first. Unless \n&gt; ADV announces they officially licensed PMK Anime then I guess the \n&gt; distribution of fansubs by fansubbers won&#39;t stop till then. So glad \n&gt; though that someone is picking up the manga because that means the \n&gt; DVDs will be out soon, probably on or after fall this year. \n&gt; WAI!!! :O)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nSaitoh Worship\n~Anime Mystique~\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
