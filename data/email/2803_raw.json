I meant to make a suggestion.\n\nFrom th=\r\ne SHQ FILM/TV/ANIME/VID GAMES\n (http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm):\n&quot;I t=\r\nhink of this Okita as the young man with the flower fetish. We don&#39;t get bu=\r\nt a glimpse of \nhim, but he kiks some serious butt at the Ikedaya. It&#39;s a p=\r\nity Saitou intervened when that \nKami damned battousai showed up.&quot;\n\nPerhaps=\r\n that should be corrected?\n\nPS In the manga, it&#39;s also stated clearly durin=\r\ng the Kyoto Arc, that Kenshin didn&#39;t fight \nSaito or Okita until 1865.\n\n---=\r\n In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;onigiribeanie&quot; &lt;jungleguuchan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I h=\r\naven&#39;t looked at the OVA and anime introductions of the context of\n&gt; our in=\r\ntroduction to Himura the Battousai recently to even gauge\n&gt; whether histori=\r\ncally one is more accurate than the other.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, I think that beca=\r\nuse production of the animated series was\n&gt; occurring as Watsuki was still =\r\nrevealing the later Jinchuu arc and the\n&gt; events surround Tomoe that the co=\r\nrrect contiuity to work from is the\n&gt; OVA and the manga.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sur=\r\ne what your questions are about the Satsuma and Choshu from\n&gt; your post. We=\r\nre you trying to reconcile errors in the subtitles?  If\n&gt; it appeared as &quot;C=\r\nhoshi&quot; or &quot;Choshin,&quot; it probably should have read\n&gt; &quot;Choshu,&quot; &quot;Choushu,&quot; or=\r\n some permutation of those.   \n&gt; \n&gt; Welcome to the list, btw.  If you need =\r\nmore information on the Choshu,\n&gt; I can redirect you to a few links (althou=\r\ngh they are listed at the\n&gt; main Shinsengumi page) and communities.  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nS\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
