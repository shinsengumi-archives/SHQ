Wander on over to SHQ Spy Division and it&#39;s in the Story \nArchive under Files.  Title&#39;s &quot;Kitaku.&quot;  That&#39;s how I chose to move \nbetween the two broad timelines.  Then there&#39;s the VERY \nconfusing &quot;Nakushita Kikai&quot; that moves around different points in the \nsame day.  That&#39;s two examples of how it&#39;s done. (Degree of success \nis open to debate.)  Others have done it, too.  Anyone have any other \nexamples?\n\nphil\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, GCW &lt;saitohworship@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Really Phil?  you probably have a great storyline huh?  I started \nto write down ideas, then I thought up a plot so complicated it&#39;s \nalmost impossible to write it in a logical order.  Do you guys have \nany suggestions as to how to write a story where it takes place over \nlike 10 years?  and the setting jumps around like crazy too . . . do \nI just use lots of asterisks and dashes or maybe separate them into \nchapters - but there&#39;s a limit of 7.  Puhhleassse give me some tips, \nI&#39;ve never written anything so complicated before ^ ^;;; *wails*  one \nmore question - are the police offiers who worked with Saitoh in \nTokyo Boshin samurais?  How did they manage to not recognize Saitoh \nas a member of the Shinsengumi again?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m actually working on my Saitou-Holmes story.  Can&#39;t believe I \n&gt; actually hit on a beginning for it.
