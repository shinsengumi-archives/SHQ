I myself have \nnever read the manga only because I have the untranslated manga and \nam studying Nihon-go (little progress though). \n\nThat&#39;s kind of interesting that they&#39;d know about Fujita... Who \nleaked it? I wonder if it&#39;s a mistake by Watsuki since if those kind \nof rumors were up and about, being an undercover agent would be no \ngood. Come to think of it, Fujita going about as a policeman by day \nand then also going undercover on the side, it&#39;s a little weird for \nme.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if at this point in the manga, did it still matter? \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Same message, but with the repaired link...\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;ve been busily and happily (obsessively?) capturing images from \nthe RK manga (thanks to Grace!) of Saitou (up to 880, maybe 2/3 of \nthe way through the Jinchuu arc) and ran into this.  This is the \nfirst time I&#39;ve seen the manga in its original format and I&#39;m \nrunning into things that either I hadn&#39;t noticed before or had \nforgotten.  I don&#39;t remember the men in the Tokyo jail gossiping \nabout who Fujita really is.  Reminded me of discussions we&#39;ve had \nabout whether or not people in the department knew his true identity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve uploaded that portion of page 19 from chapter 218 \n&gt; (volume 25) of the manga into the Photos section.  Wasn&#39;t sure if \nit was appropriate to any of the folders, so it&#39;s just sitting there \non its own.
