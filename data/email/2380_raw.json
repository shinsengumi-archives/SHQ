Perhaps a little? &quot;Sonno-joi&quot; literally \nmeans &quot;Revere the Emperor&quot; and &quot;expel the barbarians.&quot; Everything I have read \nabout the slogan so far points to it having originated in Mito. (Possibly from \nTokugawa Nariaki himself?) But both &quot;barbarians&quot; and &quot;foreign devils&quot; were terms \ncommonly used to decribe foreigners at the time so it could have just as \neasily been worded the other way.  The feeling behind all of it was the same at \nany rate.\n\n-MissB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
