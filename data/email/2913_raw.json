Based on this, people have reasoned that\nhad it not been for Kinmon-no-Hen (for which Ikeda-ya\nhas been credited as one of the direct causes), Choshu\nwould have risen up earlier. \n\nThere is also the notion that Ikeda-ya (or\nKinmon-no-Hen rather) actually speeded up the\nBakumatsu: had it not been such a catalyst for Choshu\nto take action, then their rebellious politics might\nhave festered for much longer before coming to the\nboil. \n\nEither way, it was a matter of a few years earlier or\na few years later. Hope this helps. \n\nBest Wishes, \n\nMio. \n\n--- slvrgriffn &lt;meredith_hartley@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I know this is an old topic, but I&#39;m new and was\n&gt; catching up on old posts.\n&gt; First -- I AM in Utah in the Asian Studies program\n&gt; at a different\n&gt; university. There are MANY students in the program\n&gt; here who have\n&gt; become VERY interested in samurai of all periods.\n&gt; And, if you mention\n&gt;   Shin sen gumi in a room of Asian Studies Majors,\n&gt; you&#39;ll get a\n&gt; joyously heated discussion. IT IS ALIVE AND WELL IN\n&gt; UTAH. \n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, it&#39;s one subject of my abbreviated thesis\n&gt; (a series of\n&gt; shorter, 8-10 page papers written as an addendum to\n&gt; a Grad School\n&gt; Application and authorization to pursue publishing).\n&gt; I&#39;ve been work\n&gt; with the works of Hillsborough, Keene, Jansen,\n&gt; Craig, and Totman\n&gt; mainly, but I&#39;d love ANY help y&#39;all can give. I\n&gt; speak fluent Thai, but\n&gt; my Japanese is still hideously rudimentary. \n&gt; \n&gt; If y&#39;all could:\n&gt; I&#39;ve run into claims that the &quot;Ideda&#39;ya affair\n&gt; extended the war by two\n&gt; years at least&quot; more than 5 times, but I HAVEN&#39;T\n&gt; found an intelligible\n&gt; explanation of that claim. Hillsborough doesn&#39;t seem\n&gt; to buy it, and\n&gt; devotes a few paragraphs to it. The claim is\n&gt; popularly accepted, but\n&gt; I&#39;d like a data-based analysis of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas or sources, folks?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Meredith\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTry the all-new Yahoo!
