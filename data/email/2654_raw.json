Not a fighting game, but a dating game!  While this might\nbe an unconventional portrayal, it&#39;s a lot of -fun-, and not simply\nbecause the bishonen factor is high...  :)  The story focuses on\nSakuraba Suzuka, a young girl from Aizu who has trained in kendo.\nWanting to prove herself, she gets Teruhime&#39;s help and joins the\nShinsengumi.\n \nThe point of the game is to talk to and eventually gain the interest of\none of the guys.  Except for Suzuka, all of the characters in the game\nare actual historical figures - even including Shinsengumi members that\naren&#39;t as well known in the English fandom.  There has been one volume\nof manga released, in addition to novels and a variety of merchandise.  \n \nKizu and I have made a site dedicated to this game, &quot;Bakumatsu Renka\nShinsengumi no Koibito&quot; at  &lt;http://brs.hajimenokizu.com/&gt;\nhttp://brs.hajimenokizu.com.  Whether you heard of this game last year\nas news came from Japan or this is the first you&#39;ve seen of it, visit\nthe site to learn more!  We have a lot of information, and yes,\npictures.  ^__^  \n \n \n-SafetyGirl\n \n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
