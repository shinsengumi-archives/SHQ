Did other performances change \nyour perception=\r\n of their Shinsengumi role or is that performance so \nburned into your head=\r\n that it colors how you react to other roles?  \nAnyone who will forever BE =\r\nthat person in your head?\n&gt;    \n&gt; \n\n\n\nTaro Yamamoto (NHK Harada): Can&#39;t wat=\r\nch him in Battle Royale without \nseeing Sano - and I saw BR before NHK. Tar=\r\no just came in and made the \nrole of Sano *his*.  He is the only Sano that =\r\nstands out in my mind \n(other than Peacemaker Sano, but PMK is in a class o=\r\nf it&#39;s own!)\n\n\nMasato Sakai (NHK Yamanami):  Another case of the only actor=\r\n who \nreally stands out to me in his role.  He brought in an elegant, quiet=\r\n \nintesity.  For me, he is Yamanami.  \n\n\nTatsuya Fujiwara (NHK Okita):  Had=\r\n already seen him in BR.  Then NHK \nmade me a fan.  He didn&#39;t impress me at=\r\n the beginning of the series, \nbut his performance improved as the series w=\r\nent on and he grew into \nhis role.  Then I saw him in BRII and Sabu.  Still=\r\n a fan.  I can \nwatch Tatsuya in other roles and not see him as Souji. [As =\r\nan aside, \nif anyone&#39;s interested, Tatsuya is the lead in Death Note coming=\r\n out \nin Japan in June.  The manga is great if anyone&#39;s into that.  The \nmo=\r\nvie trailer is here  www.death-note-movie.com  Once you&#39;re in the \nroom, cl=\r\nick on the computer on the right.  There&#39;s also a movie \nposter on the wall=\r\n to click on and enlarge.]\n\n\nI also agree with what has been said about Jo =\r\nOdagiri and Shosuke \nTanihara.  \n\n\nIf anyone could make some viewing sugges=\r\ntions for any of these actors \nI&#39;d like to hear them.  Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
