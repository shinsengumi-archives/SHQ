Tha=\r\nt&#39;s why sometimes I get \nquestions \n&gt; like &quot;Is Saito killed at the end of t=\r\nhe Kyoto Arc?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Mary-Ann &lt;mary=\r\nannsfanfic@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a way to explain everythi=\r\nng and put an end to the growing confusion...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In volume 20 of RK (=\r\nnot animated unfortunately), which depicts Kenshin&#39;s past with \n&gt; Tomoe, yo=\r\nu can see a description of what happens at Ikedaya, from Kenshin&#39;s pov. As =\r\n\nwe \n&gt; see in that volume, Kenshin never intervened at Ikedaya, only becomi=\r\nng aware of the \n&gt; events once everything is over. He then assists to the S=\r\nhinsengumi &quot;parade&quot; and \nexchange \n&gt; a long look with Saito. Kenshin then t=\r\nhinks &quot;J&#39;ai l&#39;impression que je reverrai souvent cet \n&gt; homme...&quot; or if I&#39;m=\r\n translating from the French version &quot;I was under the impression that \nI \n&gt;=\r\n would often see that man in the future...&quot;, implying that they didn&#39;t knew=\r\n each other yet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then, in volume 21, once Tomoe is dead (sorry, if=\r\n I&#39;m spoiling that to anyone, but... \n&gt; where have you been?) Kenshin retur=\r\nns to Kyoto and soon engage in a duel with Saito \nfor \n&gt; the first time. Se=\r\neing him, Saito says &quot;Je me disais bien que ce n&#39;=C3=A9tait pas un sabreur =\r\n\n&gt; ordinaire... c&#39;=C3=A9tait donc cela&quot; or &quot;I thought he was no ordinary sw=\r\nordsman... this \nexplains \n&gt; it...&quot;, meaning that he just understood that t=\r\nhe man he saw in the crowd after Ikedaya is \n&gt; Battosai. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So knowi=\r\nng this, it then becomes clear that the scene in volume 7 (or episode 28) \n=\r\ndoes \n&gt; not happens at Ikedaya, like many people thinks, but WAY after Iked=\r\naya. It really is a \n&gt; common mistake as I&#39;ve also been under that impressi=\r\non for a long time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mary-Ann\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; nlf7 &lt;nlf7@&gt; wrote:    =\r\n                           Only one word has to be corrected, &quot; \nIkedaya.&quot; =\r\n\n&gt; Please refer to my original \n&gt; &gt;  message for more information.
