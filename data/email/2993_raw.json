( I&#39;m just cameback from Pluto !! he he he )\n   \n  Thank you so very much. Your Answer Help me so .\n  Seven sensei, Yes. I was asking about the Yakuza in the bakumatsu era.\n  Soshite, you said that, Shinsengumi was so loyal because they&#39;ve got paid, tteittakke??\n  But, in &quot;MibuGishiDen&quot;, why they look so poor ???\n  Another question..\n  Could anybody tell me, except &quot;Kiyokawa Hachirou/Serizawa Kamo&#39;s probs&quot;, are there another internal problem in Shinsengumi????\n   \n  thnxxxxx 4 the answer, sensei tachi !!!!\n  Ja ne\n   \n  _Rei_\n  \n\nSeven &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:\n          &gt; Seven, yakuza connections with the ultranationalists began \n&gt; more &quot;openly&quot; in the 1890s with the changing face of political \n&gt; parties during the Meiji era. Yakuza today still are considered to \n&gt; be right wing conservatives and use their money to support political \n&gt; candidates.\n\nNo disagreement there. :)\n\n&gt; Rei Shinoda was asking about the *Bakumatsu era, during which the \n&gt; yakuza had flourished (they were also doing very well much earlier). \n\nI wasn&#39;t sure which era Rei Shinoda was asking about. (I&#39;m more familiar with the history \nof the Yakuza in the Meiji era.)\n\n~Seven\n\n\n\n         \n\n \n---------------------------------\nGet your email and see which of your friends are online - Right on the  new Yahoo.com\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
