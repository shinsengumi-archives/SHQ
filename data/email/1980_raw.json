(or it&#39;s only me who has been panicked?)\n\nAs for the saving flash, there is a free and practical one here,\nhttp://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dl/win95/art/se175326.html\ncalled FLASH MANIA, but the problem is this one has only Japanese \nlanguage explanation.\n\nHowever, I try to put some explanation as this one is quite simple to use.\nAt first you put the link above to any translation site to find the \ndownload button.\n\nAnd once the soft is downloaded, and installed, started, you can see the \nblack screen with some buttons below.\n\nWhen you click on the button &quot;S&quot; of the search, you can see the list of \nflashes you&#39;ve downloaded. (So you can download at first any flash \nnormally on your browser) Then you can choose the flash you wish save and\nyou right clicked the chosen file. There are two option in Japanese but\nyou can see at least (S) for save and (D) for delete.\nChoosing (S) option you can save the file where you want on your PC.\nAnd the button &quot;O&quot; is open and &quot;M&quot; is misc.\n\nMay be I explain badly and it seems complicated, but once you do try it, \nit would be more simple and easy, I think.\nAnd I don&#39;t know for the Mac, sorry.\n\nTama\n\n\n\nktamae@... wrote:\n\n &gt;\n &gt; According to the announcement on the official &quot;Shinsengumi! &quot;site on NHK,\n &gt; they&#39;ll withdraw entire site at the end of January because of the\n &gt; copyright.\n &gt;\n &gt; Now it&#39;s time to save every stuff.( There are some soft which can save\n &gt; even\n &gt; flash thing)\n &gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
