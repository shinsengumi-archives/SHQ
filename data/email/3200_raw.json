Also, &quot;toko&quot; is ju=\r\nst an onomatopoeia used in Japanese folk songs)\n\nA rough translation:\n\n&quot;Lor=\r\nd Aizu Higo is Kyoto Protector\nThe Palace prospers, the nobles are relieved=\r\n\nAll is right with the world again&quot;\n\nSome people in Kyoto may have supporte=\r\nd Choshu, especially as time \nwent on, but think about it: how logical is i=\r\nt for &quot;most&quot; of the \nresidents of a city to like the people who go slinking=\r\n around at \nnight murdering, and who, given a chance, wanted to burn their =\r\ncity \nto the ground? This is not to excuse Aizu from blame: there was, for =\r\n\nexample, a recorded instance of Aizu men wanting to torch Nishi-\nHonganji =\r\nfor hiding Choshu runaways in 1864. (see \nhttp://homepage3.nifty.com/naitou=\r\nhougyoku/frame11/jinmei-ka.htm) \nHowever, the monk who was doing the hiding=\r\n, named Kawai Zenjun, was \nfrom Aizu, and reported the intent of those men =\r\nto the Aizu \nauthorities, who promptly reined them in. After all torching N=\r\nishi \nHonganji was a violation of Aizu&#39;s military codes, the Rules for \nCom=\r\nmanders and Rules For Soldiers (which Aizu had compiled half a \ncentury pre=\r\nviously)-- these codes clearly state that unnecessary \ndestruction of &quot;civi=\r\nlian&quot; property (such as Nishi Honganji) was \nprohibited. The codes appear i=\r\nn Japanese, together with others such \nas the Aizu house code, here: \nhttp:=\r\n//homepage3.nifty.com/naitouhougyoku/frame11/jinmei-ka.htm\n\n&gt;Could someone =\r\nhere help me and provide\n&gt; book citations?\n\nYes, I agree-- if anyone has a =\r\ncitation-- not simply a book title, \nbut an actual passage from a book, com=\r\nplete with a page number and \nbibliographic citation (title, author, publis=\r\nher, year)-- please \nshare it.\n\n\n"
