I think the problem \n&gt; was I typed something wrong. The correct url is:\n&gt; http://www.directcon.net/pharmer/Wakamatsu/Wakamatsu.html\n&gt; \n&gt; The name of the site is Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony at Gold \n&gt; Hill, California. If the url still won&#39;t work, then type the name \n&gt; into Yahoo. It will definitely come up that way.\n&gt; \n&gt; For those of you who are a bit confused, during the Boshin War a \nman \n&gt; named J. H. Schnell smuggled refugees out of Aizu and brought them \nto \n&gt; America. One was a young woman named Okei. They founded the \nWakamatsu \n&gt; Tea and Silk Company at Gold Hill in 1869 (near modern day \n&gt; Placerville, CA), but it folded after only two years. Everyone \nwent \n&gt; their seperate ways. Okei remained in the area as an employee of a \n&gt; local family. She seems to have died very young of tuberculosis \nand \n&gt; her grave is on a hill near where the community once existed.\n\n\nAlthough it may seldom become helpful, such pages exist. \n\nhttp://www.aizu-liaison.co.jp/liaison/rekisi/rekisi26.html\n\nhttp://www.aizu-liaison.co.jp/liaison/rekisi.html\n\nThe very first of the migration from Japan was the midst of Boshin \nwar in 1868.\nThey emigrated to Hawaii. \nThen, Japanese people emigrated to some countries. \nAlthough the reason of people who emigrated was various, there were \npeople who cannot live in Japan on the organization of a country \nhaving changed. \n\nEnomoto Takeaki escaped from Edo together with the Tokugawa navy, \nand went to Hokkaido. \nWhile they were staying in Sendai, the foreigner who calls the \ngovernment official of Hawaii came and he recommended them to defect \nto Hawaii. \nAlthough Enomoto considered it, he refused. \nIn fact, the foreigner was an arms merchant who does slave trade. \nIt seems that he was going to sell off Tokugawa&#39;s deserters as \nslaves. \nProbably, history of Japan was considerably different if Enomoto \ntrusted him.
