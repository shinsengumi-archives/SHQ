After serving a brief detention after the war, Sh=\r\nimada Kai\ncontinued to live in the Meiji era and left behind a record of\nSh=\r\ninsengumi activities.  From past discussions (this is from my memory\nmind y=\r\nou) he did not wish to seek government employment and this or\nmay not be co=\r\nnnected to his views on the new order.\n\nInside the http://www.shinsengumihq=\r\n.com website is a search bar in the\nupper left hand corner and if you type =\r\nin &quot;Shimada Kai&quot; every page on\nwhich his name appears should be pulled up f=\r\nor you to browse.\n\n--------[Extra Info]--------\n\nSome of Shimada Kai&#39;s writ=\r\ning is invaluable in terms of cross checking\nsome facts and Hirotada wrote =\r\na great summary comparing what Shimada\nsaid about the name &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; an=\r\nd perhaps a more likely explanation:\n\n&quot;What&#39;s in a Name?&quot;--Shimada Kai and =\r\nthe Question of Shinsengumi&#39;s\nName [return to top]\n\nby Hirotada Tokugawa(Sh=\r\nimazu Masayoshi)\n\nAccording to Shimada Kai&#39;s record, the name &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;=\r\n was received\nby the Buke-denso (Imperial Messengers) following the unit&#39;s\n=\r\nperformance on 8/18/Bunkyu 3. However, Tsuri Yoichi, in &quot;Doujidainin\nwo mit=\r\na Matsudaira Katamori&quot; (appearing in &quot;Matsudaira Katamori no\nSubete&quot;), poin=\r\nts out that after the incident, on the day that the\ngroup received the name=\r\n &quot;Shinsengumi,&quot; the buke-denso-- Nomiya\nSadanori and Asukai Masanori-- were=\r\n confined from meeting with anyone\non that day, since they were in the list=\r\n of 20 nobles in Sanjo\nChunagon Sanetomi&#39;s group who were similarly confine=\r\nd. &quot;Therefore,\nthere is no way,&quot; Tsuri says, &quot;that they could have been the=\r\nre to\nbestow the name of &#39;Shinsengumi&#39;. If we are to trust Shimada Kai&#39;s\nre=\r\ncord and believe they were the ones who bestowed the name, they\nwould have =\r\nhad to bestowed it prior to the 8/18 incident. Therefore it\nis more probabl=\r\ne that Katamori or one of the men close to him bestowed\nthe name instead.&quot;\n=\r\n\n(Tsuri Yoichi, Doujidainin wo mita Matsudaira Katamori, pp. 150-160 of\nMat=\r\nsudaira Katamori no Subete, Tsunabuchi Kenjo, ed.
