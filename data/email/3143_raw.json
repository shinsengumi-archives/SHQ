Ofcourse there should be the &quot;reverse&quot; that is Aizu official \nr=\r\necords on the Shinsengumi as well.\n- Aizu accounts by Yamakawa Hiroshi and =\r\nYamakawa Kenjiro (whose book \ndoes mention the shinsengumi---no shock there=\r\n both brothers knew \nSaitou)---yet both books would have a MULTITUDE of inf=\r\normants, \nendless voices but edited and compiled into one book with no clea=\r\nr \nlabel who told them what and when\n\nIn all the items listed above there w=\r\nill be first hand accounts and \nalso second hand accounts actually mixed in=\r\n.  \n\nHere is an example:  Kondou in a letter said that it seems that \nhomos=\r\nexual activities are being practiced amongst his men.  Did he \nhear or see =\r\nthis first hand?  Or did someone tell him?\n\nFor example Yamazaki may have h=\r\neard of something and noted it in his \nbook---but what did he SEE WITH HIS =\r\nOWN EYES? But it is still a \n*primary resource if you follow the definition=\r\n that it is a &quot;source \nof information that was created at or near the time =\r\nbeing \nstudied&quot;[wiki article].  \n\nThus what is important is evaluating sour=\r\nces.  Off the bat it is \ndifficult at times to even to ***categorize source=\r\ns---we just know \nto exercise caution.  We don&#39;t know who is more correct t=\r\nhan the \nother we should however track who is saying what, to whom and when=\r\n \nand if they have a personal interest in saying certain things.  \n\nAs Nlf7=\r\n and Kitsuno found=85there will be conflicting info.\n\nHowever a book with a=\r\n few errors may not be *entirely* innaccurate.\nFor instance if you open any=\r\n book on the Meiji era...it will likely \nsay that it was during the Meiji e=\r\nra when paper money was issued.  \nThat is absolutely wrong.  However the bo=\r\nok may have other pertinant \nfacts.\n\nDon&#39;t toss the incorrect information y=\r\net=85just note it all.  \nFor example you can say\nSamurai Z was born this ye=\r\nar (in resource A)\nHowever (resource B) says otherwise and (resource C) giv=\r\nes even more \ndifferent information.\n\nI have found in my own studies that o=\r\nver time you will figure out \n*why there are errors.\n\nAt the bottom of this=\r\n page are some words of wisdom from a really \nstellar resaercher who has &quot;s=\r\neen it all&quot; in regards to Meiji Era \nrevisionism which has negatively affec=\r\nted the study of the Bakumatsu\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/shinsenresearch=\r\n.html\n\n\n\n"
