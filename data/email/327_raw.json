I&#39;ve been eyeing that site for TOO \nlong now. Still trying to decide whether actually buying from jpqueen \nis better than buying from www.sasugabooks.com. I mean the price per \ntankoubon is high like 5-6 USD but it&#39;s new and shipping is slightly \nlower and I&#39;ll get it faster unlike Jpqueen. But I don&#39;t know there&#39;s \nso many other things I want to buy from jpqueen like manga \nanthologies, doujinshis... They have better prices but shipping kills \nthe deal... We need to get a &quot;Japanese connection&quot; so to speak. You \nknow a person who can bid for us in yahoo japan, scour the streets \nfor doujinshis and tankoubons dealing with Saitou and the \nShinsengumi. While he/she is at it, we might as well ask that person \nto find us movies, figures, and possibly &quot;historical&quot; novelties... \n\n*Dear Lord... We already have very good language translators... Now \nall we need is another person to do our shopping for us in Japan*\n\nOh for those people who have been looking for Japanese historical \nbooks per se, sasugabooks has a better collection than Amazon albeit \nthe price...\n\n~wounds\n\n\n"
