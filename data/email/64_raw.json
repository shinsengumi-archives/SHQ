One of his students posted in other\nforums and mentioned low light training and outdoor training on\nhills/incline which I found to be fascinating and perhaps unorthodox\nin the world of mainstream kendo.\n\nI recall posting about the Tennen Rishin Ryu video and Serizawa\nmentioned that it isn&#39;t that great...if Tennen Rishin Ryu is going the\n way of many lineages which are arguably waning to put it lightly then\nclassical kendo may be the only shot in the study/preservation of the\nmartial arts the Shinsengumi practiced.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shimazu Masayoshi&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Kotaka-sensei&#39;s site was one of the first I encountered when I became\n&gt; introduced to the Shinsengumi. I admire his grit and resolve, but in\n&gt; many respects he came across as a bitter old man.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d really, really love to see his kenjutsu in action, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; --M.\n\n\n"
