There is a Temple dedicated to th=\r\nis, and blind women dedicated to contact the departed souls (on behalf of a=\r\n small  fee) Also, it&#39;s one of the three main gathering places for shamans =\r\nin Japan. Somehow, I can see PMK Saitou having a picninc day here... or a v=\r\nery busy schedule attending departed souls with messages to deliver...\n \nHe=\r\nre is some info on the place if someone is interested...\n\n \n\nOsore-san\n    =\r\nOsorezan, on the Shimokita peninsula of eastern Aomori Prefecture, is one o=\r\nf Japan&#39;s most prominent sainokawara (banks of the underworld river Sai), a=\r\n sulphurous landscape believed to hover between the world of the living and=\r\n the world of the dead.This mountain scared people so much that its name be=\r\ncame the Japanese word for =91dread=92.  It=92s a desolate, hellish place t=\r\nhat smells of sulfur and has attractions like =91The Lake of Blood=92.  \n\nT=\r\nhough the temple was founded in the ninth century, Osore-zan was already re=\r\nvered in ancient folk religion as a place where dead souls gather, and it&#39;s=\r\n easy to see why - the desolate volcanic landscape, with its yellow- and re=\r\nd-stained soil, multicolored pools and bubbling, malodorous streams, makes =\r\nfor a truly unearthly scene. The temple also receives a steady trickle of n=\r\non-spectral visitors, but during the summer festival (July 20-24) people ar=\r\nrive in force to contact their ancestors or the recently deceased through t=\r\nhe mediation of itako, usually blind, elderly women who turn a profitable t=\r\nrade. During the open season (May-Oct) six buses a day run up to the temple=\r\n from Mutsu (35min; =A5750); note that the last bus leaves Osore-zan at 4.4=\r\n5pm.\n\nFrom Mutsu, the road to Osorezan-Bodaiji winds through pine forests, =\r\npast a succession of stone monuments and a spring where it&#39;s customary to s=\r\ntop for a sip of purifying water. At the top you emerge by a large lake bes=\r\nide which a small humped bridge represents the journey souls make between t=\r\nhis world and the next; it&#39;s said that those who led an evil life will find=\r\n it impossible to cross over. After a quick look round the temple, take any=\r\n path leading over the hummock towards the lake&#39;s barren foreshore. The lit=\r\ntle heaps of stones all around are said to be the work of children who died=\r\n before their parents. They have to wait here, building stupas, which demon=\r\ns gleefully knock over during the night - most people add a pebble or two i=\r\nn passing. Jizo, the guardian deity of children and the bodhisattva charged=\r\n with leading people to the Buddhist Western Paradise, also comes along to =\r\nscare away the demons, though it seems with less success. Sad little statue=\r\ns, touchingly wrapped in\n towels and bibs, add an even more melancholy note=\r\n to the scene. Many have offerings piled in front of them: bunches of flowe=\r\nrs, furry toys - faded and rain-sodden at the end of summer - and plastic w=\r\nindmills whispering to each other in the wind.\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\n--------------------=\r\n-------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
