Plus, Nakamura Shichinosuke (the actor who played him) is a\nreal Kabuki actor, so it felt all the more realistic.\n\nI&#39;m sorry if I flew off the handle. It&#39;s just that...for some reason,\nI feel acutely aware of the pain and humiliation that the Tokugawa and\ntheir retainers must have felt at being &quot;outcasts&quot; and &quot;enemies of the\nCourt&quot;, when it really had nothing to do with the Court, and\neverything to do with Choshuu and Satsuma&#39;s efforts for\nself-advancement. Again, I&#39;m sorry I lost control. As a\nhistorian-in-training, it&#39;s OK to feel emotional, but I realize that I\nhave to train myself to be able to better keep my cool.\n\n( :::Hugs imaginary Ayu-nee plushie::: ) I&#39;m much better now...^_^\n\n--M.\n\n\n"
