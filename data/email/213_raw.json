I\n  haven&#39;t had the honor nor the pleasure to meet him in\n  person, but I have seen him (in videotape) performing\n  some Suio Ryu katas and it was pretty impressive.\n\n\n  &gt; From this, I could see the truth behind the word.\n  &gt; Bushido is not what is written in books about the\n  &gt; samurai code, the way a samurai is supposed to\n  &gt; conduct himself, it&#39;s true meaning is simply in the\n  &gt; way of combat, the way of the warrior. \n\n\n  Well, since you drew such conclusion after the literal\n  analysis of the kanji (ideograms) for &quot;Bushido&quot;, I\n  suggest you doing the same with the kanji for\n  &quot;Samurai&quot;. It&#39;s pretty curious :)\n\n\n  Serizawa Kamo\n\n  __________________________________\n  Do you Yahoo!?\n  Yahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online.
