You know its really hard to go up and ask \n&gt; knowledgeable people...they&#39;ll probably give you weird looks \n&gt; understandably...have you searched on e-budo.com the guys there \n&gt; probably discussed all scenarios and possibilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Okita Souji&quot; &lt;okita_souji@o...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; One other thing I remembered, was there are a few ways to \ndisembowel \n&gt; oneself\n&gt; that i&#39;ve heard about. There&#39;st the regular stab and cut across, \nbut \n&gt; thers&#39;s\n&gt; others that involve manipulating the knife up or down in addition \nto \n&gt; cutting\n&gt; across. Sounds even more gruesome....\n\n\nI don&#39;t understand how cutting the intestines would be the wrong way \nSec... Did you read that somewhere? I would imagine that cutting all \nthe way to the stomach&#39;s intestines would mean a more assured/faster \nway to die, wouldn&#39;t that be the preference or is it required that \nyou be conscious for as long as possible when committing seppuku? \nSounds harsh to me either way....\n\nOkita, as for falling backwards /forwards in the country where I came \nfrom (*wink*) the national hero (Jose Rizal) made it a point to be \nexecuted forwards by twisting himself as he got shot (indicating he \nis not a traitor) and to ensure he fell backwards towards the sky \n(another symbolism of his innocence and hopes for the future). It \nmight be a different case, just thought you&#39;d like to know.\n\n\n"
