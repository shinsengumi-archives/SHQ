Appeare=\r\nntly, those photos have no way of being proven that it was Okita.   As far =\r\nas I&#39;ve read, there is no knowledge that Okita ever did pose for a photogra=\r\nph (itwould be good if someone could answer this for me).\n\nThats not to say=\r\n the photo isn&#39;t him... its more like I&#39;m in the same boat as you are and h=\r\nave no clue whether that really was him or not.    \n\n\n_____________________=\r\n_____________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
