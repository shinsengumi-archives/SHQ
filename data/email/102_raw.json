Are you planning on writing for the SH meets SH fanfic challenge?  Oh yeah, I &#39;ve been wanting to ask this for a long time.  What exactly was the Boshin war?  I&#39;ve been so confused between all the battle names that I probably got them wrong on my fanfic.  Was it the same as the Meiji revolution, just another name?
