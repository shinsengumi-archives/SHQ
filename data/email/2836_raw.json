However, I&#39;d like to bring a detail to your attention.\n\nYou c=\r\norrected the entry, saying that Aizu was besieged in September\n1868, to say=\r\ning that it was besieged in October 1868. I presume you\nmeant the beginning=\r\n of the siege. In this case, you are correct.\n\n&quot;On the morning of the 23rd =\r\nday of the 8th month, the new government&#39;s\narmy quickly broke through Takiz=\r\nawa Pass and arrived at the castle\ntown.&quot; (page 176 of &quot;Aizu-han&quot;, by Noguc=\r\nhi Shin&#39;ichi)\n\n23rd day of the 8th (lunar) month. That being the case, if y=\r\nou now use\nhttp://www.astro.sendai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv, and put in=\r\n the\ndate of &quot;1868/8/23&quot;, and select the lower option to convert from lunar=\r\n\nto solar calendar, and then click on the button on the lower right of\nthe =\r\ngreen box, that translates to, in our modern calendar: October 8,\n1868. You=\r\n are correct in saying October for the *start* of the siege;\nobviously, the=\r\n article says &quot;they were eventually besieged at Tsuruga\nCastle, the seat of=\r\n the Aizu domain, in October 1868.&quot; Besieged, not\ndefeated; so again, that&#39;=\r\ns absolutely correct.\n\nHowever, those who read this article should be mindf=\r\nul that the siege\ndid not end overnight; according to the timeline that app=\r\nears on page\n15 of the text &quot;Sendai Boshin Senshi&quot; (written by Fujiwara Ain=\r\nosuke in\n1911), as well as the timeline that appears on page 237 of the\ntim=\r\neline compiled by Itou Tetsuya in &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no\nSubete&quot;, th=\r\ne date for the surrender of Aizu is the 23rd day of the 9th\nlunar month, 18=\r\n68. Another source, page 182 of text &quot;Aizu-han&quot;, gives\nthe date one day ear=\r\nlier-- the 22nd day of the 9th lunar month, 1868,\nas being the date when, a=\r\ns the text says (I&#39;m quoting directly here):\n&quot;Shin-seifugun to no kyouryoku=\r\n ga nari, tsui ni kugatsu nijuuninichi,\nroujou ikkagetsu nishite koufuku to=\r\n kimatta.&quot; Translated, that reads\n&quot;After negotiation with the new governmen=\r\nt&#39;s army, the surrender was\ndecided for the 22nd day of the 9th month, afte=\r\nr the siege that lasted\na month.&quot;\n\n22nd or 23rd, it doesn&#39;t matter much. Tw=\r\no other sources say 9/23, and\nas the siege started on the 23rd of the 8th l=\r\nunar month, and Noguchi\nsays &quot;after a siege that lasted a month&quot;, I will go=\r\n with the 23rd.\n\nThat being the case, if you again use\nhttp://www.astro.sen=\r\ndai-c.ed.jp/cgi-bin/mooncal/conv, and put in the\ndate of &quot;1868/9/23&quot; and us=\r\ne the same method to convert it, that\ntranslates to, in our modern calendar=\r\n: November 6, 1868.\n\nYou were right to correct the start date of the siege =\r\nfrom September\nto October, however, the siege did take a month in the lunar=\r\n calendar,\nand just under a month by the Western calendar, to end. I don&#39;t =\r\nsay\nthis to lecture anybody, I merely respectfully wish to bring correct\nin=\r\nformation to people&#39;s attention-- just as you wish to bring correct\ninforma=\r\ntion to people.\n\nAgain, please accept my thanks for your efforts.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"
