(like a friend or something) Because the second shows them &quot;an act of kindness&quot; in ending their suffering after cutting open their stomach. Have you read or heard anything similar? \n\nFor women, i&#39;ve read that seppuku is a bit different and involves severing the arteries in the neck. \n\nBtw, the pointing to the stomach with a fan, an example of that is shown in Lone Wolf and Cub when the child had to commit seppuku but had to use the fan because he was too young to use a knife to cut himself open. \n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, May 20, 2004 9:56 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Topic from Wounds~Beheading Decapitation\n\n\n  {{{{WARNING}}}}\n  VERY VERY VERY \n  Grisly stuff ahead...leave now if you don&#39;t like this stuff\n\n  The original post from our member &quot;Wounds&quot;\n  http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm2.showMessage?topicID=48.topic\n\n  in regards to Kondou&#39;s execution\n\n  I read ~years~ ago that there is more than one way to do this\n\n  like in cutting all things with the sword you kind of concentrate on\n  using the first 1/3 of the blade (don&#39;t count the hilt), starting from\n  the tip. This has to do with the physics of the swing etc etc...the\n  part of the blade you want to use is really easy to see on a kendo\n  shinai as there is rope/leather which &quot;bind&quot; the bamboo and basically\n  divide the the blade into &quot;parts&quot; so to speak.  \n\n  Unlike an execution, in seppuku the &quot;second&quot; who beheads the person\n  does not cut all the way through...he will cut in far enough to read\n  the skin at the front of the neck and pull the blade out which will\n  prevent the head from simply &quot;falling&quot; on the ground (this happens in\n  a split second)...over time ritual suicide etiquette/procedures will\n  change to the point the person who commits suicide can mere point to\n  his stomach with a fan and the second will do his job...without the\n  person disemboweling himself.\n\n  There was a detailed account I read on how in an execution the person\n  doing the beheading is going for a certain point on the vertebra (this\n  is common sense since he is cutting through...) but ~how~ one can\n  accomplish this is beyond me...the point is they wanted the center\n  between the base of the neck and shoulder...note that the best swords\n  can cut through 2-3 corpses (according to accounts of testing swords).\n\n  In the film Shinsengumi! BAnd of Assasins (starring Toshiro)...Kondou\n  holds up his poney tail so the executioner can do his job...to me that\n  seems weird...it would&#39;ve made more sense to tie his hair up rather\n  than hold his hair with his hand....in anycase none of the stuff I\n  read really discusses the hair of the person about to be executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n  visit \n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n  our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
