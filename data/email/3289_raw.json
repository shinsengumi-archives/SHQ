During my seemingly never-ending\nt=\r\nravels, I had the opportunity to see an exhibit on the famed artist\ncouple,=\r\n Ike Taiga and Tokuyama Gyokuran, at the Philadelphia Museum of\nArt. The co=\r\nuple, natives of Kyoto, lived in the mid to late 1700s, and\nwere skilled ar=\r\ntists of the nanga genre. That&#39;s nanga, not manga--\nnanga are &quot;southern dra=\r\nwings,&quot; manga are &quot;sequential drawings.&quot;\nAnyway, I went to this exhibit, an=\r\nd after several hours inside, I saw\nsomething that made my jaw drop.\n\nIt wa=\r\ns a set of doors, depicting West Lake, a traditional topic for\nChinese and =\r\nJapanese artists alike, painted by Gyokuran, Taiga&#39;s wife.\nNow, that would =\r\nall be fine and good, except these doors came from\nKonkai-komyoji, her fami=\r\nly temple. Now what, you may ask, is the\nsignificance of Konkai-komyoji?\n\nI=\r\nt was the headquarters for the Aizu clan in Kyoto. Shinsengumi,\nespecially =\r\nKondou, went there OFTEN.\n\nThink about it. These doors were probably seen w=\r\nhen Matsudaira\nKatamori, lord of Aizu, entered the place, and may have been=\r\n mute\nwitnesses to the decision to take Shinsengumi under Aizu command.\nNag=\r\nakura, when he went to the temple to appear before Matsudaira\nKatamori and =\r\ncensure Kondou, might have sat next to them. Kondou\nhimself might have walk=\r\ned right through them. Kondou also may have sat\nnear them when receiving th=\r\ne formal awards from Lord Matsudaira, in\nrecognition for Shinsengumi&#39;s work=\r\n at Ikedaya. Or they might have been\nin a less prominent place, but perhaps=\r\n still seen as our boys passed\nby. Or not seen at all, though I doubt that =\r\nthe doors, painted as they\nwere by a famed artist, would be in a place that=\r\n was not prominent.\n\nIt was unreal. A security guard walked up to me and co=\r\nmmented that I\nlooked like I really loved the exhibit, because apparently I=\r\n&#39;d been\ninside for hours. I was so moved that I had to go two days in a row=\r\n,\njust to look at it again and picture our boys. They probably saw it\nwith =\r\ntheir own eyes. This set of 4 doors, now hanging on a wall in\nPhiladelphia.=\r\n..\n\nI will never forget those visits to the art museum as long as I live.\nW=\r\nhen I lived in Japan I got to see places where Shinsengumi had been,\nsuch a=\r\ns Matsushima Bay, Nijo Castle, the Imperial Palace, Hiroshima,\nOsaka...but =\r\nseeing those doors was different. They weren&#39;t a place,\nthey were a thing. =\r\nA tangible object, that had crossed the ocean and\nwhich I had encountered w=\r\nithout even knowing.\n\nIt&#39;s too bad the exhibit closed on Sunday. It would h=\r\nave been so nice\nif it was more permanent, so those of you (predominantly i=\r\nn the US)\nable to do so could make the trip to Philadelphia to see the door=\r\ns.\n\nIn short, the history came alive in that set of somewhat\nunremarkable-l=\r\nooking, painted, sliding doors. And that is why, dear\nmembers, history comp=\r\nels me.\n\n-M.\n\n\n"
