Although there is no\n&gt; mention to S=\r\nhinsengumi, there are some tidbits of\n&gt; information about Boshin War and th=\r\ne Aizu fief, from\n&gt; the Aizu point of view. It&#39;s also interesting to read\n&gt;=\r\n a bit about Saigo Tanomo and the rendition of Aizu.\n&gt; Not to mention some =\r\nrare pictures taken at the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, by the way, yes, there MAY be a c=\r\nonnection with\n&gt; Shinsengumi. One of the associates of Aizu-kai is a\n&gt; cert=\r\nain Fujita Tsutomu, which sounds suspiciously like\n&gt; Fujita Goro(Saito Haji=\r\nme)&#39;s son. If one finds out that\n&gt; Saito Hajime&#39;s son was in the Army (Lt. =\r\nColonel, if\n&gt; I&#39;m not mistaken) in 1928, then chances are that this\n&gt; Fujit=\r\na Tsutomu is indeed Saito&#39;s son.\n\nHello Serizawa, thank you for your inform=\r\nation.  Oh we put you on the \nthank you list on the new site as well (^_^).=\r\n  For new members here, \njust so you know Serizawa has been very generous t=\r\no us over these \nmany years and we are happy to hear form him when he has t=\r\nhe time to \nwrite to us.\n\n1928 it is really a critical year and I think alo=\r\nt of surviving 1st \nor second generation Aizu folks became very ACTIVE.  Be=\r\ncause of the \nmarriage between Matsudaira Setsuko (granddaughter of Matsuda=\r\nira \nKatamori and Prince Chichibu---brother of Emperor Hirohito).  The \ninf=\r\normation we posted on the SHQ site for a long time now is about \nhow in 192=\r\n8, Fujita Goro&#39;s sword (one of perhaps no doubt many he \nowned) was made a =\r\ngift during this important wedding.\n\nYamakawa was a key figure in this wedd=\r\ning and discussed the matter \nwith Matsudaira TSuneo (son of Matsudaira Kat=\r\namori).  SO we can see \nhow one generation of retainers...carries his dutie=\r\ns over regardless \nof era.\n\n1928 is also year of the EArth Dragon.  Interes=\r\ntingly...similar to \nThe Boshin War of 1868.  It is just a coincedence...ma=\r\nybe.  The \nImperial wedding was meant to also symbolize a reincorporation o=\r\nf \nAizu back into the mainstream (politically).\n\nSince we know Fujita Tsuto=\r\nmu and Matsudaira Tsuneo were actually \nfriends I sort of would like to thi=\r\nnk that the possibility is very \nvery high that indeed &quot;Fujita Tsutomu&quot; is =\r\nGOro and Tokio&#39;s oldest son.\n(^_^) but by 1928 he would be long retired fro=\r\nm the army...maybe they \nincluded his last rank or something?\n\nAizukai kaih=\r\no?? (Report of the Aizu Society)---this could be the same \nmagazine likely.=\r\n..it is so valuable to us.  \n\nFor example although it is not connected to t=\r\nhe Shinsengumi, this \nmagazine contains narratives you WILL NOT FIND IN ENG=\r\nLISH AT ALL.  We \ncan read the best books in English and it can tell us the=\r\n politics, \nthe international diplomacy, the statistics but rarely a human =\r\n\nnarrative.\n\nFor example a narrative by a woman on what happened in the war=\r\n \n(specifically at Aizu).\n\nI was close to obtaining Kinoko Takamine, &quot;Takam=\r\nine Kinokojiden,&quot; \nAizukai kaiho (April 1970). But ultimately I failed.\n\nI =\r\nwanted to read about how a mother (widowed) was trying to survive \nthrough =\r\nthese hard times.  \n\nTakamine Kinoko&#39;s relation to Takagi Tokio (Fujita Tok=\r\nio) was that of \nan aunt and no doubt was a maternal figure to Tokio, this =\r\nis a story \nTakamine Kinoko would relate to female survivors of Aizu (such =\r\nas \nTokio).\n\n\n"
