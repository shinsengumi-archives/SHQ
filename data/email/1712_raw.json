Here&#39;s my vote:\n&gt; Hajime Saitou: PMK version, RK one is nice too but the PMK version \nis \n&gt; more softer and I like that.\n&gt; Souji Okita: PMK version hands down, I don&#39;t liket he way they \n&gt; portrayed him in PK as a stupid looking little kid.\n&gt; Susumu Yamazaki: PMK I&#39;ve only seen him in this particular series \nso \n&gt; I vote this version best.\n&gt; Keisuke Yamanami: PMK again as I&#39;ve only seen him in this series I \n&gt; can only vote for this version of him.\n&gt; Isami Kondou: PMK I don&#39;t liek the way he&#39;s sometimes portrayed as \n&gt; old and fat in live action so I choose PMK for the liveliness they \n&gt; gave him in it.\n&gt; Sanosuke Harada: PMK because of the comedy factor totally.\n&gt; Toshizo Hijikata: PMK I don&#39;t like how they prtray him as an \n&gt; overpowering jerk with no sense of humor in the live actions I&#39;ve \n&gt; seen so I have to vote for the cool one in the anime PMK.\n&gt; Shinpachi Nagakura: PMK for the comedy routine he, Sanosuke and \n&gt; Heisuke get into.\n&gt; Heisuke Toodou: Is he even real? Oh well since I&#39;ve only seen him \nin \n&gt; PMK I vote for the PMK version.\n&gt; Well here&#39;s my votes, what&#39;re yours?\n\nHmmm...\n\nKondou - either NHK or Keppuroku... I like the younger version in \nNHK. I think he&#39;s cute.. but as a leader Keppuroku I think is better. \nThe quiet strong type.\n\nHijikata - I like Keppuroku a lot. Very good right hand man I think.\n\nOkita - Keppuroku again wins. He&#39;s not much like a kid which I really \nlike\n\nSaitou - No one will ever beat Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s Saitou..\n\nHarada - PMK!!! Funny!\n\nTodou - PMK!!! Funny\n\nNagakura - NHK is good. I like that he is serious and strong unlike \nPMK where he is like a runt...\n\nYamanami - I LOVE NHK version... He is very lovable... Although \nKeppuroku comes a close second....\n\n~wounds\n\n\n\n\n"
