In my \narea the local law enforcement agencies frequently change the paint jobs of \ntheir patrol cars for the exact same reason. \n\nOn another note, I ran across a reference which stated that the reason the \nShinsengumi uniform was blue was because this was the color that the 47 ronin \nwhen committing seppuku?!
