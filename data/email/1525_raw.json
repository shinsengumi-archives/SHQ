As for the \ngravestone, I&#39;ll think over to find the best way to share with you guys. \nI&#39;d like to respect those people&#39;s soul and I wont forget a prayer when I&#39;ll \nvisit the place, however personally I think their gravestones have also \nhistorical value and it would be regrettable if I wont show them for you who having \nreal interest in these people&#39;s lives.\nAny suggestion or opinion about this are welcome.\n\n\nSerizawa san\nI&#39;m not Aizu people, living mostly in Tokyo when I&#39;m in Japan.\n\nAnd more OT staff for all\nI don&#39;t know if you are watching the olympic game, but if you have the chance \nto see the final of synchronized swimming, in free routine section, my \ncompatriot will show the performance which has the theme of &quot;Bushido&quot;, apparently \ninspired by &quot;Last Samurai&quot;.
