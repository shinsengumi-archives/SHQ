Fortunatly, they happen\nto know about the Shinsengumi (one lady definately knew about S.H.\nbased on the film Mibugishiden because I heard her say Sato \nHiroshi---the name of the actor who played S.H. in the film---I&#39;m\npretty sure) and so they were flipping through the book and chattering\namongst themselves for a while and I was just standing there like the\nidiot that I am...I didn&#39;t want to impose and say &quot;translate this\nnow!&quot; (Like we do to Serizawa Kamo and Shimazuryu)...of all the pics\nthey picked out ones of where Saitou lived before finding work in Tokyo...\n\np.147 +148 (Shimazuryu if you are interested) pic shows a forest and\nthe 2nd shows an empty field (used to have houses)\n\np.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern building\nused as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it\nwasn&#39;t a prison/jail but a &quot;place where people could not leave until\nthey know they did wrong&quot;...so I was trying to ask her if he committed\na crime or did something &#39;bad&#39; (robbery, murder etc) of some sort and\nshe said &#39;no&#39; and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he was\na police officer?  And I was like &quot;yes&quot; (so the pages must deal w/\nFujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word &quot;discipline&quot; and so\nshe was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,\ndisciplinary issue and this detention center that he &quot;stayed&quot; at.  I\nkept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like yes\nhe stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he WORKED\nthere...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because if you\nthink about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a\nprison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he was\nformerly &quot;disciplined&quot; for something...because I trying really hard to\nbe sure that he wasn&#39;t just a prison guard but she was trying to\ncommunicate that he did something &#39;bad&#39; but not &#39;criminal&#39;.\n\nGeez...maybe there is something to S.H. being a &quot;psycho-cop&quot; as Misao\nsaid -_-\n\nWill scan pics when I can get to a scanner.\n\n\n"
