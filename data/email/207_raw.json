What is the sleeveless jacket-type garment called... the part of the uniform that was red & lined with grey?  And the headband or bandana (is one English term more appropriate?) that they & others wore, does it have a more proper term?  If it doesn&#39;t have an official label as part of a uniform, what would be the Japanese word for it?\n \nMany thanks in advance!\nphil\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
