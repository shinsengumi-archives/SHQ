In the past a handfu=\r\nl of members had a \nposting frenzy during the early ears of SHQ and it misl=\r\ned people to \nthink that we were trying to impose our will on the many (whi=\r\nch \nwasn&#39;t the case)---so we essentially stopped and wanted people to \ndire=\r\nct the conversation.\n\nPlease be sure she reads our recommended list here\nht=\r\ntp://www.shinsengumihq.com/bibliography.html\n\nthe solid text on teh origins=\r\n of the SHinsengumi and their hometown\nSteele, M. William. Alternative Narr=\r\natives in Modern Japanese History.\nNew York: Routledge Curzon, 2003.Isbn 04=\r\n15305705\nsummarized here http://www.shinsengumihq.com/farmersofedo.html\nSte=\r\nele is the only guy who laid a really good groundwork on the \ndynamic backg=\r\nround of Tama and its politics in the Meiji Era too (^_^)\n\nOther than Hills=\r\nborough&#39;s book I *urge* her to read KINSE SHIRIAKU: A \nHISTORY OF JAPAN whi=\r\nch mentions the Shinsengumi and is pretty \ndetailed up until the very end o=\r\nf the war. Kinse is a good companion \nto Boyer, Samuel Pellman, 1839-1875. =\r\nNaval Surgeon; The Diary of Dr. \nSamuel Pellman Boyer. Edited by Elinor Bar=\r\nnes and James A. Barnes. \nIntrod. by Allan Nevins. Bloomington, Indiana Uni=\r\nversity Press [1963] \nif she wants to take a peek at the Hakodate/Hokkaido =\r\ntheatre of 1869.\n\nHirotada Tokugawa, a member here, could recommend a numbe=\r\nr of solid \nbooks in Japanese on the Bakumatsu (these are not the flimsy te=\r\nxts on \nthe era printed during the height of SHinsengumi popularity---but \n=\r\nacademic texts)...and those books also approach teh Shinsengumi \nmaturely. =\r\n I don&#39;t know how long Ms. Hearn has studied Japanese but I \nthink she is l=\r\nucky to have you to help with some research. So if she \ndoes give the Shins=\r\nengumi a cameo role it would be an interesting \nepisode (^_^).  Fans here a=\r\nre pretty familiar with &quot;Robot Shinsengumi \nwhose job was to Kill. Kill. an=\r\nd Kill some more&quot; and we know better.  \nI know she writes fiction/fantasy w=\r\nhich frees her from all the \nhistorical details but still based on the popu=\r\nlarity of her work I \nthink people like her complex characterizations, and =\r\neven the bad \nboys in blue can offer alot of that. \n\nKitsuno:\n&quot;Also, Haverf=\r\nord College has a huge collection of Anna Hartshorne&#39;s\n&gt; letters - I got ab=\r\nout 10 of them copied and sent to me, hoping to \nget information on her lif=\r\ne, but they were mostly letters written to \nher -one appeared to be a love =\r\nletter, and another one mentioned \nTsuda Ume, and also Inazo Nitobe. &quot; \n\nIf=\r\n you and your co-editor have not already finished the book...and I \nthink y=\r\nou have....you will like THE ATTIC LETTERS compiled by \nstudents at TSUDA C=\r\nOLLEGE...those letters Ume wrote to her American \nmother could give a good =\r\nparallel account to any info you had on \nHartshorne and would fill in the b=\r\nlanks or atleast lay a foundation \nfor the world in which ACH worked.  But =\r\nif you read it already, just \nignore my rant.\n\nThe problem I have with the =\r\nAttic Letters was that it was not indexed \n(really that detailed without an=\r\n index is sad) and CENSORED by \nstudents desperate to preserve an &quot;image&quot; o=\r\nf Ume (really Ume was a \ngood/normal human being, it is totally unnecessary=\r\n for them to do \nthis).  This is the same problem we have with some Shinsen=\r\ngumi \nresearch...the need to white wash -or- the other extreme can be seen =\r\n\nwith Hillsborough, the obsession with painting them to be nothing but \nvil=\r\nlains.  Nothing like good ole&#39; bias to stand in the way of a fair \ninquiry.=\r\n\n\nIf you visit Japan...just go to the TSUDA COLLEGE collections and \ndon&#39;t =\r\ntell them you research Hartshorne...otherwise that would tip \nthem off.  Ju=\r\nst &quot;mix&quot; your research and request access to alot of \nstuff. Even if the bo=\r\nok comes out next year, maybe you can still \ncontinue ACH research because =\r\nyou have insight into her! (^__^)\n\n&quot;Love Letter&quot; then you are lucky Haverfo=\r\nrd didn&#39;t put a restriction \non the collection...it was probably a cute let=\r\nter yeah?  (*^_^*).  \nThe historical society where I work and other places =\r\nmust honor \nfamily restrictions and time extensions on privacy (30, 50 year=\r\ns \netc). So it was very kind of the Hartshornes not to have done that.  \nSi=\r\nnce Tsuda was essentially Hartshorne&#39;s &quot;boss&quot;, I assume that more \nACH mate=\r\nrial will discuss not only Tsuda but also Yamakawa Sutematsu \na key figure =\r\nof the school.\n\nKitsuno:\n&quot;You can find the collection with a google search =\r\non anna \nhartshorne ...it was $10 plus 25 cents per page. One problem is th=\r\nat \nsince they are hand written, they are hard to read, at least for \nme.&quot; =\r\n \n\nyes, as I mentioned in my previous reply, one can spend easily \nhundreds=\r\n of dollars on acquiring primary material and many places \nwill not let you=\r\n take in a digital camera to photograph letters etc.  \nActually I&#39;m pretty =\r\nsure Hirotada and I have spent easily hundreds of \ndollars, and I spent...w=\r\nell weeks scanning books in Japanese. I&#39;ve \ndone alot of research using Eng=\r\n. handwritten material...you would \nthink that back in the day when they to=\r\nok penmanship classes they \nwould try to make their cursive look more than =\r\nlines across a page....\n\nAlso if you ever come across Hartshorne and DOSHIS=\r\nHA UNIV. in Kyoto \nsend me an email too cuz, we have a major AIzu family wh=\r\no \nestablished/ran that Christian school.  I wager that Hartshorne dealt \nd=\r\nirectly with Ibuka Kajinosuke (Aizu samurai) of Meiji Gakuin too. \nIt&#39;s a s=\r\nmall small world of education and especially western style \neducation. Ever=\r\nyone knew each other too well.\n\nsorry about the rant...I&#39;m obsessed with th=\r\ne post 1868 Aizu \nnetwork....where there is Aizu...there is the FUJITA fami=\r\nly and \nSaitou ofcourse :P\n\n\n"
