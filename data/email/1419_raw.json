If you&#39;ve seen Kiru! then you will note how \nthey made fun of the &quot;bamboo sword&quot; bit @_@\n\nOkamoto also directed a parody of JAMES BOND (Japan loved James \nBond)...also starring Nakadai...basically a geek, complete with horn \nrimmed glasses is supposed to be transformed into an ultra cool \nsleuth type the problem is those neat gadgets don&#39;t always work ^_^ \nand someone who saw it said it was HILARIOUS.\n\nNakadai can also be seen in the very dark comedy THE KEY (Kagi) \ndirected by Kon Ichikawa (who did the animated movie Shinsengumi \nusing shadows/paper). THE KEY is widely available.\n\n*I have seen Nakadai as a male model in a magazine (part of a book \non cinema history) and he was REALLY cute back in his day...he looks \nTOTALLY different ofcourse when he is playing a deranged swordsman.  \nAlso highly recommended is the movie THE FACE OF ANOTHER (Tanin no \nkao)....\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n\n&gt; Kill was on last weekend too. If you didn&#39;t see it then you really \nought to check it out when it comes on again. It had a pretty good \nstory and plenty of humor. The fellow playing the former-Samurai-\nturned-Yakuza/hero wasn&#39;t bad looking either... \n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin, who vows to never miss another Samurai movie on IFC \nagain.\n\n\n"
