(Western style military science and gunnery were\n&gt; taught at the\n&gt; school.)\n&gt;\n&gt; In history, Kondou Isami wasn&#39;t really a Kobusho employee; he was a\n&gt; candidate for a\n&gt; teaching position in 1862.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;secretary&quot;\n&gt; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know that NHK &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; had depicted Kondou Isami as a Kobusho\n&gt; &gt; employee and some info on that can be found at this post\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/574\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But what WAS the Kobusho?\n&gt; &gt; Was the Kobusho of NHK&#39;s &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; accurate?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can find out here\n&gt; &gt; http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/Kobusho.pdf\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyone here have some time to write like a 1-2 paragraph summary?\n&gt; &gt; The info will go on Kondou&#39;s info page properly cited and credited as\n&gt; &gt; always.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Japanese books on the Shinsengumi are REALLY expensive.
