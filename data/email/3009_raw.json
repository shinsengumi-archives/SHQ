Off the top of my head I can tell you for sure that he was \nthe son of Inoue Matsugoro, who was the brother of Inoue Genzaburo. Taisuke, \nif I recall correctly, was at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and claims to have \nseen his uncle&#39;s death; however, recent scholarship by Kikuchi Akira has \nsuggested that this may be incorrect due to the overly idealistic nature of \nTaisuke&#39;s narrative (having the time to take his uncle&#39;s head *and* sword \nand rather conveniently along the way drop them off at a temple), and the \nfact that a Bakufu soldier left a testimony that offers a different \nperspective on the death of a &quot;Shinsengumi soldier manning a cannon&quot; who may \nvery well have been Genzaburo. Stay tuned, I should be able to post a few \nmore things soon.\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon&#39;t just search. Find.
