Even Ja=\r\npanese texts which cover the &quot;bakufu side&quot; (and \nespecially the SHINSENGUMI=\r\n) such as:\n\nYamaguchi, Ken. Translated from the Japanese by Sir Ernest Maso=\r\nn \nSatow. Kins=E9 shiriaku A history of Japan, from the first visit of \nCom=\r\nmodore Perry in 1853 to the capture of Hakodate by the Mikado&#39;s \nforces in =\r\n1869. Wilmington, Del., Scholarly Resources 1973, 1906 ; \nISBN: 084201411X\n=\r\n\n*does *not even mention Ikedaya (perhaps I missed it but...I just \ncan&#39;t f=\r\nind it in the book).\n\nPerhaps Ikedaya was key only to the Shinsengumi narra=\r\ntive---but not \nkey to the entire &quot;fall of the shogunate&quot; story\n\nBecause an=\r\nother dimension which we must pursue is this:\nwere the shogunate forces def=\r\neated by modern weapons or more \nimportantly...Capitalism?  Therefore one a=\r\nlthough *key raid such as \nIkedaya would be ultimately ineffective in the o=\r\nverall conflict.\n\nand is the view of the Restoration as a capitalist revolu=\r\ntion \n(ultimately with victorious domains controlling various industrial \na=\r\nnd military monopolies) a sound approach?  Maybe it is....\n\nsorry I cannot =\r\nanswer your question---but I know other members here \nmay be able to help (=\r\n^___^)\n\nI specialize in Siam/Thailand (fluent in the language) feel free to=\r\n \nemail me offlist secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com if I can assist you\n\nThai=\r\n scholars who study the Bakumatsu are in agreeement with some \nJapanese sch=\r\nolars (Mr. Hirotada Tokugawa mentioned this lone opinion \nthat the Restorat=\r\nion was simply the monopolization of land to gain \ntaxes to fund one govern=\r\nment---controlled by a few men from certain \ndomains)---the Thai scholar (I=\r\n have a copy of this note) mentioned \nthat the Bakumatsu was an attempt to =\r\ngather all farmland---*asses \nthe national resources and then decide on the=\r\n nature of a \ncapitalist/industrial complex which followed.  Basically, Sat=\r\n-Cho \nvictors were incredibly ignorant of the the Norther (Eastern) \ndomain=\r\ns and what those territories possessed in terms of natural \nwealth.  War =\r\n=3D Plunder in other words.\n\nI think we are all happy to hear that the Shin=\r\nsengumi are alive in \nan academic setting as well as in pop-culture.\n\nThank=\r\n you for posting!!!!!!\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;slvrgriffn&quot; &lt;meredith_=\r\nhartley@...&gt; \nwrote:\n\nI&#39;ve run into claims that the &quot;Ideda&#39;ya affair extend=\r\ned the war by \ntwo\nyears at least&quot; more than 5 times, but I HAVEN&#39;T found a=\r\nn \nintelligible\nexplanation of that claim.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Meredith\n\n\n\n\n\n"
