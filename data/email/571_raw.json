Just had to share this.  I&#39;m watching one of the documentaries \non The History Channel, &quot;Horror in the East,&quot; and one of the \ngentlemen they have giving commentary is a veteran of the Japanese \nImperial Army... Hajime Kondo.  :-D  \n\nThe program has actually been a lot more objective than I was \nanticipating given it&#39;s title.  The description for it says it&#39;s an \nexamination of the Japanese psyche during WWII.  So far, it&#39;s been \namazingly fair in examining motivations for actions done with only \nthe occasional hypocritical comment (like a *somewhat* veiled \ncondemnation of Hirohito for not holding his soldiers accountable for \nwhat was being done in Manchuria... I know some action was taken \nlater, but I&#39;m sorry --- the first thing that popped into my head was \nMai Lai (spelling?) and what US soldiers did there and other places \nin Vietnam... no one holds soldiers accountable until it becomes an \nissue... that&#39;s the horror of war and man&#39;s inhumanity to man --- and \nI don&#39;t mean to make an issue of it... I just don&#39;t like isolated \ncomments like the above condemnation of Hirohito when the wider \nreality includes everyone).  Thankfully, there was a presentation of \nwhen Japan invaded Manchuria and was condemned at the Geneva \nConference, the western nations held as colonies almost everything \nsouth of Japan and their criticism of Japan hypocritical.  And while \nsurvivor comments are getting worse in terms of what was done to \nthem, it&#39;s still within a context of a cultural mentality at a \nspecific time and not as a condemnation of a people as a whole.  At \nthe least, this program seems to be a cut above most US documentaries \nthat deal with WWII Japan.\n\nphil\n\n\n"
