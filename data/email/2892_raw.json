Anyways, here&#39;s the article again.\n\n=\r\n~Seven\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n\nOkita Soji\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nOkita Soji (?? ??),=\r\n (1842 or 1844 - July 19, 1868) was the captain of the first troop of \nthe =\r\nShinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate peri=\r\nod. He was \na well-known genius swordsman, being one of the strongest out o=\r\nf the Shinsengumi, \nalong with Saito Hajime and Nagakura Shinpachi.\n\nConten=\r\nts\n\t \t1 Background\n\t \t2 Shinsengumi Period\n\t \t3 Death\n\t \t4 Trivia\n\t \t5 Refe=\r\nrences\n\t \t6 Okita in Fiction\n\nBackground\nHe was born Okita Soujirou Fujiwar=\r\na no Harumasa in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai family \nin the Shirakawa- han&#39;=\r\ns Edo mansion. (Oji p. 58 - p.59) His Great-grandfather was Okita \nKan&#39;emon=\r\n (? - 1819) and his Grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (? - 1833.) His father, =\r\nOkita \nKatsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833=\r\n-1907) and Okita Kin \n(1836-1908.) In 1846, in order to marry the adopted s=\r\non of the Okita family, Okita Rintaro \n(1826-1885), his oldest sister Okita=\r\n Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuke \nin name. Kondo Shusuke =\r\nwas the third master of the Tennen Rishin Ryu and Okita started \ntraining a=\r\nt the Shieikan with him around the age of nine. By that time, Kondo Shusuke=\r\n had \nalready adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondo Isami), but Hijika=\r\nta Toshizo had not \nyet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryu school. Okita pro=\r\nved to be a prodigy and attained \nMenkyo Kaiden status (master of kenjutsu)=\r\n at eighteen or so. (Mori, p.9 - p.11)\n\nIn 1861, Okita became the Head Coac=\r\nh (??) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often \ncommented to be honest, p=\r\nolite, and good-natured by those around him, he was also \nknown to be a str=\r\nict and quick-tempered teacher to his students. (Mori, p.27 - p.28)\n\nAccord=\r\ning to Yagi Tamesaburou (Yagi Gennoujou&#39;s son) and Satou Shun&#39;sen (Satou \nH=\r\nikogorou&#39;s descendent), Okita was a tall, dark, and thin man with high chee=\r\nkbones, a \nwide month, and a &quot;flatfish&quot; face. (Mori, p.56) In addition, he =\r\nwas known as a man who \nsmiled and laughed well (not very talkative, howeve=\r\nr.)\n\nShinsengumi Period\nOkita changed his name to Okita Souji Fujiwara no K=\r\naneyoshi shortly before his departure \nto Kyoto in 1863. He soon became a f=\r\nounding member of the Shinsengumi and a \nFukuchou Jokin (Vice-Commander&#39;s A=\r\nssistant.) (Oji, p.111) Okita Rintarou, also a \npractitioner of the Tennen =\r\nRishin-ryu, became a commander of the Shinchougumi (the \nShinsengumi&#39;s brot=\r\nher league in Edo.) (Mori, p.52)\n\nOkita was the second youngest among the S=\r\nhieikan members, with Todo Heisuke being \nthe youngest. He was one of the S=\r\nhieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (one of \nthe original command=\r\ners of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro assassinations in \n1863. =\r\n(Oji, p.132)\n\nEqually skilled with shinai, bokken/bokutou, and katana, his =\r\nsignature technique was \nnamed the Mumyo-ken or Sandanzuki (which translate=\r\ns as &quot;Three Piece Thrust&quot;), a \ntechnique that could attack one&#39;s neck, left=\r\n shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. \n(the Mumyo-ken supposedly c=\r\nould hit all three points simultaneously, but this is most \nlikely an embel=\r\nlishment.) (Oji, 20) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention and it could \nhave=\r\n been derived from an invention of Hijikata&#39;s (the Hirazuki.)\n\nIt was rumor=\r\ned that his tuberculosis was discovered when he coughed blood and fainted \n=\r\nduring the Ikedaya Affair, but some sources say that he contracted the dise=\r\nase after that. \nBoth are reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (wee=\r\nks), or very slowly (many years). \nWhile many of the Shinsengumi fans belie=\r\nve that Yoshida Toshimaru was killed by Okita \nduring the Ikedaya Affair (b=\r\nased on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction), it is in fact historically \ninaccurate.=\r\n (Mori, p.92 - 98)\n\nBased on Shiba Ryoutarou&#39;s fiction, many also believe t=\r\nhat Okita and Hijikata were like \nbrothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke wa=\r\ns the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly \nrelationship with. Yamanami&#39;=\r\ns seppuku (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was an \nextremely painful inci=\r\ndent in Okita&#39;s short life. (Mori, p.78) There is no record showing \nthat H=\r\nijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got along =\r\nwith \nHijikata.\n\nIn 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the=\r\n Shinsengumi and also served as a \nkenjutsu instructor ((Oji, p.175); later=\r\n that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be \nthe fifth master of the =\r\nTennen Rishin-ryu after him. (Mori, p.132)\n\nAlthough highly unlikely, it wa=\r\ns rumored that he wielded a famous katana called Kikuichi-\nmonji. However, =\r\nhe surely owned a set of Kaga Kiyomitsu (a katana and a wakizashi) and \nhis=\r\n so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a Yamasiro Kunikiyo instead.=\r\n (Oji, 96)\n\nDeath\nDuring the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi i=\r\nn January of Keiou 4, Okita went \ninto Matsumoto Ryoujun&#39;s hospital in Edo.=\r\n (Oji, p.235) He then moved to a guesthouse \nwith Okita Rintarou, Okita Mit=\r\nsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces (including \nthe Shinsengu=\r\nmi and the Shinchougumi) retreated to the Tohoku region, Okita remained in =\r\n\nEdo alone. (Mori, p,170 - p.171) He died on July 19 (lunar calendar May 30=\r\nth), 1868. Later \nthat night, he was buried at his family temple in Edo (pr=\r\nesent Tokyo), under his birth name \n(with Okita Souji listed in the death r=\r\necords.) Today, Okita&#39;s grave is not open to the \npublic. (Oji, p.252)\n\nThe=\r\n information that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that he =\r\nwas born \nin 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he =\r\ndied in 1868 (or on a \nlesser-known theory that he was born in Summer, befo=\r\nre July 19, 1842 and therefore was \n25 by Western standards when he died in=\r\n July 19, 1868.)\n\nTrivia\nIt is historical accurate that Okita loved childre=\r\nn. During his time in Kyoto, he was often \nseen playing with children and w=\r\nas a baby-sitter to Yagi&#39;s sons in Mibu. (Oji, p.100)\n\nHe was not particula=\r\nrly fond of liquor but it is fictional that he loved sweets.\n\nOkita was a b=\r\nit of a clean freak. (Oji, p.130)\n\nAside from being treated by Matsumoto, O=\r\nkita also took Kyorou Sanyaku (medicine for \nenervation and coughing) for h=\r\nis tuberculosis (not to be confused with Ishida Sanyaku for \ntreating injur=\r\nes such as brusises and broken bones.)\n\nThere has not been any evidence of =\r\nan Okita photograph.\n\nReferences\n\t? \tMori, Makiko.

ISBN \n4404016212\n\n\nOkit=\r\na in Fiction\nIt is important not to confuse fictional work featuring Okita =\r\nwith historical data about him.\n\nOkita is briefly mentioned and shown in th=\r\ne anime/manga series Rurouni Kenshin, which \ntakes place during and after t=\r\nhe Meiji Revolution in Japan. A character later on in the \nseries, Seta S?j=\r\nir?, was based on the Okita Soji from fiction Shinsengumi Keppuroku (and \nt=\r\nherefore, darker than the real Okita.) Okita is also a main character in th=\r\ne anime/manga \nPeacemaker Kurogane, which takes more liberties with history=\r\n. In an episode of the anime \nGS Mikami, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets ins=\r\nide of a haunted movie about the \nBakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicte=\r\nd as a crazy guy who thinks only of killing \npeople (obvious pun on his usu=\r\nal portrayal, which also is a foil to the show&#39;s rendition of \nHijikata.) O=\r\nkita is also the male protagonist in the manga Kaze Hikaru, which is a fict=\r\nional \nstory about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate (wher=\r\ne Okita trains a \nyoung girl to be one of the Shinsengumi to avenge her fat=\r\nher and older brother.) He is also \ndepicted in the 1999 film Taboo (Gohatt=\r\no.) In the anime/manga series Shura no Toki, \nOkita&#39;s (fictional) last batt=\r\nle before succumbing to his sickness is with a warrior from the \nMutsu, a c=\r\nlan that supposedly practiced unarmed combat. Their duel was a request from=\r\n \nOkita himself from years before.\n\nHis anime, manga, and TV depictions ten=\r\nd to be as a handsome young man (sometimes a \nbish?nen). The Latin American=\r\n dub of Rurouni Kenshin, in fact, mistook Okita for a \nwoman, and the Hijik=\r\nata/Okita yaoi pairing is very popular among the fangirls of \nPeacemaker Ku=\r\nrogane.\n\nWhile only briefly appearing in Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken (in a =\r\nflashback and as a \npossible ghost), Okita&#39;s (obviously) fictional daughter=\r\n Kaoru (by an equally-obviously \nfictional unnamed wife) is one of the thre=\r\ne main characters of the series.\n\nHis three-point strike (Mumyo-ken) and hi=\r\ns tuberculosis are also very similar to the \ncharacter Ukyo Tachibana from =\r\nthe video game series Samurai Shodown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
