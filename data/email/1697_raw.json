Actually, the\nname of the manga is &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot; (&quot;tsuki akiraka\nni hoshi mare naki&quot;), and the subtitle is &quot;sayonara\nShinsengumi&quot;. Currently being published in Young\nSunday.\n\nThe main character is Hijikata Toshizo (as usual).\n\nThe story itself uses plenty of well-known fictional\nclichees taken from various sources, like the fight\nbetween Hijikata and Sakamoto Ryoma in the Genbukan\n(seen also in Bakumatsu Fuunroku Makoto), the death of\nNiimi Nishiki assisted by Harada Sanosuke (100% Moeyo\nKen) and so on.\n\nI guess there are two interesting things that I\nhaven&#39;t seen so often:\n1) Okita Souji is not a bishonen. He isn&#39;t ugly\neither, but he isn&#39;t so handsome. And his eyes are\nvery slant, like the description left of him.\n2) Saito Hajime *is* an Aizu spy working for\nMatsudaira Katamori and leading a number of ninjas.\nAnd he has a scar on his face.\n\nThe art is quite good. The story, though not\nbreathtaking, is reasonably interesting. I am buying\nonly the tankobons, so I don&#39;t know the latest\ndevelopments of the story, but the last part I have is\nthe night prior to the murder of Serizawa Kamo (no,\nnot me :P)\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
