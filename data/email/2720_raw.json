The Shinsengumi/Edoji/& Spy\ndivision have a  an excellent home and message board\ngoing all thanks to the sweat and  blood of the\npresistant fans that keep the mailing lists going \nstrong.  My idea was, how &#39;bout we make a chatroom?   \nMaybe not on the actual site but on mIRC... Somewhere\nwere we can all  meet and chit chat about everything\nand anything that comes to  mind.   It&#39;ll be a great\nway to get to know the memebers of  the 3 mailing\nlists.
