He just had so much fun \ntaking down notes on all of our visitors.  If he really likes a \nguest he may even ask them questions like &#39;where are you \nfrom&#39;&#39;what&#39;s your REAL name&#39; and so forth but he tended to get \nimpatient when they didn&#39;t take his questions seriously.&quot;\n\nHist.
