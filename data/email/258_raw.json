Too many people don&#39;t \nrealize that films as recent as the 70&#39;s are in danger of being lost \nand there&#39;s *SO* much of it without even considering anything outside \nof Hollywood. (My background is in book & paper conservation, but for \na long time I&#39;ve wanted to get involved in film preservation... \nunfortunately I&#39;m too far away from the labs doing it... rats!) Japan \nis one country I would think of as having the money and the \nresources/technology to protect their cinematic history.  \n\nI&#39;ll have to go back through livejournal entries in one of the \ncommunities I&#39;m in to hunt up the person who was looking for some \nfeedback on translation styles and see if they have any suggestions \nabout pursuing getting it fan-subbed.  (This person does either fan-\nsubbing or pro-subbing or both... don&#39;t remember exactly what they \nwrote.)  Unless someone else here has some leads???  I know a lot of \nyou rely on fan-subbing for anime that hasn&#39;t already been pro-subbed \nor dubbed.\n\nI&#39;m really interested in seeing this film after you described it, but \nI&#39;d definitely want to be able to understand it.  (Unless all the \nactors as gifted as Charlie Chaplin at getting story across without \nwords.)  :-D\n\nphil\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Kevin Closson &lt;k_closson2001@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Phil,\n&gt; \n&gt;  The print that I have seen is actually pretty good\n&gt; and is the one they restored that they mention on that\n&gt; website. All it would take is someone to do a fan sub\n&gt; or professional sub so we could understand it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; --- spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Any ideas\n&gt; &gt;on who in Japan is working on preservation of\n&gt; &gt;Japanese film that one might contact to suggest a\n&gt; &gt;film like this receiving attention?  (In fact, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;something that would be good for a group... say like\n&gt; &gt;ours... to petition for preservation.)\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
