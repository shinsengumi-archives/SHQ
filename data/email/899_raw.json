I think Serizawa got hiratsuki-ed\n\nAnyways the same director, Kihachi Okamoto also does comedies such \nas Kiru! (Kill!) and Red Lion (which I have not seen). Kiru! pokes \nfun at the 7 bungling samurai and the whole bit about the bamboo \nsword (it&#39;s sad Nakadai gets to make fun of Harakiri/Seppuku which \nmade him an international star).\n\n*the guy who wrote the screenplay for Sword of Doom also wrote the \nscreenplay for 7 Samurai too\n\nRyunosuke is just &quot;misunderstood&quot;...he isn&#39;t ~that~ evil...\nhttp://www.gotterdammerung.org/film/reviews/s/sword-of-doom.html\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I just saw the Zatoichi commercial and yeah I&#39;m guessing its here \nin the \n&gt; US. I think it was out last year overseas.\n&gt; \n&gt; I never get to see the whole Sword of Doom movie  I always come in \nnear \n&gt; the end *whine*  So how many did he kill? I think he took out the \nentire \n&gt; shinsengumi except for the ones killing Serizawa. And was it me or \ndid \n&gt; Serizawa get gatotsued?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\t\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n"
