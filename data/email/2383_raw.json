The Mito Tokugawa were famed for their loyalty to the \nemperor and kokugaku (Japanese studies) one of the leading \nintellectual pursuits. Unfortunately, because of the political and \nintellectual climate of Mito (and elsewhere) prior to the bakumatsu, \nit became a rallying cry and lost much of its original meaning, \nbecoming confused with tobaku (overthrow the bakufu).\n\nphil\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Warg3791@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hm. That&#39;s sort of what I thought. I was planning to eventually pry \ndeeper \n&gt; into both the 47 ronin story and seppuku. Maybe I will find out \nmore then...\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the foreign devil thing... Perhaps a little? &quot;Sonno-joi&quot; \nliterally \n&gt; means &quot;Revere the Emperor&quot; and &quot;expel the barbarians.&quot; Everything I \nhave read \n&gt; about the slogan so far points to it having originated in Mito. \n(Possibly from \n&gt; Tokugawa Nariaki himself?) But both &quot;barbarians&quot; and &quot;foreign \ndevils&quot; were terms \n&gt; commonly used to decribe foreigners at the time so it could have \njust as \n&gt; easily been worded the other way.  The feeling behind all of it was \nthe same at \n&gt; any rate.\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissB\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
