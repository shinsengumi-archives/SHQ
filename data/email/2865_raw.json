Just by looking at the kanji, I can t=\r\nell that it could be read any \n&gt;of a number of ways:&quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;, &quot;Fusayoshi=\r\n&quot;, &quot;Fusanaga&quot;, &quot;Nobuyoshi&quot;, and so on-- the\n&gt;confusing nature of which gave=\r\n rise to Souji&#39;s formal name being read by some as \n&gt;&quot;Fusanaga&quot;.\n\nYes, the =\r\ncomplexity of name reading is amply illustrated by the kanji used to spell =\r\n\n&quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;. I&#39;d always spelt Okita Soji&#39;s formal name/middle name as &quot;Kan=\r\neyoshi/\nFusanaga&quot; till recently (like most other formal given names/middle =\r\nnames, it could be read \nmore than one way, as you&#39;ve mentioned.)  Anyways,=\r\n it&#39;s definately &quot;Kaneyoshi,&quot; not \n&quot;Fusanaga.&quot; On a few occasions, his name=\r\n was written with Yoshijiro&#39;s &quot;yoshi&quot; (not \nby himself, though.)\n\n&gt;However,=\r\n despite the fact that that name should be read &quot;Kaneyoshi&quot;, what I had sai=\r\nd \n&gt;earlier regarding Rintaro Fusamasa still holds true:\n\nI agree with you =\r\n100%.  Please don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but is it &quot;Fusamasa&quot; for sure?=\r\n  \nI haven&#39;t been able to confirm that... Maybe it could not be confirmed??=\r\n?\n\n\n~Seven\n\n\nPS.\nI&#39;ve just thought of something saved in my Okita folder.\n\n=\r\nRintaro&#39;s family register (from 1882 or around 1882)\nhttp://blog.drecom.jp/=\r\nhinojyukuhonjin_kentoukai/monthly/200506/\n\n\n(Okita Rintaro is listed as bei=\r\nng the the oldest son of the Okita family.\nOkita Mistu is listed as being t=\r\nhe the oldest daughter of Kondo Shusuke .)\n--------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\nThere hasn&#39;t been a solid explanation in regard=\r\n of the fact that Okita Soji is listed in the \ndeath records at the family =\r\ntemple as being  he &quot;2nd son of Okita Rintaro.&quot; What we could \ntell is that=\r\n both Okita Rintaro&#39;s were &quot;retainers&quot; and Rintaro Fusamasa was only going =\r\nto \nremain as the head of the family until Okita Soji got married.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"
