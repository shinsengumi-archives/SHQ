I \nthought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;=\r\nt already been \ngiven) a name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to honor someone in his family. I=\r\nn Souji shortening his \nname from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the =\r\nend part that is like \nKatsujirou. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he ini=\r\ntially retained the Katsu part \nof his name,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing=\r\n his family name, isn&#39;t he separating \nhimself from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakaw=\r\na family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki \nfirst? Could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someon=\r\ne be adopted into one family and then into another?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ****\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t =\r\nbeen fully confirmed, it&#39;s \ngenerally believed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Okita Rinta=\r\nrou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status \n(=\r\nby\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family and ther=\r\nefore would have to change his name to \nOkita.) He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; served as a =\r\nretainer for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; young Souji.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Oki=\r\nta family could have needed the additional \nfinancial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; from Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death.
