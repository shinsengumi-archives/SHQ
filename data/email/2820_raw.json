He THEN move=\r\nd to a guesthouse with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, \nand their children. Wh=\r\nen the shogunate forces (including the Shinsengumi and the \nShinchougumi) r=\r\netreated to the Tohoku region, Okita remained in Edo alone.\n\n#7 Keiou 4 did=\r\n NOT become Meiji 1 until Oct 23 1868 (lunar calender Sep 8), 3 months \nAFT=\r\nER Okita&#39;s death. His date of death should NEVER be written as &quot;Meiji 1, Ma=\r\ny 30 (Lunar \ncalendar).&quot; It&#39;s either Jul 19, 1868 or  Keiou 4, May 30 (luna=\r\nr calendar).\n\n\n~Seven\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretaryto=\r\ncapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; ok so we are all in agreement that there is some conf=\r\nlicting info on\n&gt; Okita but there are issues regarding citation\n&gt; \n&gt; as of =\r\ntoday this page is now a mess  ::ROFL!!::\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Ok=\r\nitaSoujiro.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t keep up with you intense researchers (I work on=\r\n the timeline,\n&gt; Saitou Hajime post 1868 because there is more info in Engl=\r\nish on the\n&gt; Meiji Era, Takagi/Fujita Tokio and some Aizu folks) so I have =\r\na ~weak~\n&gt; grasp of Okita (but I wrote that article on TB, that counts for\n=\r\n&gt; something right?)...now this is an idea...\n&gt; \n&gt; why don&#39;t all the Okita s=\r\npecialists form a team and revise Okita&#39;s\n&gt; info page (^___^) get in a chat=\r\nroom, or work on someone&#39;s blog and do\n&gt; some revising etc...but really you=\r\n don&#39;t have to be a specialist you\n&gt; can be a fan who joins the group and a=\r\nsks questions, this will help\n&gt; the main writers understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of th=\r\ne hundreds of thousands of\n&gt; Okita fans out there\n&gt; \n&gt; again it is totally =\r\nimportant to cite details this would be very\n&gt; helpful to visitors of the s=\r\nite\n&gt; \n&gt; also you may right some mini articles on Okita as well and I can\n&gt;=\r\n create a sub-menu\n&gt; \n&gt; for example I split the Saitou Hajime page into sec=\r\ntions (by the way\n&gt; I&#39;m in the process of converting my word document essay=\r\n into html to\n&gt; enhance the info on the page) you can take a peak here:\n&gt; h=\r\nttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; and when you are all done=\r\n, just email the text, your names (real or\n&gt; user names) to shinsengumihq(a=\r\n)yahoo.com\n&gt; \n&gt; a similar approach was adopted with the gigantic still in p=\r\nrogress\n&gt; timeline where several people over a couple of months emailed\n&gt; u=\r\npdates/entries\n&gt; \n&gt; so promise me that you will all think about it!  It is =\r\nreally\n&gt; impossible for one person to study ALL the Shinsengumi members or =\r\nall\n&gt; facets of the history/culture\n&gt; \n&gt; specialize. divide and conquer!\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
