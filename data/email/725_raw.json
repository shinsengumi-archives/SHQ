I found a site that sells japanese\n&gt;historical drama with \n&gt;english subs. I haven&#39;t ordered anything from them\n&gt;yet (*is too broke \n&gt;at the moment*), but some looks really interesting,\n&gt;like the shinsengumi keppuroku. \n\n Samuraiflix.com is Merlin&#39;s site. He is one of the\nfew people that is subtitling some of these types of\nmovies. In that particular version of &quot;Shinsengumi\nKeppuroku&quot; he just just got it from the Kiku tv Hawaii\nbroadcast. I have the series on vcd from that\nbroadcast if you don&#39;t mind vcd quality. \n However, he is the one to support if you want to see\nmore subtitled movies. The guys on e-bay that mass\nproduce his subitled movies should be avoided like the\nplague since they will be the ones that kill off the\nfansubs.\n\nKevin\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"
