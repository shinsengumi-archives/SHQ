I would like to a=\r\ndd\nyour information to the Okita webpage (with your permission)\nhttp://www.=\r\nshinsengumihq.com/OkitaSoujiro.htm\n\nIf you notice on that page (and other p=\r\nages) we name the sites we used\nas sources and we mention the name of the c=\r\nontributor.  \n\nDo you recall from which book you got all this information? =\r\n If you\ncan give atleast the author and title that would be great so we can=\r\n\nadd that to the page as well---and I try to add a link to the book so\npeop=\r\nle can buy it.\n\nThe pursuit of history is filled with contradictory facts: =\r\nthat&#39;s the\nname of the game.  \nTo deal with discrepencies, it is necessary =\r\nto put everything side by\nside and so we&#39;ve endeavoured to do that.  I thin=\r\nk all of us would\nappreciate your advice and knowledge in improving the web=\r\nsite and\nadding more to this mailing list.\n\nYou may remember from http://en=\r\n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kondo_Isami\nwhere I cite Romulus Hillsborough.  Ge=\r\nnerally, I don&#39;t like to use his\nwork but it is unavoidable because he is u=\r\nnfortunately the *first*\nwesterner to publish a text which focuses on the S=\r\nhinsengumi.  You\nwill notice I mentioned the book and page number (the orig=\r\ninal source\nfor Tani Tateki&#39;s words are Teihon: Shinsengumi Shiroku).  \n\nSo=\r\n if there is an incorrect detail anywhere it is necessary to just\nsay &quot;this=\r\n book says different&quot; and so forth so all of us fans will\nunderstand where =\r\nthe information came from.  None of were actually\nthere so we have to rely =\r\non texts. \n\nGenerally, in the world of academic publishing it is also very\n=\r\nnecessary to cite, detail by detail where information was originally\nfound-=\r\n--although http://www.shinsengumihq.com is only a fansite we\nstill want it =\r\nto follow that standard whenever possible.\n\nIf you have anymore correction =\r\nplease post here because many people\nare grateful for your help. Most of us=\r\n aren&#39;t fluent in Japanese\n(^__^) you will note how on pages like the \n\nhtt=\r\np://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm\n\nwe had to use t=\r\nhe best English language books we can find\n\n\n---------------------------\nWe=\r\n have a second entry for our Multimedia Contest:\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.c=\r\nom/ikedaya.swf submitted by (V.P.)\n\nShinsengumi site (Japanese)\nhttp://www.=\r\ntachikawaonline.jp/shinsengumi/013/013.htm\n\nFujita Goro fanart (part of a c=\r\nommunity of &quot;Aizu fans&quot;)\nhttp://mgalsips.web.fc2.com/1-17.html\n\nreally grea=\r\nt cosplay site\nhttp://animexx.4players.de/fotos/cosplay-thema.php?thema=3D1=\r\n634&alle=3D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
