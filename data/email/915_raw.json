For\n&gt; all I know (which isn&#39;t much) it may be the same and\n&gt; it was produced in Korea or something.  I just found\n&gt; it curious and thought maybe you knew more about it.\n&gt;  Maybe Kevin knows something, so I&#39;ll wait to see if\n&gt; he knows anything.  Even if it&#39;s not the same film,\n&gt; it&#39;s worth taking a look at for it&#39;s own sake.  I&#39;m\n&gt; fond of Korean cinema as well.  And thanks for\n&gt; making these things available to us.  I, for one,\n&gt; truly appreciate the opportunity to see things I\n&gt; might not otherwise get a chance to see...\n&gt; Shinsengumi related or not.  (And I&#39;ll love you\n&gt; forever for the RK manga scanlation!  I&#39;m in Saitou\n&gt; and Sano heaven!)\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun.  Try the all-new Yahoo!
