It goes in the rumor or\nfolktale section...but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he did because other\nformer members of the Shinsengumi wrote their accounts to.  Besides\nNagakura SHinpachi, Nobori Nakajima also wrote a record. They lived so\nintensely and I&#39;m sure they needed to think about what they were doing\netc.  If it did exist he must&#39;ve given it someone who would take care\nof it...somewhere out there...\n\nmy own speculation (so it is worthless:P):\n1) it wouldn&#39;t just be about the Shinsengumi it would be about\nswordsmanship and some of his spiritual beliefs as well...this is\nbased on my overall opinion from reading stuff on the 2 Japanese sites\nand other messageboards...\na. from how he died he must&#39;ve practiced meditation throughout his\nlife...and on 3-hajime.com it kinda details that he sat like this\nthroughout the night...took some time and lots of will power that\nisn&#39;t mustered at the last moments of your life but through lifelong\ncultivation.\nb. If he did indeed practice Mugai Ryu kenjutsu then he would attempt\nto study/realize its spiritual dimension based on Buddhism...many\n&quot;ryus&quot; are heavily mixed with either\nShintoism/Buddhism/Zen/Confucianism (all or three but the older the\nschool the more Shinto it is)...the more advanced your martial arts\nlevel so to speak the more abstract you get (abstract can also mean\ntrying to realize the most simple basic tenets of your art though).\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;warg3791&quot; &lt;Warg3791@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OK, so I was going through some of the posts over on the Miburo site \n&gt; and I came across something rather interesting. Someone mentioned \n&gt; that there was a rumor Saito wrote a biography about himself. \n&gt; However, they did not know if it had ever been published. Does anyone \n&gt; have anymore information about this? I sort of doubt it exists, but \n&gt; oh if it did!\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin\n\n\n"
