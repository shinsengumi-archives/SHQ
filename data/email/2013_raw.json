Amazing :D\n\nWent to Shiroyama in Satsuma and was VERY impressed at\nthe caves used by Saigo Takamori, Kirino Toshiaki and\nothers to hide. They are very small.\n\nWent to Shoukason-juku in Hagi and was VERY impressed\nat Yoshida Shoin&#39;s teachings o.o (sugoi koto wo\noshiete imashita) \n\nWent to Katsura Kogoro&#39;s house also in Hagi and was\nVERY impressed at how beautiful Ikumatsu (Matsuko) was\no.o (didn&#39;t know there was a picture of her) Also, it\nwas good to see another picture of Takasugi Shinsaku\nother than that most famous one (ano Takasugi wa\nchotto kakko yoku nai desu ^^;;;)\n\nWent to Okayama Art Museum in Okayama (duh :P) and was\nVERY impressed at how beautiful Kikuichimonji Norimune\nis o.o (no wonder he was the January of the Emperor&#39;s\nswordsmiths...)\n\nAs for the Shinsengumi, read that Shinsengumi manga by\nGolgo 13, I mean, Saito Takao. It is reasonable. Also,\nread that &quot;Shinsengumi Ibun&quot; (I guess the name was\nlike that) and enjoyed one of the most absurd mangas\n(historically speaking) on the Shinsengumi. It demands\nsome guts to come up with such a nonsense story about\nthe group!\n\nAnd last, but not least, read &quot;Dandara&quot;, by Akana Shu.\nLiked very much the drawing. Quite cool.\n\n\n\n&gt; Subject: Re: A happy new year!\n&gt; \n&gt; A Happy New Year to you and all !\n&gt; \n&gt; I like your fan arts very much, momoiro-san.\n&gt; I wish I could draw as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; \n&gt; momomanjyuu2004 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Shin-nen akemashite omedetougozaimasu.^_^\n&gt;  &gt; (In Japanese, it is the meaning of &quot;A happy new\n&gt; year&quot;.If it\n&gt;  &gt; translates literally, it will become &quot;the new\n&gt; year, dawn,\n&gt;  &gt; furthermore congratulations&quot;.)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; In fact, Japan is still the daytime on December\n&gt; 31 now.\n&gt;  &gt; However, I separate from a network for about five\n&gt; days after this.\n&gt;  &gt; Therefore, I greet you previously.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Japanese people send the postcard called\n&gt; &quot;Nengajyou&quot; (New Year&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; card) to friends.\n&gt;  &gt; It arrives on January 1.\n&gt;  &gt; I send Nengajyou to everybody of SHQ\n&gt; similarly.^_^\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omedetou1.html\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omedetou2.html\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If you like these, bring these home freely.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The page which is downward is the fan art which I\n&gt; drew two years\n&gt;  &gt; ago.\n&gt;  &gt; Since I did not understand how to use software,\n&gt; the colors are\n&gt;  &gt; crude.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/momoiro-usagi/omake.html\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; These pages are eliminated at 11:00 p.m. JST on\n&gt; January 5.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Many thanks for your kindness last year.\n&gt;  &gt; I desire for you in 2005 to be fortunate.^_^\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; momoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n=====\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
