I&#39;m so easy to keep amused.  Suzuki was born on July 12.  My birthday is July 11.  :-D  Too cool!!\n \nI just copied and pasted the babelfish translation into a Word document, so I&#39;ll be spending some time with it (with the usual confusion).  Some of it begins to sound like Saitou to some degree:\n \n(babelfish translation):\n\n&quot;But, the drunkard as it is accustomed to the house inside the temple, the liquor quantity increases the multi gates steadily, reaches the point where you shirk work.\nScolding, being not to inquire about that you say absolutely finally it becomes divorce. \nAfter the divorcing, it renames Arazirou Miki, that way you make just part serve it means.\nBut, conduct not to be repaired, it does not change and drinks the liquor to morning and because it reaches the point where and you shirk feudal clan duty, it becomes 2 part exemption.&quot;\n \nSo he had a drinking problem, too?  (This is before he joins the Shinsengumi.)  It sounds like he was adopted into a feudal clan after some problem with his family (not included here and I don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re getting at --- if the family got into trouble or if he got into trouble for wanting to leave school to join the war or if he&#39;d started a private school & numbers were declining because of the war or... &lt;shrug&gt;).  I suppose because I want information so badly on Suzuki, babelfish seems weirder than usual with this translation.  There&#39;s some talk about Itou and martial arts, too, but I can&#39;t decipher it.\n\nOh, and it looks like he ended up being Izumi Miki (Japanese order) during the Meiji era.\n\nphil\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
