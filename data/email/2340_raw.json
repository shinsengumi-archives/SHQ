Or at least that is what it says it is \nabout. This sounds suspiciously like it could be the &quot;Shinsengumi \nWitch Project&quot; to me...\n\nSome caution on the site might be wise. I did not see any pics that \nmight offend, but some of the other titles were a bit raunchy. This \nis perhaps only for the very brave then. \n\nhttp://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=ENG0101\n\nNext I found a more &quot;family friendly&quot; tourist site that had a new \ndetail about Hijikata&#39;s death. Apparently there was a barrier of some \nsort he was trying to break through when he was killed? I know that \nmany roads in the Edo period had check points which all travelers had \nto pass through in order for the Bakufu to be able to control the \nmovements of troops and weapons in the country. I am guessing that \nthis &quot;barrier&quot; was one of the checkpoints in Ezo?\n\nAlso some info on a memorial tower that the people of Hakodate built \nespecially for the Tokugawa war dead.\n\nhttp://www.0033worldnavi.com/featured-city/en/hakodate/page3.php \n\nAnd last but certainly not least is this little reference to Kondo \ngetting his butt kicked?! In all fairness it says he was using a \nspear at the time rather than a sword, but still... Tale tell or \ntruth?\n\nScroll to the very bottom to find the relevant comment.\n\nhttp://www.bushinjuku.com/arts/bushinarts/fusen/fusen.htm\n\nOn a note of redemption for the Commander&#39;s honor, I did find a small \nreference saying that people in Nagareyama now consider him a hero \nfor surrendering and sparing their town from being destroyed in fight.\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
