Hadn&#39;t had the time (and\n&gt;money!) to do so T_T\n\n&gt;I have seen several Shinsengumi mangas, but none got\n&gt;really my attention.\n\nBefore half a year, many bookstores had a Shinsengumi corner. \n(It is the influence of Taiga drama.) \nAlthough the time was easy to look for Shinsengumi-Mangas, it has \nfinished. \nThe bookstore is preparing the following Taiga drama (Minamoto no \nYoshitsune) books. \nKanashii....\n\nI think that Shinsengumi-Manga is a genre very difficult for \ncreators. \nMany Manga readers are not interested in the difficult situation of \nBakumatsu. \nOr there is no feature in the work and readers may get bored. \nMost Shinsengumi-Mangas stops the series for reasons of non-\npopularity. \n\n\n&gt;&quot;PAPUWA&quot; wa kiita koto ga arimasuga, yonda koto ga\n&gt;arimasen ^^;;; &quot;Gintama&quot; wa Jump dakara shitte imasu.\n&gt;Demo yonde imasen ^^;;; Shinsengumi-ppoi chara ga deru\n&gt;koto wa shitte imasu ga, sore dake desu. ^^;;;\n&gt;(demo Shinsengumi kara deta chara nante Yamato datte\n&gt;aru shi ne ^^;;;)\n\n&quot;PAPUWA&quot; and &quot;Gintama&quot; are jokes^^;;;\nDemo sitteiru kara kowai....\n\nFurthermore, you know to Shinsengumi-material of Yamato. \nUchusenkan-Yamato(Space Battleship Yamato / Star Blazers)\nWhy does Kamo-san know it? I was panicked. \nIt is famous to Japanese Shinsengumi fans.\nHowever, I did not think at all that the foreign Shinsengumi fan \nknew it. \nIn order to notice it, you need to know the Japanese name of the \ncaptains of Yamato. \nFurthermore, you need to be a Shinsengumi fan. \nI think that this is miraculous probability. \n\nOmisoreitashimashita....^^;;; \n\n\nAlthough there is almost no Shinsengumi Anime, a parody is seen \noccasionally^^;;;\nIncidentally, does Kamo-san know this Anime? \n\nhttp://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%8A%80%E6%B2%B3%E7%83%88%E9%A2%A8%E3%\n83%90%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC\n\nhttp://www.imagica.com/shop/j9/bax_s.html\n\nKorerano setsumei wo mite watashi wa bakusyou shimashita.\nTokuni tekigata no namae ga sugoi desu.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Not that much. It&#39;s interesting how the author\n&gt;portrayed Serizawa-Hijikata interaction, but the art\n&gt;is below average and the story isn&#39;t that appealing,\n&gt;not to mention that they don&#39;t use the famous\n&gt;Shinsengumi uniform ^^;;;\n\n&gt;It really seems that it was ended because of\n&gt;&quot;uchikiri&quot;.\n\n&quot;uchikiri&quot;...yahari sore ka.\nThere are many works stopped by the halfway story. \nThere is almost no Shinsengumi-Manga which continued to Hakodate. \nMany Mangas were announced by the influence of a Taiga drama this \nyear.\nHowever, the most is a short story. \n \n\n&gt;That&#39;s true enough. Kondou tends to play rather a\n&gt;secondary role in most manga.\n\nI think that this is the influence of &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot;. \nThe novels of Shiba Ryotarou give gifted character to the main \ncharacter, and there is a tendency to set up people around it \nfoolish. \nKondo Isami and Ootori Keisuke received this damage by &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot;. \nThe present Shinsengumi works have followed a setup of &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; \nmostly. \n\n\n&gt;o.o I haven&#39;t seen the 5th volume yet... I have to\n&gt;search for this...\n\nI&#39;m sorry, I made misunderstanding to you. \nSale of vol.5 is on December 3. \nSince I am reading YS, I know the contents of vol.5. \n\n\n\n&gt;Serizawa is a good character in this manga. Though,\n&gt;the BEST Serizawa so far is still that Serizawa from\n&gt;&quot;Shinsetsu Shinsengumi&quot;, IMHO ^^;;; Mechakucha kakkoii\n&gt;desu.\n\nSerizawa of that Manga is &quot;Kakkoyosugi&quot;. \nOwing to it, Hijikata is not conspicuous ^^;;; \n\nSoreha sorede omoshiroi desuga....\n\n\n\n\n&gt;I haven&#39;t checked this week&#39;s YS yet. I have seen only\n&gt;that it was the beginning of the Ikedaya incident.\n&gt;These days I was too busy checking Pluto, so... ^^;;;\n&gt;btw, Pluto is a HIGHLY recommended manga, though it\n&gt;has NOTHING to do with the Shinsengumi ^^;;; It&#39;s\n&gt;about Astro Boy ^^;; Urasawa Naoki rules *_*\n\nAlthough I read &quot;MASTER KEATON&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Pluto&quot; is not \nreading. \nSince my younger sister likes the works of Urasawa, I borrow it from \nher. \n\n\n\nTokorode Yamato wa gaikoku dewa donoyouni setsumei sareteiru no\ndesyouka?\nTashika Anime no ichiban saisyo no bamen wa WW2 de senkan-Yamato no\nsyukkou wo syounen ga miokurunodesuga arewa gaikoku demo cut sarezuni\nmirukoto ga dekiru no desyouka?\n(Totemo kini narimasu.)\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n\n"
