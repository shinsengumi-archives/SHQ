Specifically, I&#39;m interested in what is meant by &quot;Mito School&quot; in this case.\n\n  &quot;The fittings include: a handle covered in ray skin, gilt bronze mice menuki with wonderful detail, a fuchi signed Kunishige, and a guard from the Mito School, 19th century.&quot;\n\n  From:\n  http://www.trocadero.com/zentner/items/346215/item346215store.html#item\n\n  phil (lost somewhere in Mito)\n\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  Tired of spam?
