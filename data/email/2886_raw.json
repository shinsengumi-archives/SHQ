It was the samurai&#39;s custom!  M=\r\nany samurai \nchanged their name twice, but Okita had only changed his name =\r\nonce.  Yes, a samurai \nwould have usually kept his formal given name/middle=\r\n name when he changed his (full) \nname but Okita changed it from Harumasa t=\r\no Kaneyoshi.  Why?  I&#39;m not sure...\n\nNo, Okita didn&#39;t change his name from =\r\nSoujirou to Souji  to match the young master. \nThere&#39;s a theory that he cha=\r\nnged his name to Souji because some people around him \ncalled him &quot;Sou-Ji&quot; =\r\n(short for Soujirou.) \n\nWe don&#39;t have the Okitas&#39; family register from arou=\r\nnd 1845, but it&#39;s generally believed that \nKondou Shusuke adopted Mitsu so =\r\nshe wouldn&#39;t be Rintaro&#39;s sister.  \n\nKondou Shusuke probably didn&#39;t get any=\r\nthing in return for doing this. It was common for a \nfemale (like a merchan=\r\nt&#39;s daughter) to be adopted by someone in order to wed a man (like \nthe sec=\r\nond son of a samurai family) she couldn&#39;t marry otherwise.  \n\nThere were tw=\r\no separate Okita Rintaro&#39;s. Okita Rintaro Fujiwara no Kanwmasa was Mitsu&#39;s =\r\n\nhusband.  \n\nThough this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believ=\r\ned that Okita Rintarou \nMototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai sta=\r\ntus (by being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita \nfamily and therefore would have to =\r\nchange his name to Okita.)  He served as a retainer for \nyoung Souji. \n\nThe=\r\n Okita family could have needed the additional financial support from Rinta=\r\nrou \nMototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as th=\r\ne head of the Okita \nfamily for a short time (not sure how short...) \n\nAs I=\r\n&#39;ve mentioned before, I&#39;ve only started buying books on Okita since May 200=\r\n5. On top \nof that, I&#39;m not proficient in the Japanese language either. Nev=\r\nertheless, I&#39;d be happy to \nanswer all the questions I could.  :)\n\n~Seven\n\n=\r\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zhusanna&quot; &lt;wsehome@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nsudden influx of information has left me with a lot of \n&gt; questions...  I&#39;l=\r\nl start with just a few.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &lt;&lt;While Okita Souji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi wa=\r\ns a member of the \n&gt; Shinsengumi, Okita Soujirou Fujiwara no Harumasa was t=\r\nhe Head Coach \n&gt; at the Shieikan.&gt;&gt;  Seven\n&gt;  \n&gt; I guess my first question =\r\nis general - Why did people change their \n&gt; names so much?  The answer to t=\r\nhat may answer my next question - And, \n&gt; more specifically, why did/would =\r\nSouji change his name from Harumasa \n&gt; to Kaneyoshi?  And, the change from =\r\nSoujirou to Souji?    In NHK, he \n&gt; tells Heisuke something like I changed =\r\nmy name to match the young \n&gt; master.  Based on historical truth?  Or ficti=\r\non?\n&gt; \n&gt; ******\n&gt; \n&gt; I know I&#39;ve asked questions on adoptions before, but..=\r\n. When Kondou \n&gt; Shusuke adopted Okita Mitsu, was it so that she would not =\r\nbe Okita \n&gt; Rintaro&#39;s &quot;sister&quot; so that they could marry?  What would Kondou=\r\n \n&gt; Shusuke get in return for doing this?  Was it as common to adopt \n&gt; fem=\r\nales?\n&gt; \n&gt; ******\n&gt; \n&gt; I was a little confused by the &quot;two Rintaro&#39;s.&quot;  Sam=\r\ne man or two \n&gt; separate people?  Okita Rintaro Fusamasa (or is it Kanemasa=\r\n?) was \n&gt; Mitsu&#39;s husband?  And - \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;one was Inoue Rintaro Mototsune,=\r\n whom bought his samurai status \n&gt; (from the Okita family) after Okita Kats=\r\nujiro&#39;s death on (lunar \n&gt; calendar) October 20, 1845...&quot;&gt;&gt;  Seven\n&gt; \n&gt; He =\r\npaid the Okita family?  As sort of a replacement for Katsujirou?  \n&gt; After =\r\nhe married Souji&#39;s mother, why did he take the name Okita?  Not \n&gt; to be he=\r\nad of the family as Katsujirou had already adopted the man \n&gt; that was to m=\r\narry Mitsu?  Am I completely confused?\n&gt; \n&gt; ******\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;...but really you=\r\n don&#39;t have to be a specialist you can be a fan \n&gt; who joins the group and =\r\nasks questions, this will help the main \n&gt; writers understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of =\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of Okita \n&gt; fans out there&gt;&gt;  secretary\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve=\r\n got many Okita related questions and would be happy to ask them \n&gt; if Seve=\r\nn or anyone else is interested in what us Souji fans want to \n&gt; know.  I&#39;m =\r\nmore an expert in the area of things that are presented as \n&gt; fact in ficti=\r\non - be it film, anime, or manga.  Drop me a note if \n&gt; you&#39;re interested.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll keep my questions to that for now.  : )\n&gt; \n&gt; --Wanda\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
