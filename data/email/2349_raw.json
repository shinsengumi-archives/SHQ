BUT, the off-white is\nactually yellow!\n\nBefore the restoration, Japanese dyes were really light colored.\nSo I was thinking if the Shinsengumi haori was yellow &quot;asagi,&quot;\nwouldn&#39;t it make sense that it&#39;d be done with cheaper, indigenous\nmaterial, and NOT be the BRIGHT Yellow we think of when we think\n&quot;yellow&quot;?  Because it would be expensive to make alot uniforms a\nbright color.\n\nSo I think the pre-restoration idea of yellow is not the same as OUR\nmodern idea of yellow.\n\nI go with the light yellow with blue triangles theory.  \n\n\n\n\n"
