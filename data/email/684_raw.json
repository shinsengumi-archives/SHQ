What do you think of it? A singaporean friend \n&gt; sent me a some songs and my favorite one (aside from the \n&gt; opening/closing) is either Sorezore no Hisou or Asamoya no Naka de \n&gt; (can&#39;t decide yet). I think both though was played during episodes \n&gt; 18-19 the time of Ayu-nee&#39;s capture and death. I&#39;m no fan of \n&gt; instrumentals (aside from some of the Kenshin ones), but I think \n&gt; it&#39;s a good change.\n\nHmmm... I decided to upload a sampling of the album for evaluation \npurposes only. Here&#39;s the link. Any comments? I&#39;d love to hear from \nyou.. The original album said something like Nipponsei... It has 32 \nsongs... All instrumental except for the opening/ending song... Each \nlasting 2-3 minutes...\n\nhttp://f1.pg.briefcase.yahoo.com/bc/mg_batt/lst?.dir=/&.src=bc&.done=\nhttp%3a//f1.pg.briefcase.yahoo.com/&.view=l\n\n\n"
