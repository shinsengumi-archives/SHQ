When\n&gt; we came back, he suddenly appear=\r\ned and beat us.\n&gt; Obviously, we were always surprised and got beaten.\n&gt; Thi=\r\ns made him (my father) enraged and yell &quot;Shidou\n&gt; fukakugo!&quot;(*) . This happ=\r\nened throughout the whole\n&gt; year, so it was unbearable.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (*) One of th=\r\ne common lines to come across while\n&gt; reading about the Shinsengumi. &quot;Shido=\r\nu&quot; is literally\n&gt; &quot;the way proper to man&quot; (as it is featured in my\n&gt; site).=\r\n It can be understood as &quot;bushido&quot; for the sake\n&gt; of simplicity. And &quot;fukak=\r\nugo&quot; means &quot;unprepared&quot;.\n&gt; Needless to say, it reminds of the first article=\r\n of\n&gt; the law of the Shinsengumi ^^ \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Serizawa Kamo\n\n\nThis is testim=\r\nony of Fujita Makoto which is the grandson of Fujita \nGorou. \nIt appears in=\r\n this book in detail. \n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4041906121=\r\n/qid=3D1100614734/re\nf=3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/249-1742061-3265907\n\n&quot;My father&quot;=\r\n in this testimony is not Fujita Gorou. \nHe is Fujita Tsutomu which is the =\r\nson of Gorou. \nHow Gorou educated his sons does not remain in record. \nHowe=\r\nver, we can know it a little by this testimony of Makoto. \nAs Kamo-san gues=\r\nsed, &quot;Shidou-fukakugo&quot; is the word used by \nShinsengumi. \nI cannot think th=\r\nat Tsutomu used this word spontaneously. \nProbably, when Tsutomu was a chil=\r\nd, he would receive the same \neducation from Gorou. \n(The samurai has to be=\r\n able to do preparedness always. Even if he is \nattacked by the enemy, to b=\r\ne able to cope with it calmly is desired. \nIt will be &quot;Shidou-fukakugo&quot;, if=\r\n he is surprised and escapes.)\nTsutomu is the son who was most near the Gor=\r\nou. \nHe respected the father very much. \nIt is no wonder to consider that t=\r\nhe education which he received \nfrom the father gave his son. \n\nThere is on=\r\ne more testimony of Makoto about the education of \nTsutomu. \nTsutomu taught=\r\n Makoto &quot;Enter first from a leg&quot;, when going into an \ninner side from the d=\r\noor. \nIf he puts the head into the door previously, even if he is cut by \nt=\r\nhe enemy in the door, he cannot counterattack. \nIf the leg was cut, he can =\r\ndo a counterattack, falling. \nProbably, as for this, Tsutomu was similarly =\r\ntaught from Gorou. \nIt seems that the character of Fujita Gorou did not cha=\r\nnge even if \nit became a peaceful time^^\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n\n"
