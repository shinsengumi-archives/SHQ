Friendly people gave me a lot of help then, so those posts contain quite a bit about Hijikata&#39;s early life, including name and age of all his siblings.\n \nWould also be interested in siblings&#39; offspring though... I know he must have had at least one nephew, since there&#39;s still a Hijikata family in the Hino area who claim kinship with him. Also it&#39;s likely that any children would&#39;ve come through his second eldest brother, Kiroku. As far as I remember it the eldest one, Tamajirou, was blind and hence disqualified from inheriting, and probably hard to marry off. The other brother I think was adopted by another family and changed his name. \n\nMaria Cline &lt;ladynomad2000@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHi, I just need some info about Hijikata&#39;s family,\nlike his brothers and sisters and any possible neices\nor nephews. Stuff like that.\n\nThanks!\n\nMarie\n\n=====\n\nCheck out this link!\n\nhttp://opt-in-pays.com/r-287409\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
