They first had it listed in their  computer \nthat it would arrive by April 30, but the last time I went back  there (around \ntwo weeks ago), they said it would be available on July 30.  Apparently \nHillsborough is in frequent contact with the store, but since he&#39;s  not publishing \nit himself, its release is delayed.
