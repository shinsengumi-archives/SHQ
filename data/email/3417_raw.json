I think we&#39;d probably need a\n&gt; &gt; fan based in  France with access to =\r\na university to find if Brunet&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; diary has ever been published.\n\n******=\r\n****************************** \n\nAkimiya wrote:\n\n&gt; Do you happen to have so=\r\nme kind of extracts from Jules Brunet=B4s diary?\n&gt; I really would like to t=\r\nranslate whatever you may have.

Maybe I\n&gt; can find some infos looking a=\r\nt the university...., well starting the\n&gt; new semester in September.

I hope you have better luck find=\r\ning\nit at your university.\n\nIn 2005, 3 long years ago this is what I found:=\r\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/message/2004\n(book title is in the post)=\r\n\n\nAt the time no one was really excited about it so I let it go.\n\nI no long=\r\ner have the files.
