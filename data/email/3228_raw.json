This \nkind of harass=\r\nment has already happened to me, for instance people \ncreate usernames almo=\r\nst exactly the same as mine and post comments \nmocking &quot;myself&quot;.\n\nalso I wo=\r\nuld like to warn everyone here there is this new \nlaw/article stating that =\r\ncopyrighted music (even if the artist gives \nit for free) cannot be superim=\r\nposed or applied to moving images they \nhave not approved of...which means =\r\nif you stick a song onto anime \nand make your own fan music vid---you just =\r\nbroke the law.  What does \nthis mean?  When you make a music vid...get read=\r\ny to add your own \nmusic---yes go out and buy a kazoo or harmonica or gathe=\r\nr your own \nband and record it (^_^)---does anyone pay attention to this la=\r\nw?  \nNope! I actually cite the artist and source of the music in my vids \no=\r\nr summaries to my vids, often people don&#39;t even do that! (^_^)\n\nsadly this =\r\ntotally screws up what Hirotada Tokugawa and I had \nplanned, that is a supe=\r\nr masterpiece multi-part video/audio \ncommentary/music extravaganza which w=\r\nould be our own, historically \naccurate documentary of the Shinsengumi & Ai=\r\nzu-han\nit would detail what Hillsoborough conveniently &quot;left out&quot; but other=\r\n \nscholars have WRITTEN IN ENG, OR JAPANESE, and Aizu-han&#39;s narrative \nis n=\r\not widely know, we&#39;d like to present it using extracted footage \nfrom old S=\r\nhinsengumi films, old version of Byakkotai + new 2007 \nByakkotai...just to =\r\nkeep things visually appealing.  We would use \nall that film footage to kee=\r\np it &quot;interesting&quot; however it would be \nagain totally accurate info (those =\r\nfilms have slight innaccuracies \nor need further explanation)---it looks li=\r\nke we cannot do that \nEITHER (T_T)---and months ago I had painstakingly beg=\r\nun to gather \nfootage and extracting scenes using free software only the su=\r\nper \ncomputer at school can run\n\nIf we were going to do some sort of Shinse=\r\nngumi & Aizu documentary \nusing...I dunno...finger puppets, no one would wa=\r\ntch it...\n\n-------------------------------\nemail I got....\n----------------=\r\n---------------\nThis is to notify you that we have removed or disabled acce=\r\nss to the \nfollowing material as a result of a third-party notification by =\r\nTV- \nAsahi Corp. claiming that this material is infringing:\n\nNisshinkan cli=\r\np Byakkotai 2007 White Tigers: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D4-jUFAviUS=\r\nw\n\nPlease Note: Repeat incidents of copyright infringement will result \nin =\r\nthe *deletion *of *your *account and all videos uploaded to that \naccount. =\r\nIn order to avoid future strikes against your account, \nplease delete any v=\r\nideos to which you do not own the rights, and \nrefrain from uploading addit=\r\nional videos that infringe on the \ncopyrights of others.
