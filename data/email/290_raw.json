I thought that back on MM list someone had\nsaid that it would be hard to just &quot;fake&quot; that they had medical\nknowledge because occupations were highly specialized back then.\n\nSerizawa Kamo, as always the most informative English site, discusses\nhim...keep reading:)\nhttp://victorian.fortunecity.com/stanford/130/bio.html\n\nSorry babelfish required...discusses his role in the Ikedaya Affair\nhttp://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatu_yamazaki.htm\nhttp://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatu_yamazaki_2.htm\n\nThe movie &quot;I Want to Die a Samurai&quot; depicts Yamazaki Susumu\n*unfortunatly only bootlegs on ebay are available\n\nThe whole ninja thing is interesting...there were ninja clans/families\netc mentioned in Japanese history. However many historians also\ndiscuss samurai doing &quot;ninja work&quot; as well.  \n\nOn a different note,when I started using babelfish to search Japanese\nsearch engines there was a Shinsengumi site that mentions &quot;Saito One\nno sign ninja/shinobi&quot; ... it was more of a fan site but still I think\nwhat the webmaster was getting at was that he/she didn&#39;t think Saito\nOne was a ninja but obviously he could do spy work.  Perhaps Nanae\nChrono just recognized that information gathering was as &quot;ninja&quot; as\nyou can get and chose to portray him that way.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Did Yamazaki actually have a ninja background or is that entirely an\ninvention of PMK?  \n\n\n"
