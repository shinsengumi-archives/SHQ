They had\nbelieved culprit was Choshu ronins.\n\nS\nP\nO\nI\nL\nE\nR\n\nI think the main point of the question is Saito&#39;s capture and torture\npart was completely invention of the scriptwriter.\nThe members who executed the assassination were, according to Shimozawa\nKan&#39;s book, Kondo, Okita, Harada,Nagakura and Inoue. And Nagakura said\nthere were also Hijikata, Shimada, and Yamazaki.\nAnyway Saito&#39;s name didn&#39;t appear in this affair...\n\nMay be momoiro san could rectify or add something to what I wrote.\nI&#39; d like to reply for other posts too but it will take more time.\n\nTama\n\nP.S. I understand that for some people it would be shocking to see Saito\ntied up and beaten like that!\n\n\n\n\n\nJon Mesina wrote:\n\n      &gt; I wonder if our Japanese board members might know...\n      &gt;\n      &gt; Tama, Momoiro-usagi and ideas? ^_^\n      &gt;\n      &gt; ~Okita\n      &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n      &gt;   From: secretary\n      &gt;   To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com\n      &gt;   Sent: Thursday, September 02, 2004 1:27 PM\n      &gt;   Subject: [SHQ] Re: NHK Drama Episode 26 Question\n      &gt;\n      &gt;\n      &gt;   I didn&#39;t see this episode but Saitou and Hijikata did travel to\n      &gt; Osaka to recruit\n      &gt;   new members.
