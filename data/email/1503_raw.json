Will Jiro Asada be presenting \nanything insightful, or will this just be a press junket for his \nlatest Shinsengumi-based novel?  I guess a better example would be \nif the marquee speaker is the scriptwriter for that god-awful NHK \nShinsengumi series airing right now.  He may have done some research \nto write the script, but I doubt anyone would want to pay to hear \nhis &quot;knowledge&quot; of the Shinsengumi.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if Hillsborough will be doing anything like this, \nespecially when his new book comes out?\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Well, we didn&#39;t say he is an authority on the Shinsengumi. I doubt\n&gt; many people would dare to make that claim seeing how in the short \ntime\n&gt; period the Shinsengumi existed, their intense record would cause\n&gt; people to divide up different aspects of their duties and battle\n&gt; theatres (Toba Fushimi, Nagarayema, Aizu and Hakodate).\n&gt; \n&gt; At the request of SAitou, his secretary has made numerous calls now\n&gt; and spoke to 2 different people...all I can say is this JAL has\n&gt; contact info for translators in San Francisco and Torrance...It is \nUP\n&gt; TO THEM to do their part.  If you guys are interested please call \nthem\n&gt; and urge them to acquire translators...my goodness there are grad\n&gt; students who would do this for free.\n\n\n"
