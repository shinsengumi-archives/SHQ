Actually the DVDs I&#39;m pretty \nsure will come with both the Japanese/English audio. Every anime that \nI have bought has been like that (exclude the hongkong/pirate \nversions on this). Actually it&#39;s quite a treat to watch in pure \nNihonggo goodness without the subtitles, it&#39;s amazing how much I \nmissed when I was watching the fansubs.\n\nAnywho.... Dub very few have been done decently. The only one I can \npick out as a relatively good dub was the Big O. Kenshin DVDs \nthemselve, the english version killed me. My expectations for a good \ndub is not high... \n\n~wounds\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Even if you don&#39;t care for the English VAs, an official release \ngenerally still has the original Japanese version, right?  Or am I \njust spoiled by RK? \n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; PMK has been licensed the manga definitely so I&#39;m guessing the \nanime \n&gt; too---when it first started last October I managed to get hold of \n&gt; someone through the PMK anime official site (I think their email \nlink \n&gt; was in English) and he said they were working on US distribution so \nI \n&gt; guess this is it!! Yeehaa!\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT those Japanese voice actors are so perfect as those \ncharacters....I \n&gt; do so hope they choose wisely........\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan      \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; visit \n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n&gt; \n&gt; our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
