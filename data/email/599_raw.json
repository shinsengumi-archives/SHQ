I end up with more que=\r\nstions than I started out with, which isn&#39;t actually a bad thing except I h=\r\nave no way of answering those questions, many of the answers of which are s=\r\ntaring me straight in the face and I simply can&#39;t decipher.  There is somet=\r\nhing very interesting going on with Suzuki&#39;s early life that I can&#39;t make h=\r\nead nor tail of in the babelfish translation... it&#39;s actually more frustrat=\r\ning than knowing nothing at all.  Worse than Tantalus and the grapes and wa=\r\nter.  :-D\n\n&gt;&gt;he was a lit/hist. teacher...brainy guy who was also Toudou He=\r\nisuke&#39;s\nteacher...is it me or Itou&#39;s role seems to be blurred as &quot;book&quot;\ntea=\r\ncher -and- martial arts because &quot;somewhere&quot; out there it is\nmentioned that =\r\nItou had his own dojo&lt;&lt;\n \n*Something* like this is mentioned on the site yo=\r\nu gave us today, but I&#39;m not sure (again) exactly what they&#39;re getting at:\n=\r\n \n&quot;Kaei February of 5, death of the father. As for older brother Okura the =\r\nyounger brother, the multi gates succeeded the private school because that =\r\ntime already you had become the disciple of the Ito school in Edo.\nBut, sti=\r\nll as for the multi gates of the child as for study being able to finish ah=\r\nead of time, &quot;as for the man for martial arts should strive&quot;, that the &quot;cam=\r\nphor tree multi gate circles&quot; and so on with the flag which is written \nYou=\r\n say that everyday the children and it had gone to war the your =82=C1 dens=\r\nely and so on.&quot;\n \n&gt;&gt;there are no English sites that go into detail about It=\r\nou&lt;&lt;\n\nsigh... why am I not surprised...\n&gt;&gt;[fictional] explanations\n*Mibugis=\r\nhiden...Itou wanted to join the imperialists because he\nassumed that he and=\r\n his group would not only be paid more but they would get high ranks in the=\r\n new government\n\n*Shinsengumi!:Band of Assasins....Itou (who was invited by=\r\n Kondou to join the group) had &quot;new&quot; ideas and he says &quot;you have to think w=\r\nhy you are cutting/killing the Ishin Shishi&quot; (members of the Shinsengumi ga=\r\nsp in astonishment)...Itou in the movie writes to Kondou and tells him to d=\r\nissolve the Shinsengumi...when he leaves he tells Kondou that he\ndidn&#39;t mea=\r\nn to start a faction but he will help monitor the enemy and report info bac=\r\nk ---but that didn&#39;t happen&lt;&lt;\n\nNeither is very satisfying.  I think from so=\r\nmewhere I picked up the notion it was more along the lines of what was pres=\r\nented in &quot;Band of Assassins,&quot; but not with the &quot;friendly&quot; overtones of reta=\r\nining any contact, that it was more antagonistic.  Don&#39;t have a clue where =\r\nI got that idea, though...\n\nI&#39;m really aggravated with myself because I&#39;ve =\r\nnever once stopped to think about why Suzuki would&#39;ve join the Sekihoutai o=\r\nr that Itou&#39;s departure didn&#39;t have to mean he believed in the Ishin Shishi=\r\n cause, that he could&#39;ve still held bakufu loyalties, although wasn&#39;t Satsu=\r\nma allied with Choshu by this time (1867) and it sounds like Itou was conne=\r\ncted to the Satsuma feudal clan (or maybe that was just to whom Suzuki turn=\r\ned after the assassination)?  It&#39;s beginning to become entangled with quest=\r\nions I have about Sagara before the war and his association with the Mito c=\r\nlan and why he had to stop fighting for them... these changes in loyalties =\r\nmixed with the subtle philosophical differences/factions that arose on both=\r\n sides... it gets so delightfully confusing.  Geez... I think I need to sta=\r\nrt creating some tables before I&#39;m impossibly lost.\n\n \n\nphil (feeling very =\r\nmuch like Sano right now when he was punching down trees in the forest... a=\r\nggravated and lost)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWi=\r\nn a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
