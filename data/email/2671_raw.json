Instead they \nare using very    modern lines. I can say that as there are some core jidaigeki \nfans criticizing Mitani( the scriptwriter) that his lines are too modern to be \nhistorical drama.\nAnd especially, in the sequel, the conversation between Hijikata and Enomoto \nis really long and having important signification.\nMay be I&#39;ll try to make a synopsis for that if there wouldn&#39;t really be the \nsubbed one.\n\nI can tell that really I loved the sequel as well as the previous series \nand it worth seeing even without sub. And Tetsu in this drama( a very young \nactor who had played also Yoshitsune child last year) was simply adorable!\n\nTama\n\nP.S. Speaking of recent J-drama with actors in Shinsengumi!, you can see \nalso Tatsya Fjiwara(Okita) in the &quot;Furuhata Ninzaburo episode 1&quot;, and actor \nof   Genzaburo Inoue (co casted with Ichiro of Seattle Mariners himself) in the \nsecond episode of the same series. Both are currently seeded by Torrent.\n\nIn addition to phil&#39;s list, Shingo Katori (Kondo)will play Sun Wu Kong or \nMonkey King in the remake of &quot;Monkey Magic&quot;( I don&#39;t know how many people would \nremember this series ) based on the &quot;Journey to West&quot;.\nAnd Sakai Masato (Yamanami) will be in the new NHK short historical series \n&quot;Izumo no Okuni&quot;, telling the life of an actress who became the founder of \nactual Kabuki theater.\nBoth series will be aired from someday in January. ( Sorry I don&#39;t check \nclosely yet)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
