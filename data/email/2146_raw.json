Although Maeda group did not go to \nSekigahara, they fought with the Niwa group who is an enemy.) \nHe was set to karou (The maximum important vassal) of a Kaga domain \nafter Maeda Toshinaga died. \nHe died in 1620. \nHis posterity became the important vassal of Kaga domain. \n \n \nBy the way, I ask why the questioner knows this person. \nAbout this man, probably, even if it is a Japanese, almost all \npeople do not know. \n(I also got to know this person for the first time.) \nI think that he probably will not be known if it is not the \ninvestigator of Sengoku period, and the investigator of Maeda \nfamily. \nBut since Sengoku period is the time which is popular more than \nBakumatsu, many researchers exist^_^\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
