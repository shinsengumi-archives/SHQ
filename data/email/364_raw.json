For example there is a clip of a Shinsengumi re-enactment\nwhich to me looks like the one which occurred during a parade at Aizu.\nThere is a young female host (at one point attempts and Okita\nimpersonation) takes you on a tour of a museum (or location connected\nto the Shinsengumi). Then in another clip she interview someone. All\nfiles are for windows media player and my computer would only play the\nfirst few seconds before &quot;dying&quot; so I haven&#39;t see the entire files.\n\nHow do you find the link when babelfish cannot/will not translate this\npage? Go to the sword and click on the link right in the middle of the\nblade that should take you to the list of vids.\n\nTiffany\nsecretarytocapt3\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com\n\nP.S. still reeling from the translation...the people from Chiba\ntotally lead me on about policemen, S.H. doine somethin bad but not\ncriminal...geez...it was right after the fall of Aizu and he was a POW\nso to speak\n\n\n"
