Does he keep them in\nhis front pocket? I only remember his matchbox...it wouldn&#39;t be cool\nsmoking the whole cig...imagine Saitou with just a little stub in his\nmouth...then if he insults Sano he might actually swallow the\nstub...cigs were expensive back then too\nI recall seeing somewhere (on some long-forgotten website) that they were \nsold in a box, but it didnt&#39; say how big or anything. I would assume that at \nfirst it was like a cigar box though. He probably had some sort of case to carry a \nfew in.\n\nThe cigarette as we know it  was first mass-produced in Cuba in 1853. It \nremained something that only the rich indulged in until 1854-6, which British \nsoldiers in the Crimean War picked up the habit from the Turks, who were their \nallies. (A group of Eygptian artillerymen started making the first paper-wrapped \ncigarettes in 1832, when a communal clay pipe was broken by a Turkish \ncannonball fire! War is responsible for all evils, ne?) \n\n It is possible that the Japanese were beginning to produce their own by the \nbeginning of the Meiji era. Some of you recall me post on the messageboard \nabout the no smoking law? Well, I don&#39;t remember if I mentioned it there or not, \nbut they were growing some tobacco (illegally of course) in Japan during the \nEdo period.  And I know they were producing and exporting matches at the time \nRK was set in. (Match info from another long-forgotten website!)\n\nThe info comes from a book called Reader&#39;s Digest Everyday Life Through the \nAges.
