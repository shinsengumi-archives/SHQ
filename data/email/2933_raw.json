For example, a fan with an \ninterest in =\r\nBritish involvement will be surprised that by following \nBritish diplomats =\r\nduring the Bakumatsu, they will be reading about \nbakufu troop movements in=\r\n the North (which is ofcourse comprised of \nShinsengumi).  Or perhaps someo=\r\nne who studies Korea and is interested \nin Satsuma will be able to focus on=\r\n Saigo Takamori in the early 1870s \nand really gain an understanding of the=\r\n motivations of winners of the \nBoshin War.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;k=\r\n kobayakawa&quot; &lt;kobaya635@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am reading Wikipedia Shinsengumi =\r\nsection andI am really surprised \nthe\n&gt; power of pop culture.\n&gt; http://en.w=\r\nikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsengumi\n&gt; &quot;Depictions in Media&quot; is so detailed but de=\r\nscription about \nShinsengumi\n&gt; itself is quite simple.\n&gt; Especially &quot;End of=\r\n the Shinsengumi&quot; is too simple while there is a\n&gt; description about porn S=\r\nhinsengumi game on &quot;Depictions in Media&quot;.\n&gt; Isn&#39;t it weird?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-te=\r\nxt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
