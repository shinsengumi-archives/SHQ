I should know \nbetter than to attempt thinking when I&#39;m sick...\n\nI somehow missed the last sentence of your story... more like misread \nit probably. So the woman indicated he&#39;d done something &quot;bad&quot;?  Okay, \nso now I&#39;m more than curious as to what the situation was.  How can \nwe get this sucker translated????  Geez, you probably wouldn&#39;t even \nknow which pages were relevent since you can&#39;t read the Japanese, or \ndo you?\n\nphil (tucking tail and finding a corner to hide in)\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;spiritus_saitou&quot; &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Ironically, I&#39;ve been reduced to watching prison history \non &quot;History \n&gt; Channel&quot; today...  I don&#39;t know how similar Japanese imprisonment \n&gt; systems were to western at the time, but given that so much of the \n&gt; police and armed forces were being patterned after European models, \nI \n&gt; would expect them working on similar ideas in prison reform.\n&gt; \n&gt; If they were incorporating western ideas (or maybe it was practiced \n&gt; in Japan, too, before westernization attempts), it would NOT be \n&gt; unusual for Fujita Gorou to be living at the facility as an \n&gt; employee.  What I&#39;m getting from all of this history on prisons \n&gt; (again, US & European... unfortunately) is that it was more usual \nfor \n&gt; prison staff to live on or near the prison grounds in the 19th into \n&gt; the 20th centuries, from the warden on down.   Alcatraz, for \n&gt; instance, had a community for staff families on the island itself.  \n&gt; What are the dates for this assignment?  Was it before he married \n&gt; Tokio & his sons were born?  I can imagine the bachelor Fujita (or \n&gt; even married) living in quarters at the facility.  From what you \nare \n&gt; saying the woman told you, it sounds to me that that was exactly \nthe \n&gt; case --- he was an officer working at the detention center and he \n&gt; lived there like other staff.  I don&#39;t come to the conclusion you \n&gt; do.  (But then, my head is currently stuffed with prison \nhistory... :-\n&gt; D)  Needs to be explored!!\n&gt; \n&gt; *DEFINITELY* fascinating new info, though.  I&#39;ve been thinking \n&gt; recently about how he might regard incarceration --- in terms of \n&gt; practices and who he could be seeing locked up... maybe more & more \n&gt; young people (ahem... like Sano)without opportunity and few options \n&gt; but to turn to crime just to eat.  Anyone have any good sources for \n&gt; info about crime statistics during the Meiji, especially in the \nfirst \n&gt; decade or two? (and more than how many were arrested for peeing in \n&gt; public!)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d love to know more when you find out!\n&gt; \n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; p.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern \nbuilding\n&gt; &gt; used as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t a prison/jail but a &quot;place where people could not leave \nuntil\n&gt; &gt; they know they did wrong&quot;...so I was trying to ask her if he \n&gt; committed\n&gt; &gt; a crime or did something &#39;bad&#39; (robbery, murder etc) of some sort \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; she said &#39;no&#39; and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; a police officer?  And I was like &quot;yes&quot; (so the pages must deal w/\n&gt; &gt; Fujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word &quot;discipline&quot; \nand \n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; she was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,\n&gt; &gt; disciplinary issue and this detention center that he &quot;stayed&quot; \nat.  I\n&gt; &gt; kept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like \n&gt; yes\n&gt; &gt; he stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he \n&gt; WORKED\n&gt; &gt; there...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because \nif \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; think about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a\n&gt; &gt; prison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he \nwas\n&gt; &gt; formerly &quot;disciplined&quot; for something...because I trying really \nhard \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; be sure that he wasn&#39;t just a prison guard but she was trying to\n&gt; &gt; communicate that he did something &#39;bad&#39; but not &#39;criminal&#39;.\n\n\n"
