Batman and Robin. Lewis and Clark. \nChip and Dale...\n\nAccording to fictional sources at least, the great duo of the \nShinsengumi appears to have been Harada and Nagakura. Movies and manga \noften shown in association with one another. Historically this is \nslightly backed up by the fact they were both on the list of those \nprotesting against Kondo and by the fact that they both left the \nShinsengumi after a disagreement with their boss following the defeat \nat Kofu.\n\nSo the question is, what is your favorite portrayal of the two? What \nwas your least favorite protrayal? And of all those who have (or could) \nplay the roles of the 2nd and 10th captains, what actors would you most \nlike to see bringing this famous friendship to life?\n\n-MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
