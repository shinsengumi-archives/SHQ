LOL\n\n*sigh* Imagine....a nice clear photo of our man Hajime in his TMPD\nuniform would e ever so nice...or maybe a nice formal family pose in a\nwestern suit...maybe there was another portrait taken with their son\nwhen Tokio had hers done....\n\nTama please keep us posted--- maybe you will find out more when you go home.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
