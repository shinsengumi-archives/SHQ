It goes on to say\n&gt; that Inoue Matsugorou is =\r\nGenzaburou&#39;s (second) older brother, and\n&gt; Inoue Taisuke is Matsugorou&#39;s so=\r\nn.  I see on that link that it\n&gt; mentions that the second son eventually ch=\r\nanged his name to\n&gt; Matsugorou, so it makes sense, but could I get some cla=\r\nrification\n&gt; here? Was Inoue Touzaemon AKA Matsugorou?  Thanks!\n&gt;\n\n\n"
