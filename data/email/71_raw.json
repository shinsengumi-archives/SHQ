I&#39;ll also be constantly updating the SHQ C=\r\nalendar as I gather \nthe information.\n\nBecause I don&#39;t want you to miss out=\r\n on a chance to see &quot;Sword of \nDoom&quot; tomorrow, this month&#39;s list only inclu=\r\ndes fare from the \nIndependent Film Channel (IFC) and the Sundance Channel,=\r\n the two \nchannels that show the most Japanese film I can access.  In futur=\r\ne, \nit will also include the HBO & Cinemax family of channels, Showtime & \n=\r\nThe Movie Channel family, and the Starz family.

Always check your own local schedules for show dates and \n=\r\ntimes in your area=85 there are variations in cable feeds and the \nproblem =\r\nthat I&#39;m human and prone to err.  \n\nThe schedule is available in the Calend=\r\nar in the Web Features on the \nSHQ yahoogroup site.  If you receive individ=\r\nual e-mails, link to \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq/cal .  The calendar=\r\n is set to \nreflect the day starting at 12:00AM and ending at 11:00PM.  Tim=\r\nes for \nfilms have been incorporated into a calendar set for EST.  You can =\r\n\nimport calendar entries into your own personal calendar (but pay \nattentio=\r\nn to whether or not it changes show times to your time zone=85 \nI&#39;m not sur=\r\ne if it does or not).  When you click on the title of the \nfilm, it will gi=\r\nve you more information, including an option to \nimport the entry.
