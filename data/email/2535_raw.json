Like our own personal struggles with online\ntranslators such as http://www.nifty.com/globalgate which at best can\nhelp us locate interesting text (so that we can forward the info to\nvolunteer HUMAN translators), new fans in other countries will be\nfaced with similar difficulties.\n\nPerhaps we can, over time come, up with a standard info sheet only 1-3\nparagraphs long which include the most basic Shinsengumi information.\nTranslate it into other languages, post in the files section so that\nnew fans will have a basic foundation from which to build their new\nfansites.  The info sheet should be as neutral as possible to allow\nnew fans from different cultural backgrounds to begin their research\nwithout being exposed to too much bias right away.\n\nAn great example of how the Shinsengumi have been &quot;translated&quot; can be\nseen here\nhttp://members.thai.net/peacemakerdiary/\nsee this page for an image of a map to Ikedaya in Thai\nhttp://members.thai.net/peacemakerdiary/ikedaya.htm\nNong Giffy, you are a member here if you need assistance on the Saitou\npage please email me off-list at secretarytocap3(a)hotmail.com---I\nemailed you already (^_^)\n\nWhen a manga is translated---footnotes are included---footnotes which\nare highly biased or simply innaccurate.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, SHQ@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n\n&gt; To vote, please visit the following web page:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/surveys?id=1762610 \n&gt; \n&gt; Note: Please do not reply to this message.
