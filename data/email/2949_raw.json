Usually there is a follow\nup with how the Japanes=\r\ne are naturally paranoid about outsiders\nbecause of the fact that they live=\r\n on a series of islands.  Not only\nis that the most &quot;easy&quot; explanation, it =\r\nis incomplete.\n\nOfourse, people regardless of era or race, were capable of =\r\nrational\nthought.  So did they all of sudden wake up one day and say &quot;I hat=\r\ne\nforeigners---kill them all!&quot;  There was a cause for all things.\n\nSonno jo=\r\ni was deeply influenced by China&#39;s (first) Opium War.\n\nThe first half of th=\r\nese notes will explain it using the most reliable\ntexts I&#39;ve found:\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/www.shinsengumihq.com/unmaskmeijigovopium.htm\n\nThe rest of the page will d=\r\neal with opium in the Meiji Era, and\nJapan&#39;s use of opium in her imperialis=\r\nt ventures.\n-------------------------\n[you can stop reading if you want the=\r\n rest is just extra stuff]\n\nI felt that the right thing to do was omit one =\r\nparagraph which was the\nmost intriguing.  \n\nThe paragraph is basically this=\r\n:  The weapons which funded the Ishin\nShishi (often on credit) were directl=\r\ny linked to the opium trade. \nAlso we know that the bakufu side had their a=\r\nrms dealer too, Schnell,\nand perhaps he had a network of merchants (the tru=\r\nth is you will find\nopium trade everywhere---it was the *NORM*).  Often mer=\r\nchants will\nimport in fancy western stuff but really the big money was in o=\r\npium. \nOpium was such a guaranteed high profit commodity that something\nmer=\r\nchants &quot;pawned&quot; it to each other for money or weapons. You can say\n&quot;hey bud=\r\ndy give me a whole bunch of those guns, and I&#39;ll pay you later\ncuz I got an=\r\nother buddy coming in with opium&quot; and the person would\nlikely give the arms=\r\n because opium was sure to yield the money to\ncover the expense.  Opium did=\r\nn&#39;t take up too much cargo space, it\npulled in the most profit, and it was =\r\none of those commodities which\ncould cover weapons trade (if the merchant w=\r\nas clever in the smuggling\nmethod).\n \nI first found shreds of this info bec=\r\nause not only did merchants who\ndealt with the Ishin Shishi but also diplom=\r\nats ofcourse had another\n&quot;base&quot; and that was British INdia.  There were fin=\r\nancial transactions\nbetween Japan and colony as well as your standard munda=\r\nne paperwork.  \n\nWhat was the big deal with British India?  India was a cor=\r\nner of the\nopium triangle.  British India&#39;s colonial administration was fun=\r\nded by\nthe opium trade.  More importantly the financial institutions which\n=\r\nstored the money for the British bureaucracy and her merchants (they\nneed n=\r\not be British) was basically a storage for drug profits.\n\nThe reason why I =\r\ndidn&#39;t post this was because I did some extensive\nreading here and there an=\r\nd it was something which can be extrapolated\nfrom texts---but did I find so=\r\nme smoking gun by an author saying &quot;this\nis how the Boshin War was funded b=\r\ny drug money&quot;...not exactly (but\npretty darn close).\n\nRemember, this is a s=\r\ntudy on a sordid trade (so authors were\ncautious), there is a surprisingly =\r\namount of data, even ship logs\nnoting how much opium was entering which por=\r\nt and under which\nmerchant---but for the most part authors like to present =\r\nthe\ninformation and draw the safest conclusions.\n\nI just wanted to state th=\r\nis...Thomas Glover is mostly associated with\nNagasaki (as were ***many merc=\r\nhants ofcourse).  Opium had few entries\ninto Japan, and Nagasaki was one of=\r\n those trade hubs for this\ncontraband. The big trade firms were opium smugg=\r\nlers.  Keep in mind\nthat there was a great deal of denial over the opium pr=\r\noblem in Japan\nbefore and after 1868.  So if an author bought into the &quot;Jap=\r\nanese\ndon&#39;t smoke opium&quot; then he/she wouldn&#39;t look deeper.\n\nSo I followed t=\r\nhem and did not interpret beyond the very basic\npossible conclusion. I didn=\r\n&#39;t want to threaten the integrity of the\nrest of the good information with =\r\nmy own &quot;speculation&quot;.  but I wanted\nto share this scenario with  you all an=\r\nyways---just because I like to\nblab.\n\n(^__^)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
