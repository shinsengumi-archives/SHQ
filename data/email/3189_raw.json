They were fighting over the\ngroups name and this was o=\r\nne of the reasons.  Group politics play a\nhuge role on the front but in sec=\r\nret it was to get Kondo as the\ngroup&#39;s leader.  But Hijikata made rules tha=\r\nt you can find at this\nsite that explains a bunch:  http://en.wikipedia.org=\r\n/wiki/Shinsengumi \n\nthe rule that was broken was: not to deviate from the b=\r\nushido code and\nKamo was doing a bunch.  That was the front that was put up=\r\n but that\nwas not the real motive.  That and to get rid of the ronin that c=\r\nome\nwith Kamo.\n\nThe reason for the Shinsengumi was to pretty much keep the =\r\npeace in\nKyoto.  That and the answered directly to the Aizu and Tokugawa. \n=\r\nChoshu , Satsuma and Tosa clans were the enemies.  \n\nIkedaya incident:  Shi=\r\nnsengumi were tipped off by their spy that the\nChoshu were going to meet th=\r\nere.  Kondo let the group with Okita that\nreached the inn first.  Huge batt=\r\nle.  Also, the first time Okita\ncoughed up blood.  Many Choshu men were kil=\r\nled.\n\nWhat would cause a ronin to join the Shinsengumi rather than\nanyof th=\r\ne other factions? What type of person would join the\nShinsengumi?   My gues=\r\ns and opinion, Shinsengumi were noble and fought\nfor truth.  That would be =\r\na great cause.\n\nWhat was Kiyokawa Hachiro&#39;s ulterior motive for leading the=\r\n\n&gt; Roshigumi and going to Kyoto? I think from rumors that the Choshu\nwere a=\r\nmassing there in secret and Kastura Koguru. \n\nanymore questions, just send =\r\nme a email\n\n\n"
