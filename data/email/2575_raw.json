(^_^) I&#39;m sorry.\nWhat I meant is---in an ideal situation, studying this era in teams\nwould be the best way to learn.  A book written by authors, each a\nspecialist in his or her field would be the ultimate book.  It is\nsimply too much for one academic to handle this ENTIRE CONFLICT alone.\n\nSo that was just an idea.\n\nWhat will happen in such a learning setting is...\nLoyalists &quot;you, Aizu, don&#39;t you get it? The Shogun abdicated already\nyou lost now go bye bye.&quot;\nAizu &quot;yes we know that but how come you are gathering forces to march\nagainst us?  We are negotiating with you and also writing letters--can\nyou hold your troops back?&quot;\n\nBut such a dialogue can even be backed up with actual documents:\nMatsudaira Katamori\n&quot;The recent...turn of events is ultimately due to my incompetence...I\nhave disgraced myself completely...while in Edo, I had hoped to take\nimmediate action that would redress the situation.  But the shogun was\noccupied with his own affairs , and so I decided to return to Aizu for\nthe time being.  We have now been told that the government has ordered\nseveral domains to punish Aizu with military force.  If their troops\nadvance to our borders, we have no choice but to make full\npreparations for war.&quot; (p.40 Shiba Goro&#39;s REMEMBERING AIZU)\n\nAizu here there and everywhere.  Hillsborough uses Nagakura&#39;s work\nalot, so you will read of Nagakura and Harada wanting to head to\nAizu---however Kondou and Hijikata infected with the &quot;germ of\nself-importance&quot; would not allow that unless the two submitted\nthemselves as vassals.\n\nWhat participants will realize and experience in a controlled\nhistorical RPG are the passions and political reasonings behind each\nside of the conflict. You will then understand why people gambled\ntheir lives for their cause. However, RPGs are often taken\n&quot;personally&quot; and learning may not occur.  RPGs also take a huge amount\nof time.  A transcript of such a group effort may be a valuable source\nfor people who are not inclined to read the standard 2-5 pound texts\non the collapse of the Shogunate.\n\nWe no longer have a messageboard.  http://www.shinsengumiMB.com points\nto this mailing list.  We previously had a messageboard (at a cost)\nhowever it is gone now.  Other fans can take the initiative and work\non this.  http://www.red-bird.org kindly offered board space, and this\nsite is studying Choshu.\n\nOr people can build their own websites which are more professional\nthan what Hillsborough has offered in this groundbreaking book.  \nHe may have been reacting to the unrestrained glorification of the\nShinsengumi which was at its peak while he was writing this book. \nHence his sweeping label &quot;the most notorious band of killers in\nJapanese history.&quot; (Hillsborough 33). Wow, even if the Shinsengumi\n[tried] they may not even been able to compete with the record of some\nother groups of killers in more recent Japanese history.\n-----------------------------------------\nTimeline now in a better format and will have more info soon \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/ShinsengumiBakumatsuTimeline.htm\n-----------------------------------------\nIn constructing the narrative of Hijikata&#39;s move to Hakodate\nHillsborough does NOT use YOUNG JAPAN by Black (this book has been\nused by nearly all major works on the Bakumatsu)\nIf you want to read about Ueno/Shogitai (Harada), Aizu, and Hakodate\ndownload https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/YoungJapanEnomoto.pdf \n(1.35 mb)  You will then realize why no one wanted to be Enomoto&#39;s pen\npal XD\n-----------------------------------------\nFor fans of Takagi/Fujita Tokio\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\nClick on &quot;timeline&quot;, go to the year ***1906 and click on the link\nwhich will take you to a description of the interior of the school and\ndorm.\nTokyo was a &quot;dorm mother&quot; she would&#39;ve been very familiar with the\nstructure described. \n*Yes, Mr. Fujita Goro was still working at the school in 1906\n\n\n\n"
