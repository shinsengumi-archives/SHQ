I&#39;ve\nbeen reading more about the \n&gt;=\r\n Ichimura brothers.  \n&gt; \n&gt; There are a few theories in regard of Ichimura T=\r\netsunosuke&#39;s death\ndate, while many \n&gt; believe that Ichimura joined Saigo T=\r\nakamori&#39;s army and died during\nthe Satsuma Rebellion \n&gt; in 1877, some belie=\r\nve that he died from an illness in 1873. \n&gt; \n&gt; The uploaded scans support t=\r\nhe latter theory.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather than sayin=\r\ng that the Shinsengumi has a connection with yakuza\nera, I&#39;d say that \n&gt; th=\r\nere&#39;s a connection between the ultranationalists from the samurai\nclass and=\r\n the yakuza.  \n&gt; I recommend\n&gt; \n&gt; JAPAN&#39;S DARK BACKGROUND 1881-1945\n&gt; http:=\r\n//www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/leiber/50/bds1.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"
