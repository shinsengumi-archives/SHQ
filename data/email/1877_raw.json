Their \nleader was Sasaki Tadasaburou-- who was originally from Aizu but whose \nfamily also served the Tokugawa directly. Their uniforms were usually gray \nwith brown hakama, from what I&#39;ve found. I haven&#39;t found a flag or banner \nyet...and I do have names of some members, from the group that supposedly \nkilled Ryoma and Nakaoka Shintarou:\n\nSasaki Tadasaburou, Imai Nobuo, Watanabe Yoshitarou, Takahashi Yasijirou, \nKatsura Junnosuke, Dohi Nakazou/Chuuzou, and Sakurai Daizaburou.\n\nI -am- keeping this an active point of research, so stay tuned.\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
