His alterior motive was to lead the group to protect the emporer,\nnot th=\r\ne shogun and to help Iemochi expell the foriegners.\n\n2.  At this time there=\r\n was an issue concerning the death of a british\nsubject. Brittan was demand=\r\ning reperations and if diplomatic relations\nfailed it could lead to war. Ki=\r\nyokawa was intent on leading the\nrishigumi to Edo in order to fight if it c=\r\name to that.\n\nMeanwhail, Kondou and Serizawa were rather miffed about being=\r\n &#39;lead\nastray&#39; or lied to.. however you look at it and decided to reamain\nb=\r\nehind to protect the Shogun and expell the foriengers.\n\n3. I&#39;m not certain =\r\nabout this question as all I have read has said\nthat both Serizawa and Kond=\r\nou were co-leaders.\n\nWhy was Serizawa a leader at all?  It may have been hi=\r\ns seniority in\nrank... it could have been because he had his own people who=\r\n followed\nonly him, it could have been due to him being a captain of the Te=\r\nngu\nParty. His alfa-male personality??? Or maybe cause his brother was in\nt=\r\nhe Aizu&#39;s police force?  \n\n4. Because he was an asshole. Because his action=\r\ns (quite nurmerous)\ncame to the attention of the head of the Aizu who reque=\r\nsted the he\nshould be assasinated. He was an extoritionist to say the least=\r\n, there\nare rumors of rape as well, acts of violence every five damn\nseccon=\r\nds... he was just a rather nasty individual... it seemed as if\nhe could do =\r\nwhat ever he wanted cause he was the son of a ranking\nsamuarai... no need t=\r\no follow the bushido for him !\n\n5.  The shinsengumi were to protect the sho=\r\ngunates interests in mibu.\nThere was lots of anti shogun activity and lawle=\r\nssness that the reg\npolice force couldn&#39;t cope with so they were kind of an=\r\n auxilery force\nand a squad of aizu-clan/ shogun approved assasines/ police=\r\n force.\n\n6. Because he was co-leader and when serizawa was assinated it jus=\r\nt\nseemed like the natural thing.. by the timem serizawa was killed so\nwere =\r\nhis most loyal supporters. Everyone else was loyal to Kondou and\nhis group.=\r\n\n\n7. The shinsengumi raided a meeting btwn the anti shogun activists who\nwe=\r\nre intending to burn down kyoto and kidnap the emporer. From what I\nhave re=\r\nad there were three shinsengumi fatalities.... as far as the\nanti-shogunate=\r\n ... most of them were killed.\n\n8. I&#39;m guessing becuase of what they preven=\r\nted (see above) and how\nsuccessfull they were with the small amount of peop=\r\nle involved.\n\n9. I dont remember this one... \n\n\n10. Class. Position. One ha=\r\nd to be born a samurai. If a person joined\nthe shinsengumi he became a samu=\r\nrai it was boost in statust that had\nnever before been available. Or maybe =\r\nto do something they considered\nimportant to give thier life meaning or the=\r\ny wanted to slaughter\npeople ....  in short... to be something greater than=\r\n they were, or to\nmake a name for themselvs.\n\n\n\n\n"
