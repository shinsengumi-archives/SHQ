For the RPG I&#39;m in (isn&#39;t that fun?) and=\r\n well, Rurouni Kenshin. I noticed that it&#39;s usually the precursor to most S=\r\nhinsengumi fans, myself included, unless they have access to NHK (or were p=\r\naying attention, at least ^^;;). We have NHK here but, regrettably, I wasn&#39;=\r\nt watching closely enough to have seen the series coming... :&#39;(\n\n----------=\r\n---------------------\n\n3) Do you have a favorite Shinsengumi member? Why?\n\n=\r\nIsn&#39;t it quite obvious? :D I have an irrepressible flair for the dramatic. =\r\nAnd as all fangirls go... *squee*! Kidding. I really don&#39;t know; maybe beca=\r\nuse I admire his strength and his genius. The ferocity that&#39;s hidden behind=\r\n that amiable face. As I said, an &quot;irreressible flair for the dramatic&quot;.\n \n=\r\nAnd Saitoh. He creeps the hell out of me. Sheer viciousness. He&#39;s not just =\r\nyour typical bad boy (don&#39;t we just love those?)\n \n------------------------=\r\n-------\n\n4) What Shinsengumi media have you read/seen?\n\n*sniff* Rurouni Ken=\r\nshin... although I am planning on getting my hands on my own set of the Pea=\r\ncemaker series, and vowed to tune into NHK more frequently than I used to..=\r\n. And I&#39;ve been badgering the people at Power Books to look for novels/book=\r\ns/whathaveyous about them. Is &quot;Of Spirits Walking in the Red Shadow&quot; Shinse=\r\nngumi-centric?\n \n-------------------------------\n\n5) In terms of film/telev=\r\nision portrayals what film (or series) do you \nthink captured your favorite=\r\n member(s) the best and why?\n\nI have no idea... \n\n-------------------------=\r\n--\n\n6) Do you have any questions that are nagging at you about any \nparticu=\r\nlar Shinsengumi members or events?\n\nHmm...
