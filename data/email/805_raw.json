This has to do with the physics of the swing etc etc...the\npart of the blade you want to use is really easy to see on a kendo\nshinai as there is rope/leather which &quot;bind&quot; the bamboo and basically\ndivide the the blade into &quot;parts&quot; so to speak.  \n\nUnlike an execution, in seppuku the &quot;second&quot; who beheads the person\ndoes not cut all the way through...he will cut in far enough to read\nthe skin at the front of the neck and pull the blade out which will\nprevent the head from simply &quot;falling&quot; on the ground (this happens in\na split second)...over time ritual suicide etiquette/procedures will\nchange to the point the person who commits suicide can mere point to\nhis stomach with a fan and the second will do his job...without the\nperson disemboweling himself.\n\nThere was a detailed account I read on how in an execution the person\ndoing the beheading is going for a certain point on the vertebra (this\nis common sense since he is cutting through...) but ~how~ one can\naccomplish this is beyond me...the point is they wanted the center\nbetween the base of the neck and shoulder...note that the best swords\ncan cut through 2-3 corpses (according to accounts of testing swords).\n\nIn the film Shinsengumi! BAnd of Assasins (starring Toshiro)...Kondou\nholds up his poney tail so the executioner can do his job...to me that\nseems weird...it would&#39;ve made more sense to tie his hair up rather\nthan hold his hair with his hand....in anycase none of the stuff I\nread really discusses the hair of the person about to be executed.\n\n\n\n\n"
