It was passable, as a program,\nbut will not contain any information you mostly didn&#39;t already know. \nThe timeline of the program runs from the first Tokugawa Shogun to the\nlast one.  (It does not particularly mention that a bloody war\nfollowed the fall of the Shogunate.)\n\nThe only sections I found even really remotely interesting were on the\nstrict laws and edicts of the third Tokugawa shogun, and the section\non the ease/difficulty of travel.\n\nAngrybee.\n\n\n"
