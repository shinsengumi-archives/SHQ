But=\r\n refined by you.\n&gt; Does she discuss women&#39;s educ. much?  You know scholars =\r\nlike LIncicome\n&gt; would want it (if it does cover education).\n&gt; \n&gt; Alot of p=\r\neople here on SHQ ML may like LIan Hearn&#39;s fiction and it&#39;s\n&gt; very awesome =\r\nshe wrote the intro to your book.  She&#39;s like the JK\n&gt; ROWLING of Japan/fan=\r\ntasy.  Please tell us of all your future projects\n&gt; so if some of us have t=\r\nhe money we can snap up the books.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hear Lian Hearn is planning possi=\r\nbly a BAKUMATSU BOOK----likely set\n&gt; in KYOTO?  Will the Shinsengumi make a=\r\n cameo appearance?  YOU MUST\n&gt; TELL US...we&#39;ll keep it our little secret (^=\r\n_^)...don&#39;t hold out on\n&gt; us...we fans don&#39;t have a whole lot to wait for.\n=\r\n&gt;\n\nNot sure the topic of her bakumatsu book, but Hearn actually\nparticipate=\r\nd in the Shinsengumi discussion group a few months back\nunder a pseudonym. =\r\nSo... maybe? :D  I sent her a bunch of journal\narticles about the bakumatsu=\r\n for her research, but there really wasn&#39;t\nmuch on the shinsengumi in them.=\r\n\n\nAlso, Haverford College has a huge collection of Anna Hartshorne&#39;s\nletter=\r\ns - I got about 10 of them copied and sent to me, hoping to get\ninformation=\r\n on her life, but they were mostly letters written to her -\none appeared to=\r\n be a love letter, and another one mentioned Tsuda Ume,\nand also Inazo Nito=\r\nbe.  You can find the collection with a google\nsearch on anna hartshorne - =\r\nthey have a huge collection if you are\ninterested - I think it was $10 plus=\r\n 25 cents per page. One problem is\nthat since they are hand written, they a=\r\nre hard to read, at least for\nme.  I&#39;m too used to reading Times New Roman.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Japan and Her People&quot; is a reprint of the 1902 book. It is mostly a\ntrav=\r\nelogue and history of the places she visited, most of the\ncontemporary info=\r\nrmation is on what the cities and places look like.\nThe cultural references=\r\n are more general, things like food and\nclothing, etc. - but I&#39;ve only edit=\r\ned half the book, my friend edited\nthe other half. I guess it&#39;s possible sh=\r\ne looks at education in the\nfirst half of the book, but I&#39;m not sure, I hav=\r\nen&#39;t read the entire\nbook yet. We are just publishing the first volume, at =\r\nleast for now.\n\n\n"
