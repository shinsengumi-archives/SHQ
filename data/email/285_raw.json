It started out as a manga, and the\nfirst story arc was made into an anime. It follows a \nboy named Musashi (written with the kanji for 3, 6,\nand 4) from his birth until young adulthood, as he\nlearns kendo and tries to become the top kendo\npractitioner in Japan. \n\nThere is one flashback scene (to the Showa era) in\nwhich a swordsman named Yamamoto Chujiro is practicing\ntsuki (thrust) on an empty can hung by a string. One\nday, an old man tries to do it. The can doesn&#39;t even\nmove, so Yamamoto thinks he missed. But when Yamamoto\ntakes a second look at the can...he sees that the old\nman had pierced a hole in the can without even moving\nit. It turns out that the old man was none other than\nSaitou Hajime himself. :)\n\nAs for whether this has anything to do with the real\nhistorical Saitou, I doubt it, but I was amused to\nfind yet another reference to him in a manga or anime\nI&#39;ve read/seen.\n\nTatsuko\n\n\n--- Tiffany &lt;makoto@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There was a post on\n&gt; www.3-hajime.com/cgi-local/patio/patio.cgi\n&gt; The title of the post is &quot;Anecdote of Late Year?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the babelfish translation...telling of an\n&gt; old Saito Hajime\n&gt; appearing in an anime...(Usual warning about\n&gt; babelfish)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It meaning that name of Saito one appears in the\n&gt; kendo cartoon,\n&gt; &quot;sword of 634&quot;, it does.\n&gt; As a story of former times, the alone boy being\n&gt; Kawahara, when you\n&gt; practice kendo, the old person coming, you say that\n&gt; try doing the\n&gt; bamboo sword.\n&gt; It was less crowded in the string and hung the can,\n&gt; practiced\n&gt; piercing, but aiming for that can, the old person\n&gt; extended the bamboo\n&gt; sword.\n&gt; But, the can does not move jerkily.\n&gt; When the boy tries seeing, you say that the hole\n&gt; opened in the can.\n&gt; You say that with the bamboo sword, the can was\n&gt; carried out.\n&gt; That was Saito one of late year.\n&gt; \n&gt; With it meaning that the anecdote which is said is\n&gt; riding, it does,\n&gt; but is this how probably what?\n&gt; The �� - the ��, you question, it\n&gt; becomes.\n&gt; Penetrating the being less crowded can which was\n&gt; hung to the string\n&gt; with the bamboo sword how, being possible?\n&gt; As an anecdote of Saito one, such a story it has\n&gt; been effective?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a reply to the post along the lines that\n&gt; it is uncertain\n&gt; whether or not this story was associated with\n&gt; historical S.H.  (The\n&gt; important thing to me is that he is in yet -another-\n&gt; anime LOL).\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
