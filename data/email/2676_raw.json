The reply came from the\n&gt; person who uploaded the torrent (a longtime member),\n&gt; stating that fansubbers don&#39;t tackle taiga dramas\n&gt; because of the difficulty of the language used for\n&gt; those and they rely on the subtitling that is\n&gt; provided by professionals.  Unfortunately, in this\n&gt; case, neither of the two main sources that have\n&gt; previously provided subtitles for taiga have\n&gt; provided them for this.  **shrug**  Like I said,\n&gt; we&#39;ll just have to see if someone does considering\n&gt; the drama itself was so popular.\n\nI can&#39;t use torrent here at home (download limits), so\nI&#39;ll try downloading it elsewhere. After I get it,\nI&#39;ll sub it in my free time and post the .ssa here in\nthe list. Then, it is sufficient to use DirectVobSub\nor the like to see the subtitles.\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________________ \nYahoo!
