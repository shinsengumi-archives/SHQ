I purposely put in the babelfish translation even though it was worse than usual just so you&#39;d bite on &quot;demon circular.&quot;  I wondered the same thing, but I couldn&#39;t remember if there was more to the name of Saitou&#39;s sword and I&#39;m just not up to searching in past messages.  I figured you&#39;d know (or at least find it noteworthy).\n \n&gt;&gt;?...imagine Shinsengumi captains Saitou &quot;my sword is xxxx&quot;, \nMiki &quot;so&#39;s mine&quot;...then they just go on and on about the history of their swords&lt;&lt;\n\nWhile they both down plenty of sake, I&#39;m sure.  That could&#39;ve been a riot (perhaps literally).  ;-)  Something else the site (and momoiro) mentioned was that Suzuki had a lifelong drinking problem.\n\n&gt;&gt;now with all these tales of Shinsengumi grandpas I imagine their grandsons and granddaughters...at school saying things like &quot;my grandpa can kick your grandpa&#39;s *ss&quot;&lt;&lt;\n\nAnd maybe that was good enough reason to stay away from each other.  :-D  Kids say the darnedest things, like giving away your hiding place.  With what appears to be *seven* grandkids from Tsutomu alone (looking at the family tree M provided), maybe Saitou had good reason to be always on alert.  :-D\n\nWe should start a grandpa file to keep all these stories...  they&#39;re such a treat!\n\nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
