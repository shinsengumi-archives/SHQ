I&#39;m partial to humour a la Gintama, and I&#39;m\nglad to see that it&#39;s going out to a wider\n(English-speaking) audience. Gin-san reminds me a bit\nof Kenshin (both have dark pasts) but in my opinion,\nhe is much more fun (ducks flying objects from Kenshin\nfans). \nAnd Okita and Kagura are great characters. Y&#39;know if I\nwas a bit more obsessive, I&#39;d petition Sorachi to\nintroduce Saitou Hajime. \n\nMio. \n\n--- guuchan &lt;jungleguuchan@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nGintama - A Shounen jump title which features an AU\nBakamatsu universe replete with Aliens has apparently\nbeen picked up by Viz, and will be released in English\nat a to be announced date.\n\nActually, I quite like the manga -- even though it\nprobably is a bit irreverent in its treatment of\nhistory. I find the characterizations of the\nShinsengumi and the Ishin to be inspired, although not\nexactly serious.  The names aren&#39;t quite the same, but\nyou&#39;ll easily recognize Kondou, Hijikata, Okita,\nYamazaki and from the Ishin: Sakamoto, Katsura and\nTakasugi.\n\nThis is the only English fansite that I am aware of at\nthe moment: http://www.yorozuya.cjb.net/ \n\nYes there are (were) scanslations, but I suspect these\nwill be yanked out of deference to Viz.  \n\n-S\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
