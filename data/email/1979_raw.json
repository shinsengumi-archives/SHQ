There is a new film featuring our \nfavorite boys in blue called: Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage. \n\nI haven&#39;t seen it, but from what I can understand it is not a \nstrictly historical movie, it&#39;s a fiction where Satsuma sends five \nKunoichi to spy on the Shinsengumi. Apparently, it also involves some \nsupernatural events. I&#39;m under the impression that it is not really a \nmasterpiece, but if you are interrested, more info can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.dvdlister.com/title.dvd/66d19V6634fs433aceT/\n\nMary-Ann\n\n\n\n\n"
