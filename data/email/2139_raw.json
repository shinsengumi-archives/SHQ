THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENC=\r\nES in the \nmovie and the book especially the assassination of Serizawa Kamo=\r\n \n(which was not shown in the film).\nHuh?! Then somehow we saw two VERY dif=\r\nferent &quot;Sword of Doom&quot; movies with \nToshiro Mifune...\n\nIn the movie, Seriza=\r\nwa and Ryunosuke are off in that room with all the bamboo \nscreens (?) and =\r\nSerizawa is telling him he wants him to kill Kondo. &quot;After \nthat, Hijikata =\r\nwill be easy to control...&quot; (Yeah, that&#39;s what the Meiji \ngovernment though=\r\nt too.)  They catch some girl spying on them (for that Utsuki Hyoma \nguy), =\r\nRyunosuke says he&#39;ll dispose of her, and Serizawa  leaves. Ryu-chan very \nk=\r\nindly decides to let her live and tells her she just has to stay there a \ns=\r\nhort while.\n\nMeanwhile, Hijikata, Kondo, and I -think- Yamanami (or was it =\r\nOkita?) were \noff in their own little corner and Hijikata is telling Kondo =\r\nthey should go \nahead and finish off Serizawa.  At some point, in the middl=\r\ne of that weird little \nscene where the girl thinks she sees the ghost of a=\r\n murdered woman and \nRyunosuke starts going nuts, it flips over briefly to =\r\nHijikata and the others rushing \ninto the room Serizawa is sleeping in and =\r\nkilling him. Then it goes back to \nRyunosuke, who is slashing everything in=\r\n sight (blinds, Shinsengumi, etc.) and \nscreaming &quot;Serizawa! I&#39;ll do it! I&#39;=\r\nll kill Kondo for you! Serizawa!&quot; Then it \njust ends.\n\nI&#39;m told there is a =\r\nsequel to this movie, which I have yet to see.
