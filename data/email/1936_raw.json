Needless\nto say (?!), she eventually falls in love with one of\nthe members -- or is supposed to do so, since she is\nthe main character of the story, controlled by the\nplayer :D\n\nThis is a game meant for girls and not for boys (for\nobvious reasons). And it is about falling in love with\none of the many Shinsengumi members, which happen to\nbe almost all bishonen :D Except Yamazaki Susumu, who\nhappens to be gay in the game O_O (and with a costume\nsuspiciously similar to Misao in Rurouni Kenshin) It\nis kind of an animated shoujo manga.\n\nFor those who want to check the opening movie, it is\nlocated at:\n\nhttp://www.d3p.co.jp/shinsengumi/sin_op.wmv\n\n(by the way: Miki Shin-ichiro is the voice actor for\nSaito Hajime in this game)\n\nIt will cost 5040 yen and in the first (limited)\nedition, it will present also a calendar for 2005.\n\n\n=====\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
