As we see in that volume, Kenshin never intervened=\r\n at Ikedaya, only becoming aware of the events once everything is over. He =\r\nthen assists to the Shinsengumi &quot;parade&quot; and exchange a long look with Sait=\r\no. Kenshin then thinks &quot;J&#39;ai l&#39;impression que je reverrai souvent cet homme=\r\n...&quot; or if I&#39;m translating from the French version &quot;I was under the impress=\r\nion that I would often see that man in the future...&quot;, implying that they d=\r\nidn&#39;t knew each other yet.\n\nThen, in volume 21, once Tomoe is dead (sorry, =\r\nif I&#39;m spoiling that to anyone, but... where have you been?) Kenshin return=\r\ns to Kyoto and soon engage in a duel with Saito for the first time. Seeing =\r\nhim, Saito says &quot;Je me disais bien que ce n&#39;=C3=A9tait pas un sabreur ordin=\r\naire... c&#39;=C3=A9tait donc cela&quot; or &quot;I thought he was no ordinary swordsman.=\r\n.. this explains it...&quot;, meaning that he just understood that the man he sa=\r\nw in the crowd after Ikedaya is Battosai. \n\nSo knowing this, it then become=\r\ns clear that the scene in volume 7 (or episode 28) does not happens at Iked=\r\naya, like many people thinks, but WAY after Ikedaya. It really is a common =\r\nmistake as I&#39;ve also been under that impression for a long time.\n\nMary-Ann\n=\r\n\n\nnlf7 &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:                               Only one word =\r\nhas to be corrected, &quot; Ikedaya.&quot; Please refer to my original \n message for =\r\nmore information.  In addition, I&#39;ve uploaded a screen cap of the \n name of=\r\n the inn from ep.28. (By the way, could anyone read that? I know it&#39;s \n not=\r\n &quot; Ikedaya&quot;  but what is it?) \n \n http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_=\r\nDivision/photos/view/470f?b=3D17\n \n http://us.a2.yahoofs.com/groups/g_12287=\r\n916/470f/__sr_/\n 10fb.jpg?grw9tjEB31NWQEpO\n I&#39;ve explained this one to peop=\r\nle nearly 100 times.
