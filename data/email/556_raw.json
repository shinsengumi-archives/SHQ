It&#39;s the battle at Goryokaku that is supposed to be in it. They could have completely skipped over his part in all that easily. It&#39;s more about some ninja kid or the like. I just thought that if they did show anything of the war in Hokkaido it might be worth my while. That&#39;s what I&#39;m really trying to find out.\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
