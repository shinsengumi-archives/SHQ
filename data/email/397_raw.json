I&#39;ve \nbeen \n&gt; watching the last few episodes of the NHK Shinsengumi (un subtitled \n&gt; *sigh*) and I came into it when Kondou was trying to get in with \nthe \n&gt; Roshigumi that was forming to  head to Kyoto.\n&gt; \n&gt; A bit ago I was looking at the characters&#39; pictures on the NHK \nwebsite \n&gt; trying to figure out who this kid is that Nagakura keeps having \nwords \n&gt; with, and while clicking through the name banners to find said kid \nI \n&gt; clicked on the pic of the actor playing  Sasaki Tadasaburo and the \n&gt; proverbial light bulb went off over my head, \n&gt; \n&gt; He&#39;s one of the two main leaders of the Roshigumi! He and Serizawa \nKamo \n&gt; have a serious dislike for one another and he and the other top guy \nin \n&gt; the Roshigumi (names escapes me) are always at odds.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the previews at the end of last week&#39;s show Saitou \nfinally \n&gt; hits Kyoto so maybe we&#39;ll see the connection?  I will do my best to \n&gt; decipher something from the body language/facial expressions.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\t\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n"
