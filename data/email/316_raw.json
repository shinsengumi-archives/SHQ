NEW INFO!!!!!!!!\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=122717733\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: mg_batt\r\n\r\nWell babelfish or no babelfish, the info you give to the group are \nalways interesting.. This one is definitely is. I am wondering though \nwhy he got detained... So he didn&#39;t do something criminal... Well \nunfortunately, what&#39;s going to my head is that he drank a bottle too \nmany and something happened... I know.. I know... I&#39;m not being \nfair... I usually don&#39;t think this way of Saitou-sama... Please let \nus know soon.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; uh oh you think...Tiffany is using babelfish again...\n&gt; -NOPE-\n&gt; My university had a special event with artists/delegates from the\n&gt; Chiba Perfecture Japan (sister city to my city)(dance/kendo\n&gt; demo/puppet skit/blurb on the hakkenden etc) and so I attended the \nevent.\n&gt; I just ~happen~ to be carrying around the book Saitou Hajime No \nSubete\n&gt; with me and I tried to communicate with them.  Fortunatly, they \nhappen\n&gt; to know about the Shinsengumi (one lady definately knew about S.H.\n&gt; based on the film Mibugishiden because I heard her say Sato \n&gt; Hiroshi---the name of the actor who played S.H. in the film---I&#39;m\n&gt; pretty sure) and so they were flipping through the book and \nchattering\n&gt; amongst themselves for a while and I was just standing there like \nthe\n&gt; idiot that I am...I didn&#39;t want to impose and say &quot;translate this\n&gt; now!&quot; (Like we do to Serizawa Kamo and Shimazuryu)...of all the pics\n&gt; they picked out ones of where Saitou lived before finding work in \nTokyo...\n&gt; \n&gt; p.147 +148 (Shimazuryu if you are interested) pic shows a forest and\n&gt; the 2nd shows an empty field (used to have houses)\n&gt; \n&gt; p.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern building\n&gt; used as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a prison/jail but a &quot;place where people could not leave until\n&gt; they know they did wrong&quot;...so I was trying to ask her if he \ncommitted\n&gt; a crime or did something &#39;bad&#39; (robbery, murder etc) of some sort \nand\n&gt; she said &#39;no&#39; and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he \nwas\n&gt; a police officer?  And I was like &quot;yes&quot; (so the pages must deal w/\n&gt; Fujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word &quot;discipline&quot; and \nso\n&gt; she was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,\n&gt; disciplinary issue and this detention center that he &quot;stayed&quot; at.  I\n&gt; kept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like \nyes\n&gt; he stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he \nWORKED\n&gt; there...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because if \nyou\n&gt; think about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a\n&gt; prison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he was\n&gt; formerly &quot;disciplined&quot; for something...because I trying really hard \nto\n&gt; be sure that he wasn&#39;t just a prison guard but she was trying to\n&gt; communicate that he did something &#39;bad&#39; but not &#39;criminal&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Geez...maybe there is something to S.H. being a &quot;psycho-cop&quot; as \nMisao\n&gt; said -_-\n&gt; \n&gt; Will scan pics when I can get to a scanner.\n\n\n"
