From a message from Chris Patton to his fan group:\n \n&gt;&gt;Also, ADV announced Peacemaker, which I believe I will have a role in, though of course nothing can be officially confirmed or denied as of yet. (wink wink).&lt;&lt;\n\nIs there another anime by that name or is it what I think?\n\nSmall world... I &quot;met&quot; Chris through livejournal and when he discontinued his personal journal a few weeks ago (which was a major bummer because it was always such a delight to read), I joined his yahoogroup fan group to keep tabs on what he was up to.  (He&#39;s extremely personable and in tune with his fans, but I&#39;ve had no desire to pelt him with e-mails of &quot;so what&#39;s new?&quot;... you know what I mean?  It was different when it was through lj.)  Anyway, if he is talking about PMK, I&#39;ll see if he or his manager will keep me up to date so I can pass it on here.\n\nIf you&#39;re as unfamiliar with Chris&#39; work as I was (and still am, really, since I&#39;m not into anime in any big way), check the CrystalAcids entry for him at http://www.crystalacids.com/database/actor/patton_christopher.html.  He was lead character in &quot;Pretear&quot; and &quot;Spriggan&quot; and did several episode characters for &quot;Saiyuki.&quot;  He&#39;s done quite a bit of work and just keeps getting busier...\n\nphil (tap, tap, tap... &lt;waiting&gt;)\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
