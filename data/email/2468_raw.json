Through this list \nI have met several people who have a ver=\r\ny realistic view of the \nShinsengumi and they also enjoy their fictional sp=\r\nin-offs.  What I \nfound to be very interesting about the site is the mixtur=\r\ne of some \nsound facts and plenty of opinions.  I could not find the author=\r\n&#39;s \nlist of textual sources (maybe there is a list---I just can&#39;t find \nit)=\r\n.  Since most of us can&#39;t time travel or do not know Japanese it \nis necess=\r\nary to look for books/articles written by those who know \nmore than we do. =\r\n This is why I have tried to be thorough and \ncareful in citing my sources =\r\nso if you wish you can double check my \nown work, you CAN---establish a pap=\r\ner trail and giving credit where \nit is due.  For example the webmaster at =\r\none point said Nakajima \nNobori was enthusiastic about photography---as a N=\r\nakajima Nobori fan \nI&#39;d like to know where he got this detail. So these sit=\r\nes are useful \nin gauging people&#39;s changing views but they may not be as he=\r\nlpful in \nthe long run if you want to dig deeper into the history.\n\nHis/her=\r\n discussion in Shinsengumi opinions on foreigners is also \ninteresting.\n\n[s=\r\nide note:  Fujita Goro was assigned, at one point,  to work the \nAzabu area=\r\n in Tokyo.  Azabu was where many foreign missionaries \nlived.  The area dur=\r\ning the Meiji Era was described in extreme terms \nas very &quot;good&quot; due to the=\r\n foreigners and also very &quot;bad&quot; due to the \nhigh number of poor people (the=\r\n missionaries proselytized and setup \norphanages and schools for the poor).=\r\n  Basically, later in life \nFujita Goro *had* to encounter foreigners throu=\r\ngh his work in Azabu, \nat the Education Museum and later Tokyo Womens Norma=\r\nl School.  It \nwould be interesting to learn how former Shinsengumi may hav=\r\ne felt \nabout foreigners as time past.\n------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n\nWhat happened to ShinsengumiMB.com?   \n\nAs S=\r\npiritus Saitou mentioned, the board was severely damaged due to \nsomeone ha=\r\ncking into ezboard.com.

Recall the TV series=\r\n Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s Saitou in the \nother title sequence\n\n.....Not exactly...=\r\n..  \n\nThe answer lies in the development of the Japanese police.  From the =\r\n\n1870s to 1879 (Toshiyoshi Kawaji dies) the French model was \nadopted.  In =\r\nthe 1880s onward led by Yamagata Aritomo the German \npolice model was imple=\r\nmented.  The gloves come from France&#39;s Eug=E8ne \nFran=E7ois Vidocq   who wa=\r\ns a career criminal who later became a super \nspy for the police (his crimi=\r\nnal ways later led to his downfall).  \nVidocq had a team of former criminal=\r\ns who worked with him.  The \npublic saw the police as criminals in uniform.=\r\n  The police in turn \nwore white gloves because gloves prevented them from =\r\npicking \npockets.  Bare hands are needed to determine if the victim is \ncar=\r\nrying valuables.  Bare hands (skin) provides the traction needed \nto remove=\r\n those valuables.\n\n\n\n\n"
