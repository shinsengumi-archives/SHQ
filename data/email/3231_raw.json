It&#39;s n=\r\not like she did\nanything to provoke him...not really...it was an accident..=\r\n.\n\n* * * *\n\nI lay down on the futon again but knew that I&#39;d never fall back=\r\n to\nsleep. My brain buzzed with a million and three questions, the first\nbe=\r\ning=97how was I ever going to get back home when I wasn&#39;t even\nquite sure h=\r\now I got here?\n\nI sat up and crinkled my nose. A breeze blew through the ti=\r\nny window set\nhigh in the wall outside the cell and the smell it carried re=\r\nminded me\nof the chamberpot&#39;s existence. Bad enough the place stunk because=\r\n of\nthe male prisoners&#39; waste, but I really didn&#39;t want anything of\nthe sor=\r\nt to be closer to me than necessary.\n\nI remembered that Yamanami went out l=\r\nast night to relieve his own\nbladder and I didn&#39;t recall him unlocking the =\r\nouter door before\nexiting, so maybe it wasn&#39;t locked. I could go out, leave=\r\n the pot\nthen come back and wait to be formally sprung. After all, it&#39;s not=\r\n\nlike I was a criminal prisoner or anything.\n\nI retrieved the chamberpot ca=\r\nrefully, moving slowly so as not to spill\nit. I tiptoed between the futon a=\r\nnd the sleeping samurai leader and\nhoped he didn&#39;t decide to stretch out hi=\r\ns legs. I stepped over him\nwithout any disaster and breathed a quick sigh o=\r\nf relief. I inched to\nthe door not wanting to draw the attention of those g=\r\nross guys down the\nway.\n\nI&#39;m almost home free, I thought, testing the door =\r\nby nudging it with\nmy foot. It gave way a bit and I turned sideways to push=\r\n it open with my\nshoulder.\n\nThe next thing I knew, the door flew open. I pi=\r\ntched outward and the pot\nflew out of my hands=97\n\nRight into the center of=\r\n Toshizou Hijikata&#39;s chest. He roared an\nobscenity so loud it had to wake h=\r\nalf of Kyoto.\n\nI fell to my knees partly as a sign of apology, partly to pr=\r\nay that he\nwouldn&#39;t slice my head off. I looked up a bit and winced. The ti=\r\nssue\nI&#39;d used as toilet paper had deposited itself right in the center of\nh=\r\nis low obi.\n\nI bent my head to the ground and apologized profusely in Japan=\r\nese the\nbest I could. I begged his forgiveness, adding that I was a complet=\r\ne\nfool who didn&#39;t deserve his mercy.\n\nAfter all, when confronted with angry=\r\n men who brandished sharp,\ndangerous objects, it seemed wise to push one&#39;s =\r\nmodern pride aside\nand grovel.\n\nEspecially after one dumped a pot of pee on=\r\n them.\n\n* * * *\n\n~Barb Sheridan/Chloe Michelle\nhttp://chloemichelle.com\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
