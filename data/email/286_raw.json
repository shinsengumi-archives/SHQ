I don&#39;t know how similar Japanese imprisonment \n&gt; &gt; systems were to western at the time, but given that so much of the \n&gt; &gt; police and armed forces were being patterned after European models, \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; would expect them working on similar ideas in prison reform.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If they were incorporating western ideas (or maybe it was practiced \n&gt; &gt; in Japan, too, before westernization attempts), it would NOT be \n&gt; &gt; unusual for Fujita Gorou to be living at the facility as an \n&gt; &gt; employee.  What I&#39;m getting from all of this history on prisons \n&gt; &gt; (again, US & European... unfortunately) is that it was more usual \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; prison staff to live on or near the prison grounds in the 19th into \n&gt; &gt; the 20th centuries, from the warden on down.   Alcatraz, for \n&gt; &gt; instance, had a community for staff families on the island itself.  \n&gt; &gt; What are the dates for this assignment?  Was it before he married \n&gt; &gt; Tokio & his sons were born?  I can imagine the bachelor Fujita (or \n&gt; &gt; even married) living in quarters at the facility.  From what you \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; saying the woman told you, it sounds to me that that was exactly \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; case --- he was an officer working at the detention center and he \n&gt; &gt; lived there like other staff.  I don&#39;t come to the conclusion you \n&gt; &gt; do.  (But then, my head is currently stuffed with prison \n&gt; history... :-\n&gt; &gt; D)  Needs to be explored!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *DEFINITELY* fascinating new info, though.  I&#39;ve been thinking \n&gt; &gt; recently about how he might regard incarceration --- in terms of \n&gt; &gt; practices and who he could be seeing locked up... maybe more & more \n&gt; &gt; young people (ahem... like Sano)without opportunity and few options \n&gt; &gt; but to turn to crime just to eat.  Anyone have any good sources for \n&gt; &gt; info about crime statistics during the Meiji, especially in the \n&gt; first \n&gt; &gt; decade or two? (and more than how many were arrested for peeing in \n&gt; &gt; public!)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to know more when you find out!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; phil\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;makoto@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; p.214 is VERY interesting BECAUSE it shows a pretty modern \n&gt; building\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used as a detention center.  The lady was explaining to me that it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t a prison/jail but a &quot;place where people could not leave \n&gt; until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they know they did wrong&quot;...so I was trying to ask her if he \n&gt; &gt; committed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a crime or did something &#39;bad&#39; (robbery, murder etc) of some sort \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she said &#39;no&#39; and she was skimming the pages and asked whether he \n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a police officer?  And I was like &quot;yes&quot; (so the pages must deal w/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fujita Goro time frame)...she kept using the word &quot;discipline&quot; \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she was trying to convey something to do with being a policeman,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disciplinary issue and this detention center that he &quot;stayed&quot; \n&gt; at.  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kept asking if S.H. stayed there to be 100% sure and she was like \n&gt; &gt; yes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he stayed there. BUT what I was trying to figure out was if he \n&gt; &gt; WORKED\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there...and she made herself clear that he LIVED there. Because \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think about it --- it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to throw a cop in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prison with criminal scum. So preliminary speculation is that he \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; formerly &quot;disciplined&quot; for something...because I trying really \n&gt; hard \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be sure that he wasn&#39;t just a prison guard but she was trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communicate that he did something &#39;bad&#39; but not &#39;criminal&#39;.\n\n\n"
