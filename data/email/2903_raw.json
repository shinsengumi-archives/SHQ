Therefore,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kondou Isami was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first adopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name Kondou sometime\n&gt; after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1858.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s birth\n&gt; (but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s not the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as the head of the Okita family\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a short time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (possibly less than a year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the family.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family\n&gt; until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Souji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got married. Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s son\n&gt; Yoshijirou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would probably\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have become Souji&#39;s heir (and would likely have married Souji&#39;s eldest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; daughter.) I suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kanamasa&#39;s daughter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instead. However, considering that Souji&#39;s son would&#39;ve been quite a\n&gt; few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years younger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this\n&gt; would&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been the case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If one could change their status through purchase or adoption then\n&gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all just a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; formality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; During the Bakumatsu? more or less, perhaps.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~Seven\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;zhusanna&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;wsehome@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Calling on our knowlegdeable history people...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why did people change their names so much? It was the samurai&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; custom! Many samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed their name twice, but Okita had only changed his name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once. Yes, a samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed his (full)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. Why? I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not sure...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From Wikipedia:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugoro in 1849,\n&gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have? I thought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been given) a name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to honor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his name from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating himself from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first? Could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ****\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Okita Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.) He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; served as a retainer for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; young Souji.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Okita family could have needed the additional financial\n&gt; support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the head of the Okita\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family for a short time (not sure how short...)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, if Katsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be head of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okita family because Souji was too young...what happened when\n&gt; Souji&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother married Rintarou Mototsune? RM displaced RK as head of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family? Then after RM&#39;s death RK was reinstated? And what would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have happened if Souji had lived longer? Would he have replaced RK?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, if one could change their status through purchase or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adoption then it&#39;s all just a formality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks everyone for being patient with my questions!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Wanda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
