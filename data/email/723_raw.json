Obviously, the tiger design was not draw merely\nfor the sake of aesthetics...but also symbolism...Hijikata&#39;s ferocity\nas a warrior. To see the pic go here http://www.tamahito.com/\n(Hijikata is on the right and Kondo is on the left). So my point\nis...he uses symbolism in his work.\n\nBasically, many gods in both the Chinese and Japanese Buddhist\npantheon are derived from the Hindu pantheon (they just go through a\nname change just like Greek&gt;&gt;&gt;Roman gods/goddesses). \nSo just recall S.H. portrait by N.N. and look at these sculptures of\nBishamonten\nhttp://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/students/nrclark/\nhttp://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/bishamonten.shtml\nsame or similar postures can also be found in depictions of Siva or\nother major Hindu goddesses with just one foot on the\ndwarf/yaksha(usually giants but made small next to a god/goddess) of\nignorance/fear.\n\nKeep in mind that N.N. is an artist and he painted all these portraits\n-and- wrote his memoirs while he was a prisoner of war...so he had\nplenty of time to think...this was also probably part of his own\npersonal healing process and a way to salute people he had fought with\n(he took to the field on numerous occasions during major battles\nduring the opening of the Boshin war and at Aizu, and he went w/\nHijikata to Hakodate). So N.N. like all artists are a bit romantic\n(the guy did own a firearms store AND cultivated orchids too\ngeez)...note how his portrayal of the mysterious 17 year old heroine\nof Aizu is shown in battle with a beautiful kimono etc.  \n\nThe Japanese webpage which displayed his work was sadly deactivated\ndue to inactivity http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Palace/8636/bekkan.html\nTo me, his work is very valuable...each person has unique features,\nsome faces capture, fear, anger, pain...one had a man with his hands\nover a leg wound but he looked eager to return to the battle...one was\nof a very young boy had blood streaming down his ankles.  The images\nare graphic but very honest.\n\nI have an old thread at http://www.shinsengumimb.com about N.N.\nhttp://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.showMessage?topicID=11.topic\n\nJust a side note...I know I&#39;m repeating myself from old posts but his\ninfo on the people he painted are innaccurate...take for instance the\nguys who stayed to fight at Buddha Hall didn&#39;t all DIE...a couple\nsurvived I think one guy lived to be 90! But I and perhaps a couple of\nyou too may wonder if he didn&#39;t make these mistakes on purpose\nsometimes just to cover for his buddies.  If he painted these while a\nprisoner I imagine a guard tapping him on the shoulder and asking \nprison guard:  &quot;who are those guys?&quot;\nN.N.: &quot;They are friends and sadly they have all perished&quot; (puts the\nback of wrist to forehead).\nprison guard: &quot;oh, okay carry on...&quot;\nN.N. proceeds to paint and paint 40 works\n\nEventhough N.N. seemed to have painted them for himself, who would buy\nportraits of the loser Shinsengumi? N.N. was the son of a merchant and\nI doubt N.N. was a career artist.  Atleast the prisoners around him\nmust&#39;ve seen his work because I&#39;ve seen photos of an exhibit (online\nand each portrait was around -I&#39;m guessing- 2.5&quot;).  \n\n\n\n\n"
