Most things in English, deal with th=\r\ne Meiji era.\n\nIt is actually our good fortune that both Mr. and Mrs. Fujita=\r\n worked\nat a high profile school known as Tokyo Women&#39;s NOrmal School (late=\r\nr\nTokyo Women&#39;s Higher NOrmal School and then Ochanomizo).\n\nFor new members=\r\n please read\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/TakagiTokioinfo.htm\n\nI used Tokio=\r\n&#39;s cousin as an anchor in the research.\n\nThroughout this time I had no idea=\r\n who the &quot;other&quot; principal who kept\nswitching with Takamine Hideo (tokio&#39;s =\r\ncousin) of the school was.\n\nA Japanese thread was discussing Mr. Fujita&#39;s w=\r\nork not only as an\noffice clerk but a teacher of kenjutsu at the Normal Sch=\r\nool (for men).\n SAdly, the posters were wrestling with the structure of the=\r\n school\nand timeline --- lucky for me I had been obsessing over Tokio&#39;s cou=\r\nsin\nand understood some of the educational structure.\nThey did not cite the=\r\nir textual source---but their hint was good enough.\n\nThe other principal wa=\r\ns Jigoro Kano.\nPlease see this timeline http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4795=\r\n/kano.html\nhe became principal after Takamine Hideo resigned in 1893 (techn=\r\nically\nforced to resign). \nAfter Takamine returned in 1897, Kano resigned s=\r\no they alternated.\nKano returns in 1901 (which coincides with the beginning=\r\n of Takamine&#39;s\nstruggle with severe depression however he remained an influ=\r\nential\nfigure).\n\nok let&#39;s compare with Goro&#39;s timeline\nhe works at the educ=\r\nation museum in 1891\ngets a job at Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School in 1899\n\nthe=\r\n structure of the hierarchy of the Normal Schools (teacher training\nacademy=\r\n) was like this\n\nTokyo Normal School (men)\nTokyo Women&#39;s Normal School (wom=\r\nen)\nEducational Museum\n\nit was like a giant pyramid with overlapping facult=\r\ny, staff and even\nbudget...students of both normal schools even used materi=\r\nal right out\nof the museum and frequently the top tier staff held concurren=\r\nt\npositions in the museum\n\nthe Museum was used for the purpose of &quot;object t=\r\neaching&quot; which was the\nstyle used at both normal schools and nationwide--th=\r\nis is why the\nmuseum was another branch of the schools\n\nKOdokan Judo (Jigor=\r\no Kano&#39;s claim to fame) was the OFFICIAL\ncompetition to the Tokyo Metropoli=\r\ntan Police Department\nit was always of interest to me how Kodokan Judo/dojo=\r\n had a minor Aizu\nconnection and at one time located in the same ward as th=\r\ne Fujita\nhousehold\n\nJIgoro Kano in partnership with Dr. Baelz (German who t=\r\nreated many VIP\nMeiji figures) were able to introduce modern kendo and judo=\r\n (to a\nlesser extent) into the education system.  Kendo was favored because=\r\n\nit was more safe.\n\nI have a hard time believing that the principal, an acc=\r\nomplished\nmartial artist, and deeply interested in Physical Education was\nc=\r\nompletely oblivious to a member of the office staff who was also a\npractiti=\r\noner of kenjutsu.\n\nBefore leaving his position at the school I believe TAka=\r\nmine would be\nsure to point out which members of the faculty and staff Kano=\r\n should\ncare for.  Takamine would be sure to highlight their special talent=\r\ns\nas well.  AFterall the Mr. and Mrs. Fujita were both family and friend\nto=\r\n Takamine.\n\nPrincipals also had access to all resumes of the staff---how wo=\r\nuld\nKano, who dealt with the TMPD not be interested in former assistant\nins=\r\npector Fujita who also worked as body guard to Inoue Kaoru and\nEmpress Dowa=\r\nger?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
