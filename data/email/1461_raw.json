Are they higher or lower than the Fujita&#39;s? It \n&gt;would be interesting if Tatsuo was from a higher family, coz if so, I \n&gt;wonder if he harbored regrets being associated with biological \n&gt;parents with lower status... \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAlthough we cannot be positive while Sec and I were pondering this very \nthing over IM yesterday a quick Google search pointed out that the \nname/word Numazawa is _very_ prominent in the Aizu-Wakumatsu  area in \nterms of many thngs/places carrying the name so we decided--assummed \nthat the family may have been quite important in terms of the history of \nAizu and that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t want to fade away.Can&#39;&#39;t have a village \nof Numazawa without any live Numazawas to lord over it now can you *grin*\n\nAs I said this is _All conjecture_ from two active imaginations However \nit makes perfect sense in terms of the ever -loyal Fujitas being willing \nto give up a son &quot;for the cause/clan&quot;.\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
