I have to note that Toshiyoshi Kawaji died in 1879 and in the \n1880s alot of changes will occur due to Yamagata Aritomo&#39;s increase \nin political power.\n-------------------------------\n50% done music vid (^_^) so the latter half has no footage and yes \nit is primitive I don&#39;t have access to high end movie editing \nprograms...so it is a slide show and animated frame by frame (-_-)\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/hotwolf.WMV (2256KB)\n**I&#39;m hoping the 2nd half will be a bit more *professional* \n\n\n\n\n"
