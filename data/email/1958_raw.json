So Hijikata&#39;s diary may not contain much about him as a person, or about sensitive stuff (unlikely for ex that he wrote down things about the assassination of Serizawa or of Itou, in case someone found it). but we can always hope!\n\n\n*Grin* Can we dare to hope he might elaborate on what happened during those \nthree days with Saito?!\n\n\n...three days with Saitou?
