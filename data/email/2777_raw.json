The information is from a member who&#39;s been watching=\r\n and dealing in jdrama (and with KIKU) for a very long time.  If the link w=\r\nill copy here, the full topic is at \n  http://d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic=\r\n_p438163.htm#438163 .  I&#39;m quoting without permission, too, but felt this w=\r\nould be easier to communicate the issue.\n   \n    &gt;&gt;Do you think the subs go=\r\nnna be realeasd?\n    &gt;&gt;No, because TV Japan and KIKU-TV are not making Engl=\r\nish subs for this SP. Taiga dramas are never subbed by fansubbers because, =\r\nlike you said, the old language is too difficult to interpret. Traditionall=\r\ny we rely on the professionals for subs of taiga and many other jidaigeki/p=\r\neriod dramas.\n    The version of Shinsengumi uploaded on D-Addicts was subb=\r\ned by TV Japan of New York USA, which is a partner of NHK. To date, there a=\r\nre no fansubs of taiga dramas because up to today there is no need for fans=\r\nubs. \n\nBrief review... Until Yoshitsune in 2005, two companies made subtitl=\r\nes for taiga dramas: TV Japan and JN Productions of Hawaii USA (using KIKU-=\r\nTV to broadcast.) The taiga dramas you see on the Internet was subbed by on=\r\ne of the two companies, depending on who provided the resources. \n\nIn the c=\r\nontinental US TV stations, the subs were provided by TV Japan. I&#39;m not sure=\r\n who did the subbing prior to Toshiie to Matsu. \n\nIn Hawaii, the subs were =\r\nprovided by JN Productions, and aired on KIKU-TV. One exception to this is =\r\nShinsengumi (2004)... The first 25-percent or so of the series was subbed b=\r\ny JN Productions. In April 2004, ties between KIKU-TV and JNP were broken, =\r\nso KIKU-TV subbed the remaining 75-percent of Shinsengumi in-house. I&#39;ve ye=\r\nt to see the JNP/KIKU-TV version released to the Internet. \n\nIt is easy to =\r\ntell who subbed what... \n- If the subs are white and two-lines, they&#39;re JN =\r\nProduction subs. \n- If the subs are white and three-lines, they&#39;re KIKU-TV =\r\n(in-house) subs. \n- If the subs are yellow and two-lines, they&#39;re TV Japan =\r\n&lt;&lt;\n   \n  For what it&#39;s worth. I don&#39;t know what this means for future taiga=\r\n dramas (I haven&#39;t been following this season&#39;s & don&#39;t know if NHK & other=\r\n entities are dropping subtitling all together).\n  phil\n  \nsecretary &lt;secre=\r\ntarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n  Michael informed me of a major CORRECTION=\r\n to the message below\n\nThe sequel aired in Hawaii LAST WEEKEND on NTV not K=\r\nIKU and sadly it \nwas not subtitled.
