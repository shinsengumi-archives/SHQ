He also knew Ulysses S. Grant (who visited\nJapan), John Russell Young, Edmund Clarence Stedman, Okuma Shigenobu\nand Inoue Kaoru.\n\nHe was sooo close to Mark Twain that he brought his lady friend Aoki\nKoto on a visit to the States.  The couple stayed with the Twains in\nHartford.  \n\nThe reason why I&#39;m so enthusiastic about English language papers,\npreferably printed in Japan, which covered either Boshin or Seinan War\nis because we can immediately see what kind of news the foriegners got\nand their opinions on the situation---and it&#39;s in ENGLISH (^_^)\n\nI should be getting a compilation of the TOKIO TIMES via inter-library\nloan.  Tokio Times was printed between 1877-1880.  even though it\ndoesn&#39;t cover the Boshin War directly...there should be references to it.\n\nIf anyone has info on English language papers printed in Japan please\nlet me know.  I had NO luck finding the paper printed in Yokohoma.\n\nI have now read in 3 different places that during the early to late\nMeiji era people actually COLLECTED newspaper clippings.  Taka,\nPrincess Chichibu&#39;s nanny collected related articles concerning the\nwedding but that made perfect sense.  People preferred to collect the\nnewspapers printed in &quot;color&quot; which illustrates scenes from the Seinan\nWar (usually exaggerated romantic accounts).  The prints I shared with\nhere in the form of zip files a while back had colorful paintings\ndepicting the Seinan War---I presume that those same paintings/prints\nwere the ones the newspapers printed.\n\n\n\n\n"
