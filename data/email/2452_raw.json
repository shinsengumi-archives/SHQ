Appearently, those photos have no way of being proven that it was Okita.   As far as I&#39;ve read, there is no knowledge that Okita ever did pose for a photograph (itwould be good if someone could answer this for me).\n \nThats not to say the photo isn&#39;t him... its more like I&#39;m in the same boat as you are and have no clue whether that really was him or not.    \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
