If only we had a way of paying you & Masayoshi a salary just to sit back, drink tea and translate Japanese sites for us!  :-D  I shudder to think of all the things we&#39;d have to be able to contemplate on.\n \n&gt;&gt;also involved in the Intelligence.\n\nWas Saitou also considered part of Intelligence?  (Not asking you directly, SK, but anyone who knows.)  I think I&#39;m becoming hung up on this idea that maybe he & Suzuki associated with each other in Kyoto (it&#39;s the drinking thing, which I could still be misinterpreting from the babelfish translation) and could&#39;ve been a reason why Saitou seems to have been accepted so readily within Itou&#39;s group.  Not that they necessarily would&#39;ve questioned *anyone&#39;s* decision to leave, even with Saitou&#39;s loyalty to Hijikata, since I get a sense that Itou left on somewhat &quot;friendly?&quot; terms with Kondou and there were plenty of defections, but it just still seems so strange no one suspected Saitou.  And, of course, Saitou could&#39;ve used any one of a number of excuses to explain why he would want to exit the Shinsengumi.  But still...\n \n \n&gt;&gt;He tried many things to exact revenge upon the\nShinsengumi, but he found himself in the new era\nwithout fulfilling his wishes.&lt;&lt;\n \nRK fanfic fodder if I ever saw it!!!  ;-D  Just when I thought SaiSa couldn&#39;t get any more &quot;angstier&quot; than it already is...  I&#39;ve already made the decision to make Suzuki part of my story &quot;Yasou,&quot; but I haven&#39;t quite decided how yet.  I&#39;m also not sure I&#39;m capable of doing justice to a confrontation between Saitou and Suzuki... so much potential emotional power even *without* considering Sano&#39;s friendship towards both men.  Suzuki has so much more reason to hate Saitou and want his blood than Kenshin ever had.\n \nSK (or anyone), if you have any more information on why Itou left, what his arguments with Kondou were, I&#39;d love to know for scholarly and writerly reasons.  With many thanks in advance.\n \n&gt;&gt;That&#39;s more or less what the fishy part says...&lt;&lt;\n \n&lt;snort&gt;  the fishy part...  Great line, SK!\n \nSK or Masayoshi, sometime could you give us the rest of the story from that site, the info on him before he joined the Shinsengumi?  So much reference to private schools, the family, and what sounds like his adoption into another family...\n\n \nphil (time to start frying up some fish and making some kind of meal out of it)\n\n\nhttp://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Cosmos/4774/page015.html\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
