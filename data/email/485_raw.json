It&#39;s good to know \n=\r\nthat the interview interested you. (^-^) I hadn&#39;t thought about \nputting it=\r\n in the files section, but it&#39;s a good idea and it&#39;s \ndefinitely the next t=\r\nhing I&#39;m going to do.\n\nFor those who didn&#39;t knew, &quot;Gun Blaze West&quot; was Wats=\r\nuki&#39;s next manga \nand its publication stopped after only three volumes as t=\r\nhe story was \nnot a huge success. After RK, the fans&#39; expectations were rea=\r\nlly \nhigh=85 Those three volumes have been translated and published in \nGer=\r\nman anyway and some group in France are trying to convince Gl=E9nat \n(RK&#39;s =\r\npublisher) to translate it as well. I don&#39;t know if it will \nwork, but it&#39;s=\r\n true that even if the story wasn&#39;t successful in \nJapan, many RK fans will=\r\n probably buy it just to see=85 (I&#39;m definitely \namong them).\n\nWatsuki wrot=\r\ne the one-shot &quot;Meteor Strike&quot; for a contest in Shonen \nJump. That one-shot=\r\n has been enclosed at the end of the French \nversion of RK vol. 28. In his =\r\nnotes about that story, Watsuki says \nthat it revolved around three themes:=\r\n a meteor, a young boy wearing \nconstruction gloves, and a young girl weari=\r\nng a helmet. Watsuki says \nthat it&#39;s a &quot;moronic&quot; story, but it&#39;s not that b=\r\nad. There are a few \nvery good jokes\n\nMary-Ann (^-^)\n\n\n"
