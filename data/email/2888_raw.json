It was the samurai&#39;s \ncustom!  Many samurai \n&gt; change=\r\nd their name twice, but Okita had only changed his name \nonce.  Yes, a samu=\r\nrai \n&gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he \nc=\r\nhanged his (full) \n&gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. =\r\n Why?  I&#39;m \nnot sure...\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n&quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopti=\r\nng the young Katsugoro in 1849, who \nfirst took the name of Shimazaki Katsu=\r\nta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nSo...What significance does the choice of =\r\nname have?  I thought \nperhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already be=\r\nen given) a name \nto honor someone in his family.  In Souji shortening his =\r\nname from \nSoujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou.  =\r\nAnd \nin Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name, \nb=\r\nut if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating himself from \nthe Mi=\r\nyakawa family?  Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first?  Could \nsomeone be =\r\nadopted into one family and then into another?\n\n\n****\n \n\n&gt; Though this hasn=\r\n&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed \nthat Okita Rintarou \n&gt; Mo=\r\ntotsune paid the Okita family for his samurai status (by \nbeing &quot;adopted&quot; i=\r\nnto the Okita \n&gt; family and therefore would have to change his name to Okit=\r\na.)  He \nserved as a retainer for \n&gt; young Souji. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Okita family co=\r\nuld have needed the additional financial support \nfrom Rintarou \n&gt; Mototsun=\r\ne after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as \nthe head of th=\r\ne Okita \n&gt; family for a short time (not sure how short...) \n\n\nFirst, if Kat=\r\nsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be head of the \nOkita family because S=\r\nouji was too young...what happened when Souji&#39;s \nmother married Rintarou Mo=\r\ntotsune?  RM displaced RK as head of the \nfamily?  Then after RM&#39;s death RK=\r\n was reinstated?  And what would \nhave happened if Souji had lived longer? =\r\n Would he have replaced RK?\nFinally, if one could change their status throu=\r\ngh purchase or \nadoption then it&#39;s all just a formality?\n\nThanks everyone f=\r\nor being patient with my questions!\n\n--Wanda\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
