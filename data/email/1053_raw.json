Was he trying to send\na message...something along the lines...work hard become a great\nswordsman, strive for the ideals of the samurai, and become a ladies man!\nCould you imagine the officer in the Shinsengumi in charge of sorting\nmail?  Why I&#39;m sure the ladies would refrain from writing their real\nnames on the envelope and so the guy would have to do the &quot;smell&quot;\ntest...perfumed letters for Vice Chief Hijikata...unperfumed letters\ngo in the &quot;business&quot; bin and as usual Saitou gets -no- mail (only the\noccasional death threat signed in blood) :P\nIn Hatchobori 7 remember the other officers were discussing how cruel\nit is to not even reply to the letters?...I wonder if he replied to\nany of his letters.\nI posted in the merchandise section of http://www.shinsengumimb.com a\ncollage of actual Shinsengumi stuff being sold (scanned from a book I\nborrowed from one of our members) and there was stationary...there\nshould be romantic stationary with Hijikata&#39;s poetry pre-printed on it.\nLastly, the whole business with pretending to be Aoyama is funny...I\nwonder if anyone in the Shinsengumi pulled this stunt...you know going\naround saying &quot;I&#39;m Hijikata&quot; (to attract the ladies)...what is the\npenalty for identity theft? LOL!\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Quite by accident I discovered seasons 2,3 & 4 of a show called \n&gt; Hatchobori Seven which can best be described as an late Edo era version \n&gt; of  NYPD Blue/Law & Order/Hill Street Blues your basic continuing \n&gt; character crime drama show.\n&gt; \n&gt; It features all sorts of cool little details in the props and plot \n&gt; points to thrill and inspire the writers among us.  (note it is much \n&gt; easier to focus on said details when there is a lack of mind-numbing \n&gt; male eye candy to distract :-D)\n&gt; \n&gt; On a Shinsengumi related note Hatchobori Seven&#39;s lead --Inspector\nAoyama \n&gt; is played by Murakami Hiroaki who portrayed Hijikata in Shinsengumi \n&gt; Keppuroku (unfortunately in this he&#39;s sporting a most unflattering--for \n&gt; him--haircut) He&#39;s very good in this as well, provided you don&#39;t mind \n&gt; his character coming  across a bit like RK&#39;s Hiko Seijuro at times.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
