One of you with \ntranslation skills should really have a look at this and try to \nclarify a few points for us! Especially the last site I&#39;m going to \nlist!\n\nThe first place I&#39;m going to draw your attention to is one some of \nyou may have found before. Not a lot of info, but there&#39;s a map on \none of the pages of the inside of the Yagi residence, where the \nShinsengumi stayed for some time. If you click on the arrows, the \npicture below it changes to offer different views of the interior of \nthe building. The site is:\nhttp://www.mibu-yagike.jp/\n\nAlso, you might want to have a peek at this site. There is some \nrandom bits of info attached to the different pictures. One is a \npicture of the monument in Hokkaido that is located on the spot where \nHijikata is rumored to have been killed. Beside it it says:\n&quot;A fierce attack of the new government force was started to wait for \na thaw of spring. Hijikata whom I asked conduct to go to rescue of \nwife of chief zen-priest Daiba by a box building all-out attack of \nMay 11 hit a bullet in 1869 (1869) and was killed in action. Enomoto \nforce surrendered soon, and the Boshin War was over.&quot; \n\nThat was the gist translation. The Babelfish says:\n&quot;In order to wait for the thawing of snow of the spring, onslaught of \nthe new government troop was started. That 1869 (1869) with box \nmansion all out attack May 11th, it probably will face to the rescue \nof the Sarasvati stand place, the manuel laborer who takes direction \ndied in battle, hitting against the gun circle. Promptly, the Enomoto \ntroop surrendering ended (?) War.&quot;\n\nI take it that the &quot;wife of chief zen-priest Daiba&quot; was some sort of \ntemple? The site in question is:\nhttp://www.city.hino.tokyo.jp/museum/sinsengumi/top/sinsengumi_top_non\nflash.html  It&#39;s the Hinocity Furusato Museum. And no, &quot;sinsengumi&quot; \nis not a mistake. That&#39;s how they spelled it.\n\nThe next site is more or less one page of info. I have no idea where \nthey got this from. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve never heard before, so I&#39;m \nasking for confirmation of the details. It states that during the \nfight Nagakura&#39;s sword broke and his left thumb was cut off?! The \nreference to Toudou&#39;s injury I&#39;ve found on the other two sites, but \nif they mention that Nagakura lost his thumb it&#39;s been lost in \ntranslation. The site in question is:\nhttp://geocities.com/koyochinbutai/1864.html\n\nYou can change the year number to get to other pages. Most have \nlittle more than the major events of the year listed, resulting in \npages with no more than two lines on them. And the injury that Toudou \nreceived in PMK? The cut to the forehead? That appears to have been \nthe injury he suffered in the real battle. \n\nNow we&#39;re getting to the REAL info! I found the next two sites by \naccident. Again one was hidden by an unusual spelling of Nagakura&#39;s \nfirst name. They called him &quot;Sinpachi&quot;. The site isn&#39;t extensive. \nSome of the listed areas have no inforomation at all, so it might be \na new site under development. The main point of interest is what it \nhas to say about Shinpachi&#39;s (or &quot;Sinpachi&#39;s&quot;) role in the Ikeda-ya \naffair. It also gives a brief bio of his life, which mentions among \nother things the quarrel with Kondo! Apparently Nagakura was \ngiven &quot;good behavior disposal&quot; for two months over the incident. No \nword on whether anyone else was given similar penalties. However, I \nwould assume this was the case. Later it refers to his meeting up \nwith a &quot;geisha&quot; he had been involved with before the war and meeting \nhis daughter, apparently for the first time! The site is:\nhttp://www.bushinavi.com/~sinpachi/sinpachi.htm\n\nThe jackpot however was this final site. It lists info about EVERY \nONE of the Captains!!! Of course some to this we&#39;ve heard before, but \nsome is very new (at least to me)! Here&#39;s a small sampler of the more \noutrageous info I discovered. [I had to use a translator other than \nBabelfish. That one wouldn&#39;t work for me.]\n\nHijikata:\n-The person he fooled around with in the shop when he was 17 was \na &quot;maid of a shop&quot;.\n-He went to Edo to appeal for a rescue of Kondo, using the \nname &quot;Hayato Naito&quot;.\nOkita:\n-If I&#39;m reading  this right, he had a short-temper when teaching \nkendo and many were more afraid of him than Kondo at such times!\nSaito: \n-Apparently the Shin Kepp miniseries wasn&#39;t wrong about him dropping \nout of the Shinsengumi! He parted company from Kondo and Hijikata at \nthe same time Nagakura and Harada did! It looks like he headed off to \nAizu on his own. But as we all know, he met up with Hijikata once \nagain before the war was over and ended up leading the Shinsengumi \nfor him while he was wounded.\n-This site says he entered the &quot;police superintendent station&quot; in \n1872.\nMatsubara Tadaji (4th Captain and someone I&#39;ve never seen anything \non!):\n-Seems to have killed someone from Anzai when he was coming back from \nGion, due to the fact he was drunk. \n-He finds out that the man had a wife and an ill child and &quot;from \nsympathy&quot; begins to take care of them. I think it&#39;s saying that he \ncouldn&#39;t bring himself to tell the wife he was the one who killed \nhim. He also fell in love with the wife!!!\n-Hijikata doesn&#39;t seem to have liked the situation one bit. Somehow \nMatsubara comes to try to commit seppuku. What actually happened to \nhim doesn&#39;t appear to be clear. His first attempt may have failed, \nbut the wound didn&#39;t heal properly and eventually led to his death. \nThere is also the story he and the wife committed suicide together or \nthat he was made to kill himself for some other reason.\nThere is something on the Captain of the Seventh Unit, Tani \nSanjuurou. I think it&#39;s implying Saito might have killed him, but I \ncan&#39;t make real heads or tails of it. His death is listed as &quot;sudden \nillness&quot;.\nSuzuki Mikisaburou (9th Captain. How could I possibly leave this guy \nout?! phil would hurt me!):\n-It says that he &quot;belong to the Satsuma armed forces by a fight of \nFushimi, Toba, and I join a red report corps, but I return to Tokyo, \nand I am imprisoned after having left it. The release back goes to \nthe front of sergeant or Aizu, but, for the end of the war, returns \nto Tokyo.&quot;\n-You might want to sit down for this one phil! It says later that he \nmet &quot;Nagakura new 8 in Kyoto in 1869 and I try a surprise attack, but \nend in an attempt.&quot; So he DID try one last time for some revenge!!!\nHarada Sanosuke (10th Captain):\n-Seems like he died of a gunshot wound to the back two days after the \nbattle at Uneo in the house of Honjo Sarue-cho.\nShimada Kai:\n-He was around six feet tall and had a sweet tooth, but &quot;can&#39;t drink \na liquor drop.&quot;\n-He not only ran a dojo later in life, but at one point after the war \nhe worked as a saleclerk of a Buddhist altar fittings shop! Is anyone \nelse thinking &quot;Monk Anji&quot;?!\n-Forget Saito secretary! Sounds like Shimada was the handy one to \nhave around for those tough situations! Poor Nagakura couldn&#39;t jump \nan earthen wall at Toba-Fushimi and he had to help him. Then later on \nhe carried Hijikata off the field on his back when the Vice-Commander \nwas wounded in the foot at Shirakawa!\nThe last person mentioned is Shinohara  Tainoshin (though they list \nhis name as Shinohara Taisuke). He was in investigations and was \nanother follower of Itou&#39;s and appears to have also joined the \nSekihoutai. Like Miki, he survived the war and lived to the ripe old \nage of 84, passing away on June 13, 1911. It says that in later years \nhe &quot;became a pious Christian.&quot;\nThe link to this final site is:\nhttp://www2.plala.or.jp/shyall/retuden/sinsengumi.html\n\nAnd to think I discovered all this by accident!!!\n\n-MissBehavin (trying NOT to think about how lucky that &quot;maid of a \nshop&quot; was...)\n\n\n"
