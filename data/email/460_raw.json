This book I have on Japanese language \n&gt; and culture mentions something called a haramaki, which is basically \n&gt; a waistband or healthband (whichever you prefer). The point of this \n&gt; is to keep the abdomen warm, even in hot weather, because it&#39;s \n&gt; supposed to keep the wearer healthy. Maybe Saito wore the towel \n&gt; around his neck for a similar reason?\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissBehavin\n\n\n"
