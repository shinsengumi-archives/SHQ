Bon dance.  I have fond memories of when I was just knee\nhigh=\r\n my dad dressed me up in my little kimono, obi and geta, and turned\nme loos=\r\ne to dance the circle. Yes!\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secr=\r\netarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope everyone is having a great s=\r\nummer. This Sunday a friend who is\n&gt; also a member here on SHQ dragged me o=\r\nut of the monotony of my daily\n&gt; life to attend Obon (Bon) at http://www.ni=\r\nshihongwanji-la.org/.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can get a general idea of Bon from reading th=\r\nis article:\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obon\n&gt;\n&gt; People who are familiar=\r\n with the Day of the Dead or the Chinese feast\n&gt; for ghosts will find a sim=\r\nilar sentiment in Bon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a collage of a few photos we took:\n&gt; htt=\r\np://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/collage.jpg\n&gt; (can you find a familiar kamon, =\r\nfamily crest?)\n&gt;\n&gt; The temple has been part of the Japanese-American commun=\r\nity in LA for\n&gt; many decades. I found some of the innovations inside the ta=\r\nble to be\n&gt; very fascinating! Notice the pews in the main worship hall. The=\r\n\n&gt; apsaras or devadas (heavenly beings/maidens) which are part of the\n&gt; orn=\r\namentation above the main alter have wings which make them look\n&gt; like cher=\r\nubs or western angels, whereas in traditional Japanese (or\n&gt; generally E. A=\r\nsian art) they would never have birdlike wings.\n&gt;\n&gt; During the service for =\r\nthe souls of the deceased, the reverend\n&gt; presiding over the ceremony empha=\r\nsized how at one point, many\n&gt; generations back we were all relatives of on=\r\ne another and therefore we\n&gt; are still presently connected.\n&gt;\n&gt; Like other =\r\nBon ceremonies everyone was asked to dance in a circle.\n&gt; The center is als=\r\no the central axis in which the lanterns with the\n&gt; names of the deceased w=\r\nritten on them are united. The dancers move\n&gt; around the axis to the tune o=\r\nf various music however I noted that the\n&gt; first dance resembled the moveme=\r\nnts of a fish. People press their\n&gt; hands together in front of them and ass=\r\nume the swimming gesture as if\n&gt; to swim through the sea/river of life arou=\r\nnd a center.\n&gt;\n&gt; The symbolism may be connected with the movement of people=\r\n through a\n&gt; mandala to reach the center, which is also related to Buddhist=\r\n\n&gt; cosmology where the center is Mt. Meru which is also the object people\n&gt;=\r\n circumambulate (Buddhists are big on circumambulating temples,\n&gt; stupas/ch=\r\nedis etc). Unlike the living, the dead can traverse from the\n&gt; center to th=\r\ne outermost realms as they &quot;hang&quot; above us (the lanterns).\n&gt;\n&gt; I was really=\r\n happy, if not completely shocked to meet this individual\n&gt; who shares an i=\r\nnterest in Fujita-sama. We both prayed for his\n&gt; happiness at this ceremony=\r\n and hoped that his comrades are also at\n&gt; rest. It was really great to be =\r\nable to make a small contribution to\n&gt; the temple on behalf of these long d=\r\nead figures who have become\n&gt; outstanding teachers to us not only in studyi=\r\nng history but other\n&gt; aspects of our lives too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Changing topics, the u=\r\npcoming Shinsengumi e-book written by and for\n&gt; fans or the general public =\r\nwill be completed on a laptop contributed\n&gt; by this person. I also learned =\r\nthat fellow Shinsengumi enthusiasts\n&gt; will also feed another (thank you, yo=\r\nu saw through my lie about being\n&gt; on a diet and all that).\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a p=\r\nic of the donated laptop and router (it&#39;s on the floor due\n&gt; to some reorga=\r\nnizing I had to do):\n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/KCCat/CatandLaptop.jpg\n&gt; The=\r\n cat has inspected it and certified that it is safe to use after\n&gt; sleeping=\r\n and &quot;guarding&quot; over it for a day now.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it looks like we have to get =\r\nmoving on that first draft!\n&gt;\n&gt; Take care everybody,\n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"
