I REALLY have to ask this.  I\n&gt; only get cable, but it seems that there is a tv show\n&gt; called Shisengumi! on one of my tv channels (ch. 35)\n&gt; that is NOT NHK.  So I was sondering if this is the\n&gt; same show (note the name) or another one.  This\n&gt; channel 35 is not purely Japanese, but there&#39;s also\n&gt; Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese languages and shows\n&gt; at different times (all asian, in short).  If\n&gt; anybody else lives in Southern CA and can tell me if\n&gt; it&#39;s the same tv show as the one on NHK, I would\n&gt; greatly appreciate it!  It has english subtitles,\n&gt; BTW ^ ^;;;\n&gt;  \n&gt; ~Saitohworship\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
