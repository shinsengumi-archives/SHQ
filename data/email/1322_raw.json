Mine sure did! Kondou turned on by \nMatsudaira???  \n&gt; It&#39;s kind of far out there but considering that we do  know Saiou \nand \n&gt; the Aizu big shots were on very very good terms I can see it being \ntrue.....\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
