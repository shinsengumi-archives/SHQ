(pp. 238-241)\n\n******************************\nsorry f=\r\nor this second post...I was cutting and pasting and made an\nerror (^_^;)\n\nR=\r\negarding Sakamoto&#39;s murder...it was pinned on the Shinsengumi with a\npiece =\r\nof &quot;evidence&quot;, Harada&#39;s sword sheath.  Thus, Yamakawa Kenjiro\ntried to exam=\r\nine the situation further with Nagakura&#39;s son.\n\nYamakawa Kenjiro (1854-1931=\r\n) is an Aizu figure connected to Fujita\nGoro.  You may read about him here:=\r\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\nand\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq=\r\n.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\nhe was a family friend of the Fujitas.\n\nso the sign=\r\nficance of Yamakawa&#39;s interest in the Sakamoto murder is\nthat an Aizu figur=\r\ne contributing to Meiji Era research on the\nShinsengumi---which is not stra=\r\nnge at all.\n\nYamakawa Kenjiro (he is called Yamaken by his fans) was a care=\r\nful and\npatient researcher who compiled the 700 page book AIZU BOSHIN SENSH=\r\nI\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm\nI scanned the entire book=\r\n so if anyone here who studies Japanese would\nlike to try reading it just e=\r\nmail me...and yes Hijikata and Kondou and\nthe rest are all in it.\n\n********=\r\n**********************\nspeaking about errors\n\nI will make this correction t=\r\no \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/saitouhajime.htm\nas soon as possible\n\nI had=\r\n erroneously typed &quot; Empress Dowager&quot; (emperor Meiji&#39;s mother--he\nactually =\r\nhad 2) when really Fujita GOro at one point guarded the\nEMPRESS http://ja.w=\r\nikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F:Empress_Shoken.jpg\n\nthe confusion occu=\r\nrred due to the name &quot;Shoken&quot; which was the other\nname of &quot;Haruko&quot; the empr=\r\ness\n\nthis in fact changes everything.  Originally, I had believed that\nFuji=\r\nta would be in the IMperial Guard Unit #2 (even for temporary\nassignments) =\r\nwhich guarded the Emperor&#39;s mother.  However, now that we\nknow he guarded t=\r\nhe empress he would be part of an entire different\nunit altogether...Unit #=\r\n1 which guarded the Emperor, Empress and\ndirect heirs (all the children)\n\nw=\r\ne do have testimony from Tokio&#39;s niece stating that Uncle Goro had\ncommente=\r\nd on the beauty of the Empress\n\nI apologize for this error...I caught it wh=\r\nile typind a bio for Saitou\nHajime...fortunately most of the essay is deriv=\r\ned from English sources\n(because the bulk of the text deals with post 1868 =\r\nstuff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
