I have tried to &quot;reach out&quot; to our sisters (why is\nit that a majority of Shinsengumi fans are women?) in Japan.  I posted\nshinsengumimb.com info on the 3-hajime.com board in English and\nJapanese (via babelfish)...it doesn&#39;t hurt to give them some laughs...\nhere are their responses...\n\n(goldfish spitting out bubbles)\nThe foreigner it is? So, if we assume that is, famous of new selection\ngroup it exceeds the border, the better seed. You think that it is\ntruly enormous thing. You are glad very Contribution day: 4/14 (Wed)\n\n(Owner of the site &quot;Hajime&quot;) Way it study enthusiastically Maggie &gt;\nnew selection group, concerning Saito one, the shank. Also Maggie,\nseems that it manage the new selection group-related sight, but,\ncontents do not understand excessively well in unskillful me of\nEnglish, it is regrettable. Your period &gt; Maggie, the foreign country\nit seems like. Don&#39;t you think? far widely know the name of new\nselection group, it is to have crossed even in foreign area. Don&#39;t you\nthink? he et. al. who had the will of the valuable imperial \nbarbarian, probably is certainly to have been surprised greatly. But,\nthe fact that it can encounter the companion who exceeds the border,\nholds the common thinking is truly delightful thing.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI think...they are happy to meet us...she didn&#39;t call me a\nbarbarian...I think she meant that it is funny that the Japanese in\nthe 19th century would consider me to be a barbarian (hey I&#39;m Asian\nwait I wonder if they think of southeast asians as barbarians too) and\nit is ironic that we barbarians take interest in the new selection\ngroup.  I read an online newsarticle (posted waaaaay back) about how\nHijikata Toshizo read essays translated from English to Japanese and\none such essay mentioned the need for protein in one&#39;s diet (since\nmost Japanese had mostly vegetarian diets) and he encouraged his men\nto consume more meat so he wasn&#39;t THAT close minded (note that\nportrait of him).  I wonder what he would think if he knew us foreign\ndevils are his fans LOL.  He would be like o_0\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"
