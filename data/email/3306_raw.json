Man=\r\ny books do cite newspaper articles and editorials which\nwaited for the axe =\r\nto fall on the Japanese conspirators (directly\nsponsored by the Meiji Gov&#39;s=\r\n ARMY) in this horrible event of one\ncountry assassinating the leader of an=\r\nother Asian country. \n\nI ofcourse left out Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese=\r\n war because there\nwould hundreds of articles (many duplicate info but publ=\r\nished in\ncountless cities across the USA). \n\nThe database searches for word=\r\ns in the scans and often the images are\nso poor due to the newspaper type q=\r\nuality that it&#39;s hard to find the\nexact article one needs.\n\nThere is also a=\r\n secondary problem of name spelling.  Enomoto was (I\nbelieve) spelled corre=\r\nctly in one article and in another place &quot;Heno\nmoto&quot; (Or something like tha=\r\nt).  Remember all the lingo is\ncharacteristic of the time like &quot;Tycoon&quot; and=\r\n &quot;Mikado&quot;. \n\nXD\n\n\n"
