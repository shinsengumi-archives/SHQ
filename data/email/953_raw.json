Being oppressed?  Figure your literary efforts are at least as good as Shinsengumi Vice Commander Hijikata&#39;s?  Trouble with bakufu pests?  Contact Saigou Takamori to make arrangements.  All forms of cash taken (literally).  In an emergency, contact Suzuki Mikisaburou, our Shinsengumi representative, in Kyoto.\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo!
