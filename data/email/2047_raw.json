That&#39;s much appreciated!\n\nI cannot seem to get an individual page url for the http://www.tamahito.com/ \nsite for some reason. It&#39;s the last link on the bottom of the first page about \nHijikata that takes you to the page I was trying to decipher. The passage \nabout Tamejirou inspiring him to write haiku is right under the picture of the \nbamboo plant. It&#39;s the same passage that talks about someone jumping into the \nriver.\n\nBelow that is the one that mentions Daisaku and seems to be saying something \nabout him making the Shinsengumi sign. I cannot find where I saw that one of \nthe brothers looked after the dojo now though. Must be a long-lost website.\n\nThe passage about Hijikata taking &quot;plain food&quot; at Hakodate is at the bottom \nof the http://www.toshizo.com/name/toshizo.html page.\n\nThe passage that says something about him going off alone in a corner to \ndrink is on http://www.toshizo.com/name/tohito.html  It appears to be the \ntestimony of a journalist of some sort? It&#39;s one of the longer notes.\n\nI was wrong about where I saw the note about his temper. It&#39;s on this page:\nhttp://www.h3.dion.ne.jp/~ash-gate/fukuchyo-2.htm  I think it&#39;s some official \n(possibly named Kato?) who was the one who made the comment.\n\nAnd the mention of the &quot;sogami hairdo&quot; (I am still not sure if the translator \nworded that properly) is on \nhttp://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/bakumatu-fubou.htm  It&#39;s in the section on Hijikata and says something about him following \nKondou or something and what they were wearing I think? Cannot really make heads \nor tails what that one is trying to say...\n\nHere&#39;s a link to one of the pages on mizosoba I was looking at: \nhttp://www.ne.jp/asahi/kumagaisan/flowers/mizosoba.html  \n\nIt mentions the &quot;splinter&quot;, but it has something else interesting too. It \nsays something at the end about the fruit of the plant? Are there two different \nplants called &quot;mizosoba&quot;?\n\nThank you again for the help Tama!\n\n-MissB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
