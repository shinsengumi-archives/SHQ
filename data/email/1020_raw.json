Seems that every daimyo had three residences in Edo-- upper, middle, \nand lower. Good way to keep them poor, I suppose, and thus leave them with \nno money to spend on revolt, unless you have domains with trade surpluses \nlike Choshuu and Satsuma...\n\n--Shinpachi&#39;s father, Nagakura Kanji, was a retainer of the Matsumae clan, \nwith a 150 koku stipend. He was a true product of the Edo era-- part of the \nsub-culture of samurai who lived their entire lives in Edo, but were \nretainers of a domain they&#39;d never seen and probably never would.\n\n--Nagakura&#39;s father spelled the family name with the &quot;naga&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot;, \nbut Shinpachi spelled it with the &quot;naga&quot; from the word for &quot;eternity&quot;.\n\n--Nagakura got his start in kenjutsu earlier than Okita. Okita started at \nage 9 in Tennen Rishin Ryuu-- BUT Nagakura entered Okada Juusuke Toshisada&#39;s \nShintou Munen Ryuu dojo at age 8.\n\n--Nagakura&#39;s birthday is the 11th day of the fourth month of Tenpo 10. By \nour calendar, that&#39;s May 11, 1839 (so we JUST missed it! lol)\n\nMore soon.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
