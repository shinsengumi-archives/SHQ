Thornton THE POLICE CHIEF v 38 July 1971\n\npage 72\n&quot;On occasion the Kidotai have used a single weak central force \n(scarecrow battalion) which is assigned to guard a fixed installation \nsuch as the United States Embassy or the Prime Minister&#39;s residence \nas a holding unit, while keeping other units *out*of*sight* until \ncalled to perform the pincers or enveloping forces.  This is \nsometimes referred to as the Manaita or cutting board tactic.  In \nessence this means that the defensive or holding unit is acting as \nthe cutting block to receive the brunt of the attack in front of the \ninstallation, while the pincers forces, having much greater strength, \nperform the decisive maneuver against the attacking force.  There has \nbeen some difficulty in convincing the members of the defensive \nmanaita unit that they should be the force assigned to bear the brunt \nof the vicious attack and even retreat in the face of overwhelming \nattack by the rioters, and then have the glory go to the pincers or \nflank attackers (kyogeki) who deliver the coup de grace.\n\nAn important tactic is to capture as rapidly as possible the \nleaders...Kidotai has learned through years of experience that the \nstrongest element of a riot group is the front line or point of the \ngroup and that the weakest is the rear&quot;\n\n*I would also like to add that students also love to use distractions \nsuch as attacking one building...and another group attacking the main \ntarget (e.g. important building on a university campus)\n\n*like the Shinsengumi vs. Ishin...Kidotai are usually the same exact \nage group as the students they suppress\n\n*kidotai do not carry guns which greatly reduce the number of \ninjuries on both sides of the conflict\n\nThis is not entirely off-topic because\n1) I read a really long time ago (using a translator ofcourse) of \nShinsengumi &quot;death squads&quot; which lured out the enemy, once their true \nnumbers are revealed then back up is called *if this is innaccurate \nplease correct me* ....I think that it would be to the advantage of \nthe Tokugawa to capture the brains of any meeting e.g. as seen in the \nRaid on Ikedaya\n\n2) pincer movements used to give the enemy a false sense of \nconfidence and the subsequent trap has been used throughout history \nin [many] conflicts...the Imperial troops in the Seinan War used this \ntactic ALOT every text I read about the war will mention this fact\n\nI&#39;m  interested in  riot police because in my city....we have really \nhuge Halloween parties with THOUSANDS of drunken students (from out \nof state ofcourse) who hang out in the downtown area  who trash \nstores and start huge bonfires and the police cannot deal with the \nproblem (these are not organized students)...our riot police is \nbasically 10-20 armored cops in a line who use tear gas RIGHT \nAWAY....rioters are not afraid of cops on horses either...injuries \nand complaints always follow this yearly *celebration*\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"
