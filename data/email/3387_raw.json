I saw one comment there and it was in=\r\n \ncyrillic, which is what Russian uses.  I also heard &quot;Gdye,&quot; which \nis &quot;Wh=\r\nere&quot; in Russian, &quot;Dobre,&quot; which is &quot;Good,&quot; and the \npronunciation is defini=\r\ntely Russian.  The title of the post is in \nCyrillic.  Unfortunately, I&#39;d h=\r\nave better luck if I saw the cyrillic \ntext.\n\nCharo\n\n\n"
