At first we&#39;d planned to go in mid-May to early June, but \nnow because of various factors, I&#39;m having second thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my question for those who&#39;ve been to Japan (I know there are a \nfew) is: What time would you think is best for the trip? May-June as \nabove, or early autumn (probably September)? Mostly in terms of \nweather and chance to catch interesting festivals and such (we&#39;ll be \ntravelling all over Japan) but also prices/chances of getting hotel \nrooms, and so forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, and if you really feel like helping out, you can answer \nanother burning question... is there such a thing as public \nlaundromats in Japan?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any answers!\n\n\n\nIf a general reply is carried out, I will think that the travel to \nJapan is best to carry out in May. \nMay has many fine days and temperature is warm. \nAlthough April has many fine days, it is still somewhat cold in a \nnorth area. \nJune is the rainy season. \nHowever, since Hokkaido does not have the rainy season, it is OK \nalso in this season. \nJuly and August are hot and they are moist.\nAlthough September and October are warm, there are many typhoons. \nIn a southern area, it may become serious damage.\nHowever, October is a season good for a travel. \nIf the travel in May is impossible, the end in September and the \nbeginning of October are good seasons. \nIt is cold from November till March. \n\n \nMany festivals are held in various places.\nWhat kind of thing do you want to see? \nIs it the relation of Shinsengumi? \nOr is it the other famous festival? \n\nThe festival which should be introduced to you depending on your \nanswer changes. \nIt is assumed that it is in May that you come to Japan.\nSince there will be Hijikata&#39;s deathday May, a festival is performed \nin the Hino city.\n\n(All pages are the bans on unapproved reproduction.) \n\nHino Shinsengumi matsuri (Hino Shinsengumi festival)\nEvery year, this is held on the 2nd Saturday and Sunday. \n\nhttp://www.suzutoo.co.jp/hino_gyouji_sinnsenngumi_fb.html\nhttp://www.suzutoo.co.jp/hino_gyouji_sinnsenngumi_fb.html\n\n\n\nSince it is also in May that the Hakodate war ended, a festival is \nperformed in Hakodate.\n\nHakodate Goryoukaku sai (Hakodate Goryoukaku festival)\nEvery year, this is held on the 3rd Saturday and Sunday. \n\nhttp://www.at-town.com/~snap/event/tour/summit2.html\n\n\n\nHowever, my reply is different if you are wanted to see not these \nbut the festival which has history more. \nProbably, in Kyoto, the festival with 1000 years of history is held \nat the almost same time as those festivals. \n\nAoi matsuri (Aoi festival)\nEvery year, this is held on May 15. \n\nhttp://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/index11.htm\n(Since music sounds, be careful.)\n\n\nThe festival which exists from the Edo period is held in the \ndowntown area in Tokyo on the same day. \n\nKanda matsuri (Kanda festival)\nThis will be held on May 14 and the 15th this year. \n\nhttp://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/kan1.htm \n(Since music sounds, be careful.)\n\n\nMoreover, the festival which has the origin of the Edo period in \nSendai is held. \n\naoba matsuri (aoba festival)\nThis will be held on May 14 and the 15th this year. \n\nhttp://sakura.mond.jp/aoba16/16aoba1.htm\n\n\n\nProbably, the oldest temple in Tokyo is holding the big festival. \n\nsanjya-matsuri (sanjya festival)\nThis is unknown for details.\nThis holds after May 15. \n\nhttp://wadaphoto.jp/maturi/san1.htm\n(Since music sounds, be careful.)\n\n\n\nProbably, Kyoto is carrying out the graceful festival. \n\nMifune matsuri (Mifune festival)\nEvery year, this is held on the 3rd Saturday and Sunday. \n\nhttp://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/ben-yama/2-mifune.htm\n\n\n\nA shrine famous as God of learning also holds a festival. \n\nYushimatenmangu taisai (Yushimatenmangu big festival)\nEvery year, this is held on May 25. \n\nhttp://junko55.web.infoseek.co.jp/02maturi/0405yusima1.htm\n\n\n\nIn others, the famous festival called Hakata Dontaku to beginning in \nMay is held in Kyushu. \nEvery year, this will be held on May 2 and the 3rd. \n\nhttp://www.kasane.jp/tamasudare/dontaku2004/parade1/index.html\n\n\nIf you need it, I will do the festival of other seasons, and \nintroduction of a tourist resort.\n\nThe charge of a hotel is really various.\nAbout it, I do not have a good opinion. \n\nLaundromat is in the city section. \nHowever, a district without it also exists. \n\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n"
