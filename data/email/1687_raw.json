They already have the makoto flag tattoo-ed on a shoulder and looking for some kind of phrase (and the kanji, I suspect) to go with a fan design they&#39;re having done next.  Now&#39;s your chance to suggest those tattoo-ed phrases you&#39;ve always wanted yourself and never had the guts to do.  :-D\n \nhttp://www.livejournal.com/community/shq_spy_office/4072.html#cutid1\n \nCan some of you far more knowledgeable than me help them out with some suggestions?  I&#39;d love to show them how crazy we are.   If you don&#39;t have a livejournal account (well, why not?) and want to answer their questions and/or contribute suggestions, I&#39;m willing to pass it on.\n \nphil\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
