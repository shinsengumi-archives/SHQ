I did mention Shiba Goro on the updated Saitou Hajime\ninfo-sheet.  What I will try to follow up it the Saga REbellion in\nwhich Yamakawa Ookura/Taizo/Hiroshi acquitted himself very well and\nwas promoted in the army...Yamakawa Hiroshi later was chief of staff\nin Seinan as you recall.  Thanks for summarizing everything\nbelow....these Aizu folks sure stuck together.Don&#39;t forget how\nYamakawa Hiroshi wanted to investigate the can clamming business too.\n\n\nYamakawa Hiroshi, puts arm around Fujita Goro&#39;s shoulder &quot;Hey Goro,\nlet&#39;s say you and me go into the can clamming business---we&#39;ll make a\nfortune!!!&quot;\n\nGoro &quot;ummm I&#39;ll stick with the police work thank you&quot;\n\nAnd about the clairvoyance testing...I&#39;m STILL pretty peeved at\nYamakawa Kenjiro about 1) messing up the experiment by forgetting to\ninsert the plate and 2) saying that no mistake occurred in an article\npublished at a later date...no doubt he was fascinated with the\nresearch (otherwise he wouldn&#39;t risk his reputation by involving\nhimself with Dr. Fukuzawa) but clearly he was too busy covering up his\nown error.\n\nI highly recommend people read both Shiba Goro&#39;s REMEMBERING AIZU and\nthe biography of Yamakawa Sutematsu....completes the &quot;picture&quot;\nperfectly and both books are EXTREMELY affordable...I got the\nSutematsu book for under $5.000 the information is INCREDIBLE!!!!!\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;warg3791&quot; &lt;Warg3791@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Forgot until I glanced at the SHQ website that Yamakawa Hiroshi, one \n&gt; of the go-betweens for Fujita Goro&#39;s marriage to Takagi Tokio, and \n&gt; Yamakawa Okura were one and the same. Remembering Aizu talkes about \n&gt; him mostly under the name Okura. Shiba Goro knew him as well, after \n&gt; he left Shimokita and went to Tokyo. He stayed with Yamakawa a couple \n&gt; of times when he had no where else to go, despite the fact that the \n&gt; former domain elder was jobless and broke. Yamakawa and his mother \n&gt; ended up borrowing 13 yen and 50 sen from Shiba in fact. You reminded \n&gt; me of his Fujita connection, but not that he was in Remembering Aizu \n&gt; the other day.\n&gt; \n&gt; And why didn&#39;t you remind me about that little scandal he was \n&gt; involved in back in Shimokita? Where he was buying up all the dregs \n&gt; from the tofu dealer and the samurai confronted him about it? HM? LOL\n&gt; \n&gt; Book specifically mentions his younger brother Kenjiro and Tokio&#39;s \n&gt; cousin, Takamine Hideo, on pg 133. Didn&#39;t realize that. Was the part \n&gt; about them being survivors of the Byakkotai.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now how I missed -this- I don&#39;t know...\n&gt; Sagawa &quot;Ogre&quot; Kanbei fought in Kyoshu as the head of a plice unit \n&gt; made up of 150 former Aizu samurai. (Knew that) To the end he refused \n&gt; to use a modern weapon and was shot and killed at Mount Aso. ?!?! How \n&gt; did I NOT see that before?! I&#39;m guessing this was in 1878 Sec?\n&gt; \n&gt; And does anyone know if Hirosawa Tomijiro (liaison for Aizu with the \n&gt; Shinsengumi) and Hirosawa Yasuto (who had the first western-style \n&gt; dairy farm) were one and the same? I recall seeing information from a \n&gt; website that M translated for us that said Tomijiro was the owner of \n&gt; this place. But Remembering Aizu mentions his first name is Yasuto? \n&gt; Did he change his name or was the website mistaken?\n&gt; \n&gt; -MissB\n\n\n\n\n"
