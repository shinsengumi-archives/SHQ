This is based on the \nidea that if the any members of Mimawarigumi and Shinsengumi were \ninvolved then it wouldn&#39;t have been a secret and just official police \nbusiness. There wouldn&#39;t be a reason to cover it up or be secret \nabout it. I just thought I would mention this...take it for whatever \nit is worth...\n\nThis is taken from Mitsuo Kure&#39;s Samurai book:\n\n&quot;Who was responsible for the killing of Ryoma? Under the Kyoto\nshugo there were two police organizations, the Shinsengumi and \nMimawarigumi. When Matsudaira Katamori, the lord of Aizu, was \nappointed as shugo his soldiers were based at the Komyoji Temple. The \nMimawarigumi stayed at a branch temple of the Komyoji and executed \ntheir duties around the temples of the city. Ryoma was regarded as a \ncriminal because he had killed one of the police raiders with his \nrevolver during the attack on him at the Teradaya inn; so it would \nnot be strange if he was a police target. According to the memoir of \nTeshirogi Suguemon, an inspector of the Shinsengumi who served under \nMatsudaira Katamori, it was Katamori who ordered Ryoma&#39;s \nassassination, and Suguemon is a credible source. But if Ryoma was a \ncriminal why did the Mimawarigumi resort to assassination? Legitimate \npolice activity did not have to be kept secret. \n\n If it was not a simple matter of police revenge, then who profited \nmost from Ryoma&#39;s death? The answer must be that the men who\nwanted to unleash military violence against the bakufu broke from the \nspell of the most influential voice speaking against the civil\nwar.&quot;\n\n(Samurai: An Illustrated History, Kure, p. 139)\n\nKevin\n \n\n\n"
