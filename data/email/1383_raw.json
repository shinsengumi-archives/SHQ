To be \n&gt;continued... so.\n&gt;They experiment to compare, with and without Sake normaly added to Isida \n&gt;San&#39;yaku and also drunk when taking this medicine, because of eventually effect of \n&gt;it. \n&gt;They chose the Sake which is come from Hino area, made by same method of \n&gt;those time in order to have approximate one used by Hijikata or Satou family.\n&gt;( This Sake called &quot;Genroku&quot; is produced by Sawanoi brewer: \n&gt;http://www.sawanoi-sake.com/)\n&gt;\n&gt;And the site tells the effect of Isida San&#39;yaku was attested by Ryojun \n&gt;Matsumoto\n&gt;in Meiji to have the admission. Because Meiji government prohibited this kind \n&gt;of &quot;old wives remedy&quot;, especially charred one like Isida San&#39;yaku. \n&gt;They say also, it&#39;s difficult to think Ryojun attested it with only his \n&gt;sympathy for Shinsengumi, considering the political situation of the period.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tama\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nHey Tama, didn&#39;t they say at the time that they would allow the Hijikata family to keep producing the medicine if they added something else to it? But the family refused, preferring just to stop making the drug to altering the formula. At least that&#39;s what the sites I&#39;ve been to seem to indicate. Am I reading that right?\n\nAnd while Yamazaki is stumbling around trying to find a way to NOT answer Saito&#39;s question, Hijikata walks up behind him. Silently fumes a moment as his family rememdy being dissed, then has a bright idea on how to deal with the good doctor...\n\nHijikata: &quot;Yamazaki-san, I need you to check out a potential Choshu hide-out for me. It&#39;s a HIGHLY dangerous mission and there&#39;s a possibilty you won&#39;t come back alive. Rumor says there are about 50 of them looking to do away with any even slightly suspicious. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to go in dressed as a woman...&quot; -smirk-\n\nAnd Yamazaki&#39;s career as the Shinsengumi&#39;s top spy was born...\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
