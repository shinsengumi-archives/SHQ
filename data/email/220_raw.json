I told the teacher that\nthis was the first Basho poem I&#39;d read, and knowing my pro-samurai\nstance, he laughed and said, &quot;Ah, so this is what got you started!&quot;\nAnd I was like, &quot;What, with Basho or samurai?&quot; and then, a guy I\nhardly know, said &quot;Freak&quot; from the other side of the classroom. We\nstared each other down for so long that the teacher had to step in...\n\nWhat is up with these people? Why do they hate samurai so much? I\nrealize they weren&#39;t _all_ wonderful-- I mean, people like Kato\nKiyomasa were good generals, but brutal and utterly heartless-- but\nthat doesn&#39;t mean that ALL samurai were bad, right? It&#39;s like Victor\nHarris said in the conclusion of his biography of Miyamoto Musashi--\n&quot;The aim of this cruel, headstrong man was evidently most humble and\nhonest.&quot; These people were warriors-- it was their business to fight.\nBut ultimately, all most of them really wanted was to acheive true\nstrength, to bring stability (and consequently, peace) to the realm,\nand also to better themselves in the knolwedge of both literary and\nmartial arts-- after all, like Lord Hojo Soun said:\n\n&quot;Hold literary skills in your left hand, martial skills in your right.\nThis is the law from ancient times. Never neglect it.&quot;\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n--M.\n\n \n\n\n"
