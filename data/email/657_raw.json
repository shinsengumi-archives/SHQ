By the same token, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was quite handy with two swords (though not as suave as Aoshi --- TWO kodachi in ONE sheath??? &lt;snicker&gt; one of my favorite quotes from RK). Do we really have any idea just how many different styles Saitou was schooled in?  And given how slick RK Saitou is, I&#39;d expect him to be ambidextrous (he certainly was against Sano in their little fist fight... at least twice it was a right upper-cut that knocked Sano silly.)\n \nphil\n\nTiffany &lt;tnamwong@...&gt; wrote:\nokay, further speculation...this mystery guy uses 2 swords.\nI just read an article on left handed people and how many gain a high\nlevel of ambidexterity depending on the social environment they lived\nin...now I will always insist that hist. Saitou was a natural lefty\nand acquired &quot;social&quot; ambidexterity...in the case of handing things to\npeople/writing in front of other (you usually hand things to people\nwith both hands or right hand at least in Japanese culture - I\nheard)...and many martial artists, e.g. bare-handed techniques will\npurposefully try to gain ambidexterity helpful in\ngrappling/throws/pins etc...so it is possible Saitou could use 2\nswords very well.\n\n\n\nvisit \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
