Discovered some details almost as soon as I began my \nresearch this morning, so I thought I&#39;d share it with you all. It really \nchanged how I look at the whole situation.\n\nAnyway, I just read in &quot;Shinsengumi Saitou Hajime no Subete&quot; (history book) \nthat the whole\nreason why Aizu was called to Kyoto (and why Shinsengumi and Mimawarigumi\nwere formed) was literally for riot control. The assassinations got SO bad\nthat the Shoshidai and the Machi-bugyosho (city magistrate, almost like the\npolice department) couldn&#39;t handle it. So the Shogunate got Aizu to go there\nand restore order. Katamori-sama got the order in the 8th month of Bunkyu 2\n(1862), and arrived in Kyoto in the 12th month, which translates to roughly\nJanuary 1863, I believe. They were able to restore order, but what really\nhelped Aizu was the Roushitai showing up in early 1863, and Kondou and co.\ndeciding they were going to stay and fight for the Shogunate. Hence the\nrapid Aizu support.\n\nWhat&#39;s more, I think we should also keep in mind that Aizu regarded\nShinsengumi as sort of &quot;spare parts&quot;-- Katamori-sama wanted a way of taking\ncare of the dissident roushi (unemployed rebel samurai), so what he did was\nfight fire with fire by using his OWN set of roushi, which was none other\nthan the Mibu-roushigumi (aka Shinsengumi).\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
