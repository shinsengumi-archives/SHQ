For example,\n\nhttp://cork.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/chi05/chi05_3959/\n\nDisguised as something related to the Kamakura era (1200s), but if you look \nclosely at the crests of the people in the picture (click to get larger \nimage), you can tell that these are figures representing the domains that \ntook the fight of the Ishin Shishi northward. In other words, these are the \npeople representing the domains who, among other things, leveled Nagaoka, \nsent the survivors of Aizu to Shimokita, and killed Hijikata at \nHakodate...So far, the only crest that&#39;s really easily identifiable is that \nof the Mouri, lords of Choshuu-- the guy in the blue court costume on the \nfar left of the painting.\n\n--\n\nhttp://cork.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/chi05/chi05_3956/\n\nCalled &quot;The Spring Incident at Honnoji&quot; (includes a brief note on the \n&quot;renaming&quot; trend), after the incident in which Oda Nobunaga was killed by \nAkechi Mitsuhide. HOWEVER, this, and \nhttp://cork.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/chi05/chi05_3957/ (called &quot;Ishiyama \nHonganji Kassen&quot;, the &quot;Decisive Battle of Ishiyama Honganji&quot;, another of \nNobunaga&#39;s battles), are both cleverly disguised prints of the Shogitai&#39;s \nstand at the Kaneiji Temple in Ueno.\n\n--\n\nhttp://cork.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/chi05/chi05_3953/chi05_3953.jpg\nhttp://cork.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/chi05/chi05_3954/\n\nEmperor&#39;s procession to Edo Castle\n\n--\n\nhttp://cork.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/chi05/chi05_3952/\n\nTokugawa Yoshinobu returns.\n\n--\n\nhttp://cork.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/bunko10/b10_8324/b10_8324.jpg\n\nSEC Take note-- seems to be TMPD officers fighting former samurai. Not in \nSatsuma, though-- I think these guys are enforcing the anti-sword law.\n\n\n\nThat&#39;s all for now.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
