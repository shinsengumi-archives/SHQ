The answer to that may an=\r\nswer my next question - And, \nmore specifically, why did/would Souji change=\r\n his name from Harumasa \nto Kaneyoshi?  And, the change from Soujirou to So=\r\nuji?    In NHK, he \ntells Heisuke something like I changed my name to match=\r\n the young \nmaster.  Based on historical truth?  Or fiction?\n\n******\n\nI kno=\r\nw I&#39;ve asked questions on adoptions before, but... When Kondou \nShusuke ado=\r\npted Okita Mitsu, was it so that she would not be Okita \nRintaro&#39;s &quot;sister&quot;=\r\n so that they could marry?  What would Kondou \nShusuke get in return for do=\r\ning this?  Was it as common to adopt \nfemales?\n\n******\n\nI was a little conf=\r\nused by the &quot;two Rintaro&#39;s.&quot;  Same man or two \nseparate people?  Okita Rint=\r\naro Fusamasa (or is it Kanemasa?) was \nMitsu&#39;s husband?  And - \n\n&lt;&lt;&quot;one was=\r\n Inoue Rintaro Mototsune, whom bought his samurai status \n(from the Okita f=\r\namily) after Okita Katsujiro&#39;s death on (lunar \ncalendar) October 20, 1845.=\r\n..&quot;&gt;&gt;  Seven\n\nHe paid the Okita family?  As sort of a replacement for Katsu=\r\njirou?  \nAfter he married Souji&#39;s mother, why did he take the name Okita?  =\r\nNot \nto be head of the family as Katsujirou had already adopted the man \nth=\r\nat was to marry Mitsu?  Am I completely confused?\n\n******\n\n&lt;&lt;...but really =\r\nyou don&#39;t have to be a specialist you can be a fan \nwho joins the group and=\r\n asks questions, this will help the main \nwriters understand the &quot;FAQ&quot; of t=\r\nhe hundreds of thousands of Okita \nfans out there&gt;&gt;  secretary\n\nI&#39;ve got ma=\r\nny Okita related questions and would be happy to ask them \nif Seven or anyo=\r\nne else is interested in what us Souji fans want to \nknow.  I&#39;m more an exp=\r\nert in the area of things that are presented as \nfact in fiction - be it fi=\r\nlm, anime, or manga.  Drop me a note if \nyou&#39;re interested.\n\n\nI&#39;ll keep my =\r\nquestions to that for now.  : )\n\n--Wanda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
