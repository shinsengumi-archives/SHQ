The title is &quot;The \nShogun&#39;s Gold&quot; by Masayo=\r\nshi Sato and is published by Kodansha. It is out of print but you can \npick=\r\n up a used copy on Amazon for a really cheap price. The novel is set during=\r\n the \nBakumatsu period and is about that period&#39;s exchange rate wars betwee=\r\nn the Bakufu and the \nWest. (I had read previously that according to many J=\r\napanese economist, it was the currency \nwar of this period that really unde=\r\nrscored the end of  the Togugawa government)  What is \ninteresting is that =\r\nthe author chooses to tell the narrative through the eyes of Rutherford \nAl=\r\ncock, Britian&#39;s first counsel general to Japan. It is a most fascinating re=\r\nad. The novel is set \nbetween the periods of March 1859 - December 1862. Tw=\r\no months later in February of \n1863, Kiyokawa Hachiro left Edo for Kyoto wi=\r\nth his 250 strong Roshi corp. And as we know, \nwhile in Kyoto, 13 members o=\r\nf the Roshi broke rank with Kiyokawa and formed the \nShinsengumi. This hist=\r\norical novel provides a wonderful economic context to the political \nintens=\r\nity and  emotions that swirled in these times.\n\n-Rodney\n\n\n"
