As an example from the times, Sagara Souzou.  The politics of the times and his philosophy brought him into association with many who would become future Shinsengumi members and rivals within the Ishin Shishi... men who ended up becoming his enemies.  Truth is often stranger than fiction.\n \nphil\n\nBarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nAlan wrote:\n\n&gt;This is very poor reasoning.  An argument like this is like saying \n&gt;Kondo and the Shogun had slumber parties as children because there&#39;s \n&gt;no documentation saying they weren&#39;t friends, or that there weren&#39;t \n&gt;any slumber parties in Japan, yet both were in Edo during that time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t think it&#39; s poor reasoning at all. While Kondou wouldn&#39;t have \nbeen in the same &quot;social circle&quot; as the Shogun it&#39;s quite in the realm \nof possibility that he knew or knew of other prominent political \nactivists/figures. \n\nI say this because I have met quite a number of &quot;important people&quot; in \nthe writing world through various conferences and such.  No, we&#39;re not \nbest buddies and for the most part I don&#39;t talk to many of these folks \non a regular basis but the thing we share in common does bring us \ntogether as friends and companions as many times as we  have reason and \nthe resources to gather.\n\nSo I think it&#39;s quite possible for some of these people to have run in \nthe same circles at times.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
