Will details probably be being referred to being this sight, how?&quot;\n&gt; [translation?]\n&gt; I ~think~ she said that she has [also] heard this rumor but like me/us\n&gt; she isn&#39;t sure why this detail hasn&#39;t showed up on 3-hajime.com\n&gt; \n&gt; ***Tiffany/secretarytocapt3 speculating (what a surprise huh?) \n&gt; o.k. from past discussions we have &quot;concluded&quot; that S.H. very likely\n&gt; crosstrained in many lineages/sword styles although Mugai-ryu\n&gt; (kenjutsu) seems to be the most widely accepted (mentioned on many\n&gt; Japanese sites+Serizawa Kamo&#39;s Bio).  To teach kenjutsu one must be\n&gt; able to cite one&#39;s lineage and preferably provide a certificate.  Now\n&gt; the Shinsengumi, to me doesn&#39;t seem to be the most orthodox group so\n&gt; I&#39;m sure when/if the groups data keeper/scribe asked &quot;um Mr.Saito may\n&gt; I see your certificate&quot; I&#39;m sure historical Saito said &quot;if you&#39;ll step\n&gt; outside I&#39;ll show my martial arts style&quot; and that would be the end of\n&gt; the discussion.  \n&gt; But after the revolution and all would it be a good idea for him to\n&gt; try to attach himself to let&#39;s say an educational institute and try to\n&gt; teach kenjutsu---these formal environments would definately ask to see\n&gt; credentials.\n&gt; And what bothers me is was he ever formally certified at all seeing\n&gt; how he was a ronin and all. I&#39;m assuming certification takes time and\n&gt; perhaps he studied at some dojo as child/adolescent and may be a very\n&gt; talented studetn but never got certified. So ~if~ he did teach perhaps\n&gt; it was very informally on the side.\n&gt; \n&gt; side note = Yes he did live/work at the Yoshida dojo (after killing\n&gt; someone, a retainer to the shogun is a rumor) because of his father&#39;s\n&gt; connections.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Actually I think I read some snippet somewhere eons ago about him  \n&gt; &gt; teaching kendo at some point which I suppose would be \n&gt; akin to gym class?\n\n\nBut wouldn&#39;t he also have to prove he was certified to compete in the kendo tournaments of the police? I&#39;m sure his bosses within the department knew all about who he was and they might have been the once he taught kendo for. Or maybe he got certified throught the Shinsengumi somehow? Kondou had been the master of a dojo after all. I&#39;m sure he could have arranged it. But this is all just speculation.\n\nAs to the origins of the rumor that he taught kendo after the war, I know of one site that mentions this. The Hiten Misurugi Ryuu site states that he was a kendo instructor for a time, but not where: \nhttp://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/Saitou.htm\n\nHowever, they also state that he didn&#39;t join the police force right away. They list the year he became a policeman as 1877. But we know he joined sooner than that. Perhaps they got confused about his leaving for the Senian War and thought that meant this is when he joined? The Saitou Watcher&#39;s Tea Room interestingly enough seems to make this same mistake, also listing the year he joined the police as 1877.\n\n-MissBehavin (Hands out Tylenol to everyone trying to track Saito-sama&#39;s movements.)\n\n"
