LOL! Well it was \nbound to happen considering how popular NHK Shinsengumi is in Japan. \nNow I just have one question, at one point I had read somewhere \nprobably here or one of the other journals that there was a planned \nsequel and it was to cover Hijikata-san (Kouji) at Goryokaku, I \nwonder if that&#39;s still in the works or was that just a rumor?\n\nNow I can&#39;t wait for this special I must see Jo in a police uniform. \nLOL!!!!!!!!!!! And of course the others too... \n\n~Kizu\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, BarbaraSheridan &lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; http://www3.nhk.or.jp/drama/\n&gt; (click on the blue and white banner/button on the left)\n&gt; \n&gt;  From Michael Reid our Shinsengumi film guru---\n&gt; NHK&#39;S Shogetsu special is an 4 hour sequel to the Shinsengumi \ntaiga \n&gt; drama it will cover all the surviving members through Ueno ,Aizu \n&gt; Wakamatsu and Goryokaku ,all the same cast members will return \n(except \n&gt; the dead ones )Koji Yamamoto ,Odagiri Jo ,Shohei  and the rest. \nKoki \n&gt; Mitani is the writer again it will air on 1/3/06 and 1/7/06 .\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone can give us a bit of a translation of the NHK page it \nwould be \n&gt; most appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; The Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n\n"
