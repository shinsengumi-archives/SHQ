Why do I always feel \nlike I&#39;m getting the B.S. version of history? You know what they say: History is \nwritten by the winners. I was very disappointed in the one I caught the other \nnight, but I had to work so I missed the ones that were on yesterday.\n\nYou know, I have a book that&#39;s called Weird Histoy 101 or something like \nthat. It&#39;s actually very critical of the U. S. decision to use the bomb.  When I \nget time, I&#39;ll find out the exact title, author, etc. for those who might be \ninterested in hearing the other side of the story. \n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
