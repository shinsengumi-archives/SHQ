Yes! I&#39;ll be there to &quot;listen&quot; in. I&#39;ll try not to make \ntoo \n&gt; much noise so as not to distract. :O)\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh you don&#39;t know about that java chat feature! It&#39;s evil... It \nwill \n&gt; do all sort of things like throw us out or make all letters \n&gt; invisible... And just a heads up (and I&#39;m serious about this), try \n&gt; not to use two character smilies like this :)\n&gt; When I did that it threw me out... All four times I did a smiley. \n&gt; Must be all the Ishin spirits coming over and hating smilies \n&gt; intended for Saitou, Hijikata and Sano...\n&gt; \n&gt; See you then... Thanks for making time for us!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, Serizawa Kamo &lt;serizawakamo@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to propose a tentative chat session for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sunday June 6th\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; New York 6:00 pm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Los Angeles 3:00 pm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chicago 5:00 pm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sao Paulo/Buenos Aires 7:00 pm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7:00 pm? I can try showing up... though this Sunday I\n&gt; &gt; will be in one of the presentations scheduled for this\n&gt; &gt; month, hopefully it will be over before 6:00 pm.\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps I will end up showing a little later (like\n&gt; &gt; 8:00 pm?), but I will try my best to show up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I am a bit ahead of schedule in my translations and\n&gt; &gt; in my preparatives, I hope I will have some time to\n&gt; &gt; chat. I tried the chat applet and it worked fine, so I\n&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t have any problem with connection or the\n&gt; &gt; like.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Serizawa Kamo\n&gt; &gt; (still wondering how on Earth a movie could be\n&gt; &gt; produced in the 19th century :D)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
