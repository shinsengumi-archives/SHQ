There are many things \nrepeated on the net from various sources and instead of individually \npulling them together (which could be inefficient time-wise) a sheet \nthat is free for all to translate is better, plus we could avoid \noffending anyone. \n\nSec, you suggested I do a Shinsengumi page in Tagalog, I&#39;m \nconsidering it but see the country&#39;s second language is English. \nSince the internet (believe it or not) is more of a luxury than a \nconvenience in the Philippines, those Filipinos who do go online \nspeak/read quite well since they belong to the middle to upper \nclass. That said, I will still translate anything to Tagalog that \nanyone wants me to as long as it&#39;s Shinsengumi related. LOL! ^__^\n\nOh I noticed only two are from the Midwest (so far). Darn, I wanted \nto meet up with some of you ;)\n\nLast but not the least... Does anyone know what the following videos \nare and what they are about? I&#39;ve never seen them before. Apologies \nif they&#39;ve been discussed before. \n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/mg_batt/shinsenanime.jpg\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/mg_batt/oldshinsenmovie.jpg\n\n\nThat said, I&#39;ve noticed that for the game BRS (Bakumatsu Renka \nShinsengumi), otherwise known as the lovely Shinsengumi dating game, \ndoujinshi are being produced and they go for a very lovely price. \nLOL! After the NHK Shinsengumi fever, I hope just like Kidou Moeyo \nKen they make an anime of this game... It&#39;s been a while since PMK \nand of course the manga finishing is questionable... *sigh* Either \nway, I wish someone gets a bright idea to turn BRS into an anime \nconsidering the doujinshis for this game is fetching quite high \nprices in Japan...\n\n~Kizu\n\n\n\n"
