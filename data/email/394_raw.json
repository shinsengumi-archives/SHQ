Between my own scattered & chemically disconnected brain cells and Yahoo&#39;s continued insistence on delivering messages willy-nilly, I thought I might&#39;ve missed something about Sasaki being the one Saitou was related to.  The last I&#39;d heard it hadn&#39;t been established &quot;who&quot; (if anyone) was the relation.  ;-D\n \nOh, I understand about speculation... I do it all the time... (which *may* be more dangerous than history as told by Hollywood).\n \nphil\n\nGrace Battista &lt;mg_batt@...&gt; wrote:\nHmmm...
