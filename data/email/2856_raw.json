The record of Okita\n&gt; Rintaro as [adopted] son o=\r\nf Okita Katsujiro *is* a fact, recorded in a\n&gt; source related to the Shinch=\r\nogumi, compiled *during* the Bakumatsu,\n&gt; which Kikuchi lists. It wasn&#39;t ra=\r\nised as part of explaining why Soji\n&gt; is listed as the &quot;second son&quot;, it was=\r\n merely confirming how Rintaro\n&gt; Mototsune/Fusamasa was listed in Shinchogu=\r\nmi records. Kikuchi\n&gt; theorizes later, but this much, with regards to Rinta=\r\nro being\n&gt; Katsujiro&#39;s &quot;son&quot;, is a fact which Kikuchi cites as coming from =\r\nthe\n&gt; record of &quot;Shinchogumi Meisaishosocho&quot;, from 1865.\n&gt; \n&gt; As always, th=\r\nank you for your interaction, and for bringing activity\n&gt; back into this gr=\r\noup.\n&gt; \n&gt; -M.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
