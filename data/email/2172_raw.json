It was his men who set \nthe fires that \n&gt; destroyed the samurai homes which surrounded the castle. Pillaging \nand burning \n&gt; obviously are a common part of war, but they might have also been \ntrying to \n&gt; remove anything that would keep their cannon from striking the \ncastle since \n&gt; they fired on it day and night after that. And these blazes had to \nbe pretty \n&gt; intense because it began to rain around the same time. According \nto witness Shiba \n&gt; Goro, it looked like a &quot;sea of fire&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; MissB\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
