In the chronological table it seems to \nhave a great deal about his what he was doing from the battle of Toba-\nFushimi until he goes to Aizu. But of course I can&#39;t understand the \nnames of any of the places or people because they&#39;re mangled. It does \nseem that he was &quot;at the rear&quot; with Nagakura during the fighting on \nJanuary 6. It also says something about him takeing &quot;a treatment of \nwound in a medical place&quot; and something about Izumi Bridge on January \n19. \n\nIn the section on the different names he went by it&#39;s trying to \nexplain the origin of the name &quot;Fujita Goro&quot;. It&#39;s saying something \nabout he was &quot;granted&quot; the name &quot;of an old Aizu feudal lord according \nto the traditions of the Fujitas&quot;. It states there are no historical \nrecords to back the story up, but then the webmaster speculates it \ncould be true because he was able to marry Tokio and something about \nwho one of the go-betweens was. I&#39;m guessing they mean one of the men \nother than Matsudaira.\n\nThe family register now lists Yaso too. I can&#39;t figure out what it&#39;s \ntrying to say about her brothers though. It seems to indicate her \nfather was killed in battle, but I might be misreading it.\n\nOne amusing thing at least. When it was trying to explain something \nabout where the name &quot;Saito&quot; came from it said: &quot;...no singing from \ndoor to door for money&quot;. Ok...  I have no idea what that has to do \nwith his name, but I&#39;ll take that advice to heart!\n\n-MissBehavin (Swears she never sang door to door for money in her \nlife!)\n\n\n"
