Aizu was deeply involved in this war, and caused a lot of \ndamage to the &quot;Imperial&quot; side-- apparently, at one point, out of seven \nengagements, the &quot;Imperials&quot; only won one. The most crushing victory for the \nnorthern domains was the Battle of Enoki Pass in early July.\n\nIf some of you will recall, I mentioned in a translated document a while ago \nthat Matsudaira Katamori &quot;shouted&quot; at Hijikata to run to Shonai and get \nreinforcements. Apparently, Shonai, Aizu, and Yonezawa were the 3 major \ndomains surrounding Echigo, and also the leading domains in the 10 or so \nwhich formed the &quot;Northern Confederacy&quot;.\n\nThe most incredible story from the Echigo War is that of Nagaoka Castle. It \nsounds like a harbinger of Aizu every time I read about it-- ALL the people \nof the domain stood up together against the Satsuma and Choshuu invaders. \nNagaoka fielded 1,500 men. 317 people were killed in action, 266 wounded. \nOver 3,000 of its houses were destroyed, its castle was totally wiped off \nthe face of the earth, and the domain was reduced from a 74,000 koku-sized \nterritory to one of 24,000.\n\nWhat the &quot;Imperials&quot; did makes me sick...\n\n--Masayoshi\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
