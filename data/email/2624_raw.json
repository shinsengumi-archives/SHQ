Inheriting the tradition doesn&#39;t\nnecessarily mean that you \ninherit the master&#39;s family. Tennen Rishin Ryu today\nis an example of that-- \nthe Kondo and Miyagawa families alternate headship, if\nI recall correctly, \nbut the present master is......Sono Seigo? Not\nsure...the last Kondo to be \nhead of the school was Kondo Isuke, who I believe died\nin the early 1990s.\n\nHello, I belong to a group called the Yamato Yagyu Kai\nwhich happens to be under a man named Sono Seigo\n(Walter Sensei calls him Seigo, the letter he wrote to\nManogue Sensei he spells his name Seiko).  This Sono\nthat you mention wouldn&#39;t happen to be the Sono Seigo\nwho lives in Osaka would it?  Sono Sensei is the 17th\nhead of Edo Yagyu Shinkage Ryu.  I think our group is\nor was connected to a dojo that teaches Buikukai\nAikido.  The instructor there, a man named Yoshida\n(I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know his first name, but he is the\nAikido instructor to my Kenjutsu instructor Paul\nManogue) is a shihan of Tennen Rishin Ryu.\n\nRemember, No Matter How Bad Life Gets, There Is Always Beer.\n-Norm MacDonald\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
