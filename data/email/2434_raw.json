Yes, it&#39;s Katsura, yes he is on the &quot;other side&quot; \nas Sherl put it (^_^) but the man is just fascinating and \ncompassionate and boy he can write.  So when  you guys do research \nfor fun -do not- expect to walk into the library and \nfind &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; instead look at the other sources.  He also dealt \nwith Toshiyoshi Kawaji during Seinan.\n\nI&#39;m with M, I really enjoy studying Aizu (Byakkotai, Joushitai and \nAizu women in the Meiji in general like the awesome YAMAMOTO YAEKO + \nJo Neesima).\n\nWe don&#39;t know a whole lot about the Fujita family, except what is \nwritten in Japanese however I&#39;m very happy with what I have found in \ntheir relationship to Aizu&#39;s Yamakawa family...so I research the \nYamakawa family (plenty of shreds of info in ENGLISH).\nDon&#39;t know about Fujita Goro the man, but I have learned alot by \nstudying his -job- the history of the TMPD, Toshiyoshi Kawaji etc.  \nSame with Tokio, her job at Tokyo Women&#39;s Normal School aka (Women&#39;s \nNormal School, Teacher&#39;s College for Women and sometimes footnoted \nat Ochanomizu) is just amazing...she had to keep with the changing \ntimes I use keynames like Takamine Hideo (her cousin),  Tsuda Umeko\n(her own school can be a -template- for how women&#39;s schools were \nrun), women&#39;s dorm life, alumni of Tokyo Women&#39;s normal school YASUI \nTETSU (same generation as Fujita MIdori) who taught in Siam and \nutitilized TWNS&#39; model there too!  So basically I&#39;m happy to learn \nabout the &quot;sphere&quot; in which our beloved historical figures lived and \nwork.\n\nI look up various keywords like &quot;Yasui Bank&quot; to learn about the \nsignificance of Tokio opening a bank account...for example\nhttp://www1.kinjo-\nu.ac.jp/~nakata/Nakata/Data/Sectors/2Sector/EYasuda.htm\n\nI believe that there are more hard records in Aizu about Tokio \nbecause she retained a leadership role due to her past employment \nwith Teruhime and ofcourse she did collect money to build a memorial \nfor those killed in Aizu.\n\nAlso found some valuable stuff on two of Kondo&#39;s buddies back home \nin Tama during the Bakumatsu and what they did in the Meiji (let&#39;s \njust say the farmers of Tama weren&#39;t all that -simple-).\n\nSo Sherl, whatever you can dig up is appreciated.\n\nOn a side note, I love SCANDAL...the  ROKUMEIKAN kind ::hehehe:: \nsomeone should totally write a fantasy Shinsengumi fanfic putting \nthem in the Deer Cry Pavilion.  For the new people please see the \nMeiji thread at shinsengumimb.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
