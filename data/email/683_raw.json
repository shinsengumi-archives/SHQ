S.H. was born (I think that is\nthe gist of the page)...unlike 3-hajime she has pics of Aizu\nlocations, not only bonari pass+buddha hall, summary of a stage play\nstarring our Fujita Goro, discusses the poplularit of Okita&#39;s grave\nand lots of neat things\n\n****1to5.net has something really weird info not mentioned elsewhere\n\n****I&#39;ll spare you the [entire] babel trans...greatly paraphrased\n\n1) There is a location (1to5.net has a pic) where Ito and his minions\nand Saito stayed at...at this place Ito (and or his followers)\n&quot;Manufacturing method of English or rocket&quot; and webmaster thinks that\nperhaps S.H. as an Ito follower studied this as well\n\n2) Ito to Saitou &quot;you are young, therefore it is, the white tooth\nsaying, the air which was studied various types does the various not\nlearning.&quot; \n\nnow...on 3-hajime you get an account of Kondou criticizing Saitou for\nhis inability to write his name (or the quality of calligraphy)\n\n3) at this &quot;place&quot; &quot;passes about 7 months here. Making provision for\nthe surprise attack of new selection group, when sleeping, it\ndesignates the right arm as under, or designates the left arm as\nunder, or discoursed so is, but if Saito left-handedness, everyone you\nsleep backwards the oak and others? With just a little you think.&quot;\n\n*at other websites the Itou affair lasted 8 months not 7...webmaster\nis still speculating on the left/right hand thing here\n\n\n \n\n\n"
