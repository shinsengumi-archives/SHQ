It was about Kondou facing off against \nSerizawa as the Roushigumi headed from Edo to Kyoto and Serizawa was not \ngiven proper accommodations.\n\nIf you aren&#39;t a fan of the actor playing serizawa (Koichi Sato who was \nSaitou in Mibugishiden) you will be after seeing this performance. That \nman can convey what would be lines and lines of dialogue with a few \nfacial expressions. I&#39;m not at all surprised he won an award for his \nSaitou portrayal..\n\n&gt;3) http://www.saitou-hajime.com or http://www.saito-hajime.com is\n&gt;CLOSING :(\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhy are they closing down?
