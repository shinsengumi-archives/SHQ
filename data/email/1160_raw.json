Do you know if its currently in any museum? \nDuring the later Edo period a lot of swords emerged that had very little curvature like Saitou&#39;s katana. I read on one Japanese site that the use of shinai had an influence on the decrease in curvature. \n\nDo you by chance have a site that has the kanji for the maker&#39;s name on Miki&#39;s katana? I have a small hunch that the name has something to do with the way it was made. \n\n \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: secretary \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, June 17, 2004 6:18 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] Re: Miki+Saitou&#39;s Sword\n\n\n  For people unfamiliar with the obsession over historical Saitou&#39;s sword\n  {please cut and paste...yahoo messes up long link/addresses)\n  http://p076.ezboard.com/fshinsengumiheadquartersfrm17.\n  showMessage?topicID=1.topic\n\n  [doing some guessing here...]\n  http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~ikkaku/138saito.htm\n  &quot;Ikeda Kijinnmaru Kunishige made on Tennna 2nd,70cm length&quot;\n  says that kunishige/kunisige part of the sword&#39;s name is the in fact\n  the maker&#39;s name\n\n  https://www.topart.co.jp/cgi-local/cargo/goodsprev.cgi?gno=43379\n  ikeda seems to be the name of a place according to this site...and the\n  sword was made in Edo\n\n  *we all followed, with great interest, stories of Okita&#39;s sword...but\n  I also recall that Saitou&#39;s sword was also an &quot;antique&quot;...(sigh) just\n  can&#39;t find the right link...upon reviewing sites which sell\n  reproductions of Saitou&#39;s sword I noticed that the blade is quiet\n  straight compared to other Japanese swords I&#39;ve seen on the\n  net...ofcourse each smith has a distinct style and stuff...but\n  straight edge perfect for those real life gatotsu-like thrusts\n\n  secretarytocapt3 still imagining that conversation Saitou and Miki\n  must have had about their swords possibly being of the same/similar\n  make and model or from the same smith...they would totally chat it up\n  and then Hijikata (clears throat)...&quot;excuse me guys we&#39;re trying to\n  have a meeting here&quot;\n  *and what kind of sword smith names his work &quot;demon&quot;...@_@\n  *modern parallel is probably guys obsessed with cars...\n\n  --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; babelfish of Saitou&#39;s sword is Demon circular Kunisige Ikeda \n  &gt; Miki&#39;s sword is &quot;three tree Saburo demon circular Kunisige&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
