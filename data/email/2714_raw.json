Like many scholars he got distracted and had to=\r\n pursue other\nstuff and so forth so it never happened (T_T)\n\nWhat does this=\r\n mean? And why is it important that &quot;scholars&quot; get\ninterested?  Because the=\r\ny write, publish and preserve.  They do the\nnerd work which needs to be don=\r\ne.  And their writing is the source for\nfandom products (pop-culture etc).\n=\r\n\nIn other words---it is up to us fans to make the Shinsengumi so\nsignifican=\r\nt that they finally will look into studying them. It is up\nto us (*_*).  Th=\r\ne cycle between academia and culture must be nurtured\notherwise in a few de=\r\ncades the Shinsengumi will simply slip back into\n&quot;cliche&quot; when as we know t=\r\nhey were very fascinating.\n\nI hope anyone here who is in college will consi=\r\nder speaking to\ngraduate students or professors who specialize in this fiel=\r\nd and ask\nthem about their interests. Do not be surprised if they have neve=\r\nr\nheard of the Shinsengumi (remember they are considered to be basically\nin=\r\nsignificant to many) or even AIZU (which is totally scary seeing how\nSatsum=\r\na and Choshu battled it out with this domain).  It would be\nhelpful if you =\r\nget a basic understanding of this era rather than ask\nthem to tell you ever=\r\nything they know (^_^)---but really you will find\nmany of them to be friend=\r\nly people who are willing to help you.\n  \n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sec=\r\nretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have to bring up this topic aga=\r\nin because it is super super important.\n&gt; \n&gt; There exists out there a SHINS=\r\nENGUMI THESIS that&#39;s right a JAPANESE\n&gt; scholar who saw their historical si=\r\ngnificance and got his degree from\n&gt; studying them ~seriously~ and he had a=\r\ndvisors thus his work is going\n&gt; to be decent AND in English (^_^).\n&gt; \n&gt; Is=\r\n there anyone here part of our mighty Shinsengumi network who lives\n&gt; -IN- =\r\nUtah and can make phone calls?  See I&#39;d do this myself except I\n&gt; maxed out=\r\n my phone card. And the person who promised to help me\n&gt; must&#39;ve forgotten =\r\nor something.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the info I have\n&gt; 1) author was formerly an empl=\r\noyee at the Japanese Cultural Center at\n&gt; Weber State\n&gt; 2) author wrote &quot;&#39;S=\r\namurai in Salt Lake&#39; and available at the Weber\n&gt; State bookstore for aroun=\r\nd $5.00\n&gt; 3) I don&#39;t have a name, year or anything!!! or whether it was an =\r\nMA\n&gt; thesis or undergrad thesis or Phd whatever---however it was\n&gt; &quot;publish=\r\ned&quot; for the school records\n&gt; \n&gt; -but- I have been searching, searching, sea=\r\nrching all databases\n&gt; available to me his thesis is just not showing up an=\r\nywhere which means\n&gt; that if someone can call http://library.weber.edu/ and=\r\n ask the\n&gt; librarian who handles this sort of thing we may be able to read =\r\nit.\n&gt; The best way to go about it is to find his or her &quot;Samurai in Salt\n&gt; =\r\nLake&quot; and get their full name to do a search.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why must we pursue yet m=\r\nore nerdy work?  Because anyone who read Mr.\n&gt; Hillsborough&#39;s work knows th=\r\nat it is far from comprehensive and\n&gt; possibly alot of stuff was left out--=\r\n-this thesis may help us fill in\n&gt; the &#39;gaps&#39;.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
