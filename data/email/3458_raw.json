At least for some of them? I mean a =\r\nstrong bond where you feel\n&gt; you belong, maybe a feeling of understanding.\n=\r\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDear Aki,\n\nI think that&#39;s a fascinating question =\r\nand thanks for posting! (^_^)\n\nIn terms of historical text -explicitly- sta=\r\nting a &quot;family&quot; bond--that\nwould be tough to find because the era and style=\r\n of writing of the\ntime would probably not specify those exact words.  Howe=\r\nver, all\nmembers of the Shinsengumi were humans and therefore fans and\nrese=\r\narchers alike are welcome to draw their own personal conclusions\nabout what=\r\n personal relationships may have arose.\n\nThese are things I think:\n1) age--=\r\n-most of the guys were very young, away from home and in a big\ncity---it&#39;s =\r\nnormal for them to become buddies\n\n2) The Shinsengumi were one of a handful=\r\n of law enforcement units in\nKyoto (Mimawarigumi, Shinchogumi and doshingum=\r\ni forgot the exact\nspelling).  These other groups often had men derived fro=\r\nm the &quot;upper&quot;\nclass (especially the Mimawari) in other words real &quot;heredita=\r\nry&quot;\nsamurai while in contrast the Shinsengumi had men from a varied\nbackgro=\r\nund.  There was no doubt the Shinsengumi operated with a chip\non their shou=\r\nlders and grasped that they were the new kids on the\nblock.  It&#39;s not a str=\r\netch for the Tama group in the Shinsengumi to\nstick amongst themselves beca=\r\nuse of their common background and to a\ngreater extent all the guys from th=\r\ne Edo region to form a group.  \n\n3) modern day military and police units su=\r\nch as the riot polie in\nJapan who do live together (sort of like firemen he=\r\nre in the US) do\nform strong bonds.  One can imagine that the Shinsengumi w=\r\nhich shared\nbarracks also had these strong bonds.  Furthermore the length o=\r\nf time\nduring which the Shinsengumi were active since the early Bakumatsu e=\r\nra\nto the end in 1868 (Aizu) and 69 (Hokkaido) suggest many were comrades\nf=\r\nor YEARS---longer or as long than many modern day wars (or low\nburning poli=\r\ntical conflicts).\n\n\n"
