No luck. I think they stopped printing? (somebody please correct me on this!) But nevertheless, I hope ADV licenses Imon Peacemaker.. That way, fans won&#39;t have to scour for them in obscure places. \n \nIf you&#39;re okay with scanlations, I suggest Manga City. I don&#39;t know if they have it over at Direct Manga, but check it out just in case. And oh! www.stoptazmo.com also have them.\n \nOr if you want, the pm_kurogane community over at LJ created an email account for the downloaded scans. You can just email them to yourself from there ^^ For details, please contact me privately.\n \n \n~Kane\n\n\nBunny ^_^ &lt;shenlong71328@...&gt; wrote:\nIn addition to Logan&#39;s question... I was reading the\nmanga that ADV put out and got hooked.   I was\nwondering if anyone knows where you can find\nShinsengumi Imon in english.  And if anyone knows if\nADV is planing on realeaseing the rest of Kurogane.  \nThanks a bunch to all. ^______________^\n\n-Bunneh\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n Start your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
