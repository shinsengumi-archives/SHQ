Or you can go through and simplify t=\r\nhe \ntext currently online\n\ncurrently the page is a bunch of notes, please s=\r\nkim it to get an idea \nof what we have already and see if you can make it e=\r\nasier to understand\nanyone who wants to volunteer can email me at secretary=\r\ntocapt3(a)\nhotmail.com and I&#39;ll give you the html files to work on\n\nI used =\r\nother sources to get an idea of what the Eagle/Kaiten/Kuaiten \nhad planned =\r\nfor the Stonewall---Hijikata was on this ship as an \nobserver\n\nI also wante=\r\nd to note that when you get as many sources as possible \nand place them sid=\r\ne by side you do find considerable differences \n(this is why I said book A =\r\nmay say something different from book B and \nwhy it is necessary to put eve=\r\nrything together for comparative \npurposes)\n\n&quot;The Banryu and Takao would dr=\r\naw up alongside the anchored Stonewall \nJackson.  Their troops would storm =\r\nthe ironclad with their swords \ndrawn and before the enemy troops had a cha=\r\nnce to defend themselves, \ncapture the ship and crew...That *grand *plan *f=\r\nailed *miserably was \non account of rough seas and mechanical failures--cru=\r\nel fate so \ninseperably intertwinved with that relentless Sun Goddess.&quot;  \n(=\r\nHILLSBOROUGH~ Shinsengumi 172) whenever possible he mentions the sun \ngodde=\r\nss (^_^)\n\nvs\n\n&quot;THE SHINSENGUMI APPEAR ON THE EAGLE&quot; see to get varied accou=\r\nnts and \nwhy details were varied http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Hakodate.htm\n=\r\n\nwhere the tone in other accounts were surprised how the \nKaiten/Eagle/Kuai=\r\nten was close to pulling off a major victory ~ \nbrilliantly with the use of=\r\n the American flag---other narratives also \nmentioned that Nomura (of the S=\r\nhinsengumi) was not shot---but killed \nwith a pike onboard\n\nThe Stonewall *=\r\nwas taken completely by surprise by the Eagle, and from \nthe accounts on th=\r\ne page you will note how the Stonewall was pretty \nineffective overall in d=\r\nefending herself in the well timed ambush\n\nHillsborough also mentioned the =\r\nissue of neutrality in regards to the \nStonewall---however he fell short of=\r\n stating the truth of the matter:\n\nThe Imperialists STOLE it from the Shogu=\r\nnate---the ship was paid with \nShogunate money after all...
