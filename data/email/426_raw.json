Whatever you have to \n  do to see it, just do it!\n\n  Wonderful, gritty look at the internal world of the Shinsengumi from \n  just after the Ikedaya Affair to just past the death of Yamanami.  \n  Fundoshi theft, homoerotic playfulness, guy talk about women & \n  Shimabara (including Kondou&#39;s 4 babes), a sweet love story, patrol \n  changes, after-hours in the barracks, execution of law breakers, a \n  samurai bacchanal, the clash of strong personalities, testing new \n  recruits, man&#39;s inhumanity to man, history, regrets, blood & gore, \n  Saitou --- it&#39;s got a little of everything.  The ending is just too \n  amazing to even consider hinting at.\n\n  The flashback of Serizawa&#39;s assassination is pure poetry and exactly \n  as I read about it.  I swear, the words came right to life before my \n  eyes.\n\n  Every Shinsengumi fan should have a copy of it!!!\n\n  One thing did hit me over the head like a brick, though --- when the \n  captains are announcing themselves in one scene, when it comes to the \n  captain of the 9th squad, the man is Abe Juro, not Suzuki.  Anyone \n  know why this would be?  I thought Abe Juro was a corporal (source: \n  Serizawa Kamo&#39;s Biography --- see links on the shinsengumimb main \n  page).\n\n  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122390/\n\n\n\n\n  visit \n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n  our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
