Actually, the\n&gt; name of the manga is &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot; (&quot;tsuki akiraka\n&gt; ni hoshi mare naki&quot;), and the subtitle is &quot;sayonara\n&gt; Shinsengumi&quot;. Currently being published in Young\n&gt; Sunday.\n\n\nThat&#39;s Kamo-san all over.\nKamo-san already knew this Manga.^^  sasugada.... \n\nDid Kamo-san read this Manga, after coming to Japan? \nAfter coming to Japan, did you read some books of Shinsengumi? \n\nKamo-san no kotodakara iroiro yondeisou....\n&quot;PAPUWA&quot; toka &quot;Gintama&quot; toka made shitteitara watashi wa\nkanari odoroki masu.^^\n\n\n\n&gt; (seen also in Bakumatsu Fuunroku Makoto),\n\nOh, did you also read this? \nIs this Manga which Koudansya published? \nIn fact, I am not reading this Manga.\nIs this interesting? \n\n\n\nI think that &quot;Getsumeiseiki&quot; has set up Kondou&#39;s character very \nwell. \nOther Shinsengumi works value Hijikata and Okita and recognize \nKondou&#39;s existence small in many cases. \nEspecially Manga has many the tendencies. \nIf Kondou&#39;s charisma character cannot be expressed, it becomes \nimpossible to explain Hijikata&#39;s action.\nI think that this will be an important setup if Hijikata is made \ninto the main character. \nAnd I think that almost all Shinsengumi Manga has gone wrong in this \npoint. \n\nThere is assassination of Serizawa in the 5th volume. \nI have not seen Serizawa sadder than this Manga. \n \nThe episode of Ikedaya started with the magazine (Young Sunday). \nMasuya was arrested by Shinsengumi this week. \n\n\n\n\nBy the way, although it got cold in Tokyo suddenly, how is Aizu? \nIt is better to take care about condition, since it will get cold \nstill from now on. \n\n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n\n"
