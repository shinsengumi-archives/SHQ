Essentially someone saw a red headress in the Boshin \nWar pai=\r\nnting (it&#39;s an exact copy of a famous ukiyo-e) and they thought it \nwas the=\r\n manga/anime character.  It&#39;s an honest mistake (^_^) still \nperhaps floati=\r\nng on a fan messageboard.\n\nI still encourage people who have exhausted the =\r\nlive-action Shinsengumi \nfilms to rent this film---now available widely in =\r\nvid stores across the USA.\n\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\nPosted on (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/mess=\r\nage/1941)\nDecember 2004 by secretarytocapt3\n\n&gt; ***MILLENIUM ACTRESS*** (con=\r\ntains Shinsengumi cameo AND the \n2nd disk of the dvd\n&gt; shows a Shinsengumi =\r\ncosplayer they used as a model AND starring RK \n&gt; Saitou&#39;s voice actor Hiro=\r\naki Suzuoki AND animates Boshin War art).\n&gt; \n&gt; ***MILLENIUM ACTRESS*** basi=\r\ncally takes you on a tour of Japanese \n&gt; history via film...and plenty of i=\r\nnside jokes for people who love \n&gt; chambara....film made me cry...\n\nRecentl=\r\ny I had to thank someone for finding me a rare work of music so I \nhad to e=\r\nxtract the entire OST of M.A. as a trade---and I wanted to share it \nhere a=\r\ns well.\n\nBasic info:\nImdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291350/\nTrailer: ht=\r\ntp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DvpGrD5wUzKE\nMuch better trailer from Japan: =\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?\nv=3D0uRjP_LqJcY\n\nMillenium Actress is a film =\r\n.. about films, namely the golden era of \nJapanese cinema paralleled with t=\r\nhe history of Japan from ancient to \nmodern times (including wars).  The ar=\r\nt and writing of this work is top \nnotch.  If you watch the film and keep i=\r\nn mind that Chiyoko the main \ncharacter -is- Japan you get a very good inte=\r\nrpretation because her \nmaturity during various periods in history is very =\r\nfascinating.\n\nAlmost all tracks are instrumental with a bit of vocals.  How=\r\never the last \nsong is entirely in Japanese and you can preview it here:  \n=\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D5E5PmsPwf0E\n\nthe rest of the OST has a ver=\r\ny interesting spiritual, adventure and \ntechnology mix to it (because the t=\r\nracks are based on the movies the main \ncharacter, an actress, performs in)=\r\n.\n\nEnjoy! \nhttp://www.megaupload.com/?d=3DAW79BRS4\n(buy) http://tinyurl.com=\r\n/5u4y5j  (don&#39;t buy the fake CDs on Ebay get it \nfrom Japan---the CD comes =\r\nwith a music vid)\n\ndo not attempt to download this OST from torrent/anime s=\r\nites as their \ntracks are incomplete or damaged \n\n\n"
