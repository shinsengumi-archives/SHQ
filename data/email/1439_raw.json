We will be doing a \nbrief chat session on the message board around 9:00pm EST to try to \nnail this down. Feel free to join in the discussion.\n\nAlso, I need anyone interested to e-mail me, Barb, or phil and tell \nus the character you want to be. You MUST contact one of us because \nthe membership into the RPG is restricted to invitation only in order \nto prevent passers-by from making pointless entries.  Hurry, because \nthe main men will go fast. We also need people to play the Ishin \nmembers.\n\nSo far taken characters are: Hijikata, Ito, Miki(Suzuki), Saito, and \nKondo. Right now the rest of the Shinsengumi are fair game, so chose \nquickly!\n\nMake sure you confirm the character is still open before you register \nwith LiveJournal, since you&#39;ll want to do so under the character&#39;s \nname. Once you&#39;re registered with the community, please refrain from \nmaking posts until the game is officially underway. We will also have \na seperate mailing list for OOC discussions and questions on the RPG. \n\nThanks,\n\n-MissBehavin/Hijikata \n\n\n"
