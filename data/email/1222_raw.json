And \n&gt; on top of that, why was Emperor Meiji even _in_ the picture?\n\nYes.\nTo be sure, if their position is considered, it will be a strange \ntalk that Katsu Kaisyu and Takasugi Shinsaku are together. \nHowever, katsu was the teacher of Sakamoto Ryoma and Saigo Takamori \nwas an acquaintance. \nTakasugi were also Sakamoto and an acquaintance. \nWhen it was their mediation, possibly two persons might meet. \n(Therefore, those who are deceived and buy this photograph appear.) \n\nIt is that Takasugi Shinsaku died in April, 1867.\nWhen this photograph was a thing in 1865, he was still alive.\n\nKatsu negotiated for the armistice of Chosyu and the Tokugawa \ngovernment in 1867. \n \n\nAnd it is strange that Emperor Meiji is in this photograph as you \nsay. \nIf the status distinctions at the time are considered, this will be \nan impossible talk absolutely. \nFurthermore, although this was a digression, Emperor Meiji abhorred \nthe photograph. \nHis vassals were troubled whenever the Emperor&#39;s photograph was \nneeded on friendliness with a foreign country, after becoming Meiji \nEra. \nIncidentally, Saigo also disliked the photograph. \nNow, there is no photograph decided as a photograph of Saigo. \n\nA certain historian announced to the magazine this photograph as a \nphotograph of Ishin shishi in 1895. \nAlthough judged as the photograph which is completely different as a \nresult of investigation, in addition to this, there was such an \nexample. \nNow, the photograph which we know as a photograph of Hijikata \nToshizou was believed to be the samurai Hijikata Hisamoto of a Tosa \ndomain by people of Meiji Era. \nIt was published as a photograph of Hijikata Hisamoto by the person \ndictionary of the time. \nAnd it was sold as a photograph of Hisamoto. \n(This will not be based on malice and is a simple mistake.) \nHisamoto played an active part in the alliance of Satsuma and \nChosyu. \nHe became a minister after becoming Meiji Era. \nAnd he is one of the vassals who worried about Emperor Meiji&#39;s \nphotograph dislike.\n\nHijikata Hisamoto\n\nhttp://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/quwatoro/bakumatu2/hisamoto.html\n\n(He is a nice old man.....However, he does not seem to resemble \nToshizou.) \n\n\n&gt; --M.\n&gt; (whose favorite song is _still_ &quot;Ee ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka...&quot;)\n\nI sing for you. \n\n\nEe ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka.\n\nChosyu san onobori ee ja nai ka.\n(It is good that Chosyu comes to Kyoto.)\n\nEe ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka, ee ja nai ka.\n\nSatsu to Chou tode ee ja nai ka.\n(It is good that Satsu (Satsuma) and Chou (Chousyu) cooperate \ntogether.) \n\n-Onomichi version-\n\nIt is the popular song of Bakumatsu. And it is a propaganda song.\n\nmomoiro-usagi \n\n\n\n"
