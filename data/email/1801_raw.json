To be honest, at f=\r\nirst the historical inaccuracies ticked me off quite a bit, but then I reco=\r\nnsidered, since  it&#39;s not a documental, but a TV series, meant to entertain=\r\n, in the same vein as many American productions for TV as well as Hollywood=\r\n movies. So after accepting this basic fact, I sat comfortably to enjoy Shi=\r\nnsengumi! for what it was worth. \n \nBut your advice is certainly very accur=\r\nate, and appreciated. Thanks for your concern.\n \nFiruze\n \n \n_______________=\r\n__________________________________________________\n  IncrediMail - El Email=\r\n ha evolucionado finalmente - Haga clic aqu=ED\n\t\t\t\n------------------------=\r\n---------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Check out the new Yahoo!
