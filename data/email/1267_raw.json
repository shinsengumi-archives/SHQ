Those gifted with the Japanese language may want to\ncompare and contrast with your own translations.   \n\n[No] this is not nifty or babelfish...it is actually a human\ntranslation.  A couple of months ago I mentioned this site to an\nacquaintance...she happened to have read RK many years ago...and she\nsent me an email with an attachment of all of her work\n@_@  please send her good karmic thoughts...cuz I don&#39;t even know how\nto repay her -_-  I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;ll meet her again in person!\n\n*Note: The Yaso section is a repeat of what SK translated for us\nalready...I didn&#39;t know she was translating this part\n\n*She spells things differently Seenan War and Fujita Goroo\n\n*hey, guys remember I said that Tokio was an &quot;outgoing&quot; woman...there\nis alot to support this in the translation...in my personal fanfic I\nhave Tokio doing a minor correction on something Fujita Goro had\nwritten...well Tokio was a writing teacher to a woman ranked as\n&quot;princess&quot; at Aizu\n\n*Things which Saitou &quot;said&quot; are also pretty clear in this translation\n\n*I especially liked the Seinan War article...one of Saigo&#39;s guys...&quot;oh\nno the Shinsengumi are coming for us...&quot; (I&#39;m sure he said that in\nreal life)\n\n*I used to mention in an email to my sister that hist. Saitou was\nharder to kill than a cockroach...you couldn&#39;t kill him even if you\nput him in front of a cannon...no really...LOL! \nwhich makes me think back to the manga of Yahiko going against that\ndude with a cannon on his arm near the police station \n\n*A WORD Document version of this file is at\nhttp://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3 \npassword makoto\nfilename:3-hajime.com translation \n\n\n\n\n"
