Some possible scenarios:\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1) he didn&#39;t join the police force until after the Seinan (wasn&#39;t it\ndiscussed here that many of Saigou&#39;s Satsuma samurai joined after the\nSeinan?) and fought with Satsuma forces against the Meiji;\n\n(I think it became REALLY popular to join the police dept. after\nSeinan...as mentioned in &quot;Remembering Aizu&quot; because everyone needed jobs)\n\n&gt; 2) he had as much reason for vengeance as Saitou, only his reasons\nwere directed at Saigou (who, until someone comes forth with evidence\nagainst it, I maintain played a part in the destruction of Sagara and\nthe Sekihoutai), and therefore he fought as part of the Meiji forces\nagainst Satsuma;\n\nIn the bigger picture...the Seihoutai uprising was sooo brief...I\nimagine him changing his name a few times and signing up as a minor\nofficer and no one would be suspicious...*in S.H.&#39;s case he was\nalready a police officer and the police were a branch of the military\nso technically speaking he had to go\n\n*if Suzuki was already part of the police dept. then he would be in\nthe same situation as S.H.---if not then he would have to volunteer\nand I&#39;m sure the gov. was happy to have volunteers (what needs to be\nchecked out is if some kind of draft was implemented)\n\n&gt; 3) he&#39;d left old animosities behind him (as Saitou *might* have done\nas well) and gave his support to the Meiji government for the security\nof Japan;\n\nNote: since I believe that actions speak louder than words...and\nSuzuki did donate money to build hospitals he was the kind of the\nperson who seemed to be in tune with the suffering around him.  After\nall these wars I imagine there were plenty of injured/maimed people so\nhe saw the need for hospitals...he and I believe Saitou may not have\nseen themselves as being &quot;Meiji dogs&quot; (as Shishio would put it) but\npublic servants.  \n\nI wonder why S.H./Suzuki didn&#39;t join the military. Perhaps you got\npaid more being a policeman/inspector?  Or because of their experience\nin the Shinsengumi they felt their skills were more effective when\nconcentrated in a local area (like modern police they were assigned to\ndistricts/wards) while the military is on a national scale.\n\n&gt; 4) he stayed out of it completely for personal and/or philosophical\nreasons (I don&#39;t think anything is mentioned of his being involved in\nthe Seinan on the one site we have).\n\nThe babelfish didn&#39;t say anything about Seinan (or garbled military\nconflict to suggest the Seinan/Satsuma rebellion)...very often the\nfish says &quot;taking to the field&quot; in regards to participating in a battle.\n\nAny information that might point us to the truth?\n&gt;  \nNOne of the Shinsengumi sites which strive to be comprehensive mention\nhim...the site I found was the only one...the best bet is root arond\nthe big sites and read their message boards\n\n\n"
