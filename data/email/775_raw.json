However, I \n&gt; doubt it was the same Saigou.\n\n\nMe too. My guess is that it was the family of Saigou\nTanomo. Those who are acquainted with the history of\nAikido and Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu will certainly\nrecognize that name. And those who know the history of\nJudo will probably know about his son, Saigou Shirou,\nthe person who created the technique &quot;Yama-arashi&quot;,\nand was the basis for that Kurosawa&#39;s movie, &quot;Sugata\nSanshiro&quot;.\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"
