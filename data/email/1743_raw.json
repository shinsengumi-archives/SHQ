After about 4 eps I was actually thinking about not watching the rest of the series till a friend told me it actually gets better. (I also had this same opinion with MADLAX, but that and PMK both turned out great) He was right as things started picking up about ep 8 or so. Most of this probably had to do with being used to watching other Shinsengumi related shows which were a bit more fast paced. \n\n\n~Okita\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: bsher213 \n  To: SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, October 18, 2004 9:12 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ] online PMK review\n\n\n\n  you guys may want to check this out and comment.
