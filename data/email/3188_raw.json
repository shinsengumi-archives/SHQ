Samurai archives is trying to accomplish alot and whenever =\r\n\npossible we must lend our support.\n\nI can reply however I don&#39;t always hav=\r\ne my books etc right in front \nof me and lately getting SHQ website up to s=\r\npeed is my number 1 \npriority right now.  \n\nSo if someone can give atleast =\r\na general answer to Kitsuno please \nhelp him out---if we don&#39;t reply right =\r\naway it&#39;s not because we do \nnot care or are ignoring someone...we have hun=\r\ndreds of members who \ncan assist and it is likely that many people are real=\r\nly busy w/ \nschool and jobs.\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samur=\r\nai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are the first round questions that are be=\r\ning discussed, I&#39;ll \n&gt; post them here to facilitate some discussion, and la=\r\nter distill \ndown \n&gt; the answers that are gathering in the discussion:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 1. What was Kiyokawa Hachiro&#39;s ulterior motive for leading the \n&gt; Roshigum=\r\ni and going to Kyoto? \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Why did some of the Roshigumi head back to E=\r\ndo while others \n&gt; stayed in Mibu? \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Why was Serizawa Kamo selected =\r\nas a leader? \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Why was Serizawa Kamo assasinated? \n&gt; \n&gt; 5. What purp=\r\nose did the Shinsengumi serve? \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Why did Kondo Isami end up leading =\r\nthe Shinsengumi? \n&gt; \n&gt; 7. What happened at the Ikedaya incident? \n&gt; \n&gt; 8. W=\r\nhy is the incident at the Ikedaya so notable? \n&gt; \n&gt; 9. Why was Yagi Gennojo=\r\n&#39;s residence made part of the Mibu Roshigumi \n&gt; headquarters? \n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Wha=\r\nt would cause a ronin to join the Shinsengumi rather than \nany \n&gt; of the ot=\r\nher factions? What type of person would join the \n&gt; Shinsengumi?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
