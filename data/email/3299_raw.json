Why bakufu allowed a peasant to become their\n&gt; troop ? (Roshigumi case)\n&gt; \n&gt; The shogunate needed manpower, and anyone who could\n&gt; hold a sword counted.\n&gt; Think about it: Serizawa was in *jail* and he was\n&gt; allowed to join.\n\n\nI think we should not forget the political maneuvers\nof Kiyokawa Hachiro in order to get amnesty to all\nthose people (including himself).\n\n\n&gt; 3. Yamanami Keisuke no jutsuryuu wa Hokushin\n&gt; Ittouryuu or Tennen Rishin Ryuu\n&gt; ?\n&gt; ( cause both is exist in different book )\n&gt; \n&gt; Yamanami Keisuke-san no ryuuha wa Hokushin Ittouryuu\n&gt; darou? (Isn&#39;t\n&gt; Yamanami&#39;s sword tradition Hokushin-ittoryu?)\n\n\nI read somewhere (can&#39;t recall exactly where) that he\njoined Tennen Rishin after losing to Kondo Isami and\neventually he became even a shihandai.\n\nBut Yamanami&#39;s original style was Hokushin Itto. If we\nsuppose that Yamanami and Todo have indeed convinced\nIto Kashitaro to join the troop, then the Hokushin\nItto link must have played a crucial role in it.\n\n\n&gt; Rei also asks if it could be true that he trained in\n&gt; 2 styles. My answer is\n&gt; this-- cross-training was common in those days among\n&gt; serious martial\n&gt; artists. \n\n\nLet&#39;s remember also that we have two kinds of\ncross-training: one involving practicing more than one\nstyle, and other involving matches against other\nstyles.\n\nThe latter was much more frequent. Although the styles\ndid have some &quot;diplomatic connections&quot;, so to speak,\nit wasn&#39;t that polite to practice more than one style\nat a time, unless you had authorization for that\nand/or had achieved mastery in one style before\nlearning another.\n\nAlso, kenjutsu dojos were more than simply a place for\nmartial arts practice. They were a kind of political\nparty, so to speak, and some were very influential.\nTherefore, the students who achieved a high status in\na dojo had to have not only a good proficiency with\nswords, but also a fine education.\n\n\n&gt; Finally, Rei asks about the feelings/belief of\n&gt; Shinsengumi toward martial\n&gt; training. As we all know, Shinsengumi was a group of\n&gt; people who were trained\n&gt; and hired for the sake of doing &quot;dirty work.&quot;\n\n\nNot to mention that the core members of the\nShinsengumi were originally martial arts\npractitioners. Even Ito Kashitaro, who tends to be\nmore known for his erudition, was the headmaster of\nthe Hokushin Itto-ryu, a style created by his adoptive\nfather, Ito Seiichi, and derived from Hokushin\nItto-ryu. Yeah, the pronunciation is the same, but the\nkanji (ideograms) are different.\n\nThey were recruited by Aizu because of their purposes\nand more importantly, of their martial arts skills.\nHence lots of emphasis were given in the training. Not\nto mention stuff like &quot;shiniban&quot; and all.\n\nTalking about Aizu, found recently a magazine, owned\nby my grandfather, issued in 1928 by Aizu-kai, an\norganization of Aizu-related people, having as members\npeople like Yamakawa Kenjiro. Although there is no\nmention to Shinsengumi, there are some tidbits of\ninformation about Boshin War and the Aizu fief, from\nthe Aizu point of view. It&#39;s also interesting to read\na bit about Saigo Tanomo and the rendition of Aizu.\nNot to mention some rare pictures taken at the time.\n\nOh, by the way, yes, there MAY be a connection with\nShinsengumi. One of the associates of Aizu-kai is a\ncertain Fujita Tsutomu, which sounds suspiciously like\nFujita Goro(Saito Hajime)&#39;s son. If one finds out that\nSaito Hajime&#39;s son was in the Army (Lt. Colonel, if\nI&#39;m not mistaken) in 1928, then chances are that this\nFujita Tsutomu is indeed Saito&#39;s son.\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLuggage?
