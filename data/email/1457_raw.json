I was like the only person who stubbornly insisted\n&gt; that he was adopted INTO the family---I apologize for the \nconfusion -_-\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.1to5.net/saito/family/family.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been thinking about Tokio and the anguish she must have felt\n&gt; her whole life about adopting out her last child.  The website\n&gt; mentions Tokio&#39;s letter to Tatsuo one month before Fujita Goro \ndied. \n&gt; We can only wonder about the words a mother would write to a son she\n&gt; had to give away.\n&gt; \n\nWell we can speculate... However a few days ago I was IM&#39;ng with Phil \nand she turned me into the reason that they gave their last son away \nor had their last son because that Aizu retainer needed to continue \ntheir family name. Although I did not really agree with her because I \nfound the reason a bit unacceptable in my point of view, being an \nadopted person myself.\n\nWhich leads me to wonder how exactly did Tatsuo react after \naccidentally learning of that fact. I seem to remember this was \ndiscussed several months ago, he was pretty angry at the situation. \nSo maybe Tokio wrote him a letter to apologize? Did she realize that \nher child&#39;s life wasn&#39;t theirs to do as they wish? I know a number \nwon&#39;t agree with me since as Phil pointed out, I&#39;m applying 20th \ncentury values to the Meiji... But even if we don&#39;t speak about \nvalues, let&#39;s just go through a normal person&#39;s psyche, Tatsuo&#39;s \nreaction is not surprising as basically he would see himself not \ntreated the same way as his siblings, he was given away... \n\nWell I better stop here...\n\n~wounds\n\n\n"
