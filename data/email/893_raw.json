For example, if you like sweets - obviously Okita, or if you like to smoke - Hijikata, stuff like that... and make it really funny.  and this is according to PMK, cuz I don&#39;t think RK provided that much info on the other captains except for Saitoh and Okita.\n~SaitohWorship\n \nwarg3791 &lt;Warg3791@...&gt; wrote:\nAs Barb has already mentioned, I&#39;ve made two quizzes for the \nShinsengumihq.com site. These first two are meant more or less as \ntest quizzes while I learn exactly how everything works. Now that \nI&#39;ve gotten the hang of it, I&#39;m looking for suggestions! I&#39;ve already \ndiscussed a quiz with Barb that will be centered around testing a \nperson&#39;s knowledge of the Shinsengumi, especially the odder facts \nwe&#39;ve come across. Considering the way things are set up, it will \nprobably work best as a true or false type quiz. Also, I want to do \nimproved versions of the test quizzes and a movie/anime type quiz \nabout the shows the Shinsengumi have appeared in, and a specifically \nPMK quiz. I&#39;m looking for suggestions on questions and answers for \nall of these.\n\nI&#39;m also willing to do a Sekihoutai quiz if our resident Sagara fan \nwill be willing to lend a hand with planning it out. Does anyone have \nany suggestions other than what&#39;s already been listed? And NO, taking \na hike, a long walk off a short pier, and playing in traffice DO NOT \nCOUNT!!!\n\nSeriously, I want everyone to have a say in these. I feel a group \neffort can only improve the quality of what eventually gets posted on \nthe site. If possible, we can discuss this the next time we schedule \na chat. So go over to Shinsengumihq.com, take the two tests already \non site, and think over what you&#39;d like to see on them. Thanks ahead \nof time! Looking forward to hearing what everyone has to say!\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n\nvisit \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\nour companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\nYahoo!
