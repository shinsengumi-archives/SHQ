It gives diffrent artist opptions on what they think looks good (although the blue haoi seems to be the most popular).\n \nIt&#39;s difficult to know what the true color was.   That suggestion of them changing the haoi as time went on seems to be the most logical.   When they first became the Roshigumi in Mibu, it was said that the only thing that kept them from becoming beggers were their swords (from the Serizawa page).   Serizawa got some protection money to get the first haois made.   As a new group, it&#39;s understandable that they didn&#39;t have the full financial backup to get themselves a uniform.   From that, it seems like money was a factor in getting the uniform.\n \nAfter the Ikedaya raid they pretty much became idols overnight and where recognized throughout the city.   At this point, they were probably making enought to get the uniform that they had first wanted.\n \nMmm... well, thats what I think anyways... Momo-san&#39;s explaination of the colors being changed with the season is also worth taking into account.   People back then used to wear cretain colors with in certain seasons (as best seen with geishas).\n \n-Bunneh\n^___________________________^;;\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
