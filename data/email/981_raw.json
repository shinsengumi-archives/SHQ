Buck\nMonumenta Nipponica, Vol 28 no. 4 (Winter 1973) 427-446\n\n[my summary]...will appear in my Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept. \nwrite up too...I&#39;m just so happy that hours of research turned up \nsomething new for me atleast...\n\nThe Imperial government attempted a secret ammunitions seizure from \nKagoshima (officially under government but prior to the Restoration \nproperty of Satsuma clan)...the government was unsuccessful as 1,000 \nSatsuma men drove off the gov&#39;s naval force.\nSaigo T. was unaware of this situation.  When Saigo T. returned to \nKagoshima, Nakahara Hisao was charged with plotting to assasinate \nSaigo T.  Furthermore, Nakahara H. confessed to meeting with Kawaji \nToshiyoshi, Chief Inspector of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept \n(and native of Satsuma).  We don&#39;t know if Nakahara&#39;s words are to \nbe trusted however at least 50 members of the Tokyo Police Dept who \nwere natives of Satsuma returned to Kagoshima in 1876-1877 at the \nsame time a high-ranking Tokyo official was sent to &quot;adjust Tokyo&#39;s \nrelations with Satsuma leadership.&quot; &quot;Some even advocated immediate \nexecution of the &#39;traitors&#39; from the Tokyo Police Department.&quot;(page \n430)\n\nThus, it is quiet obvious that Kawaji had been monitoring his own \nSatsuma domain for some time and used Satsuma policemen as spies.\nThe article also give some more info on how Satsuma remained \nrebellious against various policies,from the government they put in \npower, imposed.\n\n\n\n"
