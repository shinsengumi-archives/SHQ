The actions and writings of BS smack of the old-\nstyle Soviet cus=\r\ntom of &#39;disinformation&#39;, which means that if you keep \non repeating untruth=\r\ns long enough, people start believing them.\n\nBy surpressing objective analy=\r\nsis of his work BS is putting \ndisinformation into play and what he wrote w=\r\nill eventually become \nthe &#39;truth&#39; for many who read his work without the b=\r\nenefit of a \nscholarly analysis of it. \n\nOne of my regrets is that I even b=\r\nought that book in the first place, \ngiven the turn of events. But when I p=\r\nurchased it, I was less \ninformed about the subject matter than I am now. B=\r\nut people learn. I \ncertainly will not buy anything else that BS has writte=\r\nn in the past \nor will write in the future.\n\nAs you mentioned, he should be=\r\n thanking the researcher. (He should be \npaying the researcher for correcti=\r\nng his errors!) BS could have used \nthe critique as an opportunity to write=\r\n a &#39;revised&#39; edition the next \ntime the book was printed. This may have inc=\r\nreased his sales, because \nperhaps people would buy a second copy of the bo=\r\nok just to get the \ncorrected information. BS isn&#39;t as smart as he thinks. =\r\nHe just passed \nup a money making opportunity!\n\nIf the mods think that my c=\r\nomments may get the message board into \ntrouble, please feel free to delete=\r\n this post.\n\n\n"
