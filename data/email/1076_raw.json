He&#39;s my kind of guy-- legitimately snooping \naround museums.\n\n&gt;e) or how about the guy who converted to Christianity...church church\n&gt;and Sunday school (he probably won&#39;t get any votes)\n\nHis name was Shinohara Tainoshin, and for some reason, he also has a \nconnection to Tokugawa Yoshinobu, I think...but I&#39;m not sure.\n\n&gt;In the series Hatchobori 7...the officers use a neat little weapon\n&gt;which is shaped like a &quot;U&quot; but with one leg of the &quot;U&quot; much longer\n&gt;than the other...it basically looks like a weird fish hook with a red\n&gt;tassle.  I&#39;ve seen much bigger versions as a Chinese weapon...the\n&gt;officers use it to catch/hook swords and slash at criminals so I&#39;m\n&gt;assuming it was designed to be non-lethal as Aoyama keeps saying to\n&gt;catch criminals alive...the officers carry it in their waistband like\n&gt;a sword.  It is a pretty small weapon too as the officers have to get\n&gt;very very close to their opponents.\n\nA jutte. Interestingly, Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s father, Shinmen Munisai, was a \nmaster of the jutte.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
