Yeah I \nknow what you mean about getting your hands on all those things, I \ntried them before. The only problem I saw was that sometimes I look \nat the merchandise and some of them look really &quot;fake&quot;. It&#39;s so hard \nto muddle through whats legit and what&#39;s not...\n\nHmmm.... The owner of the site must be flooded by e-mails that is \nprobably why she (or he) choose not to respond that way. She probably \ndiscourages that or maybe her e-mail is full. Who knows?\n\nThanks for letting them know we exist... :O)\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tiffany=Maggie=secretarytocapt3=badgerturtle\n&gt; \n&gt; yes I was on saitou-hajime.com before it went bye bye\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m Thai born in U.S. if I was in Thailand I could so get my hands \n&gt; on all this manga/anime stuff the problem is the titles are all \n&gt; weird and you would have to carry a pic or something of the anime \nso \n&gt; they know what you want.  When I bought the entire set of the \n&gt; official RK release I had to draw a cross shape on my cheek and \nthey \n&gt; were like &quot;oh you mean Wandering Samurai&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; At least the gals on 3-hajime.com are &quot;happy&quot; I think...\n&gt; \n&gt; I did try to email the webmaster directly however she (from the \ntone \n&gt; of the writing very empathetic to historical S.H.) I think it&#39;s \n&gt; a &quot;she&quot;...never replies and chose to reply on the msg board \n&gt; as &quot;hajime&quot;...the email is hajime@3...\n\n\n"
