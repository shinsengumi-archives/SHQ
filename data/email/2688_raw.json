I equated it to someone \nreading a book excerpt on my web site then finding a way to access the \nunpublished things I occasionally store and claiming it as their own.\n\nAgain, I apologize to Kizu and I hope she&#39;ll stay with us. And I ask \neveryone to drop the subject once they see this and not to respond to \nany  posts that get through on the topic in the meantime.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n"
