The RK Saitou shrine is the grand experiment.  To put it mildly, it&#39;s been a bitch.  My resource books tell me to do one thing, I do it, and something completely different happens, so I&#39;m left staring at html code trying to find the discrepancy.  I&#39;ve about decided that a story about Saitou in an American high school would make delicious reading right about now.  :-D\n \nAnyway, the front page is back up with active links to two pages --- I Don&#39;t Know Where You Got Your Sense of Humor and the registry (the home button on those two pages simply opens the front page in the content window... something else I&#39;ve got to figure out --- how to get it to open it in a full screen again... I have some ideas after all I just went through to figure out the following --&gt;).  I&#39;ve just spent the last 3 hours trying to figure out WHY oh WHY it was opening up a new window when I clicked on the link in the navigation bar I created when I followed instructions implicitly... it would&#39;ve helped if they had told me which of the three html documents I needed to edit in the first place... gads, how much do I have to figure out for myself?  There&#39;s one more thing I need to do to the buttons on the navigation bar --- a text box giving the title of the page linked --- but that can wait until later.\n \nThe favor I need is for people to access the site and see if it works for them, then get in touch with me and let me know &quot;yes, it worked&quot; or &quot;no, it wouldn&#39;t even load/loaded but doesn&#39;t work&quot;.  In both cases, could you tell me what browser you have?  If Netscape causes major problems, then I&#39;m probably going to have to create a non-frames site as well.  You can contact me via the registry (there&#39;s a private option if you prefer), responding to this message, or writing to me at spiritus_saitou@... .\n \nMany, MANY thanks in advance.  The site is at http://www.geocities.com/philalexandrostoo .\n \nphil (who complains a lot, but is really having a lot of fun)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
