It got me thinking abou the Sekiguti/Sekiguchi\njiujitsu S.H. believed to have practiced.  On one of the posts at\n3-hajime.com\n\nfish says...\n&quot;Saito one Sekiguti style [jiujitsu lineage/style] softly had\ncompleted technique, because the history charge supporting is not\nclear, assertion is not possible, but because it is the information\nwhere the Akama Cipango [Akama Shizuko] child person is procured from\nthe Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, as for the possibility it is\nhigh with you think. Because Tadasi Matsubara softly seems that is\nsoftly the master of technique of the extent which serves the\ntechnique teacher head afterwards, being taken after, is not strange,\ndon&#39;t you think?&quot;\n\nso the info is from the TMPD.  The Sekiguti style was mentioned on the\nS.H.&#39;s chart http://g1342122.at.infoseek.co.jp/ \nAnd I think the guy in the NHK drama was Tadasi Matsubara--master of\nhis style(?)  his name pops up in other threads regarding the drama. \nIndeed the guys in the Shinsengumi were skilled as is ...and due to\nthe varied demographics of the group they continued to broaden their\nmartial knowledge obviously. I just found it pretty neat how Akama S.\nwas able to find this shred of info. \n\n\n\n\n"
