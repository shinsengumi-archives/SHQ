I received and watched Chusingura \n1/47 yesterday about the 47 ronin and in the beginning one of the guys \nwho becomes one of Asano&#39;s retainers and later one of the 47 takes on a \nbunch of guys trying to beat a really old samurai. He takes them all out \nand the Edo &quot;tabloids&quot; (one sheet flyers complete with gory artwork) \nhave it that he killed 18 men as opposed to the actual 3. He&#39;s a star \nand all sorts of people want him to marry their daughters or let them \nadopt him into the family etc. There&#39;s even a scene when he goes tot eh \ndojo he teaches at at there&#39;s this mob of fangirls screaming his name \npeeking inside trying to get his attention. It was hilarious and I \nwondered if Hijikata ever had a brush with that.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
