Instead \nthe webmaster for the site took a picture of what the \nheadstone/grave marker is facing.  However, the headstone is shown \non the internet at various sites.  So it is up to the person.  If I \ncould visit Aizu and all the places I have been reading about  I \nwould just burn incense at their graves (E.g. Byakkotai, all \nShinsengumi related graves and members of the Women&#39;s Brigade).  It \nis a Thai custom to ask permission of the deceased before taking a \npicture of the headstone/grave marker I wonder if this exists in \nJapanese culture.\n\nYes, S.K. is reminding us all how lucky he is......

If you visit Fujita-sama&#39;s grave, will you take pictures \nand post them to the group? \n&gt;  \n&gt; Pretty please with mochi on top?!?!?!?!?!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kalli\n\n\n"
