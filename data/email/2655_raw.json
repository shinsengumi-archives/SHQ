I would love to buy the copy=\r\nright and have this work\nreprinted....\n\nso the crazy people at http://www.h=\r\najimenokizu decided to open up the\nBRS Bakumatsu Renka universe [BRS]...\n\nI=\r\n hope that after visiting the only shrine to the novel in existence\nhttp://=\r\nwww.shinsengumihq.com/DBT.htm\n\nthat DBT&#39;s dark world may inspire someone ou=\r\nt there...what a shame! \nSaitou Hajime did not meet Tsukue Ryunosuke.......=\r\n\n\nI omitted TONS of stuff to focus on the Shinsengumi.\nThe Tsukue Ryunosuke=\r\n as seen in SWORD OF DOOM is but an interpretation\nof an extremely complex =\r\nand very -sane- character however Okamoto\nKihachi&#39;s film adaptation does a =\r\ngreat job...\n\n[If anyone here needs to study a LITERARY CHARACTER then you =\r\ngotta\nstudy Ryunosuke---he&#39;s very INTERESTING]\n\n---this novel is incredibly=\r\n important in the world of modern Japanese\nliterature, it was like the GONE=\r\n WITH THE WIND of its era, the\nnumerous commercial spin offs attest to its =\r\nfame making it like HARRY\nPOTTER in terms of $$$...it&#39;s a classic\n\n---it wa=\r\ns the first time the Shinsengumi entered &quot;formal&quot; popular\nliterature, they =\r\nalready appeared in various media in the Meiji\nera---none of which was take=\r\nn seriously\n\n---this translation marks the first move from East to West for=\r\n the\nShinsengumi\n\n---yes it predates by several decades Shiba Ryotaro&#39;s mas=\r\nterpiece\nMoeyoken---and yeah Shiba Ryotaro [probably] read this work\n\n---it=\r\n hit the presses when Nagakura Shinpachi and SAitou Hajime were\nboth alive =\r\n(it &#39;began&#39; in 1909 the exact date of publication was not\nmentioned)\n\n---it=\r\n features Kondo, Hijikata, Okita, Yamazaki and Inoue Genazaburo\n\n---the nov=\r\nel is in fact very FAST with TONS of action---the fight\nscene descriptions =\r\nare lyrical (Nakazato Kaizan himself practiced the\nthen new art AIKIDO---I =\r\nthink this is all from my memory)\n\n[a scene from the Fujita household]\nSeni=\r\nor Citizen Fujita Goro takes the politics and government section\nof the new=\r\nspaper and reads...\n\nTokio grabs the entertainment section and calls to her=\r\n daughter-in-law\n&quot;pssst Midori, look the dashing Hyoma goes to Kioto, oh de=\r\nar he\nassociates himself with those rough Shinsengumi&quot;\n\nMidori, gasps, &quot;oh =\r\nno he gets dragged to the red-light district!

This Nakazato Kaizan fellow didn&#39;t\neven care to mention the great NAGAKU=\r\nRA&quot;\n\nSugimura proceeds to start his memoirs which will be published in 1913=\r\n\nin the Hotaru Shinbun\n\n\n-------------------------\nLastly, something to pon=\r\nder.\nI would need to double check on this [so please do not take this as\nfa=\r\nct yet]...but Nakazato Kaizan was part of an entire group of young\nwriters =\r\nmentored by Natsume Soseki (there was a list of names).\n\nNatsume&#39;s influenc=\r\ne over his students, who often just stopped by his\nhouse for advice and con=\r\nversation, was great (they even used some of\nhis symbolism in their own wor=\r\nk).  Natsume did read many of his\nstudent&#39;s work, he was after all once a p=\r\nrofessor of English Lit\n(succeeded LAFCADIO HEARN) at Tokyo Univ.\n\nNatsume =\r\nwas at least an acquaintance of Fujita Goro, AND some of the\nFujita family&#39;=\r\ns Aizu friends.  \n\nNatsume DOES use Aizu folks as characters in his novels =\r\nand one\nunnamed friend of his (appears as a recurring character on more tha=\r\nn\none work) and shares his physical illness of gastric ulcers does have\na p=\r\nhysical description matching the 2nd photo of Fujita Goro (released\nlate 20=\r\n04-5). I&#39;m just being...silly now...\n\nNatsume&#39;s father (birth father or ado=\r\npted father not clear) was a\nfriend of Nagakura.\n\nHmmmm maybe...\n\nNakazato =\r\n&quot;Natsume-sensei I&#39;m bored, I want to write about SAMURAI!&quot;\n\nNatsume &quot;have y=\r\nou ever heard of the Shinsengumi?....&quot;\n\nNakazato &quot;I want to also put a hito=\r\nkiri in the story too!&quot;\n\nNatsume &quot;go ahead, I&#39;m sure one day someone will a=\r\nlso write about a\nhitokiri too---but your story will the first to examine t=\r\nhe psyche of\na manslayer&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
