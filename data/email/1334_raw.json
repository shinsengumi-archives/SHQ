Yamazaki &quot;he was an extremely shy boy and whenever guests came \n&gt;to visit he would observe them from various hiding places...but I&#39;m \n&gt;so proud that he learned to write so fast! He just had so much fun \n&gt;taking down notes on all of our visitors. ï¿½If he really likes a \n&gt;guest he may even ask them questions like &#39;where are you \n&gt;from&#39;&#39;what&#39;s your REAL name&#39; and so forth but he tended to get \n&gt;impatient when they didn&#39;t take his questions seriously.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hist.
