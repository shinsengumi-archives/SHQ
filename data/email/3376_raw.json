Awesome photos.  I have a question. \n&gt; Swerizawa&#39;s Qua=\r\nrters, was that where he was killed?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\nIf you look at this image:\nhtt=\r\np://www.flickr.com/photos/25104638@N08/2375667420/in/set-72157604321244361/=\r\n\n\nThe entrance on the left is the entrance to Hirayama and Serizawa&#39;s\nquart=\r\ners. I&#39;ll see if I can explain it - Directly inside is the\ngenkan, with a l=\r\now hanging spear-rack.  Once you get inside the entire\nbuilding is maybe 40=\r\n feet long, all tatami, and then at that time\nthere was a partition where H=\r\nirayama Goro was (the partitions are now\ngone, but the low hanging beams th=\r\nat held them are only about 6.5 feet\nabove the floor.  His &quot;room&quot; was about=\r\n 8 feet long and maybe about\nthat wide, and then another partition, where S=\r\nerizawa was. Serizawa&#39;s\n&quot;room&quot; had direct access to the garden - and by &quot;ga=\r\nrden&quot; I mean a\nreally small area that looks like a typical &quot;Japanese garden=\r\n&quot;. \nSomeone here would know better than I how the attack played out, but I\n=\r\n do remember from the guide that Serizawa stumbled onto the wooden\nwalkway =\r\nbefore the garden, and took a left into the Yagi&#39;s sleeping\nquarters where =\r\nhe was killed.  There is a cut in the top of the\ndoorway there, supposedly =\r\nfrom a sword slash from that night.  No\npictures were allowed inside or in =\r\nthe garden, unfortunately.  But it\nis all a pretty small area. It was prett=\r\ny interesting walking through\nthese rooms that I&#39;d read about.\n\nIf I have t=\r\nime, I&#39;ll add more pictures tomorrow - I still have about\n100 more to go.  =\r\nI got some great pics of Osaka castle and elsewhere.\n\n\n"
