The setting would be changed but \npolitical and internal conflict/story would be the same.  It would \nbe an alternate universe but not &quot;fantasy&quot;.  And the cast would be \nPC, multiethnic and have female captains.  They received screenshots \nof Jin-Roh:The Wolf Brigade and picked up on the idea.  So really, \nthe basic idea of the Shinsengumi, and swords+martial arts was \nappealing.  The financial resources was an issue and a strong \npersonality/host to draw an audience was a major obstacle.  As I \nmentioned ideas are stolen all the time.  Many people have been \nexposed to the Shinsengumi at the same time and not always in a \nformal meeting setting...any one of these people can take the idea \nto another company.\n\nThe company specializes in documentaries and needed ideas to pitch \nto a cable channel.  NOt the History channel but similar.  In fact \nthe idea of something to experiment with such as cutting tests with \nswords was discussed.  They like Action+History under the mask of \neducation so to speak and this is why they were very open to the \nidea in the beginning.\n\n&quot;the Wolves&quot; were part of our list of key words but they warmed up \nto swat team faster.  Whatever works for them.  To these folks &quot;The \nwolves of Mibu&quot; would be too long...\n\n&gt; Recommend Tamilyn Tomita.  Speaks excellent English, is Japanese, \n&gt; and HOT!!!  Kind of famous.\n\nYeah, there are many famous Japanese who can speak English just fine \nthe problem is the person has no &quot;name recognition&quot; with an American \naudience.  This goes back to how there aren&#39;t many Asians in showbiz \nto begin with.  The authoriy figure who submitted a formal proposal \nwould, to us, be a good host but there were certain reasons why the \ncompany did not use this person or contact him back ASAP.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan&quot; &lt;alanw1911@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; That&#39;s unfortunate to hear, but the sad truth.  The guys who fork \n&gt; have the money usually know the least.  Probably explains why \n&gt; everything is a remake or a sequel.  There are a couple problems \n&gt; though.  I don&#39;t think the American public would warm up to the \n&gt; Shinsengumi like the Japanese do.  It&#39;s a part of their society, \nand \n&gt; what they feel are part of who they are.  The American audience, \non \n&gt; the other hand, view samurai only in the romantic/robotic \n&gt; personality.  It&#39;s doubtful the mainstream will accept a &quot;down-and-\n&gt; dirty&quot; fighting unit like the Shinsengumi, portrayed with an eye \nfor \n&gt; accuracy.  At least not pay to see it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) the lack of an Asian host/narrator who is \n&gt; &gt; a) famous b) speaks English\n&gt; \n&gt; Recommend Tamilyn Tomita.  Speaks excellent English, is Japanese, \n&gt; and HOT!!!  Kind of famous.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So Shinsengumi had to be abandoned for Shogun&#39;s Swat Team or \n&gt; just &quot;Swat\n&gt; &gt; TEam&quot; and finally &quot;team&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Did you try &quot;Wolves of Mibu&quot;?  That has a &quot;cool&quot; sound to it.  \nIt&#39;s \n&gt; too bad it fell apart.  Have you considered something along the \n&gt; lines of the History Channel?  Not as mainstream, but they seemed \nto \n&gt; be the type to jump all over something like this.\n\n\n"
