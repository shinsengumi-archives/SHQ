Tonight was one night that had probably one of the most interesting discussions of the week. Our headmaster was presented with a scroll with the kanji for &quot;bushido&quot; on it which was written by one of the grandfather&#39;s of one of the students. \n\nOur headmaster then told us the meaning of the word bushido, which pointed to it&#39;s simplest meaning, yet I and many others never saw of it as this way. He broke down the meaning of the strokes in the first kanji &quot;bu&quot; and told us it basically meant &quot;to stop conflict&quot;. &quot;shi&quot; refers to a person i.e. samurai. And &quot;do&quot; the way. But basically he said it means &quot;The way of stopping conflict&quot;. He then asked how do you stop conflict. Thinkuing to the hisotry of Japan, the only way to stop conflict is to produce conflict. To fight. To suppress the enemy so that you cease their ability to produce conflict.   \n\nFrom this, I could see the truth behind the word. Bushido is not what is written in books about the samurai code, the way a samurai is supposed to conduct himself, it&#39;s true meaning is simply in the way of combat, the way of the warrior. \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
