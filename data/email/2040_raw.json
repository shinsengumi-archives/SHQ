Well the \nMeiji Era has TONS of these groups complete with speeches, riots, \nand sudden police raids.  Women&#39;s rights, and economic issues are \nwell documented in ENGLISH...so don&#39;t miss out on your chance to \nwrite about something you actually *love*...you should write NOW \nwhen you have the time (^_^)\nstart in your local public library, community college library and \nuniversity library (you can actually obtain day passes to major \nresearch universities---you DO NOT have to be a student).\n---------------------------------------------------\nsecretarytocapt3\n&quot;When I take the sword, be it only the foil, there&#39;s no parent, no \npupil nor master in my eye.  Even the best of all best friends I \nregard him as the worst enemy whom I must kill.  That is how I \nschool myself to the art of swordsmanship.&quot;\nRyunosuke from &quot;Dai-bosatsu Toge&quot;\naka the Psycho Guy or better yet THE TERMINATOR WITH A SWORD from \nthe movie &quot;SWORD OF DOOM&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
