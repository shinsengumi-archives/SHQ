The reply came from the person who uploaded the torrent (a longtime member), stating that fansubbers don&#39;t tackle taiga dramas because of the difficulty of the language used for those and they rely on the subtitling that is provided by professionals.  Unfortunately, in this case, neither of the two main sources that have previously provided subtitles for taiga have provided them for this.  **shrug**  Like I said, we&#39;ll just have to see if someone does considering the drama itself was so popular.\n   \n&lt;SNIP&gt;\n   \n  phil\n\nonigiribeanie &lt;jungleguuchan@...&gt; wrote:\n  Did anyone post a request for help with translating at d-addicts?  A\nnumber of other shows they&#39;ve put up without subtitles, fans from\nthere have made srt files available (which are not hardcoded subs, but\nbetter than nothing).  These usually appear within a few weeks of the\noriginal file going up there. (I watched Densha Otoko and a number of\nrandom J-dramas from there that way.) \n\nAnyways == thanks for the heads up.  It&#39;ll be nice to watch some\nShinsengumi(!) again.  \n\nS\n\n\t\t\t\n---------------------------------\nYahoo! Photos\n Ring in the New Year with Photo Calendars.
