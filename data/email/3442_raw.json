I&#39;m concerned that when=\r\n the movie is released in the west it \nwill simply not have the same impact=\r\n and the first 20 minutes are so are a \nbit rocky.  Most people who know th=\r\ne story can tell which character is \nwhich such as &quot;guy on white horse&quot; has=\r\n a name we all know already.  \n\nUnderstandably trailers of RED CLIFF make i=\r\nt seem like another empty, \nsoul-less CG extravaganza but if you acquire th=\r\ne film you&#39;ll be in for a BIG \nSURPRISE and part two will be even better.  =\r\n\n\nWarning: there is another &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; film by Sammo Hung---it \nlooks=\r\n really &quot;iffy&quot;.\n\nBut back to Three Kingdoms and why Kondou and men of his g=\r\neneration \nloved this work---to the point that Kondou somewhat identified h=\r\nimself \nwith the character of Guan Yu.\n\nThere are many versions of THree Ki=\r\nngdoms but the &quot;basic&quot; Guan Yu we \nknow from history was simply a self-made=\r\n man.  A farmer with no distinct \nbackground.  We assume that although he c=\r\name from an incredibly \nhumble background he seemed to be able to read---at=\r\nleast in one \nmemorable episode he reads  (or he may have pretended to read=\r\n).  More \nimportantly Guan Yu was very loyal/sincere and had a warrior&#39;s se=\r\nnse of \npride well before his sworn brother was able to establish a kingdom=\r\n/feud \nwhich in the process raised his rank.  His pathetic capture and deat=\r\nh is \noften dramatized in fiction and over the centuries he became a &quot;stock=\r\n \ncharacter&quot; for loyalty, warrior prowess and masculine power however the \n=\r\nhistorical Guan Yu was supposedly much more cunning and seemed to put \nup a=\r\n better fight than his fictional self. Kondou would have had access to \nthe=\r\n fictional Guan Yu via traditional story tellers and then he could have \nco=\r\nme across poetry and the full-length &quot;novel&quot; as he matured.  With each \nret=\r\nelling a person experiences the story becomes more &quot;badass&quot; to the \nyoung w=\r\narrior.\n\nSamurai easily related to the Three Kingdoms as a historical and l=\r\niterary \nwork because the epic is about warring feuds yet it has so many de=\r\nlicate \nepisodes which remind readers that in between the blood and gore th=\r\nere \nis still life beyond the battlefield and even the possibility of avert=\r\ning conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
