They landed in 1870 in a sleepy little town \ncalled Pagoda Springs Colorado.\n\nOnly they never counted on most of their old co-workers and enemies to \nget the same idea. We&#39;ve even had appearances from the great 15th \ncentury warrior Maeda Toshiie and his lovely wife Matsu and even Saizou \nthe pig from PMK and Bigfoot  are known to pop in O_O.\n\nDon&#39;t want to be a transplanted Japanese character? We could use long \nterm and temporary appearances from assorted American townsfolk types.\n\nIf you&#39;re interested or have questions or would like to know more pop me \nan email at bsher213@... or catch me on AIM or Yahoomessenger at \nbsher213\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n"
