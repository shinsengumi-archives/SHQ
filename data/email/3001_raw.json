In 1868,  Tatsunosuke left the Koyoch=\r\ninbutai (the renamed Shinsengumi) \nafter the battle in Koshu. However, Tets=\r\nunosuke decided to stay with the group.  He \ncontinued to fight in numerous=\r\n battles (for example, in Aizu, Fukushima, Sendai and \nHakodate.)\n\nDuring t=\r\nhe Hakodate War, on April 15 (lunar calendar) or May 3 (lunar calendar) 186=\r\n9, \nTetsunosuke was instructed by Hijikata to bear his photograph, letter, =\r\ndeath poem, \nkatana, and several strands of his hair to the home of his bro=\r\nther-in-law, Sato Hikogoro, \nin Hino. \n\nTetsunosuke arrived in Hino three m=\r\nonths later and stayed at Sato&#39;s house for 2-3 years.  \nDuring his time in =\r\nHino, Tetsunosuke studied kenjutsu and literature(?). Later, \nTetsunosuke r=\r\neturned home to Ogaki and was reunited with Tatsunosuke.\n\nThere are a few t=\r\nheories in regard of Ichimura Tetsunosuke&#39;s death date, while many \nbelieve=\r\n that Ichimura joined Saigo Takamori&#39;s army and died during the Satsuma Reb=\r\nellion \nin 1877, some believe that he died from an illness in 1873. \n\nThe u=\r\nploaded scans from &quot;Shinsengumi Dokuhon~Taishi Gaiden 2&quot; support the latter=\r\n \ntheory.\n\nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=3D10\n\nht=\r\ntp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=3D11&m=3Ds&o=3D0\n\nhtt=\r\np://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/photos/view/8b5a?b=3D12&m=3Ds&o=3D0\n\n=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nReferences\n\nKojima, Masataka.
