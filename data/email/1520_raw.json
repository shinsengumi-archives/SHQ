Sorry my poor english =/\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruno  \n&gt; \n\nHello Bruno! Welcome to the group. Sorry it&#39;s a bit empty right now. \nMost of the members I believe are busy with R/L, projects and the new \nShinsengumi RPG... \n\nI&#39;m sure one of the more knowledgeable people here can answer your \nquestion, so stick around. I won&#39;t dare answer because I&#39;m not in \ndepth with history as they are.\n\nOh while you&#39;re at it, why not join in on the fun of RPG?
