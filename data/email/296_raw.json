Odagiri is also in a  film that is \nrecently out or is coming out about Japanese jazz musicians  right after \nWWII  I can&#39;t remember the name  but there was an interview (in Japanese \nof course) with a musician who is apparently crossing over into acting \nwith this film. They showed a brief portion with subtitles and it seemed \nreally good.\n\nTiffany wrote:\n\n&gt;Joe Odagiri is the actor portraying Saitou Hajime in the NHK TAiga \n&gt;drama...so I did some online stalking...errr research and found that he \n&gt;was in the following movies\n&gt;\n&gt;BRIGHT FUTURE dir. by Kiyoshi Kurosawa ALSO starring Tadanobu \n&gt;Asano *hottie* (starred in Gohatto/Taboo and Gojoe)\n&gt;\n&gt;AZUMI...I can&#39;t really recommend this film because the director also \n&gt;directed a film called VERSUS which was -horrible- and reviewers are \n&gt;saying that AZUMI is basically VERSUS with swords...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;visit \n&gt;\n&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n&gt;\n&gt;our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n&gt;Yahoo!
