Haven&#39;t had a chance to read it fully, but in skimming it noticed a few interesting things.   \n\n\nFirst - a map of Kyoto interior.  (Finally we have a location for Mibu village with other key patrol areas marked.)  \n\nThe list of references are provided in two different ways. First a straight list and then organized by book chapters (so you can see where particular statements are taken from).     There seems to be a heavy dependence on a few works in his narratives.    (He also cites himself I believe at least twice, which I have some issues with:)  )   I think there also isn&#39;t really an attempt on his part to evaluate the sources he cites from.  \n\nPhotos: Really there are only four.  The images of Kondo and Hijikata have all appeared frequently on the web.   Kondo&#39;s jacket/haori with the skull is also included.  There is one banner from the Hijikata museum that graces the back cover.   As for the woodblock cover, still can&#39;t figure out where it comes from, although it appears to have been provided by Kojima Masataka of the Kojima Museum (http://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/) .  \n (It appears to be Satsuma clan based on their headdresses vs. Bakufu.)\n \nAs for the role of the Shinisengumi in the deaths of Ito, Takeda and Yamanami, I am not sure that fans of the taiga or anime depictions  will like what is presented here.  It certainly isn&#39;t the noble version of history that the taiga tries to portray.   \n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
