Sho=\r\nnai, of course, being close allies with Aizu.  Both \nincidents have been at=\r\ntributed to Sagara, but I don&#39;t know if anyone \nknows for sure.\n\nphil (who =\r\npromises to go back resting in peace for a while)\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, spiritus saitou &lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; It&#39;s my understanding =\r\nthat Sagara Souzou (a Satsuma retainer and \nheadquartered at the mansion wi=\r\nth the Soumou Roushitai) burned down \nthe Satsuma mansion to blame the baku=\r\nfu before he & as many of his \nmen as could reach the Satsuma warship escap=\r\ned Edo.  If M (or anyone \nelse who can translate Japanese) will take a look=\r\n at this site, maybe \nwe can get some possible clarification:  \nhttp://www1=\r\n.ocn.ne.jp/~oomi/tokusyu14.htm\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n&gt; secretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@h..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m NOT sure...but I think Aizu was part of the burning of t=\r\nhe \n&gt; SAtsuma mansion as well.  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hirotada=\r\n Tokugawa&quot; &lt;patriot014@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; In the footnotes to &quot;Remembering=\r\n Aizu,&quot; I found some things that \nI \n&gt; really \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t think of before--=\r\n namely, that the Aizu domain took the \njob \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; security in Kyoto so=\r\n seriously that it FINANCIALLY RUINED ITSELF. \n&gt; Also that \n&gt; &gt; Katamori wa=\r\ns a far more aggressive figure than Yoshinobu, and \nthat \n&gt; both \n&gt; &gt; Chosh=\r\nuu expeditions are seen as Katamori&#39;s personal vendetta \n&gt; against \n&gt; &gt; Cho=\r\nshuu-- which would explain the &quot;Imperial&quot; army&#39;s particular \n&gt; enmity at \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Aizu. Also remember that Katamori&#39;s brother Tokugawa Yoshikatsu \nwas \n&gt; =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; nominal commander of the Choshuu expedition.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --M.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo=\r\n!
