It is a book, and there&#39;s some writing on the \ncover as you can see, though I can&#39;t read it.\n\nhttp://img29.photobucket.com/albums/v86/mibella/what-002.jpg\n\nAnd this is what it looks like after the 21st page, again there&#39;s some \nwriting in the top right, and it&#39;s the same on all of the other pages, but \nagain, I can&#39;t read it. That in the middle is a printed copy of what&#39;s on \nthe twenty first page, obviously.\n\nSo I have no idea what this is and what it&#39;s for...if you know, could you \nplease tell me? My curiousity is killing me!!\n\nMiser Bellatrix\n\n&quot;Allow me to give you a hand...with your doom.&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nStop worrying about overloading your inbox - get MSN Hotmail Extra Storage! \nhttp://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=hotmail/es2&ST=1/go/onm00200362ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
