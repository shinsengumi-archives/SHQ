What was their relationship \nand what m=\r\nade them so compatible.  Oh, if only I could be a fly on \nthe wall back the=\r\nn, can you imagine the conversations I&#39;d overhear?\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------\nDear Kikue, thanks for your comment!\n\nJust somethi=\r\nng for everyone to chew on.  WHO came up with the name \nSaito Kazuma?  \n\nI =\r\nwager it&#39;s not even Fujita.\n\nI think it&#39;s Tokio.\nLet me try to explain (and=\r\n you all can disregard this blabber if you \nwant)\n\nJapanese love to keep lo=\r\ngs/records since feudal times.  If there is a \nfamine you write it down.  I=\r\nf there is a fire, you note houses burned.\nYamazaki Susumu kept a good log =\r\non Shinsengumi\nYamakawa Hiroshi (yet another friend of the Fujitas) even no=\r\nted in \nhis log when Fujita Tsutomu was born (Goro and Tokio&#39;s first son)\nM=\r\nany families (well before 1868) kept an expense log (usually \nmaintained by=\r\n the wife if she was literate)\n\nIt is in no way strange if Fujita Goro scri=\r\nbbled something in his log \nbook (mind you it&#39;s probably not a tell all dia=\r\nry XD) after Takamine \ndied.  When the book is printed, Tokio could easily =\r\nrummage through \nhubby&#39;s stuff and pull out the papers=85and she may have d=\r\none some \nediting=85like tag on a fake name=85.\n\nRemember Tokio was still a=\r\nlive=85this is still well before the 1923 \nearthquake when a lot of things =\r\nare lost forever.\n\nKikue, it&#39;s not complete yet but you can visit this site=\r\n \nhttp://www.takaminehideo.net (studied the T-sensei since 2004 and it \nocc=\r\nurred to me to put up a site in 2006 XD---there is a section on \nthe Siames=\r\ne and Takamine during Fujita&#39;s years at the school which I \nshould upload)\n=\r\n\nWell the information we posted ofcourse is based on a translation of \njust=\r\n what &quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; said about Takamine.  So your question \nabout what ma=\r\nde two very very different men friends is very important \nto me.\n\nSo I&#39;d li=\r\nke to approach your question from another angle, &quot;what did \nTakamine think =\r\nabout Fujita?&quot;  I&#39;ve been studying this man since \n2004.  Info on Takamine =\r\nappears in English, Japanese and Thai (I&#39;ve \nfound him in 4 Thai books---ho=\r\nwever 2 cite the other as source).\nI can&#39;t even begin to list how different=\r\n they were in terms of \nbackground:\n\nAge:  Takamine was exactly 10 years yo=\r\nunger than Fujita Goro\nThis is important.  In 1868, Takamine was only 15 ho=\r\nwever unlike \nFujita he never really was a fully a samurai &quot;in practice&quot; (i=\r\nf you \nincorporate the warrior definition of a samurai).  Takamine was a \np=\r\nage, while that was an important job, he like another friend of \nFujita, Ya=\r\nmakawa Kenjiro, could not experience the dimension of going \ninto battle.  =\r\nThe reason why both Takamine and Yamakawa [respected] \nFujita because: \n\n1)=\r\n Yamaguchi Jiro ~DEFENDED AIZU, their homeland---if I may speculate \nhere, =\r\nFujita to them, was sort of their hero.  Regardless of any \ndifference in s=\r\nocial class in the Meiji, they didn&#39;t see him \nas &quot;officer Fujita&quot;  they sa=\r\nw him as a samurai.\n\n2) They shared in survivor&#39;s guilt and had empathy for=\r\n one another\nSocial Background:  Takamine (as a kid he was called Tadayoshi=\r\n not \nHideo), completed his education at Nisshinkan (Aizu&#39;s school for \nsam=\r\nurai) and was gifted enough to be called a &#39;shindo&#39;, he was given \nthe job =\r\nof page to daimyo Matsudaira Katamori.  \nWe know Saitou&#39;s background pretty=\r\n well (^_^)\n\nAdulthood:  Takamine spent 3 years in the USA (rural New York)=\r\n and \nspent the rest of his life in Japan as an academic and was involved \n=\r\nin many extracurricular activities (art, science, charity, working \nwith ma=\r\nny foreigners--some of whom literally exported &quot;Meiji Japan&quot; \nto the USA an=\r\nd even to Europe)\nFujita&#39;s career was very &quot;classic&quot; post 1868 samurai jobs=\r\n (police, \nbodyguard to Inoue Kaoru, Imperial guard detail for the Empress =\r\netc)\n\nPolitical/Social views:  Takamine was a &quot;true&quot; progressive (not like =\r\n\nMori Arinori, or even Takamine&#39;s own mentor Fukuzawa).  Some women \nhere m=\r\nay appreciate this:  &quot;He (Takamine) hated the old saying &#39;men \nrevered, wom=\r\nen subjected&#39;....&quot; (danson-johi) (Takamine Hideo-sensei \nden, p. 174 transl=\r\nated by A. Bakalian).  T-sensei worked very hard \nfor women&#39;s education and=\r\n also adopted highly unpopular views at the \nrisk of his own career.\n\nWe do=\r\nn&#39;t know about Fujita&#39;s views.\n\nso with all these differences in mind how d=\r\nid they become friends, \nother than their common Aizu &quot;connection&quot; and the =\r\nfact that Tokio is \nTakamine&#39;s cousin?\n\nThey are different that&#39;s why they =\r\nget along.\n\nTakamine was VERY LOQUACIOUS (he can blah blah blah for hours o=\r\nn \ntopics he likes).  Fujita was taciturn or he may have come across as \na =\r\ngood listener.  For all we know Fujita may have learned how to \nsleep with =\r\nhis eyes open in these one sided conversations : LOL :\nFujita may have felt=\r\n that some of Takamine&#39;s ideas were 100% &quot;silly&quot; \nbecause---they were (if y=\r\nou imagine yourself to be a typical Japanese \nman of that era).  \n\nHowever,=\r\n likely their conversations were &quot;selective&quot; and focused on \nthings they co=\r\nuld agree on:  certain political figures they knew from \nbefore 1868, who w=\r\nere still around in the Meiji Era.  In other \nwords &quot;Did you read about tha=\r\nt guy who just died, remember what he \nwas up to during the war?....&quot; etc e=\r\ntc\n\nVery few people can advise Takamine in matters of art, except when it \n=\r\ncame to swords.  Again, one must meditate on the fact that Fujita in \nhis y=\r\nouth had to have had a peculiar education or mentor to be so \nlearned in th=\r\ne field of sword appraisal to have been able to give \npointers to a man lik=\r\ne Takamine who was -OBSESSED- with things like \ntraditional, modern art, po=\r\nttery etc.\n\nWe all assume that Fujita&#39;s appointment to the Women&#39;s Normal S=\r\nchool \nwas to Fujita&#39;s advantage.\n\nFrom my own study into Meiji Education p=\r\nolitics I don&#39;t think this is \nnecessarily the only way to view the situati=\r\non.  It was to TAKAMINE&#39;S \nADVANTAGE to have someone in the office to keep =\r\nhim informed.  There \nwas intense factionalism in the system and as the dir=\r\nector it was a \ngood idea to have a good &quot;pulse&quot; on the situation in the sc=\r\nhool and \nto inform him if some of his wacky ideas was truly accepted or no=\r\nt by \nhis staff and faculty. To keep this short, I have to say that \nTakami=\r\nne&#39;s career had very very severe declines.  By the time he \ndrags a friend =\r\ninto the school, Takamine has seen it all when it \ncomes to career matters.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Saitou Kazuma&quot; seemed to know intimate details about Takamine.  Well \nth=\r\ne reverse is true as well.  When Numazawa Tatsuo asked his aunt \nIbuka Saku=\r\n about his true parentage (Tatsuo was Goro and Tokio&#39;s \nthird son), Ibuka t=\r\nold him the truth.\n\nIbuka is Takamine&#39;s  mother&#39;s family.  \n\nIn other words=\r\n, it&#39;s impossible to imagine that Takamine didn&#39;t know \nabout the adoption,=\r\n Ibuka Saku was probably his mother&#39;s relative \n(sister?).  Tokio had to ha=\r\nve told Takamine&#39;s mother about the \nadoption.  Pic of Tokio&#39;s gal pal &quot;Ma =\r\nTakamine&quot; (Takamine Kinoko \nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/TakamineKin=\r\noko.jpg). \nTakamine&#39;s mother in turn may have told her own relative.\n\nRecal=\r\nl this testimony:\n\n&quot;Mrs. Tokio and my grandmother Ikuno/Kinoko were very cl=\r\nose to each \nother, and Mrs. Tokio often came over to see my grandmother...=\r\nIf my \nmemories are correct, at the time Ms. Tokio had her bangs \nin &#39;kiris=\r\nage style&quot;\nI remember, when my mother died, Ms. Tokio stopped by my house \n=\r\nseveral times to help us.\nMrs. Tokio was a woman not too tall, but rather s=\r\nmall of stature. She \ncertainly did look like an Aizu woman. (likely becaus=\r\ne she was small--\nor maybe also because she was hard-working) She often wen=\r\nt to the \nMatsudaira Katamori&#39;s home at Enoki-zaka...working there on many =\r\n\ndifferent things (or: There she devoted herself to various chores, \nsuch a=\r\ns housekeeping and other things women were in charge)\nMy grandmother often =\r\ntook my sister and I to Mr. Fujita&#39;s \nresidence...As I remember, from the s=\r\ntreet we would go down the stone-\nmade staircase to get to the house.\n\nThes=\r\ne stories are from Ms. Takamine Keiko who was interviewed in 1978.\n\nKeiko w=\r\nas born in the 1890s and therefore only knew very &quot;aged&quot; Mr. \nand Mrs. Fuji=\r\nta.\n\nI guess in a way this discovery of a &quot;Saito Kazuma&quot; makes up for my \nd=\r\nisastrous attempt at acquiring the wedding photos of Mr. and Mrs. \nTakamine=\r\n.\n\nWhile Takamine is not our main interest, what we want are the other \nAiz=\r\nu figures which would show up in a group photo, namely, possibly a \nman whi=\r\nch may or may not resemble the one shown in teh Seinan War \nphoto.\n\nResearc=\r\nh is never neat and organized, you have to be really really \nwily to find w=\r\nhat you need and look for other &quot;opportunities&quot; because \nafter all, there i=\r\ns little or no chance of anyone finding artifacts \ndirectly related to the =\r\nFujitas.\n\n\n"
