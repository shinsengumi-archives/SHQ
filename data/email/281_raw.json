Hijikata in PMK mentions this in ep 20 or 21. It&#39;s a group of 4 people that head in first during a raid. \n\n  Second and Third Images: Info about Mibu Gishi Den&#39;s Yoshimura Kanichiro. I&#39;m guessing someone asked if there was really someone in the Shinsengumi by that name. \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  visit \n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/\n\n  our companion list featuring fanfiction/art \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
