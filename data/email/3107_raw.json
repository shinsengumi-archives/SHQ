That is\nwhy the cost is kep=\r\nt low.\n\nSHQ&#39;s mission is fan based but we clearly also have a deep interest=\r\n in\nthis history. As we&#39;ve slowly gained a better understanding of the\nShin=\r\nsengumi&#39;s world we realize how rare this information is in English.\n\nSo you=\r\n may ask &#39;how can I help?&quot;\n\nYou can help by contributing any fanwork (ficti=\r\non, art, parody,\nmultimedia) you wish.\nVolunteer to help list keywords for =\r\nsome page.\n\nOR\n\ncontribute to the flat rate of this project.\n\nThe cost of t=\r\nhe installation of the database is $40. However, I hope\nto continue to have=\r\n a professional relationship with her so that she\ncan help solve other tech=\r\nnical issues which may arise in the future\nand so forth. So I feel that the=\r\n amount is justifiable.\n\nI will be paying an additional cost on my own to h=\r\ner because I have\nsat down\nwith her gone through the site with her already.=\r\n Basically she has and\nwill be putting in alot of time.\nI would pay the $40=\r\n on my own however I was unemployed at the end of\nDecember (but now I am on=\r\nly underemployed) and I cannot handle the\nfinancial burden on my own. So if=\r\n people would like to contribute any\namount please paypal [shinsengumihq(a)=\r\nyahoo.com]. For the sake of\ncomplete transparency, I can also\nprovide a rec=\r\neipt from this programmer who can verify that she has\nreceived payment from=\r\n me as well.\n\nshinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com\n\n\n"
