They never showed the \nKyoto arc but once. Maybe they intend to move it around later? Include it in \nthe Adult Swim line-up at some point? They do that sort of thing all the time \nwith their other anime. I wouldn&#39;t be a bit surprised to see it turn up again \nsoon anyway. I finally gave up on them myself.
