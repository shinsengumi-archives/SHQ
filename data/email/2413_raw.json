It seems that she beat out her husband and her full name \nis in an academic article...whereas &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; is just a footnote \nall over the place (-_-).  Our Tokio really was a &quot;capable&quot; woman.  So \nfar all our info on Tokio is translated from Japanese, mentions the \nhair cutting, nursing of wounded soldiers, her role in the Meiji Era, \nbut (not) -specifically- BODYGUARD TOKIO!\n\nIf you are short on time, download the article and flip to [page 413] \nto find her and make note of all the places in which *Teruhime* is \nmentioned in the entire text.  Logically, Tokio would be by her side \nalmost all the time.  I know atleast 2 great fanfic writers have worked \nin the Joushitai in their writings (^_^)\n\nThanks again to Hirotada Tokugawa for being the first known Joushitai \nfanguy this side of the Pacific and for introducing them to our \nShinsengumi fandom.\n\n&gt; (Learn more at and see their pics \n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/WB.htm)\n&gt; Read the article here...\n&gt; https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/FemaleCombatantsAizu.pdf \n&gt; (email me if you have problems downloading anything)\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is [Off-topic] but if you want to learn more about Henry Heusken \n(the foreign guy in NHK&#39;s Shinsengumi!) and about how Kiyokawa Hachiro \n(leader of the Roshigumi) was involved with his murder you can read\nhttp://www.1happyturtle.com/makoto/HH.htm\n\n\n\n\n"
