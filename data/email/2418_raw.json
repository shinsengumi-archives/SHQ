Saigou (Saigou Tanomo, chief retainer).\n2. Numazawa (heirless family that Tatsuo was adopted into) Page 68 of Shiba \nGoro&#39;s book references a &quot;Numasawa Einosuke&quot;...\n3. Sagawa (Sagawa Kanbei, domain elder who died at Mt. Aso in the Seinan \nWar)\n4. Kimoto/Kinomoto, presumably another Aizu retainer.\n\nBy way of Saigou, he is also connected to the Iinuma, the family of the lone \nsurvivor of the fragment of the Byakkotai that committed suicide on \nIimori-yama (Iinuma Sadakichi). Iinuma Tokei fought alongside Saigou Tanomo \nat the Battle of Shirakawa (as in the movie &quot;Byakkotai&quot;), and if the film is \ncorrect, kept Saigou from committing seppuku.\n\nHOWEVER, not all Byakkotai died on Iimori-yama. There was a larger group of \nthem, and they were either killed in the battle or survived, like Yamakawa \nKenjiro and Shiba Shiro, the brother of Shiba Goro.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. The commander of the Byakkotai was Hinata \nNaiki...and Shiba Goro&#39;s mother comes from the Hinata family. Shiba is also \nrelated to the Arakawa by way of his uncle Shiba Seisuke-- and Arakawa was \nthe family of Arakawa Katsushige, who wrote a book about Aizu in the Boshin \nthat Sec looked at some time ago.\n\nOther familial connections, this time amongst the Edo-based retainers:\n\nNakano (family of Takeko) and Hirata (other Joshitai member) were connected \nto Akaoka (naginata teacher) because they&#39;d both each given a daughter to \nhim in adoption. Nakano Heinai was the leader of the Shujakutai, the group \nof men aged 18-35 who &quot;engaged in actual combat&quot; (Shiba, p. 45), and his \nson, Nakano Toyonori, at age 19, was a member.\n\nNow back to reading!\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
