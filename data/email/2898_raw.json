Therefore,\n&gt; &gt; Kondou Isami was\n&gt; &gt; first =\r\nadopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name Kondou sometime after\n&gt; &gt; 18=\r\n58.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rintarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s =\r\nbirth (but\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s not the\n&gt; &gt; point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as=\r\n the head of the Okita family for\n&gt; &gt; a short time\n&gt; &gt; (possibly less than =\r\na year) before Rintarou Kanamasa became the head of\n&gt; &gt; the family.\n&gt; &gt; Rin=\r\ntarou Kanemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family until\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Souji\n&gt; &gt; got married. Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s son Yos=\r\nhijirou\n&gt; &gt; would probably\n&gt; &gt; have become Souji&#39;s heir (and would likely h=\r\nave married Souji&#39;s eldest\n&gt; &gt; daughter.) I suppose\n&gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve be=\r\nen acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; Kanamasa&#39;s daughter\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nnstead. However, considering that Souji&#39;s son would&#39;ve been quite a few\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n years younger\n&gt; &gt; than Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s youngest daughter, I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk this would&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; been the case.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If one could change their s=\r\ntatus through purchase or adoption then it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; all just a\n&gt; &gt; formality?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; During the Bakumatsu? more or less, perhaps.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~Seven\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;zhusanna&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;wsehom=\r\ne@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Calling on our knowlegdeable history people...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why did people change their names so much? It was th=\r\ne samurai&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; custom! Many samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed their name twice, bu=\r\nt Okita had only changed his name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; once. Yes, a samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would =\r\nhave usually kept his formal given name/middle name when he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; changed h=\r\nis (full)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it from Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. Why=\r\n? I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not sure...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From Wikipedia:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted =\r\nno time in adopting the young Katsugoro in 1849, who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first took the n=\r\name of Shimazaki Katsuta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have? I thought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nperhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been given) a name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nto honor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his name from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sou=\r\njirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Ko=\r\nndou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but if=\r\n he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating himself from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Mi=\r\nyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first? Could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone =\r\nbe adopted into one family and then into another?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ****\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though this hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally b=\r\nelieved\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that Okita Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family f=\r\nor his samurai status (by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fami=\r\nly and therefore would have to change his name to Okita.) He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; served a=\r\ns a retainer for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; young Souji.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Okita family coul=\r\nd have needed the additional financial support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death. Rintarou Mototsune did serve as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe head of the Okita\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family for a short time (not sure how short...=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First, if Katsujirou adopted Rintarou Kanamasa to be he=\r\nad of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Okita family because Souji was too young...what happened wh=\r\nen Souji&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mother married Rintarou Mototsune? RM displaced RK as head=\r\n of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; family? Then after RM&#39;s death RK was reinstated? And what wou=\r\nld\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have happened if Souji had lived longer? Would he have replaced RK=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, if one could change their status through purchase or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n adoption then it&#39;s all just a formality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks everyone for b=\r\neing patient with my questions!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --Wanda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
