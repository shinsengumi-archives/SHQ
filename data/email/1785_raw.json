The \nsite http://hajime3.hp.infoseek.co.jp/index.html (formerly 3-\nhajime.com) does focus on history and used textual resources. Keep \nin mind that &quot;history&quot; may also include stories handed down by \nfriends and family.  \n\nsecretarytocapt3\nAIM Badgerturtle\nwho is constantly pushing back her deadline for her TMPD and Seinan \nWar write up (^_^)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
