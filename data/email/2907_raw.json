Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. The samurai class was \naboli=\r\nshed within years after the Shogunate government was overthrown and whether=\r\n Okita \nreceived Bakushin status in 1867 wouldn&#39;t have mattered at that poi=\r\nnt, would it?  Then, he \nwould&#39;ve followed the &quot;plan&quot; to become the head of=\r\n the family and name Yoshijirou as his \nheir (he would&#39;t have a &quot;reason&quot; to=\r\n start a Bunke of his own, wouldn&#39;t he? ) \n\n~Seven\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;k kobayakawa&quot; &lt;kobaya635@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, we were talking abou=\r\nt &quot;if&quot;.\n&gt; But still he can start Bunke.\n&gt; Bunke, Honke is nothing to do wit=\r\nh Shogunate.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2006/6/29, Seven &lt;nlf7@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    True...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; However, even though Okita Souji received Bakushin status in 1867, the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; shogunate\n&gt; &gt; government was overthrown in 1868.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~Seven\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com &lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;k kobayakawa&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nkobaya635@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Souji can start &quot;Bunke&quot;, a branch family of =\r\nOkita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Souji received Bakushin status in 1967 so his Okita line could=\r\n be higher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than Rintaro&#39;s Okita line.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2006/6/26, Se=\r\nven &lt;nlf7@&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Shuusuke was born Shimazaki Sekigoro=\r\n(sp?) and he took the name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondou when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he became the 3rd ma=\r\nster of the Tennen Rishin-ryu in 1830. Therefore,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kondou Isami was\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first adopted as a Shimazaki before he took the name Kondou sometim=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1858.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katsujirou could have adopted Rin=\r\ntarou Kanamasa before Souji&#39;s birth\n&gt; &gt; (but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s not the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n point here.) Rintarou Mototsune served as the head of the Okita family\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a short time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (possibly less than a year) before Rintar=\r\nou Kanamasa became the head\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the family.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rintarou Kan=\r\nemasa was only going to remain as the head of the family\n&gt; &gt; until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSouji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got married. Had Souji lived longer, Rintarou Kanamasa&#39;s son\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Yoshijirou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would probably\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have become Souji&#39;s heir (and=\r\n would likely have married Souji&#39;s eldest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daughter.) I suppose\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; that it would&#39;ve been acceptable if Souji&#39;s son married Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Kanamasa&#39;s daughter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead. However, considering that Souji&#39;s so=\r\nn would&#39;ve been quite a\n&gt; &gt; few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years younger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than Rintarou=\r\n Kanamasa&#39;s youngest daughter, I don&#39;t think this\n&gt; &gt; would&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been=\r\n the case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If one could change their status throug=\r\nh purchase or adoption then\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all just a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formality?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; During the Bakumatsu? more or less, perhaps.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ~Seven=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com \n&lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n&gt;&lt;SHQ%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;zhusanna&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;wsehome@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Calling on our knowlegdeable history people...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why did people change their names so much? It w=\r\nas the samurai&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; custom! Many samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed their n=\r\name twice, but Okita had only changed his name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once. Yes, a samur=\r\nai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have usually kept his formal given name/middle name wh=\r\nen he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed his (full)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name but Okita changed it fr=\r\nom Harumasa to Kaneyoshi. Why? I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not sure...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; From Wikipedia:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Shuusuke wasted no time in adopting the young =\r\nKatsugoro in 1849,\n&gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first took the name of Shimazaki Katsu=\r\nta, and later, Kondo Isami.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; So...What significance does the choice of name have? I thought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; perhaps a male might choose (if he hasn&#39;t already been given) a name\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to honor someone in his family. In Souji shortening his name from\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Soujirou, he is dropping the end part that is like Katsujirou. And\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Kondou&#39;s case, he initially retained the Katsu part of his name=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if he changing his family name, isn&#39;t he separating himself=\r\n from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Miyakawa family? Or was he adopted as a Shimazaki first=\r\n? Could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone be adopted into one family and then into another?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ****\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though =\r\nthis hasn&#39;t been fully confirmed, it&#39;s generally believed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Ok=\r\nita Rintarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune paid the Okita family for his samurai st=\r\natus (by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being &quot;adopted&quot; into the Okita\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family and th=\r\nerefore would have to change his name to Okita.) He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; served as a r=\r\netainer for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; young Souji.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Okita fami=\r\nly could have needed the additional financial\n&gt; &gt; support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Ri=\r\nntarou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mototsune after Katsujirou&#39;s death.
