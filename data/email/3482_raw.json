The story features Japanese American\ncollege studen=\r\nt Emmi Maeda who falls back to 1864 Kyoto and gets on the\nwrong side of Hij=\r\nikata in her quest to find her way back home.  The\nscene below does&#39;t featu=\r\nre Hijikata-san but it does feature Yamanami and\neverybody&#39;s favorite mibur=\r\no Saitou. Enjoy.\n\n\nExcerpt:\n\n&quot;But, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Emmi said as the harsh trut=\r\nh sunk it. She\nwas a prisoner.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s only for tonight,&quot; Kaemon said. &quot;I&#39;ll=\r\n come\nback for you tomorrow.&quot;\n\nEmmi sniffled and nodded. He almost seemed t=\r\no care.&quot;What about my\nmirror?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yamanami-san will see that it&#39;s secure.&quot;\n\n=\r\nShe nodded again and lowered her gaze, determined not to cry in front of\nth=\r\nis guy.\nShe looked up when he spoke again, his tone much softer than it had=\r\n been\nall night.\n\n&quot;Yamanami-san, could you assign a guard to her for the ni=\r\nght?&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot;\n\n&quot;Could you choose someone totally trustworthy? Someone=\r\n who would\nnever think to\ntake advantage of the situation.&quot;\n\nYamanami place=\r\nd his hand on Kaemon&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;ve been\nhaving difficulty\nsleeping late=\r\nly. Let me lock her mirror away, and then I&#39;ll go stay\nwith her.&quot;\n\nKaemon b=\r\nowed deeply. &quot;I am in your debt, Yamanami-san.&quot;\n\nWhen the older man left, K=\r\naemon looked at Emmi a long time, and she\ntried to\nfigure out what was goin=\r\ng on behind those piercing, dark eyes of his.\nFor the first time,\nshe took =\r\na long look at her &quot;rescuer.&quot; He was young; she doubted\nhe was much older t=\r\nhan\nshe was.\n\nIn fact, he was awfully good looking.\n\nYamanami returned from=\r\n his room, and Kaemon left without saying another\nword or\neven looking back=\r\n.\n\n&quot;I won&#39;t lie to you, Maeda-dono,&quot; Yamanami said as they\nwalked towards a=\r\n small Lshaped\nbuilding at the far end of the compound. &quot;The men we have de=\r\ntained\nare typical\ndogs, and even though we rearranged them to place empty =\r\ncells adjacent\nto yours, they&#39;ll\nstill be able to glimpse you coming in, so=\r\n don&#39;t be surprised if\nthey say things you might\nnot be used to hearing sai=\r\nd to a lady.&quot;\n\nUnnerved at the thought of being stuck in an actual jail wit=\r\nh violent\ncriminals, Emmi\nstumbled.\n\nYamanami placed a steadying hand on he=\r\nr arm. &quot;It will be all right.\nI&#39;ll see to it that\nyou&#39;re not alone in there=\r\n.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you.&quot;\n\nAs predicted, the prisoners began calling out when she st=\r\nepped inside\nthe jail. Emmi\nwas glad they spoke so quickly; she couldn&#39;t pr=\r\nocess it all, but even\nthe gist of their\nwords made her want to throw up.\n\n=\r\n&quot;Silence!&quot; Yamanami yelled in a voice infinitely more commanding\nthan his\nm=\r\neasured speaking tone.\n\nEmmi kept her eyes focused on her feet. She followe=\r\nd the vice-commander\nto the\nmiddle of the three small cells that formed the=\r\n shorter portion of the\nL. Blankets had been\nhung on the sides as makeshift=\r\n walls. Yamanami picked up the clean\nchamber pot from\nthe floor outside and=\r\n placed it in the right corner behind a small\nbamboo screen.\n\n&quot;It isn&#39;t the=\r\n privacy you&#39;re used to, but I think you&#39;ll\nbe comfortable enough.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank=\r\n you,&quot; Emmi said stepping inside. Though she wanted to\nscream when\n\nYamanam=\r\ni shut the door and placed a large iron lock through the wooden\nbars, she k=\r\nept\nsilent.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to check on that food tray, and then I&#39;ll be\nback.&quot;=\r\n\n\n&quot;All right.&quot;\n\nWhen he left, Emmi unrolled the thin futon mat and curled u=\r\np in the\ncenter. She\nprayed that this was all a nightmare, that she&#39;d wake =\r\nup and find it\nhad all been a bad\ndream. That wish fell apart quickly once =\r\nthe male prisoners began\ncalling out to her a few\nminutes later.\n\n&quot;They bri=\r\nng you to entertain us?&quot;\n\n&quot;You smell sweet.&quot;\n\n&quot;I get the first taste.&quot;\n\nEmm=\r\ni covered her ears and hoped Yamanami would return soon. When the\nouter\ndoo=\r\nr to the jail slid open, she crawled to the front bars and looked\nout.\n\nShe=\r\n could make out Yamanami in the dim lantern light. He was carrying a\ndinner=\r\n\ntray. Behind him was another man who veered off towards the\nprisoners&#39; cel=\r\nls.\nEmmi gasped when she heard scuffling and what could only be the sound o=\r\nf\nmen\nbeing beaten. A man&#39;s voice issued threats and orders of silence.\n\n&quot;P=\r\nay it no mind, child,&quot; Yamanami said, as he set the tray down\nthen unlocked=\r\n the\ndoor.\n\n&quot;But=97&quot;\n\n&quot;They savaged and murdered a woman who was gathering =\r\ninformation for\nthe\nShogunate. They don&#39;t deserve your mercy.&quot;\n\nHe slipped =\r\nthe open lock through one of the door crossbars, then picked\nup the tray,\na=\r\nnd set it on the floor beside the futon. Emmi&#39;s empty stomach\nrumbled at th=\r\ne smell of\nthe soup, steaming tea, and flat bread. She noticed that there w=\r\nas\nenough for two.\n\n&quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I thought I&#39;d sit here with you.&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;Well=85&quot;\n\nYamanami smiled a rather sad smile. &quot;It&#39;s quite safe, I promise\n=\r\nyou.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yamanami-san,&quot; a man said.\n\nEmmi looked up at the man who had accom=\r\npanied the vice-commander inside.\nHe\nwas dressed in a dark kimono, his blac=\r\nk hair pulled back into a high\nponytail.\n\n&quot;Forgive the interruption. I don&#39;=\r\nt think you&#39;ll have any\nfurther trouble tonight from\nthat scum.&quot;\n\nYamanami =\r\nsighed, and Emmi had the distinct impression that he didn&#39;t\nhave much of\na =\r\nstomach for this part of the job.\n\n&quot;Thank you, Saitou-san.&quot; He turned back =\r\nto me. &quot;Maeda-dono,\nthis is Saitou Hajime,\nCaptain of the third unit.&quot;\n\nEmm=\r\ni managed to stop herself from saying &quot;I know.&quot; Saitou had\nbeen portrayed\nq=\r\nuite often in anime and manga. The drawn versions didn&#39;t come close\nto grab=\r\nbing the\nintensity of the real man.\n\nSaitou bowed to her then addressed his=\r\n commander once more. &quot;I will\nbe making\nrounds through the compound tonight=\r\n if you need anything.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you.&quot;\n\nThe fierce samurai headed to the doo=\r\nr, pausing long enough to order the\nprisoners to\ncease their groaning and s=\r\nniveling else he&#39;d &quot;make them\nstop&quot;.\n\n&quot;I think he&#39;s more frightening than H=\r\nijikata.&quot;\n\n&quot;You might be right.&quot; Yamanami removed the cover from the food\nd=\r\nishes. &quot;We&#39;d\nbetter eat this before it gets cold.&quot;\n* * * * *\n\nFalling Throu=\r\ngh Glass on sale now at Liquid Silver Books :\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ydktugj\n\n~=\r\n Barbara Sheridan\nBarbaraSheridan.com &lt;http://www.barbarasheridan.com/&gt;\n\nFa=\r\nlling Through Glass the video trailer &lt;http://tinyurl.com/nnve7t&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
