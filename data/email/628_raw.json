Looking at the names babelfish is supplying... Miki is shown in both surname and personal positions.  Is it just the way babelfish is translating or did he indeed use the name for either at various times?  And, am I correct in my always doubtful decipherment that during the Meiji he became &quot;Miki Izumi&quot; and if so, is Miki the surname or the personal name.  The urge is to switch it around with Izumi as the surname.\n \nphil (going ahead and writing an isolated scene without a clue as to where it&#39;s going to come in in the story...)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
