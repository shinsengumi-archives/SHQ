Tokugawa Yoshimune, the \ndaimyo of Kii, became the 8th shogun, inaugurating what became the Kyoho \nera, and when he came from Kii to Edo, he brought with him a group of 16 men \nwho were his private agents/bodyguards/investigators. In time, these 16 men \nbecame what&#39;s known as the Oniwabanshu, and passed on the tradition within \nthe same 16 families. This tradition continued all the way through the Edo \nperiod, all the way even into the Bakumatsu. These men were just one of many \ngroups of investigators in the service of the Shogunate, and took their \norders from the roju (Senior Councilors), wakadoshiyori (Junior Councilors), \nand metsuke (inspectors). Their duties, depending on their specific \nspecialty or classification, ranged from security inside Edo Castle (or, \npresumably, wherever the Shogun was, like Nijo Castle) to \npatrol/surveillance in Edo. In the Meiji Era, when a concerted effort was \ncarried out to interview former Shogunate officials, one of those \ninterviewed was a former Oniwabanshu member-- and his record appears in the \ncompilation of those interviews, known as &quot;Kyuji Shimonroku&quot;-- loosely, &quot;The \nRecord of Bygone Days&quot;.\n\n(info from Anna Beerens&#39; translation of &quot;Interview with a Bakumatsu \nOfficial&quot;)\n\nI wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there was interaction between Kondou Isami and \nthe Oniwabanshu during the Shinsengumi&#39;s duty at Nijo Castle, or their work \nin the Edo area.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
