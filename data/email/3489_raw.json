This book challenges some of the preconceptions that have hindered the R=\r\nestoration being understood on its own terms.&quot;\n\nWords like revolution, and =\r\ndemocracy have always been associated with the Meiji Era but studies of the=\r\n Meiji Constitution, mass militarization of the population, not to mention =\r\nthe blatant power monopoly of the victors tarnish the golden era image.\n\nSw=\r\nale completed a very decent work called The Political Thought of Mori Arino=\r\nri: A Study in Meiji Conservatism and I hope this new text will further sol=\r\nidify his position in the new wave of Meiji studies.\n\n\n\n"
