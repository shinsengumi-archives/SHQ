I guess being perpetually hungry is the lot of ronin LOL!  \n&gt;When I get more of the series...I am going to have to see this in \n&gt;slow motion ^_^...in the case of Saitou it should be like fighting \n&gt;over the last bottle of sake\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSaitou was there but I think he was being his laid back self. Now  \nHarada and Shimada.(in the episode from last Sunday) definitely dove at \nthe food. Those guys together near food are scary!! LOL\n\nFor anyone whose seen at least the first couple episodes you will recall \nwhat a dweeb Todo Heisuke is--well when he wasn&#39;t looking Harada reached \nover and stole his riceball right out of his hand!!  To make matters \nworse when Okita later spurns the food young Miss Hide saved for him \nShimada snags that and there&#39;s poor Heisuke with that lok on his face of \n&#39;hey....what about _me_????&quot;\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
