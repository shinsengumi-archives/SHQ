We will be doing a \n&gt;brief chat session on the message board around 9:00pm EST to try to \n&gt;nail this down. Feel free to join in the discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, I need anyone interested to e-mail me, Barb, or phil and tell \n&gt;us the character you want to be. You MUST contact one of us because \n&gt;the membership into the RPG is restricted to invitation only in order \n&gt;to prevent passers-by from making pointless entries.  Hurry, because \n&gt;the main men will go fast. We also need people to play the Ishin \n&gt;members.\n&gt;\n&gt;So far taken characters are: Hijikata, Ito, Miki(Suzuki), Saito, and \n&gt;Kondo. Right now the rest of the Shinsengumi are fair game, so chose \n&gt;quickly!\n&gt;\n&gt;Make sure you confirm the character is still open before you register \n&gt;with LiveJournal, since you&#39;ll want to do so under the character&#39;s \n&gt;name. Once you&#39;re registered with the community, please refrain from \n&gt;making posts until the game is officially underway. We will also have \n&gt;a seperate mailing list for OOC discussions and questions on the RPG. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;-MissBehavin/Hijikata \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nSome slight corrections to the above posts. Send your e-mails to phil. It will be easier if one person is keeping track of everything.\n\nAlso, I forgot that someone had already indicated they wanted to play Okita. It&#39;s not certain at this time they will join the game, but consider him claimed until we get confirmation one way or the other.\n\nHere&#39;s who&#39;s playing who so far:\n\nHijikata - me\nIto - Barb\nSuzuki - phil\nSaito - Angrybee\nKondo - wounds\nOkita - Aurus(?)\n\nSorry for any confusion. I&#39;m still confused myself!\n\n-MissBehavin/Hijikata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
