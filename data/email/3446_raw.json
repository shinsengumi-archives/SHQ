I know I&#39;m hoping for the best with this project.\nTechnolog=\r\ny is always changing [damn it] and no sooner we learn how to\nmanipulate one=\r\n dynamics, here comes another even more complicated to\nlearn.  After my 10+=\r\n years of working as a web host, I&#39;m ready to go to\nthe lulu bin after then=\r\n introduction of all sorts of new scripts.  I&#39;ve\ngotten to the point of was=\r\nhing my hands entirely of it and sticking to\njust doing graphics for the cl=\r\nients.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m soooo looking forward to the new site and the informati=\r\non\nthat will be available to everyone.  I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re willing to\nsacri=\r\nfice your time to this effort.  THANKS, on behalf of ALL the\nShinsengumi-ai=\r\n!\n\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; I will be recording the very very sad step by step process in trying\nto\n=\r\n&gt; restore SHQ.  Not everything on the old site will be back online\nbecause\n=\r\n&gt; we are trying to keep things simple.  If you recall our old hosting\n&gt; com=\r\npany was unable to restore the one html file which housed the\n&gt; entire site=\r\n---that&#39;s why SHQ died.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyways some of the gory details.\n&gt;\n&gt; Put in 4 =\r\nhours and just came up with a list of things:\n&gt; http://shinsengumihq.livejo=\r\nurnal.com/37668.html\n&gt;\n&gt; The evolution of SHQ over the past 4 years was\n&gt; s=\r\nimple html &gt; html with frames &gt; html with no frames but everything\n&gt; looked=\r\n much better and organized &gt; content management system (I\n&gt; was happy until=\r\n the obliteration of the critical file) &gt; Wordpress\n(present\n&gt; state)\n&gt;\n&gt; e=\r\nach evolution was not simply &quot;cut and paste&quot; code either...it&#39;s all\nhand\n&gt; =\r\ndone page by page (*_*)\n&gt;\n&gt; The difficulty lies in the fact that SHQ had to=\r\nns of text and some\npages\n&gt; with text and images and some pages with just i=\r\nmages.  As someone\n&gt; with absolutely no tech background prior to working on=\r\n this--- all\nthis\n&gt; has been a real pain for me over the years as I split t=\r\nime between\n&gt; research and then trying to figure out how to put it all onli=\r\nne.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sneak Peak: http://shinsengumihq.com/shq/\n&gt; I practiced working wit=\r\nh Wordpress on other blogs recently and\n&gt; everything is cool...until I mess=\r\ned with this particular template.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
