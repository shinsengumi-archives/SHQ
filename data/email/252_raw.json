Maybe if interest in the Shinsengumi continues=\r\n to grow someone will look into restoring & subtitling it.\n \nI know there a=\r\nre various ways of trying to bring films to the attention of conservation p=\r\nrograms here in the US, but I don&#39;t know how much foreign film they&#39;re inte=\r\nrested in (oh, they&#39;re interested, but the process is so labor & cost inten=\r\nsive that American film can often take precedence.)  Any ideas on who in Ja=\r\npan is working on preservation of Japanese film that one might contact to s=\r\nuggest a film like this receiving attention?  (In fact, it&#39;s something that=\r\n would be good for a group... say like ours... to petition for preservation=\r\n.)\n \nphil (who now *really* wishes she could see this film)\n\nKevin Closson =\r\n&lt;k_closson2001@...&gt; wrote:\nChiezo Kataoka is in the lead role as Kond=\r\no in this\nmovie.
