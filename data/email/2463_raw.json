Secretary may have more up to date information about what they were doing to restore boards, but I think they&#39;ve done all they could with back-ups that weren&#39;t damaged.  In trying to better safeguard the system and repair it, I think they did some additional damage, too.\n \nCool idea with the reviews.  Best place to send them is to this list, SHQ.  The Spy Division is more for member and other fan fiction and art.  ^_^\n \nphil\n\nniwashi_1 &lt;labaker@...&gt; wrote:\nI found the Shinsengumi Headquarters message board\nhttp://p076.ezboard.com/bshinsengumiheadquarters\nnot too long ago - just long enough to see that it had a bunch of \ninteresting stuff posted there.  Unfortunately, before I had time to \ngo through and read all that interesting stuff, it started \ndisappearing.  At first it was just some of the posts missing, then \nall of the posts and many of the forums disappeared.\n\nWhat&#39;s going on???  And is it going to get fixed?\n\n\nOn a marginally related note, I recently bought the first volume of \neach of several different Shinsengumi manga.  I was thinking of \nwriting up a little first-impression mini-review of each of them and \nposting it on the messageboard (if it were still there).  I guess I&#39;ll \npost to the Yahoo group instead (although I generally like message \nboards better than e-mail lists).  Is the SHQ group or the \nSHQ_Spy_Division group the better one to send reviews to?\n\n\nNiwashi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
