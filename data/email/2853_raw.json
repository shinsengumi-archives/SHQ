(Kikuchi, p. 26) \n\nI&#39;=\r\nm sorry, but I have to respectfully disagree. The record of Okita\nRintaro a=\r\ns [adopted] son of Okita Katsujiro *is* a fact, recorded in a\nsource relate=\r\nd to the Shinchogumi, compiled *during* the Bakumatsu,\nwhich Kikuchi lists.=\r\n It wasn&#39;t raised as part of explaining why Soji\nis listed as the &quot;second s=\r\non&quot;, it was merely confirming how Rintaro\nMototsune/Fusamasa was listed in =\r\nShinchogumi records. Kikuchi\ntheorizes later, but this much, with regards t=\r\no Rintaro being\nKatsujiro&#39;s &quot;son&quot;, is a fact which Kikuchi cites as coming =\r\nfrom the\nrecord of &quot;Shinchogumi Meisaishosocho&quot;, from 1865.\n\nAs always, tha=\r\nnk you for your interaction, and for bringing activity\nback into this group=\r\n.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
