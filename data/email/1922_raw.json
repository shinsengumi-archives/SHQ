More likely someone from the \nKojima family in Tama.  Anyone know?  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Or maybe he&#39;s made up and they blended &quot;Kojima SHIrou,&quot; &quot;KANO \nSozaburou&quot; and &quot;Sagara SanoSUKE.&quot;  :-D  Now there&#39;s a frightening \ncombination to contemplate.\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n\n\nKojima Shikanosuke is the leading farmer of Onoji village, and is \nthe sponsor of Tennen Rishin Ryuu. \nAnd he was Hijikata&#39;s distant relative. \n(They are not blood relation. The Hashimoto families which are \nHijikata&#39;s grandmother&#39;s parents&#39; home were Kojima and a relative.) \nKojima Shikanosuke was a farmer and a scholar. \nThere were many books in his house. \nKondou and Hijikata borrowed and studied the book from him. \nTheir thought has the large influence from Kojima.\nAfter becoming Meiji Era, Kojima collected the data about \nShinsengumi. \nThey are preserved carefully and are in the Kojima data hall which \nhis posterity manages now. \n\nhttp://www.ceres.dti.ne.jp/~kojishir/\n\nMoreover, he edited a book called &quot;Ryoyuuden&quot;, in order to restore \nthe honor of Kondou and Hijikata. \n\n\n&quot;Kojima&quot; is the family name which many people have.^^ \n\nmomoiro-usagi\n\n\n\n\n\n"
