I want to read more editions of the old newspapers...\nAs for addictions, sister&#39;s ghosts are far worse than soba AND cigarrette together... *sighs*\n(talking of which, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fate, or a fixation of dark angsty guys with complicated sibling relationships, but as you can guess by what I said, my fav. PMK character is Yamazaki Susumu...)\n\n&gt;*Sigh* the raw version came out last night and as far as I know that&#39;s \nthe end of that. However iI don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t give us a couple \nextra  movies---but please Dear Kami don&#39;t let it be anything like the \ndreaded RK Seishounen (sp?)&gt;\n\nSo it&#39;s true... *wails louder than before* \nNow, I totally agree with you concerning PMK movies, but I think they know better than to play on us some dirty trick in Seissou Hen style. They know that they risk to be promptly Aku-Soku-Zan-ed on sight if they dare. &gt;.&lt;\n\nThanks for the tips, I&#39;ll try to google during the weekend (free of daughter&#39;s school YEAH!)\nand concerning that undercover assignments...................... Hehe... I guess Hijikata -sama would be almost as happy as when his haikus were stolen... But Okita looks possitively, absolutely gorgeous... \n\nNow about that Ishin Shishi undercover... red on red..., mmm... too flashy? maybe if he tries magenta next time... He should ask advice to Okita-sama.
