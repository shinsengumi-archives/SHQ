As long as they maintained \ntheir distance from each other they were probably alright. But if \nthey started contacting each other and the Meiji government took an \ninterest? They might have been afraid someone would be like &quot;Oh no! \nThose Shinsengumi guys are gathering together again! We&#39;d better take \ncare of them permanently!&quot; \n\nThe other real possibility is that Nagakura might have had issues \nwith Saito going to work for the Meiji government. He might have been \nlike &quot;How can you work for the people who killed Kondo and \nHijikata?!&quot; \n\nJust a thought..\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n\n"
