Yes, it is\ninconvenient for Hijikata if Saitou stays in his room.\nI think this is as the webmistress for 1to5.net says the perfect set\nup for the Itou Affair.  When Saitou separates from the Shinsengumi,\nItou will think &quot;ofcourse Saitou separates from the Shinsengumi he was\npunished by them!&quot;  Sacrifice a rule or break a rule, to catch big\nfish...Itou. Poor Nagakura.\nsecretarytocapt3 thinks &quot;kinshin&quot; = vacation for Saitou\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, ktamae@a... wrote:\n&gt; I post here more info about a topics which roused your interest\nduring last \n&gt; chat.\n&gt; As I have no books here , I can put only the things I found on the\nweb now.\n&gt; Ito, Nagakura and Saito&#39;s Kinshin affair is mentioned here,\n&gt; http://www.1to5.net/saito/history/sumiya.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess you know already this site, still I add few explanations,\nIto stayed \n&gt; in Kondo&#39;s room and Saito in Hijikata&#39;s room until the final\nsentence of \n&gt; Kinshin was given. So Saito didn&#39;t stayed all along during his real\nkinshin times, \n&gt; in Hijikata&#39;s room. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevetherless, webmistress wonders also, why it was Saito who stayed\nwith \n&gt; Hijikata instead of Nagakura, and she gave her own supposition;\n[Hijikata gave \n&gt; Saito a mission to approach Ito as a spy before this affair.Only,\nSaito went a \n&gt; little bit too far, and Hijikata was displeased about it. But Saito\nwho knew \n&gt; Hijikata would never really punish him, could laugh about it.\n&gt; Probably, Hijikata heard Saito&#39;s report, though grunted.]\n&gt; \n&gt; I put also the definition of &quot;Kinshin&quot;.\n&gt; &quot;One of the punishments with which the person of the status more\nthan Samurai \n&gt; was sentenced at the Edo period. The place in which concerned person\nlives \n&gt; was appointed, the entrance was closed, and free action was not\nallowed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I think, NHK drama would show this episode too(and I hope so. I want\nto see \n&gt; this epispde with these actors!), as I constate some tendency of the \n&gt; scriptwriter up till now.\n&gt; I&#39;ll post about Sano&#39;s legend and Matsubara affair later.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tama\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
