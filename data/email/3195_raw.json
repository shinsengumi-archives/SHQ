Even in our modern era polling is \nunreliable and manipulated =\r\nto get people on a &quot;bandwagon&quot;.\n\nFor instance, Fukuchi Genichiro was able t=\r\no print some of his \narguably pro-bakufu opinions (Fukuchi later was a Meij=\r\ni newspaper \neditor and became pro-Meiji government due to the desire to se=\r\nek \nstability in Japan).  We do not know if his pro-bakufu stance during \nt=\r\nhe Bakumatsu years were popular or not.\n\nThe truth is the people in Kyoto o=\r\nr any situation will have a hard \ntime expressing themselves because they w=\r\nill side with whichever side \ncan bring stability and peace---at any cost. =\r\n \n\nPerhaps the question can be answered with how people interpreted the \nev=\r\nents of  Kinmon no Hen (1864) during which many pro-bakufu domains \nclashed=\r\n with Choshu forces.  Was this viewed as an attempt BY Choshu \nto aggressiv=\r\nely retake political power in Kyoto? OR was this viewed \nby many as Aizu&#39;s =\r\nattempt to suppress another domain.  We must ask \nChoshu experts to explain=\r\n details to us.\n\nRekishi Dokuhon is a magazine type publication with a mixe=\r\nd \nreputation however one can be clever and see if the information \nprinted=\r\n can be confirmed with OTHER sources.  We also have to keep in \nmind that p=\r\nublishing in general is difficult and that some \nresearchers may find it ea=\r\nsier to get things recorded in \nRekishi...than in other books.  For example=\r\n let&#39;s imagine a \nresearcher without mainstream credentials like for instan=\r\nce a PHd in \nhistory with a specialization in Japan---an &quot;amateur&quot; research=\r\ner may \nhave found something VERY valuable but may have to publish in Rekis=\r\nhi \nDokuhon due to the simple circumstance of lack of credentials but \nmore=\r\n likley due to the fact that it is just hard to get published.  I \nthink th=\r\nat we as fans must judge on a case to case basis.  \nwww.shinsengumihq.com f=\r\nor instance has had to cite Rekishi Dokuhon. \nThings such as rare Shinsengu=\r\nmi photos have even appeared in \nRekishi....  We also have to keep in mind =\r\nthat many books (not just \nthe history magazine Rekishi...) on the shinseng=\r\numi were written in a \nnon-academic tone with dubious citation and the info=\r\nrmation therefore \nat times is unreliable as well.  So Rekishi is not the o=\r\nnly problem.\n\nHere is some pro-Aizu information:\n\n[May 27,1868]\n&quot;Go in, Aid=\r\nzu, say we all of us.  Everyone is an Aidzu man now.&quot; \n(Boyer 49)\n\nwho is &quot;=\r\nwe&quot; ???... we were Americans who were sympathetic towards the \nNORTH as the=\r\n editor, Barnes, noted.\n---------------------\n[May 29, 1868]\n&quot;The coolies a=\r\nll yell for Aizu---say he is No.1.  The other day they \nyelled as loud for =\r\nSatsuma.  Now Satsuma is no good;  Aidzu is the \ncoming man.&quot; (Boyer 50)\n\ns=\r\no here we have coolies--***normal folks shifting their opinion based \non th=\r\ne tide of armed conflict\n---------------------\n[June 15, 1868]\n&quot;The latest =\r\ninformation from the seat of war is that the tycoon has \nbeen reinstated as=\r\n Executive Officer of all Japan by the Mikado.  So \nmuch for the gallant fi=\r\nghting of Aidzu.  I hope Aidzu will be \nrewarded by the tycoon.  Wonder wha=\r\nt old Satsuma will do now.  His \nreign has been of short duration.&quot; (Boyer =\r\n56)\n \nHere as the editor and as we all know is simply innaccurate \ninformat=\r\nion recorded by Boyer in his diary.  Perhaps the value of \nthis shred of de=\r\ntail is that he accepts the information he heard \nbecause HE IS HIMSELF ver=\r\ny sympathetic towards Aizu.\n\nThus, it is truly impossible to gauge whose si=\r\nde the normal folks or \npeasantry sided with.  As Shinsengumi fans we shoul=\r\nd note that our \nboys are favored and then villified depending on the polit=\r\nical \nclimate both during and after the Bakumatsu as well.  During the age =\r\n\nof feudalism the opinion of the man of the street did not &quot;count&quot;.  \nThe M=\r\neiji era was no better---the state CRUSHED dissent ruthlessly \nand muzzled =\r\nthe media effectively (literally no different from the \nTokugawa). In our p=\r\nresent day world we value popular opinion.  \nTherefore to say &quot;whose side w=\r\nas the people on&quot; is a very modern view \nthat is hard to determine in that =\r\nera.\n\nSource:\nBoyer, Dr. Samuel Pellman (edited by Elinor and James A. Barn=\r\nes).  \nNAVAL SURGEON REVOLT IN JAPAN 1868-1869. Bloomington, Indiana \nUnive=\r\nrsity Press, 1963.\n\n--- In SHQ@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Seven&quot; &lt;nlf7@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; It&#39;s always been my understanding that during the Bakumatsu, people \nin =\r\nKyoto were \n&gt; generally pro-Choshu. I&#39;ve recently gotten into an argument w=\r\nith \nsomebody who insisted \n&gt; that it wasn&#39;t the case.  In order to settle =\r\nit, I asked Shikisoku \nfor some citations (since my \n&gt; bookshelf collapsed =\r\nthe other day and all my history books are in \nboxes \n&gt; now.)Unfortunately,=\r\n that someone said Rekishi Dokuhon wasn&#39;t good \nenough to be used \n&gt; as a s=\r\nource (not to mention website sources.) Could someone here \nhelp me and pro=\r\nvide \n&gt; book citations?  I&#39;d really appreciate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Seven\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
