From what I understand, not all of Hijikata&#39;s guilt over Kondo&#39;s fate was based on his friend being captured while the rest of them escaped. Some of it seems to have come  from the fact that he was unable to stop the execution. He went to Edo under the name &quot;Hayato Naito&quot; to appeal for Kondo&#39;s rescue. Who did he appeal to? The obvious choice would be Matsudaira. \n\nI doubt that Matsudaira&#39;s decision not to do anything would have been based on trying to secure others a better position. At that point he must have realized he was on shaky ground himself. This is about the time he went back to Aizu and began making appeals for a lenient decision against his domain if I&#39;m not mistaken. He had power still, but he also knew it was only a matter of time before the new government passed judgement on him. Probably he didn&#39;t attempt to stop Kondo&#39;s execution because such an action might have made him look guilty to the few sympathetic eyes out there. People would have been like &quot;So! Still trying to throw your weight around, are you?!&quot; It was better to stay silent and comply with the new government&#39;s decisions. At least until they started to hit home...\n\nI can easily see elements of the Choshu group wanting to snatch up Kondo for a new police force however. This would have been great for them for a number of reasons. For one thing, a former Bakufu supporter leading THEIR police force? That might have convinced others (like Hijikata) that it was pointless to continue fighting. It would also have halted some of the hositlities by showing that their enemies would be treated fairly. And they already knew from experience the man&#39;s capabilities. On the conspiracy note, one might specutlate that by advocating him they were hoping to curb some of Satsuma&#39;s influence in the new administration. However Satsuma was out to grab as much personal power as possible and, as a former enemy of the new government, any argument in Kondo&#39;s favor was doomed from the start.\n\n\n-MissBehavin (Still believes the Babelfish was an Ishin conspiracy...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
