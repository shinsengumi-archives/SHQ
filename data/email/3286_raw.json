It&#39;s in all the movies,\nafter a=\r\nll-- Okita and Kondou burst in, Choshu man comes down the\nstairs, Kondou go=\r\nes up the stairs, dead Choshu man rolls down, and so\non. We also think we k=\r\nnow the leadup-- Furutaka Shuntaro, posing as a\nmerchant, gets taken in, to=\r\nrtured, and confesses.\n\nHere&#39;s some things from Oishi Manabu&#39;s book &quot;Shinse=\r\nngumi&quot;-- where he\nmakes use of primary sources to put together a composite =\r\npicture of\nthe event. Some of the information contradicts itself, but by pu=\r\ntting\ntogether a multitude of sources, a general idea about what happened\nc=\r\nan be acquired.\n\nBut I&#39;d like to talk about the Choshu men&#39;s plans. Their i=\r\nntent, as is\nknown to those who have seen the movies or read manga like Rur=\r\nouni\nKenshin, was to set fire to the city, kill Matsudaira Katamori (the\nlo=\r\nrd of Aizu and the Shinsengumi&#39;s boss), and kidnap the Emperor and\nrush bac=\r\nk to Hagi, Choshu&#39;s capital.\n\nHowever, in the items confiscated after the S=\r\nhinsengumi raid which\ntook in Furutaka, many secret documents were uncovere=\r\nd (Oishi p. 105).\nAccording to these documents, their plan was to wait for =\r\nthe Gion\nFestival (where many people would crowd the streets), dress as AIZ=\r\nU\nMEN (they even had lanterns with the Aizu crest for this), and wait\nfor s=\r\ntrong wind and set fire to the imperial palace. They would kidnap\n the Empe=\r\nror, kill Nakagawa-no-miya Asahiko (the prince who was\nsympathetic to Aizu =\r\nand Satsuma at the time) and Matsudaira Katamori\n(who were due for an appea=\r\nrance at the palace), and then take the\nEmperor and flee to Hagi, the Chosh=\r\nu capital. (Oishi, 104)\n\nI&#39;d like to reiterate that point-- they intended t=\r\no masquerade as AIZU\nmen and do this. By doing so, they would not only dest=\r\nroy Aizu&#39;s\ncredibility as protectors of the peace in Kyoto, but it would al=\r\nso be\nvery easy for the fire to spread from the palace, to the surrounding\n=\r\nnobles&#39; houses, to the city at large. And by masquerading as Aizu men,\nthey=\r\n would be able to go about the city at will, without being questioned.\n\nFur=\r\nthermore, the whole plan was Choshu&#39;s attempt at revenge for their\nloss to =\r\nAizu in 1863.(Oishi, 104)\n\nIf that were to happen to Aizu, Shinsengumi woul=\r\nd have also suffered,\nbecause they depended on Aizu for their entire liveli=\r\nhood.\n\nHowever, Shinsengumi, as Aizu&#39;s &quot;dirty&quot; tool, struck hard and fast a=\r\nnd\ndefused the plot in the carnage at Ikedaya.\n\nNo one can deny that Ikeday=\r\na was a bloodbath. However, it is critical\nthat its antecedents and backgro=\r\nund be closely examined, as well.\n\n-M.\n\n\n"
