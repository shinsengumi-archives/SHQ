<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Japan was
in a state of internal political turmoil and external pressure from foreign
powers in the mid-nineteenth century. For centuries the Shogun ruled and the
Emperor was a figurehead. The political system was about to change.<br>
<br>
The story of the Shinsengumi began in 1863 when most of their members joined a
group known as the Roushitai which travelled to Kyoto, the capital, to lend
their allegiance to the Shogunate. However, after the leader of the Roushitai
revealed his true intent to have the Roushitai shun the Shogun and support the
Emperor a group of men left.<br>
<br>
After gaining the sponsorship of the Aizu domain, on August 18, 1863 the group
adopted the name &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; (New Selection Group). The first chief
of the Shinsengumi, Serizawa Kamo was killed by his own men. Now, under the
leadership of Kondou Isami, a dojo owner and teacher of swordsmanship from Tama
(rural Edo or present day Tokyo) and his friend Hijikata Toshizo his vice
chief, the group reorganized and patrolled the city to eradicate anti-shogunate
forces. <br>
<br>
The Shinsengumi's most well known activity was the raid on Ikedaya Inn on June
5, 1864 where many revolutionaries who planned to overthrow the Shogun, burn
the capital and abduct the Emperor were apprehended or killed. <br>
<br>
The security force was threatened by internal factionalism in the Itou Affair
of 1867 when a group of men left. They were later eliminated.<br>
<br>
By 1868, the Shogunate engaged in open armed conflict with the Imperialist
faction consisting of Satsuma, Choshu and Tosa domains. The Shinsengumi <b>became</b>
part of the Shogun's army and fought at Toba and Fushimi (located outside of
Kyoto), Nagarayema where Kondou Isami was arrested and beheaded, Aizu and <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â </span>finally Hakodate (Hokkaido Island) in 1869
where Hijikata Toshizo was killed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
Though of humble origin as masterless samurai, farmers, or merchants, they made
a name for themselves equal to any warrior in Japanese history. Because they
fought on the losing side of the Boshin War, they were then villified, but
thanks to popular depictions, they are being rediscovered today. <br>
<br>
Thus, to understand the significance of this small group of men it is necessary
to appreciate fiction but study the complex history as carefully as possible.</span></p>
