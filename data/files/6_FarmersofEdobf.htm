        of the Shinsengumi in the context of their role as a security force in
        Kyoto sanctioned by the Aizu domain. Rarely, in English, will you come
        across these individuals in connection to their more humble beginnings
        in rural Edo. The Shinsengumi, may forever be connected to the preservation
        of the feudal order and the legacy of the samurai. However, their very
        origins were unique because they were part of the peasant tapestry which
        entered into the samurai class. One may even consider their upward social
        movement to be subversive and to some extent "revolutionary" in itself.</font></p>

        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&quot;Tokugawa
        writers, most of them warriors, evinced the keen interest they did in
        the &quot;</em><strong>gono</strong><em>,&quot; as wealthy peasants were
        called. Fascinated by this new social phenomenon, they rightly regarded
        it as a threat to their way of life...in numerous ways wealthy peasants
        were taking on the social characteristics of the warrior class. The most
        important distinction between the warrior and the peasant was that only
        the warrior had the right to bear a surname and to wear a sword; swords
        particularly were forbidden to peasants on the pain of severest punishment...By
        the early nineteenth century, however, both the Shogunate and baronial
        governments as a financial measure were resorting to the sale of the right
        to both arms and names---the sale above all to wealthy peasants...From
        at least the early Tokugawa period the upper stratum of peasants had been
        literate, but by the last century of the period the literacy of wealthy
        peasants in many cases went far beyond its former utilitarian limits.
        Peasants began to cultivate the fine arts and invade the field of scholarship
        and speculative thought, all previously the special province of warriors
        and the city rich.&quot; </em><strong>(Smith 176-177) </strong></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&quot;Of the various
        arts that wealthy peasants cultivated in the late Tokugawa period---such
        as poetry, painting, calligraphy---the military arts were the least proper
        of all to their class. Buyo Inshi wrote that wealthy peasants &quot;...keep
        masterless warriors around them and study military arts unsuitable to
        their status; they take teachers...and study the Japanese and Chinese
        styles of writing and painting.&quot; (43)...&quot;We hear that in recent
        times peasants have retained masterless samurai and study military arts
        from them, and that peasants of like mind band together for practice.&quot;
        (44) At least one peasant's diary also mentions such groups practicing---with
        guns, too!(45)&quot;...&quot;...In recent years many peasants have studied
        under samurai and masterless warriors who go about the country...teaching
        swordsmanship.&quot; (46)&quot; </em><strong>(Smith 178-179)</strong></font>

        were afraid of being attacked. Kojima distributed rice to prevent local

        family who ruled Onoji Village) for aiding the enemy and refusing to contribute
        money to the Imperial War coffers. The Imperial Army had demanded that

        supply packhorses. Local leaders had pleaded with the new army and <em>&#8220;asked
