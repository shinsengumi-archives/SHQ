Its of RK SAitou reclining influenced ofcourse by our\nfavorite scene of Kenshin and Misao imagining Tokio to be Kannon, the\ngoddess of mercy.  My fanart also has a cat based on Angrybee&#39;s ff.net\nstory Hajime & Tokio, and the current RPG at\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/community/miburo_lair\nWe all associate the Shinsengumi with wolves and stuff but I was just\nimagining RK Saitou with a cat and I found it to be very sexy.  \n\nBefore you take a look at the pic imagine yourself to be Tokio...\nit was a long day at working teaching young ladies, doing\nadministrative office stuff.  You come home with a list of things to\ndo, make dinner, bring in the laundry, pick up the kids, take care of\nthe kids...and feed the cat...&quot;where is the cat?&quot; you wonder.  Then\nyou here the faint sound of a bottle knocked over in the other room...\nyou open the shoji and....well...so much for the quiet and peaceful\nnight at home....\n\nTiffany/secretarytocapt3\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumidb.com\n\n\n\n"
