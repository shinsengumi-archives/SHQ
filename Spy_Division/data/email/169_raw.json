I just finished reading your fic (the \n&gt;first PMK fic I ever read and it was wonderful)&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nThank you *blush* It was pretty good considering I wrote it only a few \nepisodes in to the series.\n\n&gt; and I think Saitou \n&gt;was a better choice than Hijikata. First I don&#39;t think the PMK \n&gt;Hijikata would really do/say what Saitou did in your story.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nSee that&#39;s the beauty of the H/A pairing (which I wish I would have \nconsidered sooner)---we know that Hijikata had a hidden &quot;soft side&quot; and \nthat&#39;s the thing that would ultimately make him behave very much like my \nversion of Saitou did.\n\n&gt; Second \n&gt;because if you used Hijikata, we will not hear of Ayunee&#39;s mother \n&gt;which I think was a good inclusion. &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nConsidering Saitou&#39;s abilities in the 6th sense area and knowing how \nmothers are it seemed natural\n\n&gt;Third because wasn&#39;t Hijikata in \n&gt;real life a playboy?&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nOnce again that&#39;s why it would be so cool to use Hijikata. No one would \nexpect it and yet after seeing the whole series it now makes perfect \nsense. with the same or similar  plot\n\n&gt; Fourth (and this might not be important), I LOVE \n&gt;ALL INCARNATIONS OF SAITOU-SAMA.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nAs we all do!!! I have a serious thing going for the live action \nversions lately. *grin*\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
