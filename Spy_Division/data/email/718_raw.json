Theirs was a very unique relationship, =\r\nnot the \n&gt; fluffy kind or the shy type. It was a nice breath of fresh air i=\r\nn \nmy \n&gt; opinion. It was funny how they understood each other and showed it=\r\n \n&gt; in not so -normal- ways. I mean who says she doesn&#39;t know what \nwill \n&gt;=\r\n happen to her after she dies? And her knight in shining armor \ncomes \n&gt; al=\r\nong and says join me. LOL! While I re-watched that I got \n&gt; goosebumps.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Oh Sec... Saitou was there overhearing the conversation. I&#39;m not \n&gt; sure =\r\nif it&#39;s just me but... I have this nagging feeling that SK \nwas \n&gt; saying t=\r\nhat not only for Oume but for Saitou to hear it (hopefully \n&gt; to fulfil tha=\r\nt wish)? Wasn&#39;t it at that point that SK already knew \n&gt; he would be dying =\r\nsoon, which is why he was so open to Oume about \n&gt; it?
