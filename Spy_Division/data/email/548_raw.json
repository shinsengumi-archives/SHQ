When you post to the list, \nformatting will usually be lost.  Saving your story or poem as an html \ndocument enables you to format a story the way you want and have it be \nseen that way. Just keep readability in mind when you get enthusiastic \nwith color and fonts.  J  (In MSWord, to save a document in html format, \nyou can either choose the &quot;Save as&quot; feature under File and choose &quot;web \npage&quot; in the drop down menu OR again under File, click on &quot;Save as web \ndocument.&quot;  Those of us accustomed to uploading stories on ff.net should \nbe aware that uploading to the yahoo list site keeps formatting exactly \nas you save it, unlike ff.net which puts lines in after returns.  It&#39;s \nbeen ages since I&#39;ve worked with WordPerfect, so I don&#39;t know how it \nworks, but I imagine it&#39;s similar.  Send a query to the list for help if \nyou need to.)\n\n \n\nIf the story or poem is being posted to the list, in the subject line, \nplease provide the following FIC: &lt;title&gt;, &lt;source material&gt;, &lt;character \nor pairing&gt;, &lt;rating&gt;\n\n \n\nAs an example, using one of my Rurouni Kenshin stories:  FIC: Kitaku, \nRK, SaitouxSano, R\n\n \n\nYou can use semi-colons to separate the information or put non-title \ninformation within parentheses, etc., but include the information so \nothers can see at a glance if it is something they&#39;re interested in.  \nWith so much potential diversity of characters, situations, and source \nmaterials, it&#39;s only common courtesy.\n\n \n\nPlease include the following header when posting a story to the list or \nuploading it to the File folder.  I know it&#39;s a pain, but it allows \nreaders the choice of what they want to read and what they want to \navoid, as well as quick access to author information, permission to \narchive on the website, and a disclaimer to protect yourself.  Stories \nthat are posted without the header will be deleted.  Forgetfulness \nhappens --- don&#39;t take it personally.  Just repost it with the header.  \n(Or just send a message that, ACK! you forgot the header and correct it \non the upload in Files.) If the story contains multiple parts or \nchapters, you can either repost the header each time or at the very \nleast repost the disclaimer.  If information should change (such as the \nstory has suddenly jumped from PG to R), please repost a new header when \nyou realize information in the original header has changed.  If you have \nany questions, feel free to contact me, spiritus_saitou@... \n&lt;mailto:spiritus_saitou@...&gt; .\n\n \n\n*Title*:\n\n*Author*:\n\n*E-mail*:\n\n*Source*: (original, RK, PMK, Mibugishiden, etc.)\n\n*Main character(s*): (Shinsengumi, Okita, SaitouxTokio, Kondou & \nHijikata, just give us an idea of who we&#39;re going to read about)\n\n*Archived on the website:  *(Is it okay to archive it on the SHQ \nwebsite, yes or no)\n\n*General Rating*:  (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17... I know it&#39;s hard to \nestimate, but a general idea helps)\n\n*Warning*:  (M/M, F/M, F/F sexual situations, graphic violence, strong \nlanguage, rape... anything you think might be disturbing)\n\n*Disclaimer*:  (If you are using characterizations drawn from a \ncopyrighted source (such as anime, manga, film, books), you must \nacknowledge you do not hold the copyright.  If your story is based on an \noriginal idea with original characters, give yourself at least a little \nprotection from potential plagiarism by stating you own the rights to \nyour original ideas and characters.)\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
