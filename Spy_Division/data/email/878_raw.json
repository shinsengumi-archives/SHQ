(^_^)\nPart 3 is being polished right now.  Kyoto-Twilight (K-l=\r\night) will really be \nsome major themes of Japanese history placed in a ble=\r\nnder and \nelectrified---so it goes a bit beyond the Bakumatsu.  Many charas=\r\n may \nhave to be combined.  For example, Hijikata and Kondou obviously have=\r\n \nbeen made into one person and he has a bit of a Serizawa streak too.  \nBe=\r\ncause we want to share the story with the list the yaoi scenes can&#39;t be \nan=\r\ny more than innuendo.  The other creator may add touches of yuri in \nhis ch=\r\napters too without anything graphic (^_^) .\n\nA few months ago I designed a =\r\ntemplate for Kyoto Twilight and once we \nwrite up some more chapters we&#39;ll =\r\narchive it all at a site and place a link \nover at www.shinsengumihq.com\n\nC=\r\nurrently, SHQ has a link to a yaoi site featuring Saitou and other \nShinsen=\r\ngumi  for http://kikue-mugen.com/  (age verification necessary)\nthe site ha=\r\ns archived a very very long fanfic called Gojou and an original \nnovel Gojo=\r\nu Hajime will be released later.\n\n\n"
