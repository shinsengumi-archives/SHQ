I mean I \ngrouped yaoi stories PG-R together and then a separate yaoi NC17. Do \nyou think I should have a separate rating for each yaoi and not group \nthem?\n \nAlso another issue I&#39;m having is the characters... Basically since I \nwant it to be a Shinsengumi site, the most popular (or at least I \nthink they&#39;re popular) miburo members are there and I grouped all the \nRK characters together in &quot;other RK&quot;. There is no specifics as to \nKenshin, Kauro, Sano, Aoshi etc... I was thinking of adding \na &quot;Harada&quot;/&quot;Sanosuke&quot; but someone commented that it was probably not \na good idea as they should not be confused. *sigh*\n \nSo basically if you wanted to find a SaitouxSano story or Saitou x \nmale for the matter you just have to settle for filtering for Saitou \nand Yaoi. Does anyone have any suggestions. There are a number of \nYaoi stories now on the site but it&#39;s fine if I have to go and change \nthem.\n\nPlease take a look at how the site is presented in the details \nsection and the search/add functions... I need input right away... \nIt&#39;s growing  (101 fanfics plus a bunch more that I have permission \nto add but not there yet) but if I&#39;m making changes I have to do it \nnow before I put in another folder of authors in there.... \n\nYou can place your comments here OR in the &quot;contributors page&quot; in DB \nhttp://www.shinsengumidb.com \n\nOnce this is done... I plan to work on the fan-art and musicvids... \nThen back to the commercial section (which really NEEDS a lot of \nwork).\n\nMinna... Thanks for all your help...\n\n----------\nSec, I have not made a banner yet... Quite clueless on where to start \nas I am not artistically inclined nor do I know what programs to \nuse...\n\n\n"
