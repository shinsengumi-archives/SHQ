There&#39;s a growing prejudice that print is more reliable than electronic.  The reality is that information in books and print journals has always suffered from errors as well.  As always, the most important thing is the source, regardless of format --- how much do you trust the source.  Older books and articles suffer from being made obsolete by new information, better understanding of  extant evidence (including better translations), and/or hindsight & loss of the prejudice that often comes from contemporaries.  Newer publications suffer from the drop-off in strict editing and peer review routines that used to make scholarly publishing a\n nightmare.  Errors in print become replicated exponentially when they become part of websites, which reach a much larger audience and especially when website maintainers don&#39;t update as information is corrected.  (It&#39;s really a shame, too, that websites aren&#39;t updated because it&#39;s *SO* much easier to correct a website page than a book/article once it&#39;s gone into print publication.)\n \nI should probably have just kept my mouth shut, but as I suffer from the same prejudice (print over electronic), I felt obliged to point out what was pointed out to me by research professors and fellow librarians. Just because it comes from a book doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s correct.  :-D  How frustrating...\n \nphil\n\nTiffany &lt;tnamwong@...&gt; wrote:\nWell, we are trying our best :(\nMany universities have an EAst Asian Studies Library or reading room\nbut ofcourse you have to read the language...this summer I will use\nEnglish language texts to complete a mission for SHQ.\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, sherlgirl &lt;sherlgirl@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The thing that bothers me more now is the overreliance on Internet\nresearch over other works.
