Also, please excuse me for not \nhaving introduced myself earlier, but work has been very busy. \nTiffany aka secretarytocapt3 has been kind enough to invite me to \njoin, and frankly, I am amazed by this group, as well as the SHQ. I \ndo most of my research in Japanese, so I am sorry to say that I did \nnot know about this site until she directed me (my loss), so my \ngratitude to Tiffany. \nAnd to my embarrassment, she has already promoted my work for me, \nand I didn&#39;t realise it until today. Oh dear. Well, she says that I \nhave some readers here, so hello to everyone, and also, why have you \nnot told me about this place before?! \nSo, as she already posted the link, I guess, some of you might know \na bit about me. But just to summarise what you&#39;ll find in the \nAuthor&#39;s notes and such, I&#39;m Japanese, I am quite obsessed with \nSaitou, I work for NHK in DC, and I just wanted to say thank you \nvery much for this wonderful place and letting me join. \nI can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll be a very active member as the drudgery of \nwork continues through the weekend for the media, but I really do \nenjoy people enjoying the Shinsengumi, so I look forward to reading \nall the messages. \n\nBest wishes to all for a lovely weekend, \n\nMio (or misaki-toyodome) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
