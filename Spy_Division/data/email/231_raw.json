HOWEVER, -full- credit will be given to the\nauthor!  \n\nRules are as follows:\n\nSubmissions for episodes can be sent to: mindglue@...\n\n1) The email subject must include the episode number and title. We\nwill not accept submissions by review.\n\n2) The author&#39;s email address, ff.net username, and URL of the\nauthor&#39;s profile must be in the email. These will be included in the\nchapter if your entry is picked to appear as a guest author in\n&quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot;.\n\n3) Poems -must- be sent in .doc or .txt format.\n\n4) There is no guarantee that your poem will be used. Period.\n\n5) Poems may be of any format, from serious to humorous, from haiku to\nDr. Seuss, sonnet to epic Homerian style. However, preference will be\ngiven to humorous poems, as I wish &quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot; to be, overall,\nlighthearted.\n\n6) At this time, we are only looking for poems summarizing episodes\nthrough the end of the Kyoto arc. Feel free to send any episode number\nup to episode 65 at any time. \n\n---------------\nThe first chapter of &quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot; can be found here:\nhttp://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1848493\n\nI hope some of you will consider submitting poems to become guest\npoets!\n\nAngrybee\n\n\n"
