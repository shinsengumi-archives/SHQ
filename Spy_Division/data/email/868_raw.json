Bravo & Encore!  I am envious.  Such writing skills.\n\n\n--- In =\r\nSHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.&quot; &lt;myoe112@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;K-light,&quot; =\r\nhighly experimental piece, AU modern-day Shinsengumi.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here goes.\n&gt;\n&gt; --=\r\n----------\n&gt;\n&gt; Kyoto\n&gt; Kan&#39;bu Era, Year 21\n&gt; The streets of Nishijin were a=\r\n sea of flashing red lights. Mitsujima\n&gt; Atsuo, the famous outspoken, icono=\r\nclastic writer, had finally snapped:\n&gt; arming himself and his handful of st=\r\nudents, he had broken into the\n&gt; estate of a rich silk merchant, and was br=\r\noadcasting a list of demands\n&gt; over the city-wide intranet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Every han=\r\nd held device, laptop, desktop was illuminated by the\n&gt; portrait of the bar=\r\ne chested muscular artist with a bandanna tied\n&gt; around his head. A large t=\r\nwo story flat screen monitor outside the\n&gt; Shimabara pleasure hotel drew cu=\r\nrious crowds to the best-selling\n&gt; authors. Mitsujima&#39;s still eyes gazed in=\r\nto the souls of his audience\n&gt; as he repeated over and over again, &quot;Where i=\r\ns the soul of Japan? Can\n&gt; we let the American States and the other nations=\r\n of the world treat us\n&gt; in such a way? Do not let them plunder our sacred =\r\nland, do not let\n&gt; them trample on our warrior&#39;s spirit! Only the brave can=\r\n follow me\n&gt; into the glorious red sun!&quot; Although the image of Mitsujima wa=\r\ns\n&gt; inanimate it had seemed as if molten lava was swirling in his eyes and\n=\r\n&gt; his usually serene voice was now thick with rage.\n&gt;\n&gt; The police were bar=\r\nely able to keep the public at bay, when an HX-12\n&gt; Wasp, one of the newly =\r\ndeveloped, lithe hover-transport aircraft in\n&gt; the service of the Japanese =\r\nEmpire, landed in the clearing mid-street,\n&gt; behind the police lines. Its p=\r\nlain, serpentine gray fuselage bore the\n&gt; five-petaled hollyhock insignia o=\r\nf the shogun, and on the tail boom,\n&gt; where the service branch would be nam=\r\ned, there was instead one word,\n&gt; which immediately drove the crowd into a =\r\nfrenzy:\n&gt;\n&gt; Shinsengumi.\n&gt;\n&gt; The rear ramp clattered to the pavement with a=\r\n thud as the roar of the\n&gt; engines died down to a whine and then a whisper.=\r\n Heavily armed men in\n&gt; gray Kamirion body armor rushed out, boots pounding=\r\n the blackness of\n&gt; the pavement. From head to toe, they were the pinnacle =\r\nperfection in\n&gt; urban warfare: Kawanishi AR-52 heavy assault rifles, frag a=\r\nnd flash\n&gt; grenades, and Hosoya PP52 9 millimeter pistols with AP\n&gt; (armor-=\r\npiercing) rounds. When twelve men had piled out of the craft,\n&gt; one more fo=\r\nllowed. Unlike the rest of them, whose faces were hidden\n&gt; behind visored m=\r\nasks, he only wore a cheek protector, one of the few\n&gt; hand-me-downs still =\r\npresent and in use from old samurai armor. His\n&gt; eyes were intense, and if =\r\none looked closely, they would be able to\n&gt; see wisps of dark hair poking o=\r\nut from under his tightly-laced helmet.\n&gt; He hefted an AR-52 with a scope t=\r\nhe likes of which even the well-paid\n&gt; and supplied Kyoto Metro Police Depa=\r\nrtment had never seen before.\n&gt; Wanting to seize the moment, Captain Onoder=\r\na, the officer on duty,\n&gt; strode over to the man.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lieutenant Colonel H=\r\nijikata Isamu?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The man turned to Onodera. His voice felt like it belon=\r\nged in the\n&gt; depths of some ancient shrine. It was deep and more piercing t=\r\nhan the\n&gt; highest-velocity cop-killer round.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Reporting as ordered.&quot;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Onodera shivered, then attempted to regain some form of composure.\n&gt; &quot;Eag=\r\ner to see what Aizu&#39;s finest can do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hijikata said nothing. Raising hi=\r\ns gloved left hand, he swept it in a\n&gt; rapid, downward arc, and before Onod=\r\nera had time to blink, the\n&gt; thirteen men were gone.\n&gt;\n&gt; *****\n&gt;\n&gt; Inside t=\r\nhe estate, Mitsujima was already becoming more and more\nshrill.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Where =\r\nthe hell is that damn Aizu Katsumori!&quot; Mitsujima referred, of\n&gt; course, to =\r\nMatsudaira Katsumori, the young governor of Kyoto. A\n&gt; relative newcomer to=\r\n the political scene, the young Lord Matsudaira\n&gt; had soon reestablished or=\r\nder in the murder-prone and disaster-rife\n&gt; Imperial District of Kyoto, and=\r\n this had largely remained the case\n&gt; until Mitsujima&#39;s act of insanity. At=\r\n his booted feet, Kinunoya\n&gt; Zen&#39;emon, the owner of the estate, cowered in =\r\nterror. He had always\n&gt; been a careful man, and one to avoid the tangle of =\r\npolitics, but this\n&gt; was now his problem, in a very real and immediate sens=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If he doesn&#39;t show up IN PERSON in the next hour, you know damn wel=\r\nl\n&gt; what&#39;s going to happen, Kinunoya. And believe me...&quot; he lowered the\n&gt; m=\r\nuzzle of his rifle against the temple of Okatsu, Kinunoya&#39;s bound and\n&gt; gag=\r\nged wife, &quot;It won&#39;t be pretty...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, outside, two of Mitsujima&#39;=\r\ns students paced beside the\n&gt; barred and barricaded gate. They were rather =\r\nyoung and had been easily\n&gt; taken in by their idealistic teacher&#39;s dreams o=\r\nf a grand new order led\n&gt; directly by the emperor himself, but somehow they=\r\n were conflicted\n&gt; about their teacher&#39;s course of action. Lazily, they cha=\r\ntted in hushed\n&gt; tones about girlfriends and literary genres, hardly notici=\r\nng what was\n&gt; fast approaching from behind.\n&gt;\n&gt; ****\n&gt;\n&gt; Hijikata and his m=\r\nen had quickly scaled the estate&#39;s outer walls and\n&gt; with camouflage on, we=\r\nre rapidly advancing through the rock garden.\n&gt; Over the secure neural intr=\r\nanet, Hijikata gave his orders, as quickly\n&gt; and quietly as though he were =\r\nactually speaking.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nakano, go left and take the rear. Set up with your=\r\n grenades and make\n&gt; damn well sure no one gets through that exit alive, ev=\r\nen if that\n&gt; includes you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir!&quot; On the heads-up readout generated by=\r\n his ocular implants,\n&gt; Hijikata could see one blue light flash and then wi=\r\nnk out in\n&gt; acknowledgement.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hirata, you take right flank and get the =\r\nside entrance. When you hear\n&gt; the signal, slash the throat of the bastard =\r\nwho&#39;s there, and from then\n&gt; on do like Nakano and be ready to blow the suc=\r\nkers to Jodo if you have\n&gt; to.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir!&quot; One more light flashed and then =\r\nwinked off. Ten left, Hijikata\n&gt; went faster.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ioki, you&#39;re on left poi=\r\nnt; take your squad and provide overwatch at\n&gt; the main building. Tatsuno, =\r\nyou&#39;re on point with me, we&#39;ll take out\n&gt; these two chickens at the door an=\r\nd then head for the final push on the\n&gt; house together with Ioki&#39;s squad.&quot; =\r\nTen lights flashed and then winked\n&gt; out. &quot;Ready with Phase A now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hij=\r\nikata slung the rifle securely over his back, and tightened the\n&gt; strap. Wi=\r\nth practiced ease, he withdrew two slim, palm-length blades\n&gt; from his wais=\r\nt belt, which, though not connected to his camouflage,\n&gt; were still a very =\r\ndim gray, barely visible in the shadows of the tall\n&gt; bamboo plants by the =\r\nwall. He breathed in, then out. One final time,\n&gt; he checked his chronomete=\r\nr-- 1300 hours Japan Standard time-- then the\n&gt; weather. Gentle breeze, neg=\r\nligible speed. Still, he had to compensate.\n&gt; Barely, just barely, he shift=\r\ned his aim, and as one of the two fools\n&gt; manning the gate bent over to tie=\r\n his ill-fitting boots, Hijikata\n&gt; leapt out, flicking the blades out from =\r\nbetween his fingers; one\n&gt; downward, severing the first man, the other one =\r\ntearing, vertically,\n&gt; between the eyes of the other man, sending him backw=\r\nard in a gurgling\n&gt; mass of deadweight. Continuing the motion of his hand, =\r\nhe swept back\n&gt; to the pistol on his right hip, practically ripping it out =\r\nof its\n&gt; holster as he moved to empty one, then two silenced shots, finishi=\r\nng\n&gt; off the chickens at the gate once and for all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hijikata had no nee=\r\nd to see his men, he could feel them, both over the\n&gt; ocular implants, and =\r\nalso from years of experience with these raids.\n&gt; Reholstering the pistol, =\r\nhe grabbed his rifle. It was almost time. Two\n&gt; lights flashed on his heads=\r\n-up display. Nakano and Hirata were ready.\n&gt;\n&gt; The house was spacious, but =\r\nthrough the scope on his rifle, Hijikata\n&gt; could see through it all; he cou=\r\nld see all the dozen or so men inside\n&gt; the mansion, the four or so hostage=\r\ns; all of it was as plain as day to\n&gt; him. Much as he&#39;d want to take point =\r\nhimself, he had to stay outside\n&gt; and do what he was equipped for: make the=\r\n final call and shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All exits secure. Squad Zero-One, prepare for fr=\r\nontal assault.&quot;\n&gt; *********\n&gt;\n&gt; Inside, Mitsujima was fast losing the last =\r\nvestiges of his patience.\n&gt; &quot;WHERE is Matsudaira Katsumori? What is taking =\r\nhim so long? Can he no\n&gt; longer come out of his office at Kurotani without =\r\nthe help of his\n&gt; concubines? Perhaps we should get a real man to run this =\r\ncity, not\n&gt; some snot-nosed aristocratic brat! Kinunoya, it&#39;s going to be Y=\r\nOUR\n&gt; head on a pike over your OWN door! And as long as I&#39;m at it, I might\n=\r\n&gt; as well make the first underlining of my point-- starting with her!&quot;\n&gt; Th=\r\ne dark muzzle of Mitsujima&#39;s rifle swept toward Okatsu.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s said that =\r\nin times of immense stress, the human body and psyche\n&gt; cooperate in ways t=\r\nhat cannot be predicted, even by the newest, most\n&gt; advanced biotech comput=\r\ners. And that&#39;s precisely what drove Kinunoya,\n&gt; in utter horror, to sudden=\r\nly rise to his feet. At the same instant,\n&gt; the first muffled groans were h=\r\neard, as Hijikata&#39;s men swept closer\n&gt; and closer to that last, innermost r=\r\noom. And then, without even\n&gt; thinking, before the rifle finished its arc, =\r\nKinunoya threw himself\n&gt; onto Mitsujima, which in turn threw Hijikata&#39;s car=\r\nefully calculated\n&gt; surgical strike into disaster.\n&gt;\n&gt; *****\n&gt;\n&gt; Back at th=\r\ne gate, Hijikata was still tensing at the scope of his\n&gt; rifle, waiting for=\r\n a clear shot to take Mitsujima down. Hijikata could\n&gt; clearly make out Mit=\r\nsujima&#39;s figure, distorted through the\n&gt; interference of the walls, but sud=\r\ndenly, one of the other figures rose\n&gt; up and leapt onto Mitsujima. By the =\r\nlook of it, it was none other than\n&gt; Kinunoya, the man that Hijikata was su=\r\npposed to try to save.\n&gt;\n&gt; Take the shot? Don&#39;t take the shot? For a split =\r\nsecond, Hijikata&#39;s\n&gt; conscience about killing an innocent man conflicted wi=\r\nth his lifetime\n&gt; drive to wipe out diseased, garbage-spouting scum like Mi=\r\ntsujima. But\n&gt; only for a moment. Any other man would&#39;ve hesitated longer, =\r\nbut he was\n&gt; not any other man. He was Lieutenant Colonel Hijikata Isamu, C=\r\nommander\n&gt; of the Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi, and if taking out =\r\none\n&gt; innocent man was the price of victory, then so be it.\n&gt;\n&gt; With practi=\r\nced ease, he primed his rifle, took one deep breath, and\nfired.\n&gt;\n&gt; *I&#39;m so=\r\nrry, Kinunoya. May you live forever in Paradise*\n&gt;\n&gt; *Mitsujima, may you be=\r\n flayed alive for ten thousand kalpa in the land\n&gt; of the dead*\n&gt;\n&gt; ****\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Inside, Mitsujima was struggling, trying to free himself of Kinunoya&#39;s\n&gt; =\r\ncrazed, frenzied scratching and clawing. He only felt a burning\n&gt; sensation=\r\n on his left temple for a moment, and then the world went\n&gt; black...\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok=\r\natsu screamed, and at that instant, the door flew off its hinges\n&gt; with a c=\r\nrash, and ten men in dark body armor burst into the room.\n&gt; &quot;Aizu Special A=\r\nttack Force Shinsengumi Squad Zero-One! Surrender or be\n&gt; destroyed without=\r\n mercy!&quot; Mitsujima&#39;s surviving students in the room,\n&gt; still shaken from wa=\r\ntching their master fall in a bloody heap, seemed\n&gt; to slowly crumple, befo=\r\nre retching the meager contents of their\n&gt; starving bowels violently onto t=\r\nhe tatami mats.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ioki directed a text transmission back to Hijikata, at =\r\nthe gate.\n&gt; &quot;Hostages secured minus one, sir.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hijikata received the tr=\r\nansmission and then promptly decloaked. Even\n&gt; at this price, the mission w=\r\nas accomplished. He returned a\n&gt; transmission, this time to all units. &quot;Wel=\r\nl done, team. Gather up the\n&gt; hostages and prisoners, and rally at the fron=\r\nt gate.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Twelve lights blinked and then winked off. Mission accomplishe=\r\nd.\n&gt; *****\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Captain Onodera was still standing by the Wasp, stu=\r\nnned, when\n&gt; the front gate of the estate opened, and out came thirteen men=\r\n, three\n&gt; former hostages, and five prisoners. Before he could ask any\n&gt; qu=\r\nestions, Hijikata did the talking. Handing over the former hostages\n&gt; to On=\r\nodera&#39;s men, he gave a curt nod.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Mitsujima&#39;s dead. Kinunoya got in the=\r\n way of my shot, and while\n&gt; unfortunate, his sacrifice ensured Mishima&#39;s d=\r\nemise. Get your men to\n&gt; clean up the place, Onodera. We&#39;re taking the surv=\r\nivors for\nquestioning.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The twelve men herded their prisoners into the =\r\nWasp just as\n&gt; efficiently as they had emerged from it. Hijikata bowed curt=\r\nly once\n&gt; more, and then joined them within. The dull hum of the engines so=\r\non\n&gt; grew into a whine and then a roar, and Onodera had to cover his ears\n&gt;=\r\n as the aircraft rose straight up into the air, before zooming off\n&gt; southw=\r\nard, no doubt toward the base at Mibu.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Are we ever up shit creek now..=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
