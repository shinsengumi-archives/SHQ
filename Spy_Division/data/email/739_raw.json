I assu=\r\nre you, it wasn&#39;t deliberate. \n  Disclaimer:  First off, I do not own any o=\r\nf the characters except Yoshimura and maybe the plot (What?). This is entir=\r\nely fictional and historical Okita had probably never set his eyes upon the=\r\n legendary blade.\n   \n  Summary: The reasons why 1) Souji was seldom set to=\r\n work as a spy. 2) He was so antagonistic towards Ryouma.  \n   \n  Set in th=\r\ne days before Tetsu=92s arrival. The parts in italics cover the mysterious =\r\ngap in the last chapter of book 5. How exactly did Soujirou make his first =\r\nkill? Words in bold were spoken in English.\n   \n   \n  CHRYSANTHEMUM\n   \n   =\r\n\n  For a while Souji sat playing idly with the dog. He was in a dreamy, sus=\r\npended state of mind, when all at once he saw a man come hurtling down the =\r\nlane towards him on some makeshift cart. Souji jumped to one side. There wa=\r\ns a squealing of brakes, a flurry of kicked up dust and the man collapsed i=\r\nn a pile of legs and spinning wheels on the other side of the lane. His hat=\r\n tumbled off and Souji saw the dreadlocks. \n   \n  =93Ryouma-san!=94 Souji g=\r\naped at him. =93Where are you off to in such a hurry?=94\n   \n  Sakamoto Ryo=\r\numa got to his feet, brushing off dust and grass. =93No time for explanatio=\r\nns, Oki-Boy. Come on. Quick! They are almost here!=94\n   \n  =93Where are we=\r\n going?=94\n   \n  =93I don=92t know. Anywhere. Just away from here. Anywhere=\r\n but here!=94\n   \n  Souji scrambled after him, leaving the resigned dog beh=\r\nind. He laughed. =93Tell me, Ryouma-san, why am I doing this again?=94\n   \n=\r\n  Ryouma looked over his shoulder with a quick grin; he had moved ahead on =\r\nthe path, walking now through waist-high bracken. =93Firstly, there is no l=\r\nove lost between the Shinsengumi and the Mimawarigumi. Secondly, only a dul=\r\nl man would turn down an offer made by me.=94\n   \n  =93I will never know wh=\r\nat exactly you are trying to say, Ryouma-san,=94 Souji said cheerfully. =93=\r\nBut it was nice of you to come, considering.=94\n   \n  =93Oh, well,=94 Ryoum=\r\na shrugged. He seemed about to say something else, but changed his mind, ju=\r\nmping up and running off along the weaving path. =93Come on!=94 \n   \n  They=\r\n careered along in a happy, lunatic chase through the city: over slated roo=\r\nfs, down into dark alleys, in and out of little shops, and quite often, thr=\r\nough the busy streets. They had come a long way from the river and were now=\r\n in a quiet section of the city. Suddenly, Ryouma skidded, tumbling off the=\r\n roof. Thinking he had fallen, Souji went to help but Ryouma grabbed his ar=\r\nm and hauled him into an empty room. \n   \n  =93Well, do you think they have=\r\n given up?=94 Souji said, his face damp with sweat, yukata clinging stickil=\r\ny to his chest.\n   \n  =93Sasaki will not be too happy about that,=94 Ryouma=\r\n said, his eyes twinkling. =93I had a packet of laxative in my pocket, you =\r\nsee, and happened to be passing his troop during their meal break. When the=\r\ny were not looking, I sneaked into the kitchen and stuck half a packet into=\r\n the huge pot of tea and gave it a good stir. And while I was at it I poure=\r\nd some into their food too. You know the way the food is always left unatte=\r\nnded in the kitchen? A mistake: they should keep a closer watch on them.=94=\r\n\n   \n  The tension inside Souji snapped like a breaking spring, and he bega=\r\nn to laugh. Once he had started, it was hard to stop. =93Imagine their face=\r\ns,=94 he gasped, =93when they go tearing off after you and =96 PFFT!=94\n   =\r\n\n  They collapsed in a wild fit of chortling mirth, roaring, tottering, clu=\r\ntching at one another. Ryouma took off his dark glasses and wiped them. =93=\r\nIt is going to make everything worse in the long run, though.=94 \n   \n  =93=\r\nWorth it,=94 Souji said. Controlled again, he gave Ryouma a sideways glance=\r\n. =93But it all seems rather rehearsed, don=92t you think?=94\n   \n  =93It=\r\n=92s a matter of taking calculated risks, really,=94 Ryouma said, putting t=\r\nhe glasses back on and retreating once more into inscrutability. Looking ar=\r\nound, he grinned. =93Prepare to be dazzled.=94 \n   \n  He removed one mat fr=\r\nom the floor of the room and reached into a two-foot opening cut in the boa=\r\nrds under it. When he finally straightened, Souji noticed that he held a lo=\r\nng object wrapped in layers of red silk.\n   \n  =93So that is the katana you=\r\n have been talking about!=94 Souji exclaimed as he bounced on his heels, ba=\r\nrely able to contain his excitement. =93I am dess-err-e-de=85 whatever that=\r\n means. Lemme see it lemmelemmelemme =96 =94\n   \n  =93Hah! Behold the legen=\r\ndary Chrysanthemum blade.=94 Ryouma cried as he unwrapped the last layer wi=\r\nth theatrical flourish.\n   \n  Souji stood and took two swift steps toward h=\r\nim.\n   \n  He was probably half his size but Sakamoto Ryouma, veteran of the=\r\n Kyoto streets and bona fide escape artiste, was startled into retreating. =\r\nFeeling the wall against his back, he covered his embarrassment with a smil=\r\ne and held out the katana with both hands. =93A handsome blade, isn=92t it?=\r\n=94 he offered, trying to defuse whatever emotion was working on the man in=\r\n front of him. =93You=92ve seen it before, I guess?=94\n   \n  Souji backed a=\r\nway and looked at Ryouma for a long moment, as though calculating the other=\r\n man=92s response. The daylight behind his hair lit it up, and the contrast=\r\n hid his expression. If the room had been brighter or if Ryouma had known h=\r\nim better, he might have recognized a freakish solemnity that preceded any =\r\nstatement Souji expected to induce hilarity, or outrage. Souji hesitated an=\r\nd then found the precise phrase he wanted. \n   \n  =93A much touted blade,=\r\n=94 he said agreeably, stepping forward again with a careless smile on his =\r\nlips. He stroked the naked hilt reverently, eyes shut in seeming bliss. =93=\r\nIt would be a shame if we couldn=92t test its keenness. But for that we nee=\r\nd a body.=94\n   \n  =93A real body?=94 Ryouma=92s voice betrayed his alarm. =\r\nHe began to look around the hushed, eerie room, searching out the dark corn=\r\ners into which the sunlight did not penetrate, eyes darting to the nearest =\r\nscreen door. The window was out of question.\n   \n  =93Haven=92t you seen a =\r\ncorpse?=94 The words had come from Okita=92s mouth, but the tone and pitch =\r\nwere suddenly different. And then a slow, incomprehensible smile rose strai=\r\nning to his lips. =93Are you afraid to look at one?=94\n   \n  =93No. But whe=\r\nre would you get such a thing?=94 In fact, he was more frightened by the ma=\r\nn=92s feverish, possessed eyes than by looking at dead bodies. He sensed an=\r\n ominous incompatibility between his grin and those eyes. \n   \n  No. Sakamo=\r\nto Ryouma was not a coward who shrank from challenges. He drew a pistol fro=\r\nm his haori and cocked it.\n   \n   \n  =85 =85\n   \n   \n  His objective was to=\r\n immobilise the mysterious assassin with a deep wound and to let Hijikata-s=\r\nan take him alive. At first, the dwarfish man regarded Soujirou as a mere s=\r\ntripling of nine, but the katana was upon him like a swarm of locusts, and =\r\nafter just ten parries he had been overpowered and stabbed in the leg. Souj=\r\nirou then stabbed him in the upper right arm and before his adversary could=\r\n recover, jumped on his chest and straddled him. He heard a gasp of despair=\r\n and frustration from below. \n   \n  =93We=92re going to take you alive.=94\n=\r\n   \n  When the man heard the words =93take you alive,=94 he began to writhe=\r\n and thrash violently, in spite of his wounds. Soujirou looked around for H=\r\nijikata-san, but the man remained where he had been the past minutes, slump=\r\ned against the rock as if paralysed. Without help, Soujirou could no longer=\r\n hope to take him prisoner. And anyway the desire to feel the sharp blade c=\r\nut through soft flesh was overwhelming. Reluctantly, he pressed the point o=\r\nf his blade against the assasin=92s throat. \n   \n  =93We=92ll take you aliv=\r\ne,=94 Soujirou repeated, his resolve wavering.\n   \n  But the assassin snapp=\r\ned, =93Get on with it, boy!=94\n   \n  The man had not even had time to cry o=\r\nut: his throat was pierced with a single thrust. Soujirou had seen the hatr=\r\ned-filled eyes and the mouth, open and ready to spit and then, an instant l=\r\nater, the face of death, frozen, the features twisted in agony. \n   \n  He p=\r\nulled mindlessly at the protruding blade, but it proved more difficult to r=\r\nemove it neatly from where it had been stuck in the neck bone than it had b=\r\neen to stab a living man. Giving a last heave, he extracted the blade and w=\r\nas mildly surprised by the ensuing fountain of crimson that drenched him.\n =\r\n  \n  The rapture turned to horror; his mind flooded with untold anguish. Fo=\r\nr a time he stood in a daze, pursuing the traces of sanity. Then he lifted =\r\nhis head and howled, shattering the deathly silence.\n   \n   \n  =85 =85\n   \n=\r\n   \n  Okita was light and fast, and he was confident of his ability with a =\r\nkatana. There had been absolutely no warning when he abruptly kicked up a m=\r\nat and swung around, the blade singing furiously. In the midst of the chaos=\r\n, a bullet flew past the bridge of his nose, missing it by a hair. Instantl=\r\ny there was a second bullet, but this time, he heard it cut through the air=\r\n. He averted his face and leaned back reflexively. Even so, he did not come=\r\n off unscathed =96 the bullet grazed the right side of his face and scraped=\r\n away some of his right ear. \n   \n  The katana, a gift from a renegade nobl=\r\ne, had been made by the famous Norimune, but the boy=92s skill was even mor=\r\ne impressive than the weapon. Ryouma dodged the horizontal swipe and gave a=\r\n low whistle as he watched the screendoor through which he had intended to =\r\nmake his escape collapse in a decrepit heap. At that moment, Ryouma glimpse=\r\nd the flash of another blade close behind him. Two of his men who had been =\r\nwaiting in the antechamber had drawn their katana simultaneously and now ad=\r\nvanced together with the tips aligned. \n   \n  =93Sakamoto-sensei, you have =\r\nto leave now,=94 one of the men cried, =93the first and third squads of the=\r\n Shinsengumi have arrived with the vice-commander.=94\n   \n  =93Yoshimura-sa=\r\nn!=94\n   \n  =93I beg you, sensei! There is no time!=94\n   \n  Sakamoto was b=\r\nrave, but not suicidal. He understood the situation; more importantly, he u=\r\nnderstood his men. The moment he set his foot on the sill of the window, So=\r\nuji dashed forward and struck a blow with his katana. The man named Yoshimu=\r\nra blocked it, startled by the savage attack from a figure that had been st=\r\nanding transfixed in a corner six feet away. Seeing that his first blow had=\r\n cut deeply into the man=92s shoulder, Souji attacked again, this time angl=\r\ning the blade just so. Having struck home with one thrust to the neck, he p=\r\nulled out the katana and backed away so quickly that he was scarcely touche=\r\nd by the spurting blood. \n   \n  Even before the first man hit the floor, So=\r\nuji attacked the second. Time was the essence. Ryouma must be faraway by no=\r\nw: he would be damned if all these months of planning had gone to waste. Ov=\r\nerawed, the wretched man had no real will to fight, but stood his ground ou=\r\nt of determination to keep his master out of danger. Averting his eyes from=\r\n the flash of Souji=92s blade, he parried two or three times; but it was a =\r\nresigned, apologetic, tearful sort of resistance. Souji struck the katana f=\r\nrom his hand, kicked him down, and stabbed him in the chest.\n   \n  Quick as=\r\n he had been, he must have consumed precious minutes to accomplish this muc=\r\nh. As far as he could tell, his plan had ground to a grinding halt. From hi=\r\ns vantage point at the window, he could see Ryouma making his way across th=\r\ne rooftops, waving at him and making rude signs. \n   \n  It frustrated him n=\r\no end. He smashed the fragile katana against a stone dais and watched as th=\r\ne blade splintered around his feet. =93A pity,=94 he said ambiguously.\n   \n=\r\n  He heard voices approaching from behind and the footsteps of men running =\r\ntowards the room down the corridor. \n   \n   \n  =85 =85\n   \n   \n  The long a=\r\nutumn night had turned, if possible, even darker. Toshi was entranced. It w=\r\nas only later that he understood the emotion that had seized him; at the ti=\r\nme, he forgot himself completely. It was an agitation that he had never exp=\r\nerienced before, an inexpressible excitement. Juxtaposed with the mutilated=\r\n body, the boy glowed with the pride and joy of living, the embodiment of f=\r\nlawless beauty. And his expressionless face, precisely because it was so gi=\r\nrlish and unaffected, now appeared to be brimming with the most cynical det=\r\nachment.\n   \n  He thought he would never tire of gazing at the enigma befor=\r\ne him. To Toshi, he was irresistibly beautiful. \n   \n  It was common, in an=\r\ny case, for a na=EFve child suddenly to regard an adult as god-like, and so=\r\n he could imagine what impression he made on Soujroui with his promise. In =\r\nthe interval, then, the feelings between the pair had changed. \n   \n  The k=\r\natana with the Chrysanthemum crest was destroyed: a pity, yes, but the boy =\r\nhad insisted on it.\n   \n  However eager he may have been in his pursuit of =\r\na fair and just world, Toshi wondered if he had the courage, when confronte=\r\nd with the child=92s grief and remorse, to debase him again.\n   \n   \n  =85 =\r\n=85\n   \n   \n  He was alone at the compound that afternoon, making minor cha=\r\nnges to the next month=92s roster when he received a note from Yamazaki. Th=\r\ne message was short and the writing hurried, and he wondered if Yamazaki ha=\r\nd =96 not deliberately, of course =96 left out certain crucial details. Nev=\r\nertheless, he had found the directions sufficient.\n   \n  The troops were di=\r\nrected to search every room and take no survivors. He soon found himself ru=\r\nnning alone in the opposite direction from the men, about ten metres down a=\r\n long passage, then a turn to the left and then to the right, which led to =\r\na matted corridor three or five metres long. This was the darkest spot of a=\r\nll, with rooms on one side and wood sliding doors facing the garden on the =\r\nother.\n   \n  Room after room: there was nothing straight that could be made=\r\n curved, nothing plain that could be decorated nothing white that could be =\r\nbrilliant. The very air was embellished! It was, he thought crazily, the mo=\r\nst spectacularly vulgar place he had ever been in. It looked and smelled li=\r\nke a cheap whorehouse, except the riches were real and each piece of furnit=\r\nure probably cost a village=92s yearly earnings. \n   \n  The rooms were dese=\r\nrted, and he wondered if he had misinterpreted Yamazaki=92s directions. But=\r\n he found to his relief that the door (or what was left of it) to the last =\r\nroom was open and Souji was waiting inside, standing alone in the plain and=\r\n empty room, unscented and unfurnished. It was astonishing. He was so relie=\r\nved to be out of the visual, olfactory and auditory confusion that he very =\r\nnearly sank to his knees. \n   \n  =93Souji, what happened?=94 he asked as he=\r\n stumbled into the room, startled by how frightened he was. Then he drew on=\r\ne breath at the sight of the spilt blood and in the next, drew on detachmen=\r\nt as deliberately as he stepped over a corpse. =93You idiot,=94 he commente=\r\nd dryly, taking the other man=92s chin and inspecting his face from side to=\r\n side, gentleness belying his tone, =93losing that ear would upset the symm=\r\netry of the face. Don=92t laugh. You=92ll start the bleeding again.=94\n   \n=\r\n  He had seen enough of this kind of thing to check the torso for abrasions=\r\n and broken bones; there were none. Sighing, he reached into his robes and =\r\nbrought out a tiny jar. As Souji stood there, letting Toshi clean his face =\r\nup and pull the cuts together, he spoke quietly. \n   \n  =93I am quite usele=\r\nss after all, Hijikata-san, you would do better to replace the captain of t=\r\nhe first troop.=94\n   \n  =93Souji=85=94 Toshi frowned down at him, fingers =\r\nstill rubbing the bloodied protrusion of flesh and cartilage. He hoped Souj=\r\ni would not notice how badly his hands were shaking, but Souji=92s eyes sli=\r\nd away. \n   \n  =93He got away.=94 Souji continued, by way of explanation. =\r\n=93Sakamoto Ryouma. He was an interesting man. Nice but dangerous. I should=\r\n have waited longer, but I couldn=92t hold back.=94\n   \n  Toshi helped him =\r\nwith the robes, pulling it back up his arms, careful not to touch him unnec=\r\nessarily. He was the colour of Cochin pearls, Toshi decided, but said merel=\r\ny, =93You=92re right: you should have practiced more restraint. Even so, he=\r\n would have been difficult to pin down, we would just have to keep our eyes=\r\n wide open in the future. And,=94 Toshi straightened the collar of the bloo=\r\nd-flecked yukata, =93don=92t ever forget, Souji, that you owe Kondou-san al=\r\nl that you have today, and that the Shinsengumi needs you, even if no one e=\r\nlse does.=94\n   \n  Souji felt as if the sun had burst out. =93Thank you,=94=\r\n he said, his face a picture of befuddled gratification. He looked up with =\r\na grin and continued, raising his voice slightly. =93I know of someone, tho=\r\nugh, who is perfect for this job. Hajime-san wouldn=92t mind losing a ear =\r\n=96 it would have matched his name quite well. Don=92t you agree, Hajime-sa=\r\nn?=94\n   \n  =93Assuming that to be true, I guess you wouldn=92t mind gettin=\r\ng your nose lobbed off and served with sake and soba.=94 Saitou Hajime dead=\r\npanned as he stepped down from the alcove.\n   \n  =93You are just as stealth=\r\ny as that Yamazaki.=94 Toshi said, vaguely embarrassed. =93When did you arr=\r\nive?=94\n   \n  =93I was behind you all this while.=94\n   \n  One of these day=\r\ns, Toshi thought savagely, ignoring the peals of laughter behind him, those=\r\n two brats are going to pay for their insubordination. \n   \n   \n   The End\n=\r\n   \n  I know there is the tendency to see Souji as this very sweet being, a=\r\nnd I am being sacrilegious here by portraying him as this frightful thing. =\r\nTrust me, it wasn=92t supposed to be this way. Ryouma and Souji were suppos=\r\ned to be acquaintances in this story and have a laugh or two. Well, the fic=\r\n was to end with Souji snubbing Ryouma=92s offer and them parting on somewh=\r\nat strained terms, but there was not supposed to be bloodshed. Then, when I=\r\n finally came to the pre-planned ending (the part where Ryouma took out the=\r\n katana), events took a sudden turn for interesting. A flashback to an inci=\r\ndent that wished to be forgotten. Two people died ignominious deaths, and I=\r\n can=92t even justify them. Toshi and the respective squadrons came into th=\r\ne picture. Toshi just had to be in every fic. Sweatdrops It just justifies =\r\nmy view that one-shots should not be dragged beyond 2 weeks lest new ideas =\r\njump onto the overloaded bandwagon. \n   \n  Shakes heads. Then again, that=\r\n=92s precisely the fun of learning about the character as one writes. All i=\r\nn all, it was an exhilarating experience.\n   \n  Thanks to my brother for hi=\r\ns never-ending patience and interesting insights (symmetry, anyone? Heh=85)=\r\n. Thanks to Fignae and XXX for the wonderful inputs.\n   \n  Shrugs. Please d=\r\no leave reviews, but I am not going to beg for them.\n   \n  Notes:\n   \n  1) =\r\nAs far as I know, the Shinsengumi was not the only peacekeeping group in Ky=\r\noto. I forgot the name of the other groups. I think it is the Mimawarigumi.=\r\n I know the hierarchy changes are rapid and confusing. For the benefit of m=\r\ny overworked mind, we shall stick to the PMK hierarchy, yes?\n   \n  2) The k=\r\natana that Ryouma presented was not the Kiku-ichimonji. That one was broken=\r\n and left somewhere deep in the forest. No. This was another blade forged b=\r\ny the same swordsmith and imprinted with the same Chrsanthemum crest.\n   \n =\r\n 3) The Promise. Yes. Ahem. The promise made by Toshi was that he would hav=\r\ne need of Souji=92s strength in time to come.
