If I don&#39;t like-ey, I don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt;read-ey. End of story.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, but sometimes, you know, you just can&#39;t look away.  It&#39;s such a \n&gt; train wreck, and you are drawn in...seduced by the grotesque.  I \n&gt; guess, I sometimes read Mary Sue stories for the same reason I watch \n&gt; horror movies.  Just as it is good to know my arm isn&#39;t being gnawed \n&gt; off by zombies, it is also good to know that I am -not- as bad of a \n&gt; writer as I sometimes like to think.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -MissBehavin (Has Saito ready to Gatotsu anyone who unjustly accuses \n&gt; our members of stealing data.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, I see it now, the Shinsengumi-fans, gathering our boats, sailing \n&gt; off into the wide-wide internet, our Makoto flags unfurled, our \n&gt; eyepatches and parrots in tow...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Arrrrr.  We&#39;re here for your DATA.  We&#39;ve come to pillage \n&gt; your \n&gt; research.  Hand it over, or feel our wrath!\n&gt; \n&gt; Angrybee.\n\n\nI understand all that about the train wreck. Done that a time or two myself. But I was thinking, we&#39;ve all recently seen a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; in a popular anime and loved her to death! Who do I mean? Ayu-nee! She fits the criteria laid down almost exactly in that 1) Everyone loves her, 2) She&#39;s always solving everyone&#39;s problems for them with her advice and 3) even though the Shinsengumi are master swordsmen, it is sadly apparent she can kick most of their tails... So, Mary Sue-nee anyone? (Yes, I know she&#39;s an &quot;original&quot; character, but she probably began as a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; somewhere, ne?)\n\n\nAnd I still maintain the Gatotsu threat. I don&#39;t want anyone here who uses info we&#39;ve gathered to be accused by someone unconnected to the group of stealing &quot;their story&quot; or &quot;their data&quot; because they have the same info. I will lead a mass charge in that person&#39;s defense. Going several rounds with the goldfish and then it&#39;s evil brother has made me cranky. Esp. after I realized I&#39;ve HAD the info I&#39;ve been looking for all along! -_- Sometimes, you really can have TOO much info.\n\nYeah, there&#39;s another translator service we can gripe about now. It&#39;s called Alis Translation Solutions and the name of the program is Gist. For good reason. That&#39;s about all you&#39;ll get of the page - the gist. (On a serious note, in some cases it&#39;s worse, but in others the translation is clearer and easier to figure out.) \n\n-MissBehavin (being glared at by Saito, who was under the false impression he was going to see some immediate action...)\n\n"
