Few fine eating establishments\nacknowledged the captain of the =\r\n10th squad.\n\nHistorical Harada very likely died right after the battle at U=\r\neno Hill\nin Edo=97but some say he fled to China where he may have emerged t=\r\no\nassist Japanese troops during the Sino-Japanese War or was it the\nRusso-J=\r\napanese War?=97whatever=97because I now have a third theory to what\nhappene=\r\nd to our dear Harada.\n\nHe opened a dairy farm.  \nHis descendants to this da=\r\ny make calcium and iron rich pudding.  Below\nis a picture of an unopened co=\r\nntainer, and an image of Harada&#39;s\npudding carefully extracted and inverted =\r\non a tasteful little bowl.  I\nunderstand that in our health conscious socie=\r\nty it is necessary to\noffer more nutritious alternatives---so included an a=\r\npple and orange.\n\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/temporary/HaradaCustard.jpg\n\nI ca=\r\nme across Harada&#39;s pudding on my quest to stock up on shrimp\nchips, which b=\r\ny the way taste great with tuna sandwiches.\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/tempora=\r\nry/Shrimp_Flavored_Chips.jpg\n\nAfter purchasing Harada&#39;s pudding for a mere =\r\n$1.99 I inspected the\nprofessional packaging and was immediately disappoint=\r\ned by the lack of\na cute small eating implement which frequently accompanie=\r\ns many\nJapanese snacks.  After removing the pudding I noticed the 6 petal\nf=\r\nlower design.  I briefly contemplated what flowers are equipped with\nsix pe=\r\ntals and abandoned those thoughts to consider the product name\nitself &quot;cust=\r\nard pudding&quot;.  Unfortunately it is not pudding---it is\nFLAN custard.  How c=\r\nan we trust a company which tries to combine 2\nkinds of food into one?  Alt=\r\nhough the package touts its rich calcium\nand iron the nutrition facts lists=\r\n 17% saturated fat and a shocking\n15g of sugar.  The most scary ingredients=\r\n are &quot;locust bean gum&quot; (which\nappears TWICE)  and &quot;sweetened egg yolk&quot;.  No=\r\n wonder there is 15 g of\nsugar in this snack=97they sweeten the ingredients=\r\n even before they make\nthe product.  I was also warned that Harada&#39;s puddin=\r\ng was made in a\nfactory which uses soybeans.  \nTo this day I have never exp=\r\nerienced cardiac arrest due to ingesting\nsoybeans so I disregarded the omin=\r\nous warning and proceeded to enjoy\nHarada&#39;s creamy snack which can be finis=\r\nhed in about 3 spoonfuls.  The\ntexture of flan was perfect and I made sure =\r\nto check for locust\nabdomens or wings.  My initial grade for this product i=\r\ns a strong B\nbut I have to drop the grade to B- because after consuming all=\r\n 3 cups\nmy tongue was coated with a greasy waxy substance which was removed=\r\n\nonly after imbibing the contents of a 3 inch bottle of Shirakiku sweet\nyog=\r\nurt drink (made in Korea).\n\nThe review above has been forwarded to Harada D=\r\nairies Corporation in\nNiigata Japan along with a note requesting a clarific=\r\nation of the\nmysterious LOCUST BEAN GUM ingredient.  \n\n\n\n\n"
