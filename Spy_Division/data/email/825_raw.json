Here&#39;s a sample of MIrror, Mirror the timetravel novel\nfeaturing members of the Shisnengumi. The book is due out in e-book format\nMay 12 and in a paperback version sometime in July...\n\n* * * *\n\nI sat in musty, dark storage room off the kitchens and wondered how much\ntime had passed since Hijikata had me placed in here to await Kaemon&#39;s\narrival. I glanced toward the tiny barred window at the far end of the shed\nbut couldn&#39;t really see the sky. It seemed that it was just beginning to\nlighten but then there had been a few large paper lanterns strung around the\ncompound so I wasn&#39;t quite sure about the light or its source.\n\nI tried to erase the image of Kaemon&#39;s furious expression from my mind. Why\ndid he blame me? It wasn&#39;t as if I planned to have all that stuff happen.\nOkay, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have gone busting through the Inamoto-ro but I&#39;d\nbeen scared. Those gorilla guys were after me and I didn&#39;t even want to\nthink about what their slimy little boss had planned for me back at his\nplace. It was obvious that he had me pegged for some new male prostitute or\nother, but once they found out I was a girl, there was no telling what they\nwould have done.\n\nWhat was I supposed to do? Let them take me or try to go politely in the\nbrothel and asked sweetly for Kaemon to come to the door and reason with the\ngorillas?\n\nLike that would have worked.\n\nI sighed and leaned back against a pile of rice sacks. I closed my eyes\nwhile sending silent farewells back to Uncle Jake, my mother and\ngrandparents.\n\nI imagined the tombstone:\n\nHere Lies Emmi Maeda, Executed A Century Before She was Born\n\n** * * **\n\nThough Kaemon pretended to rest in the palanquin that took him from the\nImperial Palace to Mibu, he covertly peered across the carriage to his\ncompanion and personal retainer, Kishi Matsuyama, who had been conspicuously\nabsent during the incident at *Inamoto-ro*.\n\nSupposedly he&#39;d been so occupied with one of the new whores, Matsuyama\nhadn&#39;t realize he&#39;d returned unexpectedly with Aneko and was involved in the\ncommotion. That account did not agree with the one from off-duty Shinsengumi\ncaptain Kanryussai Takeda.\n\nThe palanquin stopped.\n\n&quot;My Lord,&quot; Matsuyama said. &quot;We&#39;ve arrived.&quot;\n\nKae sat up and made a show of rubbing the sleep from his eyes then followed\nhis retainer out of the carriage. They entered the Shinsengumi compound\nwhere the chief officers and a few of the captains waited.\n\nFollowing an imperceptible nod of Kaemon&#39;s head, Toshizou Hijikata\ninstructed two of his men to escort Matsuyama away.\n\n&quot;M-my Lord-&quot;\n\n&quot;No one betrays me, Matsuyama, and lives. No one.&quot;\n\nThose softly spoken words chilled me to the bone as I was led past the man I\nrecognized as Kaemon&#39;s friend who&#39;d gotten us out of the brothel the night I\narrived.\n\nI saw the man struggle only to be knocked to the ground and bound with rope\nthen dragged away to a darkened corner. Light glinted off a katana blade as\nit sliced through the air seconds after Kaemon&#39;s former friend cried out.\n\n&quot;Your turn,&quot; Hijikata muttered as I was led past him and toward Chief\nKondou&#39;s quarters.\n\nI gagged and raised my  bound hands to my mouth as my stomach churned.\n Kondou read the same list of charges that Hijikata had read while Kaemon\nstared at me with the same deadly expression that he&#39;d worn when condemning\nhis friend to death only moments ago.\n\n\n-- \n~Chloe Michelle\nhttp://chloemichelle.com\nhttp://www.myspace.com/emmi_kae\nhttp://chloe-michelle.livejournal.com/\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
