After the fight, Suzu and Yoshida are walking up a long \n&gt; stairway a=\r\nnd two women are walking down.  Yoshida steps aside to \n&gt;let the women pass=\r\n and Suzu says something like, &quot;You&#39;re so kind, \n&gt; master.&quot;  Then the white=\r\n cat runs across their path.  \n&gt; \n&gt;                 You are simply amazing.=\r\n I didn&#39;t notice that at all.\n\n\nOne of my favorite eps.  Not for that bit, =\r\nbut for the conversation \nbetween Souji and Toshi on the walk back from buy=\r\ning sweets.  \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;           Um... That&#39;s a fantastic idea! It never occu=\r\nred to me! \n&gt;Will take note of that. But... haha... I was thinking maybe, j=\r\nust \n&gt;maybe, quite a number came down with the first attack the first \n&gt;tim=\r\ne. Usually, such attacks are relatively mild and in young healthy \n&gt;individ=\r\nuals would present as little more than a worse than normal \n&gt;flu. After tha=\r\nt, most would recover fully with the bacteria latent \n&gt;in the body, while f=\r\nor a select few... well.\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt;           Just my take on why only Souji=\r\n got TB despite living in \nclose quarters with other men.\n&gt; \n\n\n\nAh, I don&#39;t=\r\n know as much about TB as I guess I should.  Will have to \ndo some reading.=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;From what I understand, at least back then, a black cat was a sign \n&gt;=\r\nof TB, and if you killed the cat in question, you&#39;d be safe- or so \n&gt;they b=\r\nelieved.\n&gt;\n&gt;On a somewhat related note, I will be in Kyoto for the next thr=\r\nee \n&gt;days!\n\n&gt;-M.\n\n\nThanks for the info.  So since he couldn&#39;t kill the cat.=\r\n..          \nLet us know about your stay in Kyoto - have a great time!\n\n\n\nH=\r\nas anyone watched Shura No Toki?  They do a different take on Souji \nand th=\r\ne black cat.  As well as a different take on a lot of other \nthings too...\n=\r\n\nOn a related note - in one of the early episodes of the NHK \nShinsengumi s=\r\neries a mention is made of people who were lost to \n&quot;the epidemic.&quot;  Anyone=\r\n know what that epidemic was?\n\n\n--zhusanna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
