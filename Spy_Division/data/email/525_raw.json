It appears \nthat an LJ user &quot;likebunnies&quot; was hit with a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order \nfrom the MPAA--Motion Picture Association of America for having the \nnerve to use their beloved ratings system for a fanfiction archive. The \nmain concern seems to be with the &quot;NC-17&quot; rating which they claim \ncopyright ownership of. You can read about it at the links below.\n\nTo read the letter likebunnies received (including envelope) in full:\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/users/likebunnies/150546.html \n&lt;http://www.livejournal.com/users/likebunnies/150546.html&gt;\n\nTo read a legal discussion on it:\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/community/fandom_lawyers/10204.html \n&lt;http://www.livejournal.com/community/fandom_lawyers/10204.html&gt;\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://www.livejournal.com/users/b_sheridan/\nFigures. They&#39;re generally known to be a bunch of jerks. Some years ago \nHollywood actually tried to file a lawsuit against a town here in Georgia for \ncopyright infringment of the &quot;Hollywood&quot; name. They wanted them to &quot;change the \ntown&#39;s name or they were going to sue&quot;.\n\nLOL They didn&#39;t get too far with it. Turns out  Hollywood, GA has been around \na lot longer than Hollywood, CA.\n\n-MissB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
