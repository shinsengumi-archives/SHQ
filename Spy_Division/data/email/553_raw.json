No anime characters here...all real historical\npeople. I own this stuff! LOL No I don&#39;t...who DOES own these people? lol\nMajor Characters: &quot;Other&quot;-- Matsudaira Teruhime, Matsudaira Toshihime,\nNakano Takeko, Nakano Kouko\n\nAizu Joushigun\nDai-ichi: Yoake\nOne: Daybreak\n\nEdo\nAizu clan mansion\nKaei 1 (1848)\n\nToshiko, daughter of the Aizu lord Katataka, smiled as she held the\nwarm bundle in her arms, steadied by Teru, her newly adopted sister.\nTeru shook her head in amused disbelief. She didn&#39;t think that\nsuch...cuteness was possible.\n\n&quot;Teru-nechan, isn&#39;t she cute?&quot;\n\nA blush tinged Teru&#39;s cheeks. The baby that Toshi was holding was\ncute...her smile and her calm, happy demeanor warmed Teru&#39;s otherwise\ngently cynical heart. She was a newcomer to the Matsudaira family, and\nso far had only really been impressed by her adoptive sister&#39;s\ninnocence and her adoptive brother&#39;s sometimes annoying calm.\nExtending a finger, she raised a curious eyebrow when the baby took\nfirm hold of it and wouldn&#39;t let go easily.\n\n-So adorable...like a living doll...-\n\nShe turned to the slightly older woman who sat a discreet distance away.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s her name, Kouko-chan?&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s Takeko, milady.&quot;\n\n-Nakano Takeko...-Teru mused quietly. -Sounds like she&#39;ll be...famous.\nOr something.- Takeko giggled and once again took ahold of Teru&#39;s\nextended finger.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s...adorable! And such a good grip...&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;re so blessed to have her, milady,&quot; Kouko bowed politely. &quot;I can\nsense she&#39;s bound for great things.&quot;\n\n&quot;Mm...have you thought of naginata training, when the time is right?&quot;\nTeru winced. Takeko&#39;s grip was getting really hard. &quot;My teacher,\nAkaoka Taisuke, is very good at training women. I could put in a good\nword for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you, milady.&quot;\n\n&quot;You know, Toshi-chan,&quot; Teru gently touched the younger girl on the\nshoulder, &quot;I think you&#39;ll make a great mother someday...you just look\nso natural, holding Takeko-chan...&quot;\n\n&quot;You think so?&quot;\n\n&quot;You and Katamori-sama are destined for happy days, little\nsister...just like Takeko-chan here.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"
