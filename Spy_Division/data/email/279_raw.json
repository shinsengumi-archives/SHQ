WOW, we DO think alike ... I just uploaded my PMK Yamazaki fanart in Photos also ^^  He has red eyeliner too... but I wanted it that way... it&#39;s kinda like a black and red theme.  U can see this on the cover of the PMK volume 1 manga, except it&#39;s a picture of Tetsu and not Yamazaki.  I don&#39;t have a scanner, so it turned out kinda crappy... i only have digital camera *sob* and the lighting wasn&#39;t very good... *sigh* oh well, I submitted it to the contest also.\n~SaitohWorship\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\nI uploaded my PMK Hijikata Fanart in Photos.\nYes, he actually has some red eyeliner...actually you can blame the\ncrayola markers I purchased...the felt tip screwed up everything so I\nused a bit of red to cover up something and thought &quot;heck&quot; heroes in\nJapanese prints have red around the eyes.  The drawing was done on\npaper taped together (you&#39;ll see a thin white line near the bottom.  I\nsubmitted this fanart to the contest.\n\n\n\nSHQ - Shinsengumi Headquarters\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\nSHQ - The Website\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/\nSHQ Spy Office -- SHQ LiveJournal\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/community/shq_spy_office/\nSHQ Message Board\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com/ \n\n\nYahoo!
