It captures PMK Saitou&#39;s &#39;essence&#39;. Ha! The sleepy eyes of death. \n   \n          Regarding Saitou&#39;s childhood, well there is a minute part in book 5 of PMK Kurogane. The first page, I think... Saitou seeing himself when he was a child in his blade. But it was only the back view. \n   \n         Truth is, Saitou is pretty much neglected in PMK. Not much character development there. Even Kaze no Hikaru does better there. Though I personally like the protrayal of Saitou there least.\n   \n  Divertimento\n\nsecretary &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n  I&#39;ve seen fanart of the PMK cast as kids e.g. OKita/Hijikata\n\npoor Saitou has been neglected\n\nPMK SAitou is WAAAAAY easier to drawn than RK Saitou (one line wrong\nand his face/body is totally -not- right, that is part of the finesse\nof Watsuki&#39;s bold style)\n\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/PMKSHteenager.jpg\n\nI call it &quot;the Sleepy Eyes of Death&quot; (yes from the samurai film)\nit fits PMK Saitou&#39;s personality\n\nthe thing to the left is a dragon---the circles are his prayer beads\n\n\n\n\n\nSHQ - Shinsengumi Headquarters\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\nSHQ - The Website\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/\nSHQ Message Board\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com/\nSHQ Database\nhttp://www.shinsengumidb.com/ \n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Rurouni kenshin   Peacemaker kurogane   Shinsengumi     Okita \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
