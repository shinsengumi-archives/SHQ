Every person has his o=\r\nwn \nwriting habits, sot it&#39;s funny to compare them like this. No one is \nri=\r\nght, no one is wrong. Here&#39;s what I personally do. \n\n&lt;Do you guys outline t=\r\nhe entire story first?&gt; \n\nYes. I find it essential to know where I&#39;m headin=\r\ng and how I&#39;m going \nthere. Sometimes, I can develop the plot in only a few=\r\n hours, \nsometimes it can take months. I just take all the time I need, \nbe=\r\ncause I don&#39;t want to force anything. Once I have a clear idea of \nthe plot=\r\n, I write it down and try to divide the action into chapters. \nThen, slowly=\r\n, I&#39;ll write one chapter at a time.\n\nThe plot doesn&#39;t necessarily contain e=\r\nverything and sometimes, I can \nchange a few details along the way, but not=\r\nhing too crucial to the \nstory line. I have to keep the same goal in mind.\n=\r\n\nWriting can takes me a lot of time, because before I start, I try to \nvisu=\r\nalise the scenes. They have to sound real to my ears and it&#39;s the \nvision I=\r\n got that will be put down on paper. Once again, I try to not \nforce anythi=\r\nng. The scene will be ready, when it will.\n\n\n&lt;I notice the need for chapter=\r\ns and scenes any criteria on deciding \nwhether a chapter is &#39;over&#39; so to sp=\r\neak?&gt;\n\nYou decide what the length of your chapters is. Personally, when I \n=\r\ndivide the story into chapter, I try to plan enough material in each \nof th=\r\nem to have about ten pages per chapter. Of course, I might be \nwrong in my =\r\nplanning, and if after seven pages, I&#39;m done, well there \nwill be a shorter=\r\n chapter, that&#39;s all. The important thing about \nchapters is that each one =\r\nof them has to bring its contribution to \nthe story. If a chapter has no po=\r\nint, brings no new development, then \nmaybe it&#39;s time to consider combining=\r\n two chapters.\n\n\n&lt;Do you develop one character at a time on paper? -or- do =\r\nyou develop \nthe situation and try to &quot;insert&quot; the character?&gt;\n\nMost of my =\r\ncharacters come directly from the manga, and then I just \ntry to keep them =\r\nIC. I try to introduce only one or two OC characters \nin the story, but gen=\r\nerally, when developing the plot, I have a good \nidea of who they are. I wi=\r\nll write a few words on them, but not much.\n\n\n&lt; Anyone want to share how we=\r\nird it is to try to think as someone of \nthe opposite gender? :)&gt; \n\nStrange=\r\nly enough, have no problems with that. It&#39;s probably just me=85.\n\n\n\nOne las=\r\nt thing you didn&#39;t asked any questions about, but which I \npersonally find =\r\nimportant about writing, is to not immediately post \nwhat I wrote. I always=\r\n try to be a few chapters ahead of what I post \nbecause there are always li=\r\nttle details I have to change to fit the \nlatest character development or t=\r\nhe latest plot development. Also, \nstoring the chapters on my computer allo=\r\nws me to put them aside for a \nwhile and then come back and see them under =\r\na brand new light. It \nreally helps.\n\n\nMary-Ann\n\n\n\n"
