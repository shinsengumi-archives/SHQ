Most of the members \n&gt; looks SO FAMILIAR :O)\n&gt; \n&gt; Umm... Just wanted to introduce myself first to be polite. \n&gt; \n&gt; mg_batt here from Miburo, edojidai and SHQ. My pen name is wounds \nin \n&gt; fanfiction.net. Crazy about Saitou-sama and a fast growing interest \n&gt; on the Shinsengumi. I love reading the post in the groups, so many \n&gt; informative people and it gives me something to write about. Not \nmuch \n&gt; of a contributor as everytime I get anything juicy someone is \nalready \n&gt; one step ahead. Oh well, that&#39;s how good the group is... :O)\n&gt; \n&gt; I write stories and poems that are Saitou-sama based. I like to \n&gt; write/read, alternate pairings a lot. I like to pair Saitou-sama \nwith \n&gt; just about anyone. Just started last December and not really a \n&gt; writer. Heck hated English and writing back in school, was more of \na \n&gt; Math/Science person. So please don&#39;t kill me if by chance you read \nmy \n&gt; fic and didn&#39;t like it. PLEASE? My bestfriend already did and she \n&gt; only read one chapter...   :O)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SHQ - Shinsengumi Headquarters\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\n&gt; \n&gt; Coming soon:  SHQ - The Website\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; SHQ Spy Office -- SHQ LiveJournal\n&gt; http://wwww.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
