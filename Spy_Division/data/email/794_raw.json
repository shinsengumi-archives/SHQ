This digital painting\nwas bas=\r\ned on a black-and-white manga-style drawing of Saito at the\nback of a douji=\r\nnshi called Spark! (sadly, I don&#39;t know who the artist\nwas). Even though it=\r\n was simply a stark monochrome image, I was\ncaptivated. I just had to paint=\r\n my own version of it.\n\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/deviation/37693516/\n\nThe =\r\nnext drawing I&#39;m working on is of Saitou in his Shinsengumi\nuniform (as he&#39;=\r\ns seen in Rurouni Kenshin). I&#39;m also thinking of making\nSouji Okita (Peacem=\r\naker Kurogane) art. ^_^\n\nThank you for your time! I hope you enjoy my work!=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
