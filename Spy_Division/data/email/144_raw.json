Mini-questionnaire for the\n writer in you.\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=1533100\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: bsher213\r\n\r\n\n\nIt&#39;ll probably sound like I&#39;m plagiarizing Phil here since her responses \nmade me think--that&#39;s what I was going to say.  But then again you all \nknow what they say about great minds thinking alike---or was that \n_twisted_ minds??/\n\n&gt;\n&gt;1) While writing you... ????\n&gt;a. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts \n&gt;are finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.\n&gt;b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever\n&gt;c. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, \n&gt;oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m definitely a mixture of all of the above sometimes all during the \nsame day!\n\n&gt;========================================================\n&gt;\n&gt;2) After writing you... ????\n&gt;a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important \n&gt;than Proof-read!\n&gt;b. One quick read. I&#39;m confident enough in my work.\n&gt;c. Oh who needs to check? It&#39;s too late. I wrote and posted the \n&gt;thing already!&gt;\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m generally a B since I tend to go over things once I&#39;ve finished a \npage or so but if I&#39;m trying to do something &quot;serious&quot; /original book \nlength I lean a bit more toward the A \n\n*looks at Miss B and Masayoshi*  I see  you smirking and rolling your eyes*\n==========================\n\n&gt;3) When you get reviews you... ???\n&gt;a. Oh that&#39;s nice. I&#39;ll check it in a bit. *feels good*\n&gt;b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!\n&gt;c. Review... Well that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it. &gt;\n&gt;\nI&#39;m definitely a B and if  FF.net doesn&#39;t send an alert within  24 hrs \nof posting something new I check the site just in case...\n\n*Yes, I&#39;m pathetic*\n\n===============================\n\n&gt;\n&gt;4) When you get a critique you... ???\n&gt;a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!\n&gt;b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis \n&gt;and then correct if need be...\n&gt;c. What? You didn&#39;t like it. Oh! I&#39;ve got to fix that quick!\n&gt;\n\nWhile I would certainly remove the &quot;Perfect&quot; from A I think I&#39;m a cross \nbetween A and B leaning more toward the B side.\n\nHowever I tend not to do major rewrites for fanfic because that&#39;s my \n&quot;fun all for me&quot; writing so as long as I think it&#39;s &quot;good enough&quot; then \nit stands as is.\n======================================\n\n&gt;\n&gt;5) When it comes to updates you... ???\n&gt;a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\n&gt;b. I&#39;ll update exactly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a \n&gt;defined routine.\n&gt;c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this \n&gt;great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.\n&gt;\nA & C depending on how  badly the characters want me to tell this \nparticular story.. I&#39;ve stalled don my current fanfic mainly because of \nan original story that&#39;s going really well---or better than any others \nhave for a long time.\n\n*distant whisper drifts by*  &quot;I wish she&#39;d finish the stupid book and \nlet it get rejected already so she quit bugging us for opinions&quot;\n\n*looks again at Miss B and Masayoshi* I heard that, but I&#39;ll let it \nslide this time *Grin*\n\n===========================\n\n&gt;\n&gt;6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \n&gt;you...\n&gt;a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written \n&gt;now!\n&gt;b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it&#39;s more convenient.\n&gt;c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!\n&gt;\n\nMost definitely all of the above and occasionally all all the same day\n===========================\n\n&gt;7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\n&gt;a. Post on every message board, yahoo group and even e-mail close \n&gt;(not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need to \n&gt;read ASAP or else!\n&gt;b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement \n&gt;in a community where you are an active member or popular\n&gt;c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your fic \n&gt;in the depths of ff.net.\n&gt;\nThis depends on if its a fanfic or something else. For fanfic I&#39;m mostly C.\n\nNow if the miracle of miracles happens and I publish something &quot;for \nreal&quot; again  I&#39;ll be an obnoxious little wretch and stretch that 15 min \nof &quot;fame&quot; out for as long as I can. --Consider that your warning \npotential book buyers LOL\n\n-- \n\nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
