I was born in \nL.A.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for doujinshi the moderators here will answer your questions---we \ndo have \n&gt; yaoi fans here.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you can give me the webaddresses of Thai online bookstores which \nsell \n&gt; Shinsengumi manga I would really appreciate it.  I can translate from \nThai \n&gt; to English very well and I would love to share some scanlations to our \n&gt; little group.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, the later volumes of Kaze Hikaru, Burai, Peacemaker \nKurogane.\n&gt; I have access to a great scanner at school so if I get the manga it \nwould be \n&gt; pretty easy for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also I strongly believe that the novel Mibugishiden (which became the \nmovie \n&gt; When the Last Sword is Drawn) is in Thai because as you know there \nis a HUGE \n&gt; market for martial arts novels in Thailand.  If you don&#39;t already know, \n&gt; Mibugishiden is about...SAITOU HAJIME!  (^_^).  I&#39;m not sure if \nThailand has \n&gt; purchased Mibugishiden yet for VCD distribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yin dee tee dai ruu jak na kha,\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n___________________________________________________________\n______\n&gt; Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

The address is www.comtoon.com. Are you \nstaying in Thai now? I guess not because you want to buy them online \nright? For Mibugishiden I&#39;m sure the VCDs have already been distributed \nhere since I find the review of it. I will send you the review via e-mail. \nThough I haven&#39;t watched such movie yet, I know that the story is \nfocused well on Saito-san and likely to end in tragedy.\n\nFor the manga relating to Shinsengumi, I know the story `Sakamoto \nryoma&#39; but it contains only few chapters about Shinsengumi. I still don&#39;t \nfind Kaze Hikaru. For Peace maker Kurogane here `Bonkoch Comics&#39; has \nreleased the third volume already. You can buy it from comtoon. Hope \nthis can help and sorry for the delay.  ^_^ \n\nSince I&#39;m far less fluent in the language than you, it took me quite long \nto finish this simple reply.  ^_^&#39; Is my English O.K. or not?\n\nGiffy    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
