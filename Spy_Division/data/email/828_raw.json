I use a mac at one of my jobs, \n&gt; a computer in a PC l=\r\nab and use either my dead laptop at home or a \n&gt; borrowed laptop so usually=\r\n I have to keep straight in my mind the \n&gt; versions of documents I upload a=\r\nnd overwrite.\n&gt; \n&gt; SO today, I spent....5 hours going through the story and=\r\n RE-EDITING \n&gt; it (T_T) http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOSUZUE.pdf\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Thanks Hirotada Tokugawa for informing me that it was full of \n&gt; spellin=\r\ng errors (that&#39;s how I knew I converted the wrong draft) and \n&gt; probably ov=\r\nerwrote the GOOD draft, with an older version (I&#39;m stupid).\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways I =\r\nthink that people who want to learn about the Meiji era \n&gt; should give the =\r\nstory a chance, especially the last chapter will \n&gt; cover an important deat=\r\nh (not really popularized in manga or pop-\n&gt; culture yet) and a very key de=\r\nvelopment of the era.\n&gt; \n&gt; Footnotes galor all over the place, however ther=\r\ne are tons of details \n&gt; which are accurate but I did not footnote, because=\r\n it would be \n&gt; annoying to see footnote number 105 and then have to read a=\r\nn \n&gt; explanation at the bottom of the page.\n&gt; \n&gt; I forced one friend to rea=\r\nd the story and she finished it in five \n&gt; days and her frank review was th=\r\ne story was atleast &quot;strange&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again you can support SHQ by paypaling =\r\n$$ to shinsengumihq@...\n&gt; or you can donate money to me at silapajarun@... =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope everyone likes my version of Fujita Goro (I purposefully \n&gt; al=\r\ntered his name to Fujita Gorou, just as I tweaked the names of many \n&gt; hist=\r\norical figures in the story).\n&gt; \n&gt; Please review and email me---I&#39;ll even t=\r\nake one word reviews.\n&gt; \n\n\n"
