I didn&#39;t go deeper and see what kind of rules they&#39;re forcing on authors, though.\n \nI probably will not be archiving my stories there (or ff.net) because of my lack of control over format and presentation.  I meant to make a proper announcement with a new story or something, but from now on I&#39;m planning on keeping my fanfic on my own site --- http://philalexandros.tripod.com/wolf_in_the_coop .  Someone is currently helping me set up a guestbook so any comments/reviews can be posted there.\n \nI&#39;ll be curious to hear any comments about nfiction if anyone here explores it.\n \nphil\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
