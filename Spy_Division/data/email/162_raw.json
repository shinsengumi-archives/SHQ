When I \nfirst started watching the series I definitely felt something there. \nAyunee possibly attracted to Hijikata. Still though I think that the \nfeeling was mutual. Just look at Hijikata&#39;s reaction to her death. I \nwould think there was more than just a feeling of &quot;responsibility&quot;.  \nThere were subtle yaoi tendecies between Hijikata and Okita but IMHO \nthe attraction between the two was more apparent, maybe not at the \nsame time.. Of course I could be wrong... Oh well...\n\nAs for writing a story between the two of them...  Just like \nSherlgirl I&#39;d been toying with the idea but afraid to do so at the \nmoment for so many reasons. :O)\n\nI hope someone picks up the pairing soon. ^_-\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, sherlgirl &lt;sherlgirl@m...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Tiffany - \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do we need spoiler space?\n&gt; \n&gt; :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; .\n&gt; .\n&gt; .\n&gt; .\n&gt; .\n&gt; .\n&gt; .\n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Glad I wasn&#39;t the only one reading something into that scene. I \nsuspected from the  way Ayunee and her brother talked earlier in the \nseries that she had some deep connection to Hijikata.\n&gt; \n&gt; THe goodbye scene was more subtle.... perhaps it was the fact that \nthis conversation occurred while he was washing and her subdued way \nof speaking that made me think that both were at least aware of her \nfeelings.   \n&gt; \n&gt; What puzzled me most , however, was the way Hijikata did not show \nup normally to grieve her.  Was he simply angry? Or deeply and \npersonally upset?\n&gt; \n&gt; This is actually the one fanfic idea I had kicked around as far as \nwriting.  I&#39;m reluctant to at the moment because my hands are too \nfull.   I would not mind one of you writers taking on the idea, \nhowever. ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; S\n\n\n"
