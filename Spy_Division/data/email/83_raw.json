Read a=\r\nt your own risk.\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based =\r\non anything.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the =\r\nentire\nShinsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly=\r\n.\nThank you.\n\n\nChapter 14\n\nYuki awoke with a start and looked around her in=\r\n utter confusion,\nunsure of exactly where she was. Even though three weeks =\r\nhad passed,\nit took a moment for her to remember that she was in her own ro=\r\nom in\nNijo Castle, and not at in the servants&#39; quarters at the Yagi estate\n=\r\nin Mibu. In the distance, she could hear the calling of the night\nwatch fro=\r\nm the direction of the castle gate, which only confirmed her\nsuspicions. Sh=\r\ne was definitely in Nijo Castle. No question about it.\nSighing, she flopped=\r\n back onto the futon, trying in vain to will\nherself back to sleep. Over th=\r\ne last week or so, sleep was the one\nthing that eluded her the most at nigh=\r\nt. Even though she&#39;d never been\none for long naps, she&#39;d suddenly become ch=\r\nronically tired. Now,\nnapping was pretty much all she did all day while Hir=\r\no was in his\nmeetings with Lord Matsudaira. Even when Hiro was around, Yuki=\r\n found\nherself almost always either lying down on her own or wanting to res=\r\nt\nwith her head on his shoulder.\n&quot;Back in 2004, I&#39;d always be training, but=\r\n never be low on energy=85why\nam I suddenly sleeping so much?&quot; she murmured=\r\n, looking up at the ceiling.\nToo restless to lie still, she got out of the =\r\nbed and slowly moved\ntoward the cabinet by the window nearby. Careful not t=\r\no make too much\nnoise, she opened the top drawer and took out a small box. =\r\nThen,\nmoving with just as much silence, she went and lit the small floor\nla=\r\nntern next to her futon.\nOpening the box, she gingerly removed the contents=\r\n=97a hand mirror,\ndecorated with a pattern of floating cherry blossoms on t=\r\nhe back. Hiro\nhad gotten it for her approximately a week after their arriva=\r\nl at\nNijo, on one of their first nights `together&#39; there, as a celebratory\n=\r\npresent marking their good fortune and sincere hopes for a different,\nbrigh=\r\nter future.\nHolding the mirror closely, she examined her reflection.\n&quot;Oh, j=\r\nust lovely=85I really have put on weight=85&quot;\nIndeed, her features had becom=\r\ne fuller, rounder, and somewhat softer\nin the time that she&#39;d been at Nijo.=\r\n Then again, it couldn&#39;t be\nhelped. Upperclass women back then weren&#39;t  as =\r\nphysically active. Yuki\nherself only got naginata practice done once a week=\r\n, and spent most of\nthe rest of her time reading, writing poetry, arranging=\r\n flowers,\neating, or sleeping. It was funny-- first she&#39;d had too much to d=\r\no\nwith the Shinsengumi, now she had too little to do. Life could be so\nodd =\r\nsometimes.\nSighing, she replaced the mirror in the box, and was about to ta=\r\nke it\nback to the cabinet, when she doubled over, feeling nature calling fo=\r\nr\nwhat was probably the fifth time that night.\n&quot;Um=E9!&quot;\nAlmost instantly, o=\r\nne of the sliding doors opened, and in came a\nshort, bony woman, carrying a=\r\n chamber pot. On first glance, one might\nget the impression that she was fr=\r\nail, but her frame had a strength\nthat defied her years.\n&quot;Good thing I have=\r\n night duty, milady! Nature seems to be calling\nquite a bit today!&quot; Cacklin=\r\ng to herself, she placed the chamber pot on\nthe floor. Yuki hurried over, a=\r\nnd, thankful that she hadn&#39;t tied her\nsleeping kimono too tightly, undid it=\r\n a bit, squatted down, and did\nwhat needed to be done.\nAs she retightened h=\r\ner kimono, she turned to Um=E9.\n&quot;Um=E9=85any idea why this is happening? It=\r\n&#39;s most unnerving. I can&#39;t\nsleep, I keep needing to go=85and come to think =\r\nof it,&quot; she said,\ntouching a hand to her breasts, &quot;I&#39;ve never felt this sor=\r\ne in my life!&quot;\nUm=E9 rose slowly and deliberately, with the pot firmly held=\r\n in both\nhands, and looked straight at Yuki=97a liberty allowed her only be=\r\ncause\nof years of loyal, devoted service to the Matsudaira family of Aizu.\n=\r\nThe candlelight cast sharp patterns of light and shadow over her face,\nbrin=\r\nging out the directness of her gaze. She may have been a servant,\nbut Yuki =\r\nrespected her and valued her advice.\n&quot;Lady Yuki-- may I be permitted to spe=\r\nak frankly?&quot;\nUsed to frank speech all the time from 2004, Yuki nodded.\n&quot;You=\r\n know you can be totally open and honest with me, Um=E9.&quot;\n&quot;Thank you, milad=\r\ny. As you know, I&#39;ve served the ladies of the\nMatsudaira and Tokugawa clans=\r\n for over three decades. I think it&#39;s\npretty obvious what&#39;s going on. As fo=\r\nr your seiri=85?&quot;\nYuki gasped. She was right. The lunar calendar had thrown=\r\n off her\naccustomed perception of time, but=85\n&quot;It was late this month=85&quot;\n=\r\nUm=E9 nodded, allowing herself a small smile. Her years of experience\nhad p=\r\nroved her right yet again. She gave Yuki a polite nod.\n&quot;Yes. You are with c=\r\nhild, milady. Now if you will excuse me, I must\nproperly dispose of this=85=\r\n&quot; She bowed as deeply as possible with the\npot in her hands, and moved away=\r\n quickly, closing the sliding door as\nshe went.\nYuki stood transfixed, too =\r\nstunned for words. So she was pregnant? A\nbaby=85but this would change abso=\r\nlutely everything. Suddenly, she turned\nand headed for the other sliding do=\r\nor, which led to Hiro&#39;s room,\nalmost opening it too loudly in her haste. Qu=\r\nietly, she crept over to\nhis futon, and knelt down, leaning in as close to =\r\nhis ear as she\npossibly could.\n&quot;Hiro. Wake up, I need to talk to you.&quot;\nNo r=\r\nesponse. She gently shook him by the shoulders, trying not to\nstartle him t=\r\noo much.\n&quot;Pssst=85Hiro=85Earth to Lord Tokugawa=85&quot;\nSuddenly, his eyes flew=\r\n open, and he looked around somewhat nervously,\nmore wary of his surroundin=\r\ngs now that he was an aide to Lord Matsudaira.\n&quot;Yuki! Wha=85what&#39;s going on=\r\n?&quot;\n\t&quot;Shhh=85&quot; She lay down next to him, and silently put her arms around hi=\r\nm.\n&quot;Hiro=85you ready for this? You&#39;re going to be utterly shocked out of\nyo=\r\nur wits.&quot;\nHiro chuckled.\n&quot;Yuki, I&#39;ve been altering history for nearly a mon=\r\nth now=97nothing\nshocks me anymore.&quot;\n&quot;No=85this&#39;ll really shock you. Ready?=\r\n&quot;\n&quot;Yeah=85what is it, Yuki-chan?&quot;\nShe kissed him on the cheek.\n&quot;We&#39;re going=\r\n to have a baby.&quot;\nHiro pulled back a bit. He was somewhat shocked, and wasn=\r\n&#39;t sure if\nhe&#39;d heard Yuki&#39;s last statement correctly. He simply had to\ndou=\r\nble-check something as seemingly far-reaching in consequences as that.\n&quot;A b=\r\naby?&quot;\nYuki nodded enthusiastically.\n&quot;Really. No joke. You&#39;re going to be an=\r\n otousan!&quot;\n&quot;And you=85you&#39;re going to be the kindest, sweetest, most wonder=\r\nful\nka-chan any kid could ask for.&quot;\nHiro looked down at Yuki&#39;s abdomen, and=\r\n gently placed his hand there,\nimagining the new life that was forming ther=\r\ne at that very moment. He\nknew that a part of him was in there, merging wit=\r\nh a part of Yuki,\nforming something entirely unique and truly amazing. Forc=\r\ning all other\nthoughts aside, Hiro let the thoughts in his heart take prece=\r\ndence.\nFeeling them too wonderful to hold in, he whispered to Yuki.\n&quot;Our ch=\r\nild=85&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but smile broadly.\n&quot;Yes. Our child=85&quot; echoed Yuki=\r\n. &quot;Our firstborn=85&quot;\n&quot;At least=85&quot; he said, unable to suppress a chuckle, &quot;=\r\nwe won&#39;t need to\nworry about college tuition!&quot;\n&quot;He&#39;ll tutored by his father=\r\n, be raised in the best traditions of the\nclan, following both the literary=\r\n and the martial ways.&quot;\n&quot;Oh, I think she will be a great poet, archer, and =\r\nhalberdier, like\nher mother. And she&#39;ll have her mother&#39;s eyes.&quot;\nThey broug=\r\nht their lips together, kissing slowly and passionately,\nfeeling the worrie=\r\ns, bloodshed, politics, and intrigues of the age\nrecede far into the distan=\r\nce. Instead, the brightness and joy of life\nonce again surrounded them in i=\r\nts warm glow, as it had right after\nthey&#39;d been married, shortly before the=\r\nir arrival in this period\n&quot;We&#39;ll see=85&quot; murmured Yuki. &quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;\nHiro k=\r\nissed his wife on the forehead, and ran his fingers through her\nhair softly=\r\n. In the stillness of the night, with only the moonlight\nshining through th=\r\ne windows, he gazed deeply at her, and found her to\nbe even more beautiful =\r\nthan ever.\n&quot;No matter what the coming months may bring, remember that I sta=\r\nnd by\nyour side one hundred percent. You know you can count on me,\nYuki-cha=\r\nn. I love you...&quot;\nShe buried her face in the folds of his kimono, breathing=\r\n his scent in\ndeeply. It wasn&#39;t like when he was in the Shinsengumi. He did=\r\nn&#39;t smell\nlike blood, bone and death anymore=97he smelled like the Hiro she=\r\n&#39;d\nmarried=97mild sweat and cherry blossom perfume.\nAt last, things were ri=\r\nght again.\n&quot;I love you too, Hiro=85&quot; she sighed. &quot;Well get through=85togeth=\r\ner&quot;\n**********\n\n\n\n"
