I guess I&#39;m just speaking in RK Saitou&#39;s \ncase =\r\nsince during the height of RK Fandom, everyone thought it was \nso cool that=\r\n he was a married and a dad. This can be seen via the \nsites that stress th=\r\nis point eventhough RK itself never showed his \npersonal life or family lif=\r\ne. I myself, touted that when I fangirl \nover the guy even if I&#39;m more of a=\r\nn alt pair fan than anything else. \n\nAlthough we can take Kondou&#39;s role in =\r\nanime... He&#39;s quite the nice \nold man in PMK. I don&#39;t recall if they even m=\r\nentioned he was a dad \nand was married (probably not). But in that case it =\r\nthis statement \nmight apply, it certainly applies to the doujinshi antholog=\r\nies \ninvolving him that I&#39;ve come across... But not in NHK. Certainly I \nlo=\r\nve his portrayal there especially with his family life. \n\nSo I think it&#39;s a=\r\n case by case basis. Just IMHO tho.\n\n~Kizu\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Ellene J &lt;ellene_j@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Aaaawww!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   That&#39;s so=\r\n sweet! The problem with pop cultures is that the \ndevotees see tender fath=\r\ner figures as boring characters.

How would he deal \nwith\n&gt; an infant?\n&gt; \n&gt; This idea=\r\n was based on a conversation I had with a SHQ member---\nand so\n&gt; I realized=\r\n that we lack tender father figures in pop culture.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a story b=\r\nehind this scene:\n&gt; \n&gt; Tokio, a tired and bored woman....\n&gt; \n&gt; Tokio &quot;Goro =\r\nyou will have to watch the boys while I bathe--I just\n&gt; bought this wonderf=\r\nul sea salt and I need to relax&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; F.G. &quot;Woman, child rearing is YOUR jo=\r\nb not mine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tokio &quot;will you have me tie Tsutomu to a pole and hang ba=\r\nby \nTSuyoshi\n&gt; from the ceiling as I sit in a hot bath?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; F.G. ::sigh::=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Tokio dumps the boys on her husband...she returns to the bedroom \nand=\r\n\n&gt; just hears\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;ZZzzzzzzzz&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/FGdaddy=\r\n.jpg\n&gt; you can click on the image to get the fullsize\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SHQ =\r\n- Shinsengumi Headquarters\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\n&gt; SHQ - The=\r\n Website\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/\n&gt; SHQ Message Board\n&gt; http://www.s=\r\nhinsengumimb.com/\n&gt; SHQ Database\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumidb.com/ \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n   \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   YAHOO!
