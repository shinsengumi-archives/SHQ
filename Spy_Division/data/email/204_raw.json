SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=59905708\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: secretarytocapt3\r\n\r\nWow. Your friend&#39;s comments are so valuable to me...Thank You\n\nNow I understand the posts on Japanese messageboards...so it is not\nonly how Joe Odagiri delivers the lines but the words themselves are\n&quot;groovy&quot; as our Japanese sisters put it...\n\nYou know many of the qualities you mentioned are indeed RK Saitou and\non messageboards which study the historical Shinsengumi...RK (Sword\nHeart)is always mentioned in comparison because Nobuhiro interprets\nthe Shinsengumi related documents and folklore in such a way which is\nnot only appealing as entertainment but also full of human\npsychology...and so people insist, and maybe correctly so, that RK\nsomehow reveals some truth.\n\nWhat interests me is the selection of Joe Odagiri \n(Mr. Hottie/sexy/dangerous---I was born the same day/month as him by\nthe way)...when I look at all the pics of the actors he, to me\natleast, is the most attractive and then comes Hijikata (and I wasn&#39;t\nexpecting him to be handsome because I&#39;m so used to seeing the\nportrait/photo of historical S.H.).  It seems that the writers are\nreally attracted to their Saitou and perhaps they have found something\nin their research which is so appealing that they synthesized an NHK\nversion which is irresistable.  After all Hijikata and Okita have\nalways overshadowed other members of the Shinsengumi why Saitou -now-?\n Perhaps simply because Okita and Hijikata have been used too often as\ncharacters?  But then again we have all seen slightly different Okitas\n(love Mibugishiden/Bakumatsu/Gohatto).\n\nSince Shizuko Akama&#39;s book is a major source for hist. S.H. and she\ndiscusses the mysteries associated to him...I think people want a\nmysterious hero.\n\nI wonder if they chose an unattractive actor to portray Saitou if he\nwould still be appealing as a character.\n\nFiruze, can I borrow Enishi for a second?  \nWould we sympathize with Enishi if he looked like Iwanbo (with white\nhair because it is an expression of grief-to me)?  Writers know their\naudience...we really do see the surface level first before delving\ndeeper into their psyches.  If we see Iwanbo on the beach crying for\nhis nee-san would we care?  \n\nBy the way the popularity of NHK Shinsengumi has probably led to\n3-hajime.com&#39;s surge in hits....the site is 2 years old but I&#39;m\nserious the hits have jumped by the HUNDREDS!!! these past few weeks.\n\n\n"
