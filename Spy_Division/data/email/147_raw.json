It doesn&#39;t mean I keep that ending, \nbut it is for accountability to my characters and story.\n\nIf no complete outline, I have at least a purpose statement.  Most of \nit has to do with - who lives, who dies, who gets together and what \nis the one thing that has to happen in this piece of writing?\n\n&gt; Do you develop one character at a time on paper?\n&gt; -or- do you develop the situation and try to &quot;insert&quot; the character?\nI have a concept of the character, but I let the character write \nitself and react with others. But most of my characters are trying to \nfigure themselves out anywyas.\n\n&gt; Have you ever written a &quot;diary&quot; for your character as an aid to \nwriting?\nNo.\n\n&gt; I notice the need for chapters and scenes any criteria on deciding\n&gt; whether a chapter is &#39;over&#39; so to speak?\nI usually like to end the chapter on some kind of tension point .  \nHowever, sometimes it occurs only because as I generally write from \n3rd person, I need to shift both characters and time period. If \nsomething is occurring simultaneously, there isn&#39;t always a need.  \nHowever I sometimes also break to give the reader some distance \nbetween one part and another.\n\n&gt; Anyone want to share how weird it is to try to think as someone of \nthe\n&gt; opposite gender? :)\nI enjoy it... but that&#39;s because I like puttin gmy theories on how \nmen think to paper.  Honestly too much of one gender gives me a \nheadache ^_^\n\n&gt; P.S. I have considered livejournal...I just don&#39;t think the world is\n&gt; ready for my scary scary scary thoughts (much better to keep them to\n&gt; myself!)\n\nI have a few blogs and think it&#39;s an excellent way to practice your \nwriting - even if you&#39;re not writing a fic -- AND a good way of \ngetting yourself used to expressing yourself more.  I enjoy reading \nweblogs too == especially when people are very honest.   It gives you \ninsight into human nature... \n\nS\n\n\n"
