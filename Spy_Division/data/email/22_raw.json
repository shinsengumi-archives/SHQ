Hey,\nit was the Revolution, for crying out loud! There _was_ blood flow=\r\ning\nin the streets and secret trysts in inns and teahouses! Ehem...right.\nD=\r\nisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based on anything.\nYou _=\r\nmay_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entire\nShinsengumi=\r\n to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nThank you.\n\n\nCha=\r\npter 4\n\n\tOut on patrol, Hiro had to do his best to keep from grinning like =\r\nan\nidiot. He still couldn&#39;t believe his eyes=97he was on patrol in Kyoto\nwi=\r\nth the Shinsengumi, wearing the blue overcoat with white\nmountain-shaped tr=\r\niangles on the sleeves, wearing swords like his\nsamurai ancestors, and walk=\r\ning in step with Saitou Hajime&#39;s 3rd Unit.\nHe let the whole experience, the=\r\n atmosphere and all the sights,\nsounds, and smells of Kyoto, sink in.\n\tAs h=\r\ne walked, he let his eyes wander around. Kyoto in these days was\nnothing li=\r\nke he&#39;d ever seen in photographs=97even the surviving\nbuildings from the pe=\r\nriod didn&#39;t look this good, this clean. The day\nwas calm, making the city, =\r\neven in these bloody days, seem worthy of\nthe name &quot;Peaceful Capital&quot;. Hiro=\r\n also noticed, with some degree of\namusement, that anywhere the unit went, =\r\npeople would entirely clear\nthe street, some going so far as to even avert =\r\ntheir eyes. We&#39;re so\ngood, we&#39;re bad=85he thought with a chuckle.\n\tSaitou o=\r\nrdered the unit to halt. When Hiro noticed where they were,\nhe stopped smil=\r\ning. In all the excitement, he&#39;d never asked the date.\nNow he suddenly knew=\r\n=97June 20, 1864. This was the date of the pivotal\narrest that took place h=\r\nere, at the Masuya used clothing store.\n\tWith a sweep of his hand, Saitou o=\r\nrdered the unit to surround the\nbuilding, cutting off all possible routes o=\r\nf escape. Hiro began moving\ntoward one of the groups, but Saitou motioned h=\r\nim back to the front.\nSo I&#39;m still being tested, thought Hiro, as he joined=\r\n the four men who\nwere with the captain. After a couple of uneasy moments, =\r\nthey\nannounced themselves.\n\t&quot;We are the Shinsengumi!&quot; called Saitou. &quot;By or=\r\nder of the Kyoto\nMilitary Commission, we wish to speak with the owner of th=\r\nis shop!&quot;\n\tA short man with furtive, darting eyes stepped forward.\n\t&quot;I&#39;m Ma=\r\nsuya Kiemon.You want something?&quot; he drawled, in Japanese heavy\nwith a south=\r\nern accent, much like the accent characteristic of the\nAmerican south. The =\r\nshopworkers, who all seemed to have a similar air\nabout them, suddenly tens=\r\ned up.\n&quot;We&#39;ve received reports of rebel activity around here. Have\nyou=85no=\r\nticed anything?&quot;\n\tIn what seemed like a matter of seconds, half a dozen con=\r\ncealed\nblades were pointed at Saitou and his group.\n\tI guess that answers t=\r\nhe question, thought Hiro darkly.\n\t&quot;Don&#39;t make me laugh,&quot; sighed Saitou, sl=\r\nowly bringing his hand toward\nthe hilt of his sword. &quot;You Ishin dogs are on=\r\nly going to make it worse\nfor yourselves.&quot;\n\t&quot;Get `im, boys,&quot; growled Masuya=\r\n.\n\tHiro didn&#39;t wait for someone to come at him. Drawing his sword, he\ngritt=\r\ned his teeth and went toward the nearest enemy. He tried to do\nhis best to =\r\nfocus on the battle, and not on the fact that his sword,\nwhich he believed =\r\nwas &quot;life-giving&quot; and protective, was actually being\nused to kill. Rebel ex=\r\ntremists or not, killing was killing.\n\tMoments later, the rest of the Third=\r\n squad poured in through the\nother entrances, quickly crushing any resistan=\r\nce. Soon Masuya was left\nalone, standing amidst the bodies of his associate=\r\ns, with over two\ndozen swords pointed at him.\n\t&quot;Surrender,&quot; said Saitou, gl=\r\naring at him with his piercing, wolf-eyed\ngaze. Masuya quietly held his han=\r\nds up in the air, palms facing\noutward. Someone found some rope, and quickl=\r\ny bound his hands. Another\npatrolman searched him thoroughly for any hidden=\r\n weapons. When all was\nsecure, Saitou nodded.\n\t&quot;Two people go and notify th=\r\ne Military Commission about what\nhappened, five people stay here as a guard=\r\n until they get here. The\nrest of you come with me to the Maekawa estate.&quot;\t=\r\nHiro bobbed his head\nrespectfully, and followed Saitou&#39;s group.\n***********=\r\n*\nThe 3rd Unit arrived at the Maekawa estate=97the &quot;other&quot; Shinsengumi\nhead=\r\nquarters=97rather quickly. It seemed that Hijikata was already\nthere, and h=\r\nad been waiting for some time. After Saitou delivered a\nface-to-face report=\r\n, he handed Masuya over to Hijikata. Then the two\nShinsengumi leaders and t=\r\nhe prisoner, as well as a couple of other\nmembeers not from the 3rd unit, e=\r\nntered the small building in the back\nof the estate, and shut the doors. Th=\r\ne interrogation of Masuya Kiemon\nhad begun.\nThe 3rd Unit sat around the est=\r\nate idly, eating rice balls and sweets,\ntalking, catnapping, and in general=\r\n, resting their feet after a long\nday out on the streets. It was a good thi=\r\nng that the interrogation\nroom had been built as a storage building=97the w=\r\nalls and doors were\nthicker than usual, and thus blocked out any sounds of =\r\nagony that\nundoubtedly accompanied any interrogation by Hijikata Toshizou.\n=\r\nHiro quietly munched on a rice ball and thought to what was happening\nin th=\r\ne interrogation with disgust. History books on the Shinsengumi,\nas well as =\r\naccounts of Hijikata himself, seemed to be very good about\nrecounting this =\r\nincident.\nHijikata had Masuya hung by his ankles by the ceiling. After lett=\r\ning\nthe blood flow into the man&#39;s head until he lost feeling in his legs,\nH=\r\nijikata started to interrogate him, firing question after question at\nhis v=\r\nictim. Masuya wouldn&#39;t answer=85couldn&#39;t answer. Hijikata beat him\nrepeated=\r\nly, until his skin was raw and bleeding, and still Masuya said\nnothing. Fin=\r\nally, exasperated, Hijikata had metal spikes driven\nthrough the soles of th=\r\ne man&#39;s feet, and had placed lit candles on the\nprotruding part of each spi=\r\nke. Only when the hot wax dripped into the\nopen wounds in his soles did Mas=\r\nuya start talking.\nFirst of all, he admitted that Masuya Kiemon was a pseud=\r\nonym. He was\nactually a samurai of the Ishin Shishi named Furutaka Shuntaro=\r\nu\nMasayasu. Masquerading as a Kyoto merchant, he had slowly helped amass\na =\r\nlarge arsenal=97onlu one of several which were to be used in this\nattack. A=\r\ns it turned out, the Ishin Shishi were planning massive\naction in Kyoto. Ar=\r\nound the Gion Festival in mid-July, they planned to\nexecute a plan so inhum=\r\nan, so cruel, that even Hijikata apparently\ndidn&#39;t believe his ears at firs=\r\nt. They would secretly set fire to a\ndistrict north of the Imperial Palace =\r\nand allow the wind to spread the\nfire rapidly. In the ensuing conflagration=\r\n, they would kill as many of\nthe Shinsengumi and related shogunate forces a=\r\ns possible, and to top\nit all off, they were going to kidnap Emperor Komei =\r\nand whisk him off\nto Choshuu, the domain which was at the forefront of the\n=\r\nanti-shogunate movement, and with the &quot;approval&quot; of the Emperor,\n&quot;reinstate=\r\n&quot; the Imperial government. Hijikata had wanted to find out\nmore, but at tha=\r\nt point, almost mercifully, Furutaka Shuntarou\nMasayasu had died from a com=\r\nbination of blood loss and exhaustion. But\nthe Shinsengumi had found out th=\r\ne rest of the story through their spy\nnetwork, and ended up stopping the pl=\r\not in the first week of July, at\nthe Battle of Ikedaya...\nAt the thought of=\r\n Ikedaya, Hiro closed the mental textbook and thought\nof reality. He knew t=\r\nhat the Battle of Ikedaya lasted an entire night,\nand that there were sever=\r\nal Shinsengumi dead, as well as some people\nwho were wounded so badly they =\r\nwould never be able to see or wield a\nsword again. He thought of how he mig=\r\nht be one of those casualties, of\nhow Yuki would probably suffer in such a =\r\nfamiliar yet alien time, of\nhow she&#39;d be alienated because of her &quot;modern&quot; =\r\napproach to life=85\n&quot;Getting ahead of ourselves, aren&#39;t we?&quot; he muttered, g=\r\niving himself a\nslap to the forehead. &quot;One day at a time=85&quot;\n&quot;Neh, Tokugawa=\r\n-san,&quot; said one of his fellow 3rd unit patrolmen. &quot;We&#39;ve\nbeen on patrol all=\r\n day, and haven&#39;t had any time to ask you about\nyourself=85&quot;\n&quot;Oh. Yes, I su=\r\nppose that&#39;s right,&quot; said Hiro, scratching his head in\nembarrassment.\n&quot;Wher=\r\ne are you from?&quot; asked a man sitting next to him. &quot;I can&#39;t\ntell=97your acce=\r\nnt is=85vague.&quot;\nAs with Hijikata that morning, Hiro decided to tell part of=\r\n the truth.\n&quot;Well, I was born in Mito, but my father was a wandering swords=\r\nman, so\nI&#39;ve been all around the country, training at various schools. None=\r\n of\nthe schools of the major styles though. Come to think of it,&quot; he\nadded,=\r\n &quot;traveling from school to school was how I ended up meeting my\nwife, up at=\r\n a naginata school in northern Honshu=85&quot;\n&quot;Skilled with the `spear&#39; and swo=\r\nrd, eh, Tokugawa-san?&quot; someone burst out.\n&quot;Ha, ha. Very funny.&quot;\n&quot;She is qui=\r\nte a sight, though,&quot; said someone else, around a mouthful\nof rice balls.\nA =\r\nshout interrupted them.\n&quot;1st Unit is here! 1st Unit is here!&quot;\nThe 3rd Unit =\r\ncondensed themselves, moving closer together to give room\nto the newcomers.=\r\n Hiro looked them over. Being the first unit, they\nwere the unspoken object=\r\ns of the envy of perhaps every other unit of\nthe Shinsengumi. He&#39;d thought =\r\nit only had to do with the fact that\ntheir captain was Okita Souji, but now=\r\n, having gotten a good look at\nthem, it seemed like every one of the men of=\r\n that unit was an object\nof envy, as well=97they seemed cleaner, taller, an=\r\nd stronger than the\n3rd Unit.\nSuddenly, Saitou emerged from the interrogati=\r\non room, quickly slipping\nout and closing the door behind him. He had his e=\r\nyes shut and was\nshaking his head in quiet disbelief. Tugging smartly at hi=\r\ns haori, he\nmoved over to his unit.\n &quot;Alright, let&#39;s head back to the Yagi =\r\nmansion, everyone!&quot;\nEveryone quickly got up and formed two lines. One of th=\r\ne men on the\nright raised the Shinsengumi flag. Though none of them had tra=\r\nined in\nWestern military drill exercises, the beat of their march was more\n=\r\nconstant a cadence than any Hiro had heard in his life. He did his\nbest to =\r\nkeep his step in time with the others.\nThough still in disgust at the inter=\r\nrogation, and still doubtful about\nthe future, Hiro nonetheless felt a sens=\r\ne of accomplishment. He&#39;d\nsaved Yuki&#39;s life, joined Shinsengumi, helped app=\r\nrehend a rebel, had\nfought side-by-side with one of the most famous swordsm=\r\nen of the age,\nand was on his way to gaining respect from his fellow patrol=\r\nmen.\nAll in all, he&#39;d had a good day.\n\n\n\n"
