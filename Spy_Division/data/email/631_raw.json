If I am not mistaken,saito killed them all. being, after all, the\nshinsengumi spy that hijikata sama sent in to deal with them. I believe he lured them in by\npretending to be a lush and not adverse to stealing sake to the endearment of the group.\n\nBut if you want to be all technical, in the beginning, it was the forced seppuku of the defected\nvice chief sannan or  Yamanami Seisuke. after he attempted to leave the group, hijikata sent okita\nsama to &quot;be his second&quot;. The forced seppuku proablye came as no surprise to him in the\nend.hijikata wrote the rules of the shinsengumi,but he hardly objected at the time., but  Toudou\nHeisuke  i am sure, felt more betrayed.since he was one of the originals with okita, yamanami,\nhijikata and koundo; before they were even  called the shinsengumi.\nthe other saw it as a power grab demonstrated by their lecherous deeds.\n\n\n--- Kizuisen &lt;eraille@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; (yes it is true.)
