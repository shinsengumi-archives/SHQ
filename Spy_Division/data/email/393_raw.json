If someone who&#39;s never seen PMK before \npicks this up, doesn&#39;t matter whether they watch the anime or read \nthe manga first, they&#39;ll still be pretty confused. I know I was \no.O;; but I had already seen the anime.\n\nStill, woo-hoo! I think I&#39;ll have enough by the time it comes out, \nand my Shinsengumi fangirl friends and I can watch it on halloween.  \n(And we&#39;re going as miburo this year...too bad it&#39;s on a sunday, and \nthank goodness haori are warm, considering how friggin&#39; COLD October \n31st gets in Nebraska...)\n\n\n\n\n"
