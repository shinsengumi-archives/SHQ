And great review!\n\nWhat I&#39;m cur=\r\nious about with this book and the film Gohatto is why the Shinsengumi is \nb=\r\neing used to explore the theme of nanshoku (male-male love)? Is there docum=\r\nented \nhistorical reasons for this? If not, why Shinsengumi and not - say -=\r\n the 47 Ronin or \nMiyamoto Musashi? Just curious :-).. I do plan on picking=\r\n the book up so thanks so much \nfor the FYI and the great post below!\n\n\n---=\r\n In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; &lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; [This post contains a brief introduction and\n&gt; review for a yaoi n=\r\novel.  The post does not \n&gt; actually contain yaoi and is rated-G.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Dea=\r\nr Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve read the early drafts of GOJOU HAJIME, a \n&gt; work of ya=\r\noi so here is my review of the work...\n&gt; \n&gt; Whereas well known films like T=\r\nABOO/GOHATTO move\n&gt; at a meditative pace and leaves key narrative themes\n&gt; =\r\nup to viewer interpretation GOJOU HAJIME is the exact \n&gt; opposite.  The nov=\r\nel&#39;s pace is very even and balances out\n&gt; the chapters by switching between=\r\n the various pairings and\n&gt; leaves *nothing* to the imagination.\n&gt; \n&gt; What =\r\nstruck me the most about GH is the tone or voice of the\n&gt; writing is very y=\r\nouthful and matches the age range of the \n&gt; main characters.  One will noti=\r\nce how effective this &quot;voice&quot; is\n&gt; in regards to the Hajime and Okita pairi=\r\nng.  The humorous interaction\n&gt; between the more mature pairing, Hijikata a=\r\nnd Kondou is absolutely\n&gt; exciting and contrasts with the dominance and sub=\r\nmission psychology in\n&gt; the Toudou and Serizawa couple.\n&gt; \n&gt; The homosexual=\r\nity in the work deviates for a refreshing mxf romance\n&gt; I&#39;ll not reveal her=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; My only complaint is I wanted more action. I hope that the female l=\r\nead\n&gt; becomes more developed in the sequel.\n&gt; \n&gt; GOJOU HAJIME is a relaxing=\r\n read where the plot is based on emotional\n&gt; and physical reaction between =\r\ncharacters.  \n&gt; \n&gt; [BLURB]\n&gt; During Japan&#39;s 1800&#39;s the samurai\n&gt; became dis=\r\nsatisfied with the shogun\n&gt; for opening their isolated nation to\n&gt; the West=\r\nern Barbarians. Many\n&gt; rebelled and plotted to overthrow\n&gt; the shogun and r=\r\nestore their emperor\n&gt; to a seat of power. The shogun\n&gt; arranged a band of =\r\nexpert swordsmen\n&gt; to manage the revolution. Given the\n&gt; name, Shinsengumi =\r\n(Newly Selected\n&gt; Corps), the brave men were\n&gt; commissioned to eliminate th=\r\ne unruly\n&gt; samurai and ronin, sanctioned to kill.\n&gt; The men lived for the m=\r\noment, for their\n&gt; lives could end in an instant. Under\n&gt; stressful circums=\r\ntances some of the\n&gt; men turned to one another for comfort,\n&gt; but how far d=\r\nid they venture from there\n&gt; into the realm of taboo?\n&gt; A fascinating histo=\r\nrical, gay, yaoi,\n&gt; erotic fiction for the adult reader 18+.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUY IT\n&gt; =\r\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3345828\n&gt; \n&gt; LEARN MORE\n&gt; http://www.samurai-on=\r\n-samurai.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
