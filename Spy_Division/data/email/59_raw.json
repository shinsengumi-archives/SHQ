If\nthat makes your stomach do the funky chicken, then read at you=\r\nr own risk.\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based on an=\r\nything.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entir=\r\ne\nShinsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nTha=\r\nnk you.\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\t&quot;Yuki-han! They&#39;re coming back!&quot;\n\tMidori pointed up=\r\n the path to where a thin cluster of lanterns could\nbe seen, slowly approac=\r\nhing the gate of the headquarters. Yuki stared\nat the shapes in the distanc=\r\ne, squinting to try and figure out if it\nwas really them. She knew that the=\r\n timing was right, and that they\nwere supposed to be back at any minute. Bu=\r\nt in Bakumatsu-era Kyoto, in\nthe dark, it was wrong to assume anything of a=\r\nny sort, especially that\na large crowd of people approaching the Yagi estat=\r\ne had to be none\nother than the Shinsengumi. Just to be safe, Yuki lowered =\r\nher naginata\ninto ready position.\n\t&quot;No one stands down until we&#39;re absolute=\r\nly sure it&#39;s them,&quot; she ordered.\n\tThe others also moved their weapons to a =\r\nready stance. Leaning\nforward, they strained their eyes in the darkness to =\r\ntry and make out\nthe faces of the approaching crowd of samurai. If it wasn&#39;=\r\nt the\nShinsengumi, then they were resolved to do their best in standing\nthe=\r\nir ground, in order to do their part for the unit. If it was indeed\nChoshuu=\r\n samurai who were approaching, they would not be allowed to\npass easily, an=\r\nd would pay dearly for every inch of ground they took.\n\t&quot;Go-yo! Kyoto Milit=\r\nary Commission! Official business!&quot;\n\tThe repeated shout suddenly sent a wav=\r\ne of relief through the women\nat the gate, making some of them relax the de=\r\nath-grip they had on\ntheir naginata. So it was the Shinsengumi, back at las=\r\nt after a long\nnight of fighting. By Yuki&#39;s estimate, they had been out for=\r\n about\nseven hours=97from around seven o&#39;clock in the evening, to the curre=\r\nnt 2\nAM. She&#39;d known the Ikedaya incident was long, but no account of it\nha=\r\nd prepared her for how long it actually was.\n\tEager to find Hiro, she ran u=\r\np to the approaching samurai. Kondou,\nHijikata, Okita, and Saitou led the g=\r\nroup in front, with Okita\ncarrying the Shinsengumi banner. Yuki noticed tha=\r\nt they weren&#39;t\nalone=97there were a large number of Aizu samurai with them,=\r\n as well,\nclad in black haori and looking generally more well-groomed than =\r\ntheir\nShinsengumi comrades.\nJust as Yuki was about to ask someone for the l=\r\nocation of the 3rd\nUnit, she noticed several wounded Shinsengumi members be=\r\ning carried on\nwooden stretchers. Moving smoothly alongside the stretcher b=\r\nearers,\nshe looked over the wounded with a combination of visceral disgust =\r\nand\nirrepressible curiosity=97she&#39;d never seen people wounded by swords\nbef=\r\nore. The cuts seemed so clean, so surgically precise. This was a\ntestament =\r\nnot only to the skill of Japanese swordsmen, but also to the\nrazor-sharp ed=\r\nge of nearly any Japanese sword.\nAs she walked amongst the stretcher bearer=\r\ns, though, one of the\nwounded suddenly caught her eye. She wasn&#39;t sure why,=\r\n but something\nwas familiar about his height and build. He had a large gash=\r\n on his\nleft shoulder, the red of his blood staining the sky blue color of =\r\nhis\novercoat. And his eyes=85His eyes were looking straight up to the sky,\n=\r\nbut were emptier than any she&#39;d seen before=85\nYuki&#39;s hand went to her mout=\r\nh in shock.\n&quot;H=85Hirotada-sama!&quot;\nHe didn&#39;t move=97just kept staring blankly=\r\n at the night sky, deaf to\neverything.\nYuki. If I fall=85what will you do?\n=\r\nYuki&#39;s eyes filled with silent tears as she remembered their\nconversation--=\r\n his question and her response, both equally shocking\nand yet, both were th=\r\nings that needed to be said.\n&quot;I would willingly follow you in death=85&quot; she=\r\n whispered, repeating her\nresponse of that day. Then she paused, and squeez=\r\ned his hand, choking\nback tears.\n&quot;Willingly=85but you&#39;re not dead yet.&quot;\n***=\r\n*****\n\tHiro was alone=97totally and utterly alone. He still wore his clothi=\r\nng\nand battle gear from the attack, but he was by himself, walking in a\nvas=\r\nt, open field of grass, stretching as far as his eyes could see.\nLooking do=\r\nwn at his shoulder, he found that there was a large blood\nstain on his unif=\r\norm, but that his shoulder didn&#39;t hurt anymore. He\nsighed in relief.\n\tI wou=\r\nld willingly follow you in death. Willingly, but you&#39;re not dead\nyet=85came=\r\n a familiar voice. His heart leapt.\n\t&quot;Yuki! Where are you?&quot;\n\tNo answer.\n\t&quot;Y=\r\nuki!&quot;\n\tHiro walked around the open expanse, trying to find where his wife\nc=\r\nould be, but to no avail. Exhausted, he sank down to the ground,\nlying on h=\r\nis back and looking up at the sky.\n\tNot dead yet=85came Yuki&#39;s voice again.=\r\n\n\t&quot;Not dead? Well then where am I? There certainly isn&#39;t this much\ngrass an=\r\nywhere in Kyoto!&quot;\n\tHe sighed in exhaustion, and closed his eyes.\n\t&quot;So what =\r\nbrings you here?&quot; asked someone. Hiro&#39;s eyes flew open, and\nhe found himsel=\r\nf looking into a face very similar to his own. His jaw\ndropped at the reali=\r\nzation that he was looking at his direct ancestor,\nthe fifteenth and final =\r\nshogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Moving to his\nknees, he bowed in awe.\n\t&quot;Yoshino=\r\nbu-sama!&quot;\n\t&quot;Obviously,&quot; he answered, sitting down next to Hiro. &quot;Now, I&#39;ll =\r\nask\nagain. You&#39;ve got a war to fight, a wife to protect, and honor to\nuphol=\r\nd,&quot; Yoshinobu paused, emphasizing each of the rest of his words.\n&quot;Why are y=\r\nou here?&quot;\nHiro stared at his ancestor blankly.\n&quot;I=85don&#39;t know. Really, Yos=\r\nhinobu-sama. I don&#39;t.&quot;\nYoshinobu&#39;s dark eyebrows furrowed.\n&quot;Rise.&quot;\n&quot;Excuse =\r\nme?&quot;\n&quot;Rise.&quot;\nHiro shook his head in confusion. He wasn&#39;t sure what his ance=\r\nstor\nmeant=97rise? Rise where?\n&quot;I&#39;ll say it again. Rise.&quot;\nHiro shut his eye=\r\ns. Whatever was going on, he didn&#39;t like it one bit.\nThe whole &quot;talking to =\r\nthe ancestor&quot; bit was really getting to be annoying.\n&quot;Idon&#39;tunderstandwhyyo=\r\nu&#39;retellingmetoriseIdon&#39;tgetitIreallydon&#39;tunders=97&quot;\nHis eyes flew open, se=\r\neing another familiar face.\n&quot;Shhh=85lie down, Hirotada-sama. Please.&quot;\nHiro =\r\nslowly eased himself back down onto the futon. Out of the corner\nof his eye=\r\n, he could see other men around him, similarly injured,\nreceiving treatment=\r\n from the serving women and a tall, thin man whom\nhe recognized from one of=\r\n his family&#39;s Bakumatsu photo albums as\nTakani Ryuutarou, Lord Matsudaira K=\r\natamori&#39;s personal physician.\nAs with so many times in the past two weeks, =\r\nHiro&#39;s mental history\ntextbook opened and began to narrate itself. He recal=\r\nled that after\nthe victory at the Ikedaya, some of the Aizu samurai had ver=\r\ny quickly\nbrought word to the Military Commission and Lord Matsudaira about=\r\n the\nShinsengumi&#39;s exceptional conduct in the battle. Thoroughly impressed,=\r\n\nthe lord had immediately sent Doctor Takani to the Shinsengumi, to\nhelp tr=\r\neat the wounded. Not only that, but the lord had also sent his\npersonal con=\r\ngratulations on the victory, as well as the promise of a\nmonetary reward fo=\r\nr the unit&#39;s exceptional service. All this and more\nwas in store, but not j=\r\nust yet.\n&quot;Take it easy=85&quot;whispered Yuki. &quot;You&#39;ve been wounded in the shoul=\r\nder,\nHirotada-sama.&quot;\n&quot;Yeah=85&quot; murmured Hiro. It still felt a bit awkward, =\r\nhearing Yuki\naddress him with such overly dignified terms, but given her de=\r\nfinite\nshock, it wasn&#39;t entirely a surprise. If nothing else, it certainly\n=\r\nfit the era better, even if he did prefer a simple &quot;Hiro-kun&quot; from\nher. `Wh=\r\nen in Rome=85&#39;, as the Americans say, he thought to himself.\nHe looked over=\r\n at his shoulder, which appeared to be tightly wrapped\nin gauze.\n&quot;I know th=\r\nat=85A Choshuu scumbag&#39;s blade passed right through it. It was\ncertainly th=\r\ne last thing he did, though.&quot;\nYuki took a moist cloth, and wiped Hiro&#39;s for=\r\nehead, cleaning off the\ncold sweat that had settled there during his period=\r\n of unconsciousness.\n&quot;Doctor Takani stitched you up, but you&#39;re going to ha=\r\nve to rest.\nPlease, just take it easy on yourself.&quot;\nHiro paused, taking a d=\r\neep, steadying breath.\n&quot;What about Ikedaya? What happened?&quot;\nYuki smiled, an=\r\nd gave him a quick kiss, quick enough not to be\nnoticed. Hiro smiled back a=\r\nt her, feeling a sort of healing that the\ndoctor could not provide, wash th=\r\nrough his body, cleansing him of much\nof his fatigue and agony, and leaving=\r\n him with a gentle feeling of\nwarmth everywhere. He knew he needed to rest =\r\nawhile, but he already\nfelt much, much better. Yuki leaned in close to him =\r\nand whispered, so\nlow that only Hiro could hear.\n&quot;You know what happened, k=\r\noishii. We won=85&quot;\n********\n\n\n\n"
