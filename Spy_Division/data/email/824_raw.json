But to \n&gt; understand=\r\n the novel you have to read the intro the author wrote---the \n&gt; author was =\r\nalso a huge nerd (school teacher and also T.A.ed as well)  \n&gt; the story was=\r\n pedantic but also pure PULP FICTION WITH SWORDS...it is \n&gt; still one of th=\r\ne best novels I&#39;ve ever read--truly spectacular.\n&gt; \n&gt; both these covers are=\r\n part of my novel (yes! it&#39;s almost done...just \n&gt; polishing some scenes no=\r\nw--I&#39;m so excited!  I know when the story is \n&gt; good and done when I want t=\r\no write parodies of it)...\n&gt; \n&gt; ONO SUZUE: A MAN OF TALENT* IN THE MEIJI ER=\r\nA\n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/OSBanner2.jpg [thank you Anne Cain =\r\n\n&gt; of http://www.dragonsdisciple for providing the character sketch)\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nt does feature Fujita Goro (fictionalized as Fujita Gorou)---his \n&gt; private=\r\n life is emphasized in chapter 4 although he enters the plot in \n&gt; book one=\r\n and appears in all 5 chapters.  Where there is Gorou, there is \n&gt; Tokio...=\r\nsigh...she practically dragged the laptop away from me.\n&gt; \n&gt; *the phrase Ma=\r\nn of Talent (or men of talent) was a real phrase used in \n&gt; books published=\r\n during the Meiji Era to describe two &quot;generations&quot; of \n&gt; men.  The older g=\r\neneration being the all stars of the IMperialist camp \n&gt; (Inoue Kowashi/Kou=\r\nashi, Ito Hirobumi, Okubo Toshimichi, Mori Arinori \n&gt; interestingly those w=\r\nho were more &quot;samurai&quot; like Saigo Takamori or \n&gt; Yamagata Aritomo was never=\r\n described as such)--it was applied to men \n&gt; who had toured the west and h=\r\nad a very strong literary side.  &quot;Men of \n&gt; Talent&quot; was also applied to tho=\r\nse who were just teenagers during the \n&gt; Boshin War and later on studied ab=\r\nroad and returned to Japan to \n&gt; modernize the country---it was a label use=\r\nd for atleast 2 Aizu samurai \n&gt; associated the Fujita family.\n&gt; \n&gt; The phra=\r\nse is so common that it stuck in my head and I wonder how it is \n&gt; written =\r\nin JAPANESE.\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case I was devastated when a coworker flipped thro=\r\nugh a print \n&gt; out and said &quot;oh this is like the Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;.  Aft=\r\ner I \n&gt; scratched her eyes out (I hated that movie, it was good in the \n&gt; b=\r\neginning then got old) I realized that the title does sound too much \n&gt; lik=\r\ne that Matt Damon flick (thank Buddha Jude Law was in it).\n&gt; \n&gt; I would lik=\r\ne to think my little story, which spans the Boshin War to \n&gt; the the 1880s =\r\nis going to be pretty different....yeah different.  \n&gt; Horror + history of =\r\nscience + a dash of dirty Meiji Politics + yaoi and \n&gt; straight sex =3D ove=\r\nr 60,000 words although I am editing out and revising \n&gt; now.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
