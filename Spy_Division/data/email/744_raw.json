Granted, it&#39;s not \nshinsengumi, but it doe=\r\ns include Saito (my fave character from that \nseries, yeah); I added it cos=\r\n I&#39;m pretty proud of the piece, and I \nwon&#39;t be producing any more related =\r\nart, as I will now start a Harry \nPotter piece, which will probably take as=\r\n long as this one took \n(couple of weeks, I guess?), and only one art contr=\r\nibuted felt too \nlittle.
