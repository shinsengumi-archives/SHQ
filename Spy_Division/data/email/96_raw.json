Actually I think they re-arranged \ntheir site, which is really a disadvantage to us since now I don&#39;t \nsee the sample pages or the online doujinshi that they used to do.\n\nHmm... From what Spiritus_Saitou said it&#39;s now for June? Hmm... The \npushed it back? In the e-mail they sent me it was May. Well either \nway if you want to see a couple of sample pages (non-explicit, \nfrankly a little bland - probably because they didn&#39;t know if I was \n18+) e-mail me and I will forward their e-mail to me.\n\nI love doujinshi... I&#39;m sure this is old news but for those who do \nnot know and is interested in Japanese doujinshi&#39;s go to \naestheticism.com, doujinshiplanet.com and dojindomei.com. They have \nboth yaoi and non-yaoi.\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan \n&lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Whoa! That looks like some &quot;interesting&quot; stuff.  I didn&#39;t check out \nthe \n&gt; link tot he publisher yet but I am safe in assuming this is an \nEnglish \n&gt; language thing?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally I&#39;m quite intrigued by that cover art as it&#39;s sort of \nkeeping \n&gt; in line with my current fanfic on ff.net that takes a really \ndifferent \n&gt; look at the Saiitou/Sano thing.
