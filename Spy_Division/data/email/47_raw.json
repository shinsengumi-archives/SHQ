You know...business as\nusual in the Bakumatsu.\nDisclaimer: This story is=\r\n entirely mine, and is not based on anything.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you=\r\n try to steal it, I will get the entire\nShinsengumi to descend on your head=\r\n and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nThank you.\n\n------\n\nChapter 7\n\n&quot;Present =\r\nidentification now, or prepare to die.&quot;\nHiro was enraged. He didn&#39;t care wh=\r\no the man worked for=97time travel or\nno time travel, Hiro was a Tokugawa, =\r\nand despite the general humility\nhe had, retained certain aristocratic tend=\r\nencies. To be told &quot;prepare\nto die&quot; from a no-name middle-class samurai was=\r\n like a slap in the\nface. As a respectable heir of the Tokugawa clan, Hiro =\r\nneeded to keep\nhis honor and dignity intact.\nSlowly, he started to close hi=\r\ns hands around each of his swords&#39;\nhandles, ready to slash the man in half =\r\nwhen he felt Yuki&#39;s hand\ngently restrain his own. Startled back to full awa=\r\nreness, Hiro took a\ndeep breath to calm himself, bringing his humility back=\r\n in control of\nhis mind, and deciding on being courteous instead of impulsi=\r\nve. Taking\na step back, he bowed low.\n&quot;I am Tokugawa Hirotada, a patrolman =\r\nof the Shinsengumi 3rd Unit. I\nhave no quarrel with you or your unit, Takad=\r\na-san.&quot;\nTakada snorted.\n&quot;Feh=85Tokugawa, indeed. I want proof. Now.&quot;\nHiro r=\r\neached into his sleeve, and pulled out his Kyoto Military\nCommission identi=\r\nfication paper which he&#39;d received right before his\nfirst patrol with Saito=\r\nu. He held it out to Takada humbly.\n&quot;Here is all the proof you need.&quot;\nTakad=\r\na&#39;s two assistant patrolmen moved in as their leader took the\ndocument with=\r\n one hand and scanned it quickly, keeping his sword low\nbut ready to strike=\r\n as he did so.\nHiro winced. An agonizing eternity passed as he thought of h=\r\now much he\nwanted to keep his head attached to his body, how he wanted to f=\r\night\nat the Battle of Ikedaya, and how he wanted to live through the\nBakuma=\r\ntsu. Lost in these and other thoughts, he almost missed the\nsound of Takada=\r\n&#39;s sword being sheathed.\nThe Mimawarigumi patrolman bowed.\n&quot;I=85see, Tokuga=\r\nwa-san. My apologies. As you know, we can&#39;t take any\nchances nowadays. At a=\r\nny rate, your papers are in order. You&#39;re free\nto go.&quot;\nHiro took back the p=\r\naper, folding it carefully and putting it back in\nhis sleeve. He bowed, not=\r\n wanting to take any chances.\n&quot;I humbly thank you.&quot;\n**********\n\tHiro and Yu=\r\nki paused. Having covered the rest of the way without\nincident, they had fi=\r\nnally neared their destination. Ahead of them lay\nthe gate of the Yagi esta=\r\nte, which seemed to gently beckon them back\nto work and the real world. The=\r\ny turned to face each other for one\nlast time.\n\t&quot;Well, back to work,&quot; Hiro =\r\nsighed.\n\tYuki nodded. Rather impulsively, she leaned in and gave him a quic=\r\nk\nkiss on the cheek.\n&quot;Neh, anata,&quot; she whispered sweetly, &quot;Again, I hope we=\r\n have the\nopportunity to repeat this sometime soon.&quot; She giggled as Hiro bl=\r\nushed\nbright red, conscious as ever of the social constraints and standards=\r\n\nof propriety of the age.\n&quot;Me too,&quot; Hiro murmured. &quot;As long as the Mimawari=\r\ngumi doesn&#39;t kill us\non our way home next time.&quot;\n&quot;Deal.&quot;\nThey took one last=\r\n, longing look at each other, and then proceeded for\nthe gate.\n*********\n\tU=\r\npon making it through the gate, the first thing Yuki did was proceed\nto the=\r\n kitchen to find Midori. Sure enough, there she was, working\nquickly with t=\r\nhe other women to make soup for the returning 5th and\n8th Units.\n\t&quot;Ah, Yuki=\r\n-han! Welcome back!&quot;\n\tYuki bowed politely.\n\t&quot;Good to be back, Midori-san.&quot;\n=\r\n\t&quot;Did you, um, get the errand done?&quot;\n\t&quot;Yes. Yes, I did,&quot; she said, stifling=\r\n the urge to laugh. &quot;Thank you\nfor allowing me to go.&quot;\n\tMidori exchanged a =\r\nknowing glance with her.\n\t&quot;Only you could&#39;ve done it. No one else, Yuki-han=\r\n.&quot;\n\tYuki bowed again in gratitude. Pulling a tasuki sash out of her\nsleeve,=\r\n she tied her sleeves up and went to work.\n**********\n\tHiro yawned. The 3rd=\r\n Unit had been patrolling since noon, and they\nhadn&#39;t had any trouble=97not=\r\n even from the Mimawarigumi. Of course, the\ntired, bored mood had led to jo=\r\nking amongst the patrolmen as they\ncontinued to make their rounds. Saitou d=\r\nidn&#39;t seem to mind=97he even\njoined in at times. The general atmosphere of =\r\nthe Shinsengumi was too\n`brotherly&#39; for any of its members=97with the possi=\r\nble exception of\nHijikata=97to be continually serious for any extended dura=\r\ntion.\n\tThe men&#39;s conversations covered everything, from politics to the\nwea=\r\nther to the latest sumo matches. Finally, Hiro was hit with the\nquestion he=\r\n&#39;d been expecting since the morning.\n\t&quot;So, Tokugawa-kun, did you have a goo=\r\nd day off?&quot;\n\tOkada Shichinosuke, a patrolman who&#39;d immediately befriended H=\r\niro on\nhis first day, tried to intervene.\n\t&quot;What Tokugawa-kun does on his t=\r\nime off is his=85um=85business=85Right,\nTokugawa-kun?&quot;\n\tHiro snickered at t=\r\nhe comment. Okada had quickly proved himself to be\npossessed of a sharp wit=\r\n, and constantly made clever remarks left and\nright, this one being no exce=\r\nption. He cleared his throat and tried\nhis best to follow up on the good-na=\r\ntured jab.\n\t&quot;Yes, it was my business, Okada-kun.&quot;\n\t&quot;Was it a pleasure doing=\r\n business, Tokugawa-kun?&quot; somebody asked\nbetween guffaws and chortles.\n&quot;Did=\r\n you have any associates?&quot; asked someone else. Unable to restrain\nthemselve=\r\ns any longer, the entire 3rd Unit burst into howls of raucous\nlaughter.\n\t&quot;S=\r\nhut up!&quot; ordered Saitou suddenly. &quot;Talk all you want, but I won&#39;t\nhave you =\r\npeople doing this while on duty!&quot;\n\tDead silence. Suddenly, someone spoke.\n\t=\r\n&quot;Neh, Saitou-san, do you need a business associate?&quot;\n\tSaitou tried to keep =\r\na straight face, but in vain. Suddenly, he burst\nout laughing with the rest=\r\n of them.\n\t&quot;I can&#39;t believe you people=85&quot; he muttered disbelievingly. &quot;Thi=\r\ns is\nsupposed to be the toughest city in the entire realm to work in=97how\n=\r\ncome you guys are still alive with such an attitude? How can this, in\nall s=\r\neriousness, be called a combat-ready unit?&quot;\n\tThis time, Hiro had the answer=\r\n.\n&quot;That&#39;s simple, Saitou-sama. We&#39;re the best of the best. That&#39;s\nbecause t=\r\nhe Ishin Shishi stay away from our sick sense of humor at all\ncosts.&quot;\n*****=\r\n****\n\tYuki wiped the sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand and\ns=\r\nighed. The naginata class had gotten off to a good start. After\nlunch, she&#39;=\r\nd received word by way of Midori that Kondou had approved\nof her teaching t=\r\nhe women how to use the naginata, and so the first\nclass had been scheduled=\r\n for the early evening.\n\t&quot;Very well done,&quot; she told the women, who all stoo=\r\nd leaning on their\nwooden practice naginata, sleeves tied back, hair tied u=\r\np in tenugui\nbandannas, and looking similarly sweaty and tired.\n&quot;Very well =\r\ndone indeed. You&#39;ve all got great potential.&quot;\nVery well done for the very f=\r\nirst day=85and besides, I don&#39;t know which\nof these women will end up where=\r\n=85hopefully I&#39;m teaching them something\nnot entirely useless=85and hopeful=\r\nly I&#39;m not changing the course of\nhistory too much, she thought. Then, smir=\r\nking to herself, she added,\nAt least I get to have longer classes here than=\r\n `back&#39; in 2004=85and no\none can really complain of techniques which are `h=\r\nard&#39; or `too\naggressive&#39;. After all, we are in a life-and-death struggle he=\r\nre.\nYuki bowed to the women.\n&quot;Thank you. That will be all for today.&quot;\n &quot;Dom=\r\no arigatou gozaimasu, sensei,&quot; they said in unison. &quot;Thank you\nvery much, t=\r\neacher.&quot;\nWith that, some of them headed for the baths, eager to relax for a=\r\n\ntime, while the others finished the necessary chores for the\nShinsengumi. =\r\nAs agreed before the class, the groups would switch after\na certain amount =\r\nof time, allowing for equal &quot;down time&quot; in the baths\nfor everyone.\nJust as =\r\nYuki was about to head over to the baths, she quickly glanced\nover at the m=\r\nain building, feeling a chill run down her spine as she\ndid so.\nHijikata To=\r\nshizou was standing outside his room, arms folded across\nhis chest. He shot=\r\n Yuki a glare. Even though no words were spoken,\nYuki got the message.\nKeep=\r\n yourself in shape. I&#39;m watching.\n**********\n\n\n\n"
