My friend who took writing for her college degree does the \nsame thing. It worked out for her... \n\nFor me though (and I hope I&#39;m not alone in this), since I don&#39;t \nwrite for a living, only for entertainment purposes and satisfy my \nneed for Saitou-sama fics, I write &quot;on the fly&quot; so to speak. I start \nout with a basic idea, a one liner, then dream up my characters. The \nevents happen in and around the idea I had in mind first. If there&#39;s \nsomething I really want to write about, I just put it in there, \nhoping that what I wrote was clever enough to be incorporated into \nthe story. Then it takes a life of it&#39;s own... There are somethings \nthat I wrote previously into the story that limits me from \ndoing/adding other &quot;crazy&quot; stuff. \n\nI rely heavily on previous knowledge since I don&#39;t &quot;research&quot;. \nWhatever I have at the moment is what&#39;s going in. I make note of it \nto my readers. Maybe I should research, but when you&#39;re on a \nbusiness trip or out in the middle of nowhere it&#39;s crazy to do that. \nSo I visit groups likes this and hope the information sticks until \nthe time I need to use it.\n\nSorry if this isn&#39;t much help. I hope you show us your work soon. \nPersonally, I think you should since it is YOUR writing, you should \nbe proud to show it off. When I first posted on ff.net, no one read \nmy fic but I kept going since it was MY story and I LOVE IT. It \nstill happens to me a lot, you know, no one reads it but so what? \nEventually someone will and when I read reviews it makes me feel \ngood, someone is enjoying what I wrote. \n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; \n&lt;secretarytocapt3@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have a really basic idea for one of the challenges~may take \nmonths\n&gt; to write :P\n&gt; \n&gt; I have some questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you guys outline the entire story first?\n&gt; Do you develop one character at a time on paper?\n&gt; -or- do you develop the situation and try to &quot;insert&quot; the \ncharacter?\n&gt; Have you ever written a &quot;diary&quot; for your character as an aid to \nwriting?\n&gt; I notice the need for chapters and scenes any criteria on deciding\n&gt; whether a chapter is &#39;over&#39; so to speak?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone use &quot;diary&quot; journal software of any kind.  I sometimes find\n&gt; myself synthesizing historical+fictional characters and then \ncomparing\n&gt; them with my own pathetic life or pondering their ethics/morality \nwith\n&gt; today&#39;s ethics/morality blah blah blah.  I guess I could use \nfilemaker\n&gt; pro or something.  Or anyone know how to setup something where I \ncan\n&gt; type in an internal dialogue like Q&A with a character?  As you can\n&gt; see I am going down a ~dangerous~ path.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone want to share how weird it is to try to think as someone of \nthe\n&gt; opposite gender? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumimb.com\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. I have considered livejournal...I just don&#39;t think the world \nis\n&gt; ready for my scary scary scary thoughts (much better to keep them \nto\n&gt; myself!)\n\n\n"
