Glad you found us though!\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, dabomb@t... wrote:\n&gt; --- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot;\n&gt; &lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) While writing you... ????\n&gt; &gt; a. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. \nDrafts \n&gt; &gt; are finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.\n&gt; &gt; b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever\n&gt; &gt; c. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 \nminutes, \n&gt; &gt; oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I don&#39;t have spell check, personally.  Or grammar check.  It\n&gt; annoys me.  I type up my stories in an old terminal window, and \nthen\n&gt; import each chapter into a spell-checker when I am finished.  I \ncan&#39;t\n&gt; stand grammar-checking.  This would be because I break grammar \nrules\n&gt; left and right.  But, I tell myself that is OKAY, since I do it on\n&gt; purpose, at least.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to start writing at about 9:00 every evening, and go until\n&gt; approximately 2:00am, when I go to bed.  There&#39;s a 45 minute break \nin\n&gt; there for going to work out.  Every 30-60 minutes or so, I get up \nand\n&gt; take a 2-3 minute break -at least-.  Or, at least I try to.  \nSometimes\n&gt; I forget.  Oops.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2) After writing you... ????\n&gt; &gt; a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important \n&gt; &gt; than Proof-read!\n&gt; &gt; b. One quick read. I&#39;m confident enough in my work.\n&gt; &gt; c. Oh who needs to check? It&#39;s too late. I wrote and posted the \n&gt; &gt; thing already!\n&gt; \n&gt; I proof-read each section after I write it.  Then I go back and\n&gt; proof-read the entire chapter when I am done.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) When you get reviews you... ???\n&gt; &gt; a. Oh that&#39;s nice. I&#39;ll check it in a bit. *feels good*\n&gt; &gt; b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review \nquick!\n&gt; &gt; c. Review... Well that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it. \n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to read reviews as they come.  But, if they aren&#39;t saying\n&gt; anything besides &quot;loved the fic&quot;, I also delete them as they come.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) When you get a critique you... ???\n&gt; &gt; a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!\n&gt; &gt; b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any \nbasis \n&gt; &gt; and then correct if need be...\n&gt; &gt; c. What? You didn&#39;t like it. Oh! I&#39;ve got to fix that quick!\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, definitely B.  Especially if they point out a timeline error \nor a\n&gt; historical error.  Then I correct it -right- away.  Grammatical and\n&gt; formating errors I tend to not get around to changing as quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) When it comes to updates you... ???\n&gt; &gt; a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\n&gt; &gt; b. I&#39;ll update exactly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a \n&gt; &gt; defined routine.\n&gt; &gt; c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this \n&gt; &gt; great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.\n&gt; \n&gt; I try to update at least two of my stories per week.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \n&gt; &gt; you...\n&gt; &gt; a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be \nwritten \n&gt; &gt; now!\n&gt; &gt; b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it&#39;s more \nconvenient.\n&gt; &gt; c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hahaha.  I tend to think C is the correct answer.  But, what I\n&gt; generally do, if I don&#39;t have the time to write it all out JUST \nTHEN,\n&gt; is get the first 3 or 4 paragraphs on paper.  Then I can come back \nto\n&gt; it later when I have time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\n&gt; &gt; a. Post on every messageboard, yahoo group and even e-mail close \n&gt; &gt; (not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they \nneed to \n&gt; &gt; read ASAP or else!\n&gt; &gt; b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an \nannouncement \n&gt; &gt; in a community where you are an active member or popular\n&gt; &gt; c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your \nfic \n&gt; &gt; in the depths of ff.net.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I tend to just do C, mostly, though I&#39;m doing more and more \nof\n&gt; B.  I think, for long stories, I let the momentum build up a bit, \nand\n&gt; then I try to find a community or forum where they would most be\n&gt; interested.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the questionaire, wounds!  It was fun!\n&gt; \n&gt; Angrybee.\n\n\n"
