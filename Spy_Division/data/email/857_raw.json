Only book 1 is up for sale right now.   \n\nBooks 2-5 will cost a mere $3=\r\n.00 because Book 2 is a bit \nmore &quot;literary&quot; and has a taboo e-pubs will no=\r\nt touch but the rest will \nfulfill your mxm, mxf and mxmxf needs and thrill=\r\ning plot requirements.\n(the last 4 books is being edited by me T_T)\n\nYou&#39;ll=\r\n be surprised by what is completely -true- in this story.  In \nother words =\r\nI wrote it for everyone here \n::points at SHQ SPY DIVISION members list::\n\n=\r\nThere is -no- way to place this story anywhere in the e-pub world.\n\nI put a=\r\nlot of thought into the character of Fujita Goro (I spelled \nGOrou in the s=\r\ntory) and he is an interesting figure throughout the \nnovel and he&#39;ll surpr=\r\nise you.\n\nWhere does your $1.25 go? The quarter is Lulu&#39;s fee.\n\nFirst the $=\r\n$$ goes to feed Shinsen-turtle seen here:\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/Sh=\r\ninsenMaggie.jpg\n\nXD\n\nMost importantly, some of the weird research I do is u=\r\nnfortunately not \nfree (T_T).  Like for example I had to send alot of mater=\r\nial to Japan \nthis week and my communication may or may not answer some que=\r\nstions I \nhave.  Serious we all know stuff FROM Japan was pricey, but sendi=\r\nng \nmaterial TO Japan is costly as well.  It was a frivolous cost but it \nw=\r\nas a path I had to pursue (the usual shot in the dark) any researcher \nwoul=\r\nd have to take.\n\nMaybe in the future we can all team up and write the mega-=\r\nawesome \nShinsengumi yaoi story and use it as a small fundraiser for SHQ? L=\r\nike \nedit it to DEATH, and sell it for a $1???\n\n\n\n\n\n"
