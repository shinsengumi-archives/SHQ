All of you\nunderstood...and gave very helpful advice.  I even learned something\nnew.  Men=humans.  Anime men=gods.  I got that straight\n\nP.S. Try reading some Yukio Mishima. He does a lot of delving into\nmen&#39;s psyches... sometimes to the point I want to scream &quot;just get on\nwith the story!&quot; (Thinking of &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot; and &quot;Forbidden\nColors,&quot; which I&#39;m currently reading, but psychological exploration\nseems to be one of his hallmarks in all his fiction... and he&#39;s\nwriting from a Japanese perspective, though again, it&#39;s actually\nuniversal.)\n\ncompletely OT...\n\nMishima was a pretty *interesting* guy.\nI happen to be reading THE TEMPLE OF THE DAWN (isbn 0394466144) right\nnow because it centers on a character&#39;s rebirth in Thailand (a country\nI am studying)\n\nI would like to call attention to a lengthy passage in The\nTemple...pages 169-174 which deals with the &quot;Land of the Pomegranate&quot;\n&lt;&lt;&lt; Miss B! (symbolism of this fruit is interesting here)\n\n[scary quotes from The Land of the Pomegranate passages...]\n\npage 170 &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s true brotherly love to terminate life\nwhile beautiful people are still young?&quot;\nThink Mishima&#39;s life o_O\n\npage 171 &quot;...there are only two roles for humans in this world: those\nwho remember and those who are remembered.&quot;\nI&#39;m thinking about the commercialized revival of the Shinsengumi and\nthe reexamination of the group by historians (by the way there are\nmany talks/lectures going on around Japan this year at museums etc\nsome are held at Shinsengumi club chapters too)\n\npage 172 &quot;The basic concept is memory, and in a manner of speaking,\nmemory is national policy&quot;\nThe Land of the Pomegranates talks about beautiful and ugly people\n(who worship the beautiful)...the worshippers remember the beautiful\npeople and the imaginative land is propelled by memory.  I&#39;m thinking\nabout historical figures which are constantly resurrected/reincarnated\n(Mishima talks about this too) would fit in the category of the\n&quot;beautiful&quot;\n\n***anyways the passages talks about errrr some very adult stuff so I&#39;m\nkeeping it rated G but yeah Mishima has amazing insight into the human\npsyche \n\n  \n\n\n"
