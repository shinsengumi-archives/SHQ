That black cat showed up several times in Peacemaker (was it always the same one?) as well as a white one. \n\n \n\n         Yes. The black cat. Is there a white one? I never noticed. \n\n \n\nThe black cat is given a brief mention in the new Hillsborough book \n(He wrote that Souji tried twice to kill the cat, but was too weak, \nand Souji&#39;s last words were &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;) And we saw Souji trying to get the cat in The Last Swordsman too. Is that it, or is there more to the cat story?\n\n \n\n        Oooh? Did that really happen? I never read the book and would definitely love to know the details. Anyone kind enough to direct me to something similar on the web? Even better... the name and authore of the book.\n\n \n\n        I guess we will never truly know Souji&#39;s last thoughts. We can only keep speculating. &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here?&quot; He sounds like he has truly lost it.\n\n\nI&#39;m assuming that the question about Toshi is, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t spending \nSouji&#39;s last days with him be more important than continuing a losing battle?&quot;  \n\n \n\n          Something like that. But, from my pov and in my stories, there will never be any niggling doubt as to which is more important to Hijikata. Fighting a losing battle? I think Souji would be more miserable if Hijikata just gave up without a fight: he never does things in halves. \n\n \n\nHmm...  In our world of fanfic - Of course, Our Toshi would move mountains to be with Our Souji. But, in reality would Toshi want to keep fighting for what they set out to do five years earlier?  Would he be dishonoring his comrades who died during this years long journey to Kyoto and back?  \n\n \n\n \n\nWould Souji be fighting at his side if he wasn&#39;t sick? And, TB is contagious.  \n\n \n\n           No question on the first statement. He would definitely go on fighting. TB is contagious. But there is another side to this strange disease. My hypothesis is that Souji had probably contracted it much earlier than we thought. I would put it somewhere around... 1862. No evidence, just gut feeling here for the fanfic world. And not everyone dies of TB. *Hint hint* Souji may not have been the only one with the illness... but he is the only one whose illness lay dormant a few years only to flare up like a dragonhead. I believe TB has flares and relapses. *Pause* I will have to do more research on that.\n\n \n\nLots of questions. Sounds like some good speculative fanfic here!  (Hint, hint to all our writers.)\n\n \n\n        Yes! Write, people! And don&#39;t forget the intricate relationship among the comedy Trio, Saitou etc...\n\nI read all the PMK fics and don&#39;t review.  Guilty as charged.  I \nappreciate all the talented writers sharing their work and in the \nfuture will let &#39;em know!  \n\nThanks for the story Divertimento, and yes, I am confused!\n\n \n\n        Sorry for the confusion, but I meant it that way. \n\nDivertimento\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n Yahoo!
