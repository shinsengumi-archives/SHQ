(actually THE ONLY SODA THE=\r\nY ARE ALLOWED TO\nCONSUME).\n\nHirotada Tokugawa noted that Aizu also had a mo=\r\nnopoly on ginseng so\nthis would be the new Mt. Bandai Dew with a bit of the=\r\n zazzy root.\n\nVery likely the Shinsengumi would shun the competing the &quot;Cho=\r\nshu 7-Up&quot;\n drink (Choshu 7 being a popular term labelling heroes of that do=\r\nmain)\nor the heavily artificially colored &quot;Satsuma Sunkist&quot; pop.\n\nNot to be=\r\n beaten, Satsuma forces wished to cater to its own homesick\nsamurai in Kyot=\r\no and opened up a chain fast food store symbolized by a\nGOLDEN &quot;S&quot; and gaud=\r\ny red and yellow color scheme.  Satsuma samurai are\nalso pejoratively calle=\r\nd &quot;potato&quot; samurai and no surprise they fry\nthem up and serve them with a b=\r\nit of salt:\nhttp://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t270/secretarytocapt3/Satsum=\r\naFries.jpg\n\nThey don&#39;t believe in &quot;super-sizing&quot; portions, rather they call=\r\n it\n&quot;Saigo-sizing&quot; meals.  WHich means the portions are SO HUGE they can\nev=\r\nen satisfy the apetite of big guys like Saigo Takamori\n(fictionalized into =\r\na heroic figure shown in THE LAST SAMURAI).\n\nFor general snacking Shinsengu=\r\nmi reach for Jozai-han rabbit/bunny\njerky. Do to a past product recall, the=\r\n domain now guarantees that all\ntheir goods contain NO BUNNY FUR. \nhttp://i=\r\n162.photobucket.com/albums/t270/secretarytocapt3/JozaiJerky.jpg\n\n[notes on =\r\nJozai Han by Hirotada Tokugawa]\nThe ancestors of Hayashi Tadataka, daimyo o=\r\nf the Jozai domain, hunted\nfor rabbits as a new year&#39;s dish for Nitta Yoshi=\r\nsada, the ancestor of\nTokugawa Ieyasu. Soon after, the Hayashi family began=\r\n serving a son of\nthe Nitta who was the founder of the family which became =\r\nthe Tokugawa.\n\nFrom then on, the head of the Hayashi family would present p=\r\nreserved\nrabbit meat to the head of the Matsudaira (later known as Tokugawa=\r\n)\nfamily on new year&#39;s day, and in return, the head of the Hayashi\nfamily h=\r\nad the right to receive his new year&#39;s sake cup before any\nother retainer o=\r\nf the Matsudaira/Tokugawa clan. \n\nBecause of this, the Hayashi family&#39;s &quot;tr=\r\niple-tomoe&quot; crest\n(http://www.kanjistyle.com/gif/JFC003.gif) had the kanji =\r\nfor &quot;one&quot; or\n&quot;first&quot; beneath it-- which created what was later known as the=\r\n &quot;Jozai\ntomoe,&quot; after the Hayashi family&#39;s fief\n(http://www.asahi-net.or.jp=\r\n/~me4k-skri/han/kamon/jouzai-hayasi-tomoe1.jpg)\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joza=\r\ni domain\n \n\n\n"
