I marked certain parts as {climactic scene #1} or \n{sensual} etc=\r\n because in doing so I am able to see the flow of the \nstory and see if it =\r\nhas something going on for the reader...that&#39;s \nhow I plan things.  Many sc=\r\nript writers also do this as a way of \ninsuring that their work has somethi=\r\nng movie makers can work with.  \n\nHowever people who are just curious are m=\r\nore than welcome to skim the \nplot.  I have a new story for every moment of=\r\n the day involving \nSaitou---however most are comedies set when he is older=\r\n (^_^)\n\nI have alot of ideas, but no time, or I don&#39;t want to waste time \nw=\r\nriting like...a really really long story no one will read.  My prose \nis re=\r\nally for non-fiction.  To have someone write non-fiction write \nfiction is =\r\nlike having a swimmer who swims laps in a pool do \nunderwater ballet.  It&#39;s=\r\n similar but not the same (^_^).\n\nI know there are alot of talented authors=\r\n and artists here who can \nwrite great stories for fanfiction.net and get a=\r\nlot of reviews.\n\nSo if you have nothing better to do over the summer give i=\r\nt a shot!\n\nI&#39;m still giving away my novel for free here:\nhttp://silapajarun=\r\n.1happyturtle.com/\njust contact the email on the site if you want it\nso far=\r\n I got 2 one sentence reviews\nand three other people have asked to download=\r\n the file, but I dunno \nif I&#39;ll ever hear from them again (LOL!)\n\n\n"
