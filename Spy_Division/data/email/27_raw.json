Hey,\nit was the Revolution, for crying out loud! There _was_ blo=\r\nod flowing\nin the streets and secret trysts in inns and teahouses! Ehem...r=\r\night.\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based on anything=\r\n.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entire\nShin=\r\nsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nThank you=\r\n.\n\nChapter 5\n\n\tWork done for the time being, Yuki sat leaning against a pil=\r\nlar on\nthe veranda and sighed tiredly. The day had been quite a long one, a=\r\nnd\nthe work, be it cleaning, cooking, or washing, never seemed to get\ndone.=\r\n To top it off, there were some off-duty patrolmen who seemed to\nlike shado=\r\nwing her and the other women, so Yuki remained guarded and\nalert. Tired of =\r\nthe day&#39;s concerns, though, she focused on the mist.\nThe view into the cour=\r\ntyard reminded her of the 11th century\nliterature she&#39;d studied in college.=\r\n In those days, Kyoto was the\ncenter of the vibrant Heian court culture, wh=\r\nich remained one of the\nmost well-known periods of Japanese history, primar=\r\nily because of the\nsheer volume of writing done by the women of the court, =\r\nincluding such\nfamous names as Sei Shonagon and Lady Murasaki. As Yuki reca=\r\nlled, one\nof the favored poetic devices of the Heian court ladies was the\nm=\r\nist=97usually used in reference to the mist shrouding a departing\nlover&#39;s r=\r\neceding figure. Just like how it shrouded the path that Hiro\ntook, earlier =\r\ntoday=85 she thought. The more things change, the more\nthey stay the same=\r\n=85\n\tYuki&#39;s consciousness started drifting. The rhythm of the raindrops,\nge=\r\nntly striking the roof of the veranda and the flat, worn stones of\nthe cour=\r\ntyard, had a nearly hypnotic effect on her. She closed her\neyes, and would&#39;=\r\nve fallen asleep had the guards at the gate not made\ntheir timely announcem=\r\nent.\n\t&quot;3rd Unit is here! 3rd Unit is here!&quot;\n\tShe&#39;d wanted to hear those wor=\r\nds all day. Suddenly, a poem from those\nbygone days of the Heian court leap=\r\nt to mind=85\n\tFaintly I saw you=97\na man spied for an instant\nas through th=\r\ne morning mist.\nAnd yet I fear that I may die,\nso clear is the love that I =\r\nfeel.\nYuki managed to get to her feet and give the customary bow, just as\nt=\r\nhe soaked samurai of Saitou&#39;s unit came through the gate. Once safely\nwithi=\r\nn the compound, they all made a dash for the dry safety of the\nsurrounding =\r\nrooms and the veranda. She caught sight of Hiro as he made\nit onto to the v=\r\neranda. Shaking the moisture off his new blue and\nwhite haori, he approache=\r\nd her.\n\t&quot;Tadaima. I&#39;m home.&quot;\n\t&quot;Okaerinasai, Hiro-kun. Welcome back.&quot;\n\tShe l=\r\neaned forward, and quickly whispered in his ear.\n\t&quot;Meet me behind the kitch=\r\nen tonight.&quot;\n\tHe nodded.\nI was hoping you&#39;d say that=85he thought. We need =\r\nto talk=85\n********\n\tThe rain tapered off a couple hours later, after sunse=\r\nt, leaving the\nground moist and the air slightly humid. Hiro didn&#39;t notice =\r\nat first,\nbeing rather occupied with sharing drinks with his fellow 3rd Uni=\r\nt\nmembers in one of the smaller rooms.\n&quot;Hey guys=85didn&#39;t the rain stop?&quot;\n\t=\r\nThe men paused for a moment, and listened closely, some halting cups\nof sak=\r\ne halfway in order to discern the lull that always follows a\nsteady rain.\n\t=\r\n&quot;So it did=85&quot; mumbled someone. &quot;Aw great, now it&#39;ll be humid=85&quot;\n\tThey all=\r\n glanced at each other for a moment.\n\t&quot;At least that&#39;ll keep those Choshuu =\r\ndogs off the streets for awhile!&quot;\n\tThe entire room burst out in raucous lau=\r\nghter.\n\t&quot;Yeah! That way, maybe they&#39;ll sweat to death, and that&#39;ll take car=\r\ne\nof them at last! `Topple the Shogunate&#39; this, you dirty slobs!&quot;\n\t&quot;Hear, h=\r\near!&quot; Everyone downed their cups of sake in hearty agreement.\n\tHiro bowed c=\r\nurtly.\n&quot;If you&#39;ll all excuse me, I need go outside for awhile and get some\n=\r\nfresh air.&quot;\n\t&quot;Awww=85alright, Lord Shogun. Hurry back, your Excellency, or =\r\nwe&#39;ll\nfinish all the sake!&quot;\n\tHiro laughed at the new nickname.\nIf they only=\r\n knew=85People around here certainly have a strange sense of\nhumor=85\n\t&quot;I&#39;l=\r\nl try.&quot;\n\tSake isn&#39;t what I need to calm myself down right now=85he thought.=\r\n\n Quickly making it out to the veranda, he was overjoyed at his\ndiscovery t=\r\nhat the rain had stopped. He slipped into his sandals and\nheaded out into t=\r\nhe courtyard, silently coming to the area behind the\nkitchen, trying his be=\r\nst not to be noticed. There wasn&#39;t much room\nbehind the kitchen=97just a na=\r\nrrow bit of a passage between it and the\nouter wall.\n\t&quot;Yuki?&quot; he whispered,=\r\n barely audibly. &quot;You here?&quot;\n\tHiro looked around, unable to see much in the=\r\n darkness. Suddenly,\nthough, he saw her form illuminated by the starlight--=\r\n leaning against\nthe outer wall, hands pressed together in a silent effort =\r\nto calm her\nimpatience, silent tears glistening in the moonlight glow.\n\t&quot;Yu=\r\nki.&quot;\n\tShe looked up suddenly, squinting to make sure it was him.\n\t&quot;Hiro=85y=\r\nou&#39;re here=85&quot;\n\tUnable to control herself any more, she threw her arms arou=\r\nnd him,\nand sobbed bitterly.\n\t&quot;I was so worried about you! When I asked the=\r\n date, and found out it\nwas June 20=85and I remembered that today was the d=\r\nay that Furutaka was\ncaptured at the Masuya clothing store. You were out on=\r\n patrol, and I=85&quot;\nshe buried her face in the folds of his kimono, unable t=\r\no go on.\n\t&quot;Shhhhh=85.&quot; he whispered. &quot;It has been a long day, for both of u=\r\ns.\nDon&#39;t worry, Yuki-chan=85things will work out.&quot;\n\t&quot;How can you say that?&quot;=\r\n she moaned. &quot;We&#39;re in the middle of a war,\nsiding with the doomed cause. T=\r\nhe Ikedaya battle is only a matter of\nweeks away, then the Battle of Kinmon=\r\n, then the minor skirmishes, all\nthe way to your ancestor Yoshinobu&#39;s renun=\r\nciation of authority, then\nthe battle of Toba-Fushimi and the retreat north=\r\n, then the bloodbath\nat Aizu-Wakamatsu and Hakodate=85can we really live th=\r\nrough this period?\nWho&#39;s to say you won&#39;t get killed on patrol tomorrow? I&#39;=\r\nve always\nloved this period, but now that I&#39;m actually in it, I feel so ali=\r\nen. I\nneed you. I don&#39;t want to lose you. =85&quot;\n\t&quot;Yuki=85&quot; Hiro sighed, runn=\r\ning his fingers gently through her long,\nglossy hair. &quot;If there were only o=\r\nne thing I could tell you to\nremember now, it&#39;d be this.&quot; He took her face =\r\nin his hands, and looked\ndeeply into her eyes, mesmerized by the way that t=\r\nhe moonlight made\nthem sparkle. \n&quot;Anata wa watashi no taisetsu na takaramon=\r\no desu=85you are my precious\ntreasure. I hold on to this one thought always=\r\n.&quot; \n\tYuki gave Hiro a gentle, loving squeeze.\n\t&quot;Thank you=85I w--&quot; she trie=\r\nd to say something, but he quietly\ninterrupted, drawing their lips together=\r\n in a long, bittersweet,\nsatisfying kiss that tasted of tears and longing=\r\n=85\nWaves of pleasing, delightful warmth washed over both of them,\nlighting=\r\n the air with a beautiful, surreal glow. Yuki sensed her knees\nget weak, an=\r\nd felt like she was almost melting in the comfort of his\nembrace.\n&quot;And even=\r\n though the word won&#39;t exist until after the end of this\nwar=85aishiteru, Y=\r\nuki-chan. I love you=85&quot;\n\tHer heart skipped a beat. She felt like it&#39;d been=\r\n so long since the\nlast time he&#39;d said that.\n&quot;Dai suki desu=85dai suki desu=\r\n, Hiro-kun...If I could shout it from the\nrooftops without getting arrested=\r\n by your new boss for disturbing the\npeace, I would.&quot;\n\tHiro quietly chuckle=\r\nd. Seems like her wit is the same as ever=85\n\t&quot;Hiro-kun=85something else. W=\r\nill we ever get to be alone?&quot;\n\tHe sighed again.\n&quot;I&#39;ll have to figure someth=\r\ning out. The guys in my unit have been\ntalking about the two of us this eve=\r\nning, offering `suggestions&#39; left\nand right about all the teahouses and inn=\r\ns they&#39;ve heard of from here\nto Edo, but I don&#39;t know anything for sure. Th=\r\ney&#39;re all drunk right\nnow, so I can&#39;t say that I trust what they say right =\r\nnow. Just be\npatient=97we&#39;ll get our chance.&quot;\n\tYuki&#39;s brow furrowed in frus=\r\ntration.\n&quot;People were so up-tight in this age. They had all the licensed\npl=\r\neasure quarters they wanted and more=85but when it came to people who\nwere =\r\nactually in love, they had to=85&quot; She lowered her voice, suddenly\nrememberi=\r\nng the secrecy of their meeting.\n&quot;I&#39;ll wait. I don&#39;t want to wait forever, =\r\nthough=85&quot;\n\t&quot;I&#39;ll get right on it=85&quot; he said with a smirk, getting her dri=\r\nft. &quot;I\ndon&#39;t know about my unit, but they say that Harada Sanosuke-sama of\n=\r\nthe 10th Unit is the guy to ask about stuff like that=97I&#39;ve read=85and\nhea=\r\nrd, that he seems to know a lot of the `right places&#39;. I&#39;ll ask\nhim, when I=\r\n get the opportunity.&quot;\n&quot;Thanks,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Can we stay like this for a=\r\n while?&quot;\n\t&quot;Yes=85please=85&quot;\nHiro closed his eyes and letting the peace and =\r\ncalm of the moment\nenter his soul. He knew well that he would need to hold =\r\nsuch peace\ndeep inside his heart, to get both of them through the long, tir=\r\ning,\nand bloody days to come.\n*********\n\n\n\n"
