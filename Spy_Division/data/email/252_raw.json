It started out that way, anyway...for example-- in &quot;Jidai \nMonogatari&quot;, my main character was not always Hiro-- in previous drafts, it \nused to be Yuki. I think that writing and thinking so much as a character of \nthe opposite gender actually helped me in the long run-- it helped me become \nmore balanced as an individual. In a way, I&#39;ve always been unlike other guys \n(I dislike watching sports on TV, I&#39;m generally more open and sensitive, I&#39;m \nnot afraid to cry openly), but this sort of helped me define that. Writing \nas Yuki opened me up to a new range of emotions and perception-- in a way, \nwhen I wrote as her, it turned things upside down.\n\nAnd something else (sort of related)-- much as it looks like a skirt (but \nisn&#39;t), I&#39;m not afraid to wear a hakama, or Japanese clothing, in public \nanymore. Like Tom Cruise&#39;s character said in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;-- &quot;I know \nwhy you&#39;re mad-- they make you wear a dress!&quot; lol! I&#39;m beyond caring whether \nit looks like a skirt-- in my mind, this is one way that I pay tribute to \nthe culture and era that I&#39;m studying. Of course I don&#39;t wear them all the \ntime, but I regularly put them on. As with writing from the POV of the \nopposite gender, wearing clothing of a different culture opens your eyes and \nhelps you look at things from a different angle-- like tying your hakama \nstrings tight so that you don&#39;t trip all over yourself as you climb stairs! \nlol\n\nAnyway, that&#39;s all for now.\n\n--M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
