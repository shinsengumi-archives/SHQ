According to Chief Kondou\n&gt; Isami &quot;We are most \n&gt; honored to have been chosen as Defenders of Kyoto\n&gt; and we wish the \n&gt; citizens to know that they can come to us any time\n&gt; of the day or night \n&gt; to seek help. It has been a memorable year and we\n&gt; thank our neighbors \n&gt; for accepting us with open arms.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; On an unrelated note Chief Kondou is asking for\n&gt; references for local \n&gt; window repair and graffiti removal services. Project\n&gt; bids currently \n&gt; being accepted at Shinsengumi headquarters, Mibu.\n&gt; \n&gt; # # # # # # # #\n&gt; \n&gt; Other news:\n&gt; \n&gt; A conservation minded citizen who chooses to remain\n&gt; anonymous has \n&gt; reported to the Times/Dispatch that while traveling\n&gt; some time back he \n&gt; witnessed a group of young thugs slicing down trees\n&gt; for no apparent \n&gt; reason other than their own twisted sense of\n&gt; amusement. The worst \n&gt; offender appeared to be a young lad of no more than\n&gt; fourteen summers who \n&gt; gleefully sliced through trunk after trunk with his\n&gt; katana.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the citizen tried to speak with the male adult\n&gt; who appeared to be \n&gt; the boy&#39;s guardian, he was greeted with a rude bout\n&gt; of obviously feigned \n&gt; coughing. Taking the hint the concerned citizen\n&gt; continued on his \n&gt; travels. He planned to return to that area soon on\n&gt; business and had \n&gt; hoped to take the matter up with local officials but\n&gt; has decided to \n&gt; postpone his trip due to the recent onset of an\n&gt; unexpected  respiratory \n&gt; ailment.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Note from the editor-in-chief) Rest assured dear\n&gt; citizens that we of \n&gt; the Shinsengumi will not tolerate such lack of\n&gt; disregard for the natural \n&gt; beauty of our local flora and fauna in this Han.\n&gt; (Anyone attempting to \n&gt; deface public property will be dealt with\n&gt; accordingly.)\n&gt; \n&gt; # # # # # # # # # #\n&gt; \n&gt; Pubic Service Bulletin:\n&gt; \n&gt; Runaway child report:\n&gt; \n&gt;  The missing child ran away from home approximately\n&gt; six months ago \n&gt; following an argument with his adoptive father, a\n&gt; potter from the Edo \n&gt; area. The boy&#39;s name is Himura  Shinta sometimes\n&gt; called &quot;Kenni&quot; He is of \n&gt; slightly below average height and build with reddish\n&gt; brown hair and a \n&gt; generally bad attitude. He was last reported in this\n&gt; general vicinity in \n&gt; the company of a band of older men. His father\n&gt; reports that he is rather \n&gt; immature for his age and that he believes these\n&gt; &quot;older men&quot; may have \n&gt; coerced his son into following them for purposes of\n&gt; an obscene nature. \n&gt; Anonymous information on this child accepted care of\n&gt; this newspaper.\n&gt; \n&gt; # # # # # # # # #\n&gt; \n&gt; Lost & Found:\n&gt; \n&gt; Lost kitten. Orange with green eyes. Belongs to a\n&gt; close friend who is \n&gt; heartbroken. Accidently let it out when returning to\n&gt; barracks and it ran \n&gt; off. If found, please contact the Captain of the 2nd\n&gt; Unit. (Repeat of ad \n&gt; from issue 1.0)\n&gt; \n&gt; # # # # # # # # # # # #\n&gt; \n&gt; Found--sort of\n&gt; \n&gt; Umm, I saw that cat. It&#39;s ...not around anymore.\n&gt; Let&#39;s just say it involves\n&gt; \n&gt; a spear, twenty Ishin men and the kitten in close\n&gt; quarters in the alley \n&gt; behind the all-night soba place. Ummm. I&#39;ll help you\n&gt; get a replacement \n&gt; pet for your friend.
