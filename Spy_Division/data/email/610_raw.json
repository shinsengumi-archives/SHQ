Yamazaki and Hijikata in the TV Asahi are my favs.  Yamazaki \nis just too cool, I love how he scoops up swords in the inn under the \npretense of moving them out of the way.  No way this guy would let\nany kunoichi get the best of him!  As for Hijikata...also very cool.  \nAlways in control and usually calm, but every once in a while you get \nto see why Okita called him the &#39;most hot blooded of all&#39;.\n\n \n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;iamgiffy2003&quot; \n&lt;giffykawaii@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And why do you love them? Just wanna know more about people in this \n&gt; community.\n&gt; I love Okita. Most from Peace Maker and also like the character of \nhim in \n&gt; RK. ^__^\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
