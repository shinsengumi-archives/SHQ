It&#39;s just a one stop shop for finding \nwebsites, commercial releases and fan fiction/artwork. The test site \nis up http://geocities.com/mg_batt and will launch in \nwww.shinsengumidb.com. It will just be links/summaries, no archiving \nis done. For a user to view your work they will have to use the link \nand follow it either to your own website or at the archiving website \nlike ff.net.\n\nNow I would like to merge the database here in the yahoo group and \ncopy over the entries to the website. I will be doing that \ntonight. . The summaries I will use whatever your have on your \nwebsite or ff.net. If you need something to be edited and for those \nwho do not want to be included, please drop me a line so I can \nremove/edit the entry. When the website is officially launched you \ncan also add entries.\n\nFor those other stories that are not listed here in the database, I \nwill be sending out &quot;I want your permission&quot; e-mails... *wounds \ncrosses fingers and mutters &quot;I hope they say yes&quot;.*\n\nThanks for your time... :O)\n\n~wounds\n\n---- To phil ----\n\nI got your e-mail. I will not be taking your entries in the group \ndatabase, until you are ready. So let me know because I don&#39;t want \nto miss out on those wonderful yaoi stories. :O)\n\nPhil, sec mentioned a link to the livejournal SHQ for the fanfic \nchallenges, can I go ahead and put the link on the website?\n\n\n"
