For crying out loud (in laughter)... that is the most adorable, funny, clever skit I&#39;ve come across in a long time. Especially because I love the Shinsengumi and really enjoyed PeaceMaker. Even if I never seen PM, or wasn&#39;t knowledgeable of the Shinsengumi, I still would enjoy it, simply because it is kewt, silly and VERY creative. You know, I&#39;m motivated now  to create something like that, but could never be as clever as this. Way to go! I certainly appreciate the work you put into doing this and then sharing it with us! THANKS for the TREAT!  \n   \n  Oh.. thanks also for letting us know they all didn&#39;t end up as someone&#39;s breakfast the day after... That would be SICK!!!!!
