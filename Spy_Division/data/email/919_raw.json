In some cases we have names of those \nfemales and=\r\n I&#39;d like to know if any Japanese researchers have ever \nfollowed up with f=\r\ninding those women&#39;s records (since they were geisha).\n\nIn the case of Sait=\r\nou Hajime he had Aioi Tayu.\n\nBut I think ultimately the audience finds the =\r\nm/m possibilities to \nbe more tantalizing.\n\n-------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n\nBut the Shinsengumi weren&#39;t the only group from that era =\r\nwho got \nthe &quot;yaoi makeover&quot;.  The Byakkotai&#39;s narrative as told by:\n\nHeise=\r\n, Richard. Ueber Loyalit=E4t in Japan;\numgearbeitet nach einem Vortrag ...\n=\r\nB=F6hm.-Krumau 1931 (72 pages)\n\nalso has homoerotic touches.  This is based=\r\n on an interpretation I read \nwhere Heise describes the bodies of the youth=\r\ns falling on one another \nin a very &quot;literary&quot; way which may imply homoerot=\r\nic bonds between \nthem.  I don&#39;t read German so I wouldn&#39;t know for sure an=\r\nd I don&#39;t have \nspecific page numbers in Heise&#39;s book where his writing see=\r\nms to lean \nthat way.  Since Heise was writing in an era where it may not b=\r\ne \nprudent to fully express his interpretation of the Byakkotai he may \nhav=\r\ne just held back from going overboard.  Then again my understanding \nis tha=\r\nt Germans attach homoeroticism to military groups so maybe he is \nwriting f=\r\nrom his own cultural standpoint.\n\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n------\n\nNow shameless plugging of a novella I wrote.\n\nAnyone in the modo fo=\r\nr *DARK* m/m set in 19th century Japan and WI USA \nshould try KATANA DUET: =\r\nSamurai&#39;s Forbidden Love. Coming soon to Amazon \nat the end of Sept 2008 in=\r\n print form but the e-book version published \nand distributed by BOOKSTRAND=\r\n.com is cheaper and more environmentally \nsound.  Some people know me on th=\r\ne list as being a nerd, well this book \ndoes have nerd stuff in it but I ca=\r\nll it historical details goodness \nwhich sadly I could not footnote in the =\r\ntext. (^_^)\n\nKATANA DUET is a very unique work which manages to combine a t=\r\nouch of \nthe Boshin War, the struggles of samurai after that period, immigr=\r\nation \nand an uneasy integration into an isolated area in the USA.  The the=\r\nme \nof blood ties, attraction between the same blood is mixed in with \nrese=\r\narch into a mysterious disease (it is actually TB).  Exoticism of \nOriental=\r\ns is conveyed through the vehicle of the circus (WI was the \nhome of the tr=\r\navelling show).\n\nIf anyone wants to buy it....(sorry only 18+ readers will =\r\nbe able to \npurchase)\n\n(This site has bookcovers which are NOT worksafe and=\r\n geared for a \nfemale audience)\n\ncontains book blurb, buy link and rated G =\r\nand rated adult excerpt\nhttp://www.bookstrand.com/authors/silapajarun/kd.as=\r\np\n\nFALLEN ANGEL REVIEWS ~ 5/5 Angels! \nhttp://tinyurl.com/5dowxz \n\nDARK ANG=\r\nEL REVIEWS ~ 4 Pixies\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6bd7fa\n\nBOOK TRAILER (rated-G and =\r\nis worksafe and my attempt at creating a \nmovie with just Windows Movie Mak=\r\ner)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D1nG_1YTJBjk\n\n\n"
