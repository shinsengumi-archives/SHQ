It ran mostly \nalong the Pacific coast and has been around since before they thought \nto keep track of history in Japan. It said there were 53 shukuba \nmachi along the route. These were posting stations were travelers \nrested and were controlled by the Bakufu. Remember, they did this to \nkeep track of potential threats to the Shogun. The road is mostly \ncovered by the Tokaido highway now, but you can still see parts of \nthe old road today and the Shinkansen line is supposed to run more or \nless alongside the old route.\n\nApparently it was one of five Gokaido or main highways during the Edo \nperiod. The site listed one other route. The Nakasendo road was about \n500km or 310 miles long and had 67 shukuba machi. It began in \nNihonbashi in Edo and ended in Kyoto, cutting through the mountainous \ncentral region of Japan. Because it was a much harder way, it was \nless travelled than the Tokaido road. \n\n\n"
