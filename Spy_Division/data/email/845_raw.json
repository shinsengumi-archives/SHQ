But I just need to set aside those \ndays either for =\r\nthe 4th of July or push it to next week because I \nhave to work and makeup =\r\nhours due to the midweek holiday.  But in any \ncase the site will unfortuna=\r\ntely look different from the artistic \ndesign we have now...but it&#39;s the on=\r\nly and most fastest solution we \ncan think of.\n\nI wanted the new look to fe=\r\nature a nice film on the front page to \nmake the site look lively.  Rather =\r\nthan an animated music video like \nthe dozens of those already on youtube I=\r\n was wondering if any fan \nwould like to make their own unique creation to =\r\nsubmit.  The film \nwould link to the Makoto Film Dojo where we store alot o=\r\nf multimedia \nmaterial.\n\nAn independent animated or live action film doesn&#39;=\r\nt have to be 5-10 \nminutes long---it can be as little as 1 minute long and =\r\nneed not have \nan extensive epic story.  It can be an expression of a poem =\r\nor \nfeeling.  You can take just a paragraph out of history and try to \nvisu=\r\nally capture it.\n\nOr illustrate your own fanfic or songfic and scan the pan=\r\nels and \ncreate a film (this is like drawing your own 1-2 page manga and th=\r\nen \nscanning it in pieces)\n\nif you are a photographer you can take pics of =\r\nthematic centerpieces \nand work them into drawings or combine with music\n\ni=\r\nn other words you don&#39;t need a budget or even a cast to create a \ngood film=\r\n...just your imagination! (^_^)\n\nMany people are afraid they need a fancy c=\r\namera, studio or high end \ncomputers so I&#39;d like to dispel that notion by l=\r\nisting some vids \nbelow which use a variety of techniques to create origina=\r\nl movies.\n\n[none of the vids have anything to do with Japan...but I am list=\r\ning \nthem to demonstrate that low budget can still be artistically \neffecti=\r\nve---you will notice that some vids utilize minimal movement, \nbut their go=\r\nal is to be original]\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DYhgMvirwzOU\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DU8WdI47rvdo\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DRP=\r\n4vepofWeg\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DsW6wWSCBCf0\n\nhttp://www.youtube=\r\n.com/watch?v=3Dfa0CJK8iQzE\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DZi_760pnGtg\n\nA=\r\nnyways this is almost the middle of summer already and anyone who \nwould li=\r\nke to put in some time for art may want to give this project \na try...what =\r\nI can guarantee is that when it&#39;s on SHQ...someone or \nrather alot of peopl=\r\ne will see it and it makes the work very \ngratifying.  \n\nYou can also uploa=\r\nd the film to youtube and email us the link so we \ncan embed it on the site=\r\n...or give us the original file to host as a \nbackup.\n\n\n"
