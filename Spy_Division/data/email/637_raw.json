I would love to hear from as many of you \nas possible--private email [bsher213(at)yahoo.com]may be best but here \nmight be fine if it&#39;s okay with Phil (?)\n\nThe main question is--- Would you buy a novel set mainly in Bakumatsu \nera Japan where the Shinsengumi appear as supporting characters?\n\nIf yes, would it make a difference if the novel was geared for 16-22 yr \nold (highschool/college) audience as opposed to a more detailed \n&quot;serious&quot; historical novel?\n\nWould you buy such a novel in an ebook format or only the typical \n&quot;bookstore book&quot; format? What if it was a &quot;trade paperback&quot; which \nusually retail for about $10-$15?\n\nThanks a lot for your time. Again you can respond to bsher213(at)yahoo.com\n\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n"
