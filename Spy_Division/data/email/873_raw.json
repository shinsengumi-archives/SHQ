As the captain of th=\r\ne first unit \nwalked\n&gt; down the hallway of headquarters he nearly knocked o=\r\nver one of the\n&gt; officers too slow to get out of his way as he walked into =\r\nthe gym.\n&gt; Harada was kicking the boxing bag, so he went to the shooting ra=\r\nnge\n&gt; instead.\n&gt; \n&gt; He took off the ear muffs to hear the shots and hoped t=\r\nhat with each\n&gt; bullet he could erase Hijikata&#39;s words from his mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What the fuck are you doing reading this =\r\ntrash?&quot; Isamu threw the\n&gt; print outs in Okita&#39;s face, &quot;Where did you print =\r\nthem? At a caf=E9?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m studying the enemy,&quot; the younger man was emot=\r\nionless as he \nstared\n&gt; at Hijikata, &quot;and to answer your question, yes the =\r\nHimeya coffee \nhouse.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They&#39;ll have to be inspected tomorrow, or perh=\r\naps closed down then.\n&gt; These businesses with internet access know the rule=\r\ns about\n&gt; disseminating incorrect information under the Homeland Security \n=\r\nAct,&quot;\n&gt; Isamu folded his arms, &quot;That bastard Mitsujima is in a refrigerator=\r\n \nat\n&gt; the basement of the Kyoto security department now where he can&#39;t \nsp=\r\nout\n&gt; anymore poison to confuse the people.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Okita collected the paper=\r\ns, &quot;Do you really disagree with him? Deep\n&gt; down you agree and many warrior=\r\ns believe his words. They&#39;re coming \nand\n&gt; we can&#39;t stop them=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nLieutenant Colonel shoved his subordinate back, &quot;Don&#39;t compare \nme\n&gt; to tha=\r\nt Mitsujima! I disagree with any motherfucker who thinks they\n&gt; can touch K=\r\nyoto when I&#39;m _on_duty_.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;We will become impotent, obsolete Hijik=\r\nata.&quot;&lt;i&gt; Okita swallowed\n&gt; and looked at the floor as his mind briefly ackn=\r\nowledged that leader\n&gt; of the Shinsengumi has not touched him for some time=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;_On_duty_? Or when you are in full control of the city?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Isamu=\r\n&#39;s dark eyes locked onto Soujiro&#39;s as his voice became icy, &quot;We\n&gt; know our =\r\nplace under A-han&#39;s mandate. Don&#39;t speak those words in\n&gt; public Okita.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Okita closed his eyes briefly if only to appreciate the delicate \nscent\n=\r\n&gt; of sandalwood which Hijikata used to perfume his clothes. For such a\n&gt; fi=\r\nerce man, Isamu paid close attention to his appearance and was \nmost\n&gt; care=\r\nful with his manners in front of representatives from A-han. \nOkita\n&gt; was o=\r\nne of the few who knew what the Demon was really capable of \nwhen\n&gt; at the =\r\nheight of his anger, but he was the only man who could \nsatisfy\n&gt; Isamu&#39;s l=\r\nust as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is Nippon&#39;s future?&quot; Okita looked out the window at=\r\n the Aizu\n&gt; Phoenix Unit helicopters moving slowly over the city in the dar=\r\nkness\n&gt; like large silent predatory birds, &quot;Mitsujima is not the only one \n=\r\nwho\n&gt; will weaken our country from within. He has followers.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Who wil=\r\nl be dealt,&quot; Hijikata stood behind Soujiro, but refrained \nfrom\n&gt; putting h=\r\nis chin on the young man&#39;s shoulder. Isamu shoved his hands\n&gt; into his slac=\r\nks, in a desperate attempt from running them across\n&gt; Okita&#39;s tone chest an=\r\nd torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; He tried to bring his focus =\r\nback to emptying the standard issue\n&gt; handgun into the target. Soujiro sque=\r\nezed his eyes shut and heard \nthe\n&gt; whish of a new sheet being replaced ove=\r\nr the target and pulled the\n&gt; trigger. He ground his teeth, &quot;We don&#39;t have =\r\na response to the\n&gt; American States. We can&#39;t do anything=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Another =\r\nhand pushed down the gun. Okita opened his eyes, &quot;Saitou?&quot;\n&gt; The captain of=\r\n the third unit was unshaven and tired from spending \nthe\n&gt; entire night in=\r\nterviewing the witnesses and survivors of the \nincident.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Soujiro, if =\r\nyou want to kill a member of the Shinsengumi, always \naim\n&gt; for the head. T=\r\nhe body armor developed for us by the Temple of \nLight,\n&gt; Hoko-in, would pr=\r\notect our vital organs.&quot; Saitou cocked his head at\n&gt; the target.\n&gt; \n&gt; Okita=\r\n put down his weapon and looked up, &quot;That son of a bitch Harada\n&gt; must have=\r\n replaced some of the targets.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Both captains stared at the life size,=\r\n color image of their leader,\n&gt; dressed in traditional attire peppered with=\r\n bullet holes. In a way,\n&gt; the paper representation was a shadow of the hum=\r\nble man a few of \nthem\n&gt; knew back at the Tama Regional Martial Arts Traini=\r\nng Center.\n&gt; \n&gt; The security camera recorded the image of one tall tan skin=\r\nned man\n&gt; with long hair held back in a pony tail and a slightly shorter ma=\r\nn \nwho\n&gt; could pass as one of the fashion models plastered on billboards \na=\r\nround\n&gt; the city, if only he smiled more. The small device was a state of \n=\r\nthe\n&gt; art closed circuit recorder which stored images and sound in the\n&gt; mi=\r\nburo&#39;s headquarters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unbeknownst to the wolves these cameras also rela=\r\nyed valuable \ninsight\n&gt; to the offices of A-han.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Shinsengumi, who =\r\nmade it their duty to watch over the city were\n&gt; themselves being watched v=\r\nery closely.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
