(I \nsuppose this is what I get for not being able to read and write at the \nsame time... density). I *do*, however, understand that wholescale \nplagiarism does occur. I&#39;m talking about ideas or actions. And how am I \nto convince someone I *didn&#39;t* know the same thing or something similar \nwas in a story of theirs&gt;&gt;\n\nIn the publishing world the most notable case that was won by the \noriginal writer was because the other writer (who oddly enough was a \n&quot;big name&quot; herself) was won because actually passages of the original \nauthor&#39;s text were copied. Stealing someone&#39;s exact original words is \nplagiarism .\n\nYou can&#39;t claim ownership to titles or  ideas in general\n\nThe person who tried to sue JK Rowling lost because while they said \ntheir idea was the same as the one Rowling used and that they used \nsimilar words for the same things Muggles etc. I do believe  they lost \nbecause they couldn&#39;t produce exact instances of copied passages of text.\n\nIf I&#39;m mistaken in this I&#39;m sure someone will correct me. I didn&#39;t \nfollow that Potter case close enough to keep up on all the exact details.\n\nFor those of us writing RK and PMK etc we only have a small body of \nreference material to work with the anime, manga and such so I think \nit&#39;s inevitable that we&#39;re going to overlap in some things such as \nSaitou eventually adopting Eiji. I used that in my Saitou/Tokio fic and \nI know others whose stories came after mine have as well.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
