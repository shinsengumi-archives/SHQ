In the first case, as I said, i=\r\nt=92s freely given, and it gives a little pleasure to you to see your idea =\r\ndeveloped by those people you talk with. But when it=92s ripped off from wh=\r\nat you have done with your effort, then it=92s not pleasurable at all. \n\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nI used to work as an intern in a studio office and I read screenplays\nwhich=\r\n were all the same the difference is in setting and sometimes the\nbosses ev=\r\nen like ideas but hate the execution and the poor writer who\nmade the criti=\r\ncal mistake of Fedexing a 500 treatment thing to the\noffice with no strings=\r\n attached (to try to get a contract or\nsomething) gets nothing...in fact it=\r\n is COMMON to have the bosses take\nthe good idea script...give it to a scre=\r\nenwriter they like to\nrevise...and so it doesn&#39;t surprise me that there are=\r\n bitter writers\nout there who insist the idea was theirs first.&lt;&lt;\n\n Yes, st=\r\nealing of ideas happens. But, actually, when some of these persons can prov=\r\ne ownership, they sue. The difference between being bitter and righteous is=\r\n the same  between having proofs and not having them. If you don=92t have a=\r\nny, just keeps it to yourself and your inner circle. When you have proofs, =\r\nyou simply go for the kill.
