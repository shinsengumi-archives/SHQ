The black cat. Is there a white one? I never noticed. \n  \n\n=\r\nThe white one is in the ep where Suzu and Tetsu fight in the sword \nshop.  =\r\nAfter the fight, Suzu and Yoshida are walking up a long \nstairway and two w=\r\nomen are walking down.  Yoshida steps aside to let \nthe women pass and Suzu=\r\n says something like, &quot;You&#39;re so kind, \nmaster.&quot;  Then the white cat runs a=\r\ncross their path.  \n\n\n\n\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oooh? Did that really happen? I never read th=\r\ne book and would \ndefinitely love to know the details. Anyone kind enough t=\r\no direct me \nto something similar on the web? Even better... the name and a=\r\nuthore \nof the book.\n\n\n\nThe book is Shinsengumi: The Shogun&#39;s Last Samurai =\r\nCorps by Romulus \nHillsborough.  ISBN 0804836272 \n\n\n\n\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess we will=\r\n never truly know Souji&#39;s last thoughts. We can \nonly keep speculating. &quot;I&#39;=\r\nll bet that cat is here?&quot; He sounds like he \nhas truly lost it.\n\n\nI found t=\r\nhat part of the book quite sad.  Hillsborough cited the \nwoman who was look=\r\ning after Souji as the source of the information.  \nHillsborough wrote that=\r\n three days before he died, Souji felt well \nenough to get out of bed, went=\r\n out to the garden and tried to kill \nthe cat with his sword, but was too w=\r\neak.  The next day he tried \nagain and failed again and was very distressed=\r\n that he was unable to \nkill the cat.  Then the next day (the day he died) =\r\nis when he \nsaid, &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;  So sad.  One of the best \ns=\r\nwordsmen in the Shinsengumi unable to beat his illness and being \ntormented=\r\n by that cat.  That&#39;s why I wondered about why the cat kept \nshowing up in =\r\nPeacemaker.  Didn&#39;t know if Souji had some history \nbefore with a cat...\n\n\n=\r\n\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TB is contagious. But there is another side to this strange \ndisease=\r\n. My hypothesis is that Souji had probably contracted it much \nearlier than=\r\n we thought. I would put it somewhere around... 1862. No \nevidence, just gu=\r\nt feeling here for the fanfic world. And not \neveryone dies of TB. *Hint hi=\r\nnt* Souji may not have been the only one \nwith the illness... but he is the=\r\n only one whose illness lay dormant \na few years only to flare up like a dr=\r\nagonhead. I believe TB has \nflares and relapses. *Pause* I will have to do =\r\nmore research on that.\n\n\n\nHmm...1862.  Before they left for Kyoto.  Are you=\r\n suggesting that he \ncontracted TB from someone we know?  \n\n\nMany questions=\r\n....\n\n\n--zhusanna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
