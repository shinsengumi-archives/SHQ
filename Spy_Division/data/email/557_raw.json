But still...\n\n-M.\n\n---\n\nAizu Jousitai\nTwo: Ame (Rain)\nAuthor: Shimazu Masayoshi (patriot014@...)\nRating: PG-13 (Violence)\nDisclaimer: None. No anime characters here...all real historical\npeople. I own this stuff! LOL No I don&#39;t...who DOES own these people? lol\nMajor Characters: &quot;Other&quot;-- Yamamoto Kakuma, Yamamoto Yaeko, Aizu soldiers\n\nNote: These stories are in no particular chronological order, I just\nwrite them as they come. This one is a bit more historically accurate.\nComments, please!\n\nAuthor�s note: Second installment, much more historically accurate. Will \npost a list of the women of the Brigade soon.  Happy reading!\n\nKyoto\nSummer 1864\n\nThe door of the inn flew inward with a crash. The swirling dust and rain \nobscured the entrance for but a moment, before the waiting forms outside \nbecame visible. As the leader stepped inside, his white sleeve insignia with \nthe black letter �Ai� on it could plainly be seen by one and all. The \nshopkeeper�s face contorted. He shuddered in fear for a moment, noting the \nwaiting soldiers outside carrying spears and guns.\n\n�We�re being sear�� his words ended with the squish of steel through flesh.\n\n�I am Yamamoto Kakuma of Aizu-han!� the squad leader brandished his sword, \nstained with fresh blood, at the cowering commoners. �We come on official \nbusiness!� The others poured in, the stamping of their boots resounding \nthroughout the building as some  spread out to secure the ground floor while \nthe rest bounded up the stairs. There was a ghastly stillness for a moment, \nand then a bloody heap fell down the stairs. They were right�there were \nShishi here, just like the spy report had said. Just as Yamamoto started to \nturn, there was a blur of motion.\n\n�Choshu!!�\n\nHe began to turn, blade hissing outward in a flash of light, before a loud \ncrack resounded in the dead air�Yamamoto only saw the dead body just as his \neyes began to adjust. At the far side of the room, one of his men leaned \nback with the kick of his smoking rifle. The remaining men and women, most \nprobably employees, cowered in shock.\n\n�Resist and you will all pay the consequences! Cooperate and the law will be \nlenient!�\n\nThe unit from the upper floor pounded down the stairs, kicking along a \ncouple of bound and struggling men. Yamamoto nodded, and pointed to the \nothers on the floor. �You, you, and you, tie these people up and take them \nto Kurotani for questioning. You and you, board up the entrance and go \ninform the Kuwana troops at Nijo. And you�� he pointed at the young soldier \nwho�d been so quick to shoot. �With me. Now.� With a sharp cleaning whip to \nhis sword, he sheathed and turned to leave.\n\nThe young soldier quickly fell in step next to Yamamoto as he emerged.\n\n�It stopped raining�� he shook his head. With his men in tow, he started on \nthe long road back to Aizu headquarters.\n\n�I did good, didn�t I?� asked the soldier with a slight cough. �Damn, it�s \nso hard to keep my voice low.�\n\n�Yae�� he whispered, keeping his own voice low. �Your technique is��\n\n�Clean?�\n\nYamamoto turned to his�sister, and proffered a hand towel from under his \nbreastplate. �I don�t know what to call it, but I guess�� She wiped her \nforehead and returned it to him.\n\n�You�re like the Murasaki Shikibu of gunnery.�\n\n�Does that mean I outdo you? Murasaki was better than her brother at \nwriting, you know��\n\n�Just shut up, Yae. People will stare.�\n\n�Haha�I�m better than you!�\n\n�Save it for the demonstration before Lord Katamori tomorrow.�\n\n�You�re on!�\n\n--\n\nGlossary and Notes:\n\n-han: suffix meaning �feudal domain�\n\n-Murasaki Shikibu was an 11th century poet and author of the world�s first \nnovel (The Tale of Genji), who outdid her brother in an age when women were \nsupposed to be very sparsely educated.\n\n\n\n"
