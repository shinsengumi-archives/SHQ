If \nyou&#39;re interested, I have three stories in progress available at \nhttp://www.fanfiction.net/~philalexandros .\n\n&quot;Kitaku&quot; (rated R) follows two timelines:  15 years after Sano has to \nleave Japan (post OAV &quot;Reflections&quot;) and flashbacks to 1878/79.  \nSaitou finds the mature Sano on the mainland and they begin a new \nphase in their association.\n\n&quot;Oujougiwa no Seizonsha&quot; (rated R) should probably be &quot;Seizonsha no \nOujougiwa&quot; (only our resident Japanese translator knows for \nsure... ).  Anyway, it&#39;s a rough one with Saitou having to bring Sano \nthrough opium withdrawal when the ahou decides he&#39;s had enough of \nliving in the Meiji Era.\n\nAnd &quot;Yasou&quot; (rated R), which I posted the intro to here on the list.  \nI got part of Chapter One written before we began this expansion \nproject for miburo and I haven&#39;t been able to touch it since.  I&#39;ll \ncontinue to post installments of this story on the list.\n\nI&#39;m very much RK and SaiSa obsessed, so that&#39;s likely the most you&#39;ll \nsee from me... though Barb&#39;s still trying her best to talk me into a \nSaitouxTokio story.  I&#39;m about to be introduced to PMK... who knows \nwhere my yaoi tendencies will lead me there.  And most have you have \nprobably already been introduced to these stories.  I&#39;m just making \nthem available here (and the website) for the future.  This is \nShinsengumi Headquarters, after all.\n\nMasayoshi&#39;s already regaling us with art in the Photos section.  \nYeah!  The rest of you --- get those fingers saving files to htm/html \n(just *what* is the difference between htm and html... one text, one \nimages??) and upload those babies!\n\nphil\n\n\n"
