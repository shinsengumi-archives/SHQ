So all your images shows up as &quot;x&quot; and when you \n&gt; try to plug in the image to restore it all you end up screwing up \n&gt; the timing...just one HUGE headache....so keep &quot;saving&quot; your work\n&gt; otherwise windows movie maker is a very easy to learn program\n&gt; \n&gt; secretarytocapt3\n&gt; weeping bitterly....\n\n\n\n\n"
