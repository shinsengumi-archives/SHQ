Template changes and Archives\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=173227807\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: spiritus_saitou\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve made some minor changes to the document over in the Files \nSection under List Business.  One thing is important --- a slight \nchange to the fiction template.\n\nFirst of all, we now have an LJ community, SHQ Spy Office, although \nit&#39;s not ready for business yet --- it really is just blank walls at \nthe moment and everything is restricted until it&#39;s ready.  It&#39;s going \nto take me a little while to get an archive site set up and linked to \nSHQ, so the LJ will be acting as a temporary archive site in the \nmeantime.  It will remain open only to members of this list who join \nthe LJ community until a real website is established.  Once that site \nis up, then I will free up the LJ to open membership and viewing.  At \nthat time, all stories stored and searched under &quot;Memories&quot; that \nauthors have indicated they don&#39;t want available through LJ will be \nremoved from the journal and Memories.\n\nTo try to put this plainly...  The LJ will be a temporary archive for \nstories posted on this list, closed to all comments and viewing \nEXCEPT for members of this list who apply for membership to the LJ \ncommunity, SHQ Spy Office.  When an official archive site is up, the \njournal and Memories will be edited and *stories* by authors who \ndon&#39;t want them available there will be REMOVED from the LJ community \nentirely.  After that&#39;s done, the LJ will become public.  That&#39;s why \nthe addition to the template.\n\nAs soon as I&#39;ve tweaked some things, I&#39;ll post addresses and \ninformation. Don&#39;t start pelting me with membership requests yet... \nplease.  :-)  Those of you who already have stories posted, don&#39;t \nworry about going back and changing anything on the header.  I can \nreach you privately about it.\n\nThat was the one important thing.  The other is just to encourage you \nto upload stuff to the Web Features at your leisure, but not to be \nshocked and dismayed if you find it in a different place than you put \nit.  I&#39;m not into deleting or censoring... just getting to be a \ncontrol freak about organization since I&#39;ve been trying to clean up \nmy hard drive... things keep popping up that I&#39;ve wanted and went \nlost because I obviously just stuck it anywhere.  MissBehavin&#39;, are \nyou sure I shouldn&#39;t be Hajime instead of Shinpachi?  How about we \ngive him a split personality... you can be the bored PMK &#39;Jime and \nI&#39;ll be the control-freak RK &#39;Jime... hmmm?  ;-)\n\nuh... I&#39;m not sure who I am anymore...  List Bitch?\n\n\n\n"
