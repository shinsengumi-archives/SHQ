I know some authors thrive on the stuff, but I&#39;m \nnot an author,=\r\n nor a writer, for that matter.  But I read your review \nsince it was on th=\r\ne thread and I just happen to love your rabbit \nstory.  In fact I bought it=\r\n from lulu earlier this morning and look \nforward to the rest.\n\nI have to a=\r\ngree with the review... That story deserves to be picked \nup by a publisher=\r\n that can do it right by exposure!\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I offered my story up to r=\r\neview to a harsh (but she is the best) \ncritic.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was like dangling a=\r\n baby seal in front of a great white shark.\n&gt; \n&gt; Check it out...\n&gt; \n&gt; http:=\r\n//www.mrsgiggles.com/pod/jarun_rabbit.html\n&gt; \n&gt; You can read other reviews =\r\nshe has given.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mrs. G is really really really hard to impress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\nat is neato is that it is compared to the \n&gt; http://www.dragonsdisciple.com=\r\n series which is generating alot of \nbuzz \n&gt; in the e-book biz.\n&gt; \n&gt; To lea=\r\nrn more about the story please visit:\n&gt; http://www.lulu.com/silapajarun\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; http://www.silapajarun.com (click on Ono Suzue to go to a detailed \nsite =\r\n\n&gt; on the entire novel)\n&gt; \n&gt; The entire novel (100K words) was truly writte=\r\nn for the fan of the \n&gt; Bakumatsu and Meiji Era and it was researched to gi=\r\nve that \nauthentic \n&gt; touch.  Only book 1 is up for sale right now.   \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Books 2-5 will cost a mere $3.00 because Book 2 is a bit \n&gt; more &quot;literary=\r\n&quot; and has a taboo e-pubs will not touch but the rest \nwill \n&gt; fulfill your =\r\nmxm, mxf and mxmxf needs and thrilling plot \nrequirements.\n&gt; (the last 4 bo=\r\noks is being edited by me T_T)\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ll be surprised by what is complete=\r\nly -true- in this story.  In \n&gt; other words I wrote it for everyone here \n&gt;=\r\n ::points at SHQ SPY DIVISION members list::\n&gt; \n&gt; There is -no- way to plac=\r\ne this story anywhere in the e-pub world.\n&gt; \n&gt; I put alot of thought into t=\r\nhe character of Fujita Goro (I spelled \n&gt; GOrou in the story) and he is an =\r\ninteresting figure throughout the \n&gt; novel and he&#39;ll surprise you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whe=\r\nre does your $1.25 go? The quarter is Lulu&#39;s fee.\n&gt; \n&gt; First the $$$ goes t=\r\no feed Shinsen-turtle seen here:\n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/ShinsenMa=\r\nggie.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; XD\n&gt; \n&gt; Most importantly, some of the weird research I do is =\r\nunfortunately \nnot \n&gt; free (T_T).  Like for example I had to send alot of m=\r\naterial to \nJapan \n&gt; this week and my communication may or may not answer s=\r\nome questions \nI \n&gt; have.  Serious we all know stuff FROM Japan was pricey,=\r\n but sending \n&gt; material TO Japan is costly as well.  It was a frivolous co=\r\nst but \nit \n&gt; was a path I had to pursue (the usual shot in the dark) any \n=\r\nresearcher \n&gt; would have to take.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe in the future we can all team =\r\nup and write the mega-awesome \n&gt; Shinsengumi yaoi story and use it as a sma=\r\nll fundraiser for SHQ? \nLike \n&gt; edit it to DEATH, and sell it for a $1???\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"
