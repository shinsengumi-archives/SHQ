Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts \n&gt; are finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.\n&gt; b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever\n&gt; c. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, \n&gt; oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) After writing you... ????\n&gt; a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important \n&gt; than Proof-read!\n&gt; b. One quick read. I&#39;m confident enough in my work.\n&gt; c. Oh who needs to check? It&#39;s too late. I wrote and posted the \n&gt; thing already!\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) When you get reviews you... ???\n&gt; a. Oh that&#39;s nice. I&#39;ll check it in a bit. *feels good*\n&gt; b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!\n&gt; c. Review... Well that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it. \n&gt; \n&gt; 4) When you get a critique you... ???\n&gt; a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!\n&gt; b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis \n&gt; and then correct if need be...\n&gt; c. What? You didn&#39;t like it. Oh! I&#39;ve got to fix that quick!\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) When it comes to updates you... ???\n&gt; a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\n&gt; b. I&#39;ll update exactly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a \n&gt; defined routine.\n&gt; c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this \n&gt; great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \n&gt; you...\n&gt; a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written \n&gt; now!\n&gt; b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it&#39;s more convenient.\n&gt; c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!\n&gt; \n&gt; 7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\n&gt; a. Post on every messageboard, yahoo group and even e-mail close \n&gt; (not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need to \n&gt; read ASAP or else!\n&gt; b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement \n&gt; in a community where you are an active member or popular\n&gt; c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find \n&gt; your fic \n&gt; in the depths of ff.net.\n\n\nHey wounds! Here are my answers:\n\n1) d. Have the whole d****d thing written out as a rough draft and all I have to do is type it, but I still split my time between answers b and c! In my defense, I usually only have the time to type up a story at like 3 or 4 in the morning, so I&#39;m trying to keep from falling asleep as I type.\n\n2) a. And then I find all the mistakes only AFTER I post it. Another side-effect of only being able to type up a new chapter at 4 in the morning, ne?\n\n3) a.\n\n4) d. Cry to Barb. Feel better afterwards. \n\n5) c. (You know how I am already! Of course, my job is generallly behind my long time between updates. That and too many stories going at once.)\n\n6) b.\n\n7) b.\n\n\n-MissBehavin\n \n\n"
