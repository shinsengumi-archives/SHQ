She presently unplugged from internet and will be without  stable connection at least until mid-July. Yet, she might find the chance to get a computer and answer to you later.\n \nBTW, these are my favorite guys in the NHK drama, though I have been told that Hijikata gets better and better since they arrive to Kyoto. I&#39;ve watched only until episode 11, but I&#39;m anxiously waiting for the last ones that have been aired in Japan.\n \ntake care\nFiruze\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From:   secretary \n  To: SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com   \n  Sent: Monday, June 21, 2004 4:11 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ_Spy_Division] Mary-Ann&#39;s   Corner\n  \n\nnow, I know the owner of the site should   announce\nthis...secretarytocapt3 is going to be pushy and rude as usual I   HAVE\nTO POST THIS HERE ^_^\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/mary_anns_corner/index.html\n\nFrom   the ff.net author\nhttp://www..fanfiction.net/profile.php?userid=374604\n\nPlease   read her thoughts+opinions on RK Saitou vs Hist.
