With all the excessive\ndrooling (Harada) it kind of made me wonder if her rice/cooking was\nreally that good.  They were talking about something else ---secret\nguy code--- LOL.  Nagakura was telling his friends to calm down and\nnot to take the race so seriously too almost like he was suggesting\nthey all go take a cold a shower LOL.\n\nIn the PMK world she is the only adult female on the premises...if she\nmade herself available then you would have the whole Taboo/Gohatto\nscenario and practice time in the dojo would get bloody.  When she\nassigns a room to the ninja girl she says &quot;its not like I can have you\nstay with the men&quot; -duh- so poor Ayunee -also- has to isolate herself\ntoo she does seem to live at headquarters because she was available to\ntend to Yamazaki&#39;s wounds. And she can&#39;t meet with HIjikata either\n(late night meetings with Yamazaki).\n\nBack to PMK Saitou he walks in on the guys imagining how the lady\nwould respond to Tetsu with &quot;No&quot; (hentai comments) and Saitou was like\n&quot;what do you mean &#39;No&#39; or &#39;stop&#39;?&quot; he is sooo out of the loop and you\nknow he was probably listening the whole time (in the manga his ninja\nqualities seem more prominent)...imagine him being dragged to\nShimabara by the guys.  Toudou makes extra &quot;special&quot; reservations and\nSaitou and an attractive lady are stuck in a room...he brings out\nthose prayer beads --- total turn off.\n\n\n"
