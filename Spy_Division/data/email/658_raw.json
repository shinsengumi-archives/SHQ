I think I have had \nenough excitement to be getting al=\r\nong with, for now.&quot;\n\nSouji said lightly, deliberately, &quot;I suppose the last =\r\nreal stir\nwas \nthe Ikedaya Incident.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah,&quot; the lady said. &quot;Who could forg=\r\net that? Hijikata-san\nis a kind \nsoul, no doubt he had his reasons. Tell me=\r\n, Soujirou, have you had \nsome sort of quarrel with him?&quot;\n\nSouji thought: A=\r\nnd that&#39;s what you wanted to ask me, with the bag\nof \ncandies, because you =\r\nare a kind soul too=85 And I wish I could be \nproperly honest with you.\n\n&quot;N=\r\no,&quot; he said, choosing his words carefully. &quot;But we have\nhad a \ncouple of ba=\r\nd news recently and I think he just wants to be alone. \nFor a while.&quot;\n\nShe =\r\nshook her head. \n\nA small pain shot through Souji&#39;s chest; he clutched it b=\r\nriefly,\nand \nSaizou squirmed uneasily against him.\n\nHe said suddenly, &quot;Did =\r\nhe never come back at all, ever? Your son?\nHow could he just go off and lea=\r\nve you, like that?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the lady said. &quot;But no, there was no\ns=\r\nign of him \nsince.&quot;\n\n&quot;To go away like that=85&quot;\n\nShe looked at him sharply. =\r\n&quot;Have you heard anything about\nhim.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, no, of course not.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re a f=\r\nunny boy yourself,&quot; the lady said curiously.\n&quot;Sometimes \nyou sound like an =\r\nold man. Comes from hanging around the Shinsengumi \nfor such a long time, I=\r\n suppose=85&quot; She hesitated for a moment,\nthen \ndrew closer. &quot;There was once=\r\n, a few days before he left, when we\nwere \nalone, he told me: If you have o=\r\nnce betrayed a great trust, you dare \nnot let yourself be trusted again, be=\r\ncause a second betrayal would be \nthe end of the world. I don&#39;t know if you=\r\n can understand\nthat.&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean he was frightened of what he might do?&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;And more frightened of what he had done. Whatever it was.&quot;\n\n&quot;So he ran awa=\r\ny. Poor guy.&quot;\n\n&quot;Poor me,&quot; the lady sighed.\n\nThere was a gentle tug at the h=\r\nem of his yukata. Souji bent slightly, \ntipping Saizou out onto the streets=\r\n where he capered excitedly around \nhis feet. The child gazed up at him wit=\r\nh wide adoring eyes; face \nalight with anticipation.\n\n&quot;Here you go, Miki-ch=\r\nan,&quot; Souji poured out a generous portion\nof \ncandies into the cupped hands,=\r\n smiling all the while.\n\nStuffing the candies into her mouth, the child tur=\r\nned suddenly and  \ngave him a clumsy hug before running off. &quot;Thank you,\nSo=\r\nujiro-san!&quot;\n\nThe lady laughed when she saw his smile brighten with pleasure=\r\n and  \nsurprise, &quot;Fond of you, those orphans.&quot;\n\n&quot;I am fond of them too, ver=\r\ny.&quot;\n\n&quot;Be careful then, won&#39;t you?&quot; Her round face was innocent\nof all  \nexp=\r\nression, but the words had force. Souji looked at her rather \ncoldly. \n\n&quot;Wh=\r\nat do you mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; the lady said carefully, pottering about her shop=\r\n.\n&quot;I am not \nat all sure what it is that is going on all around us, or wher=\r\ne it is \nleading. But those who know anything at all about the Shinsengumi =\r\n\nalso know that there is a fierceness to its power, like the white \nburning=\r\n of the sun.&quot; Suddenly her voice sounded to Souji very \nstrong. &quot;At the ver=\r\ny heart, that is. Other things, like humanity,\nand \nmercy, and charity, tha=\r\nt most good men hold more precious than all \nelse, they do not come first f=\r\nor the Mibu-Ro. Oh, sometimes they are \nthere; often, indeed. But in the lo=\r\nng run the concern is with \nabsolute order, ahead of all else. You are like=\r\n fanatics. Your\nmasters, at any rate. &quot;\n\nHer warm lyrical voice ended, and =\r\nthere was only the roar of bustling \nhumanity around them. Souji looked out=\r\n over the mass of bobbing \nheads, silent.\n\n&quot;That was a whole lot of nonsens=\r\ne, now,&quot; The shopkeeper\ncontinued \nawkwardly. &quot;But I was only saying, be ca=\r\nreful not to forget that \nthere are people in this city who can be hurt, ev=\r\nen in the pursuit of \ngood ends.&quot;\n\nSouji heard again in his mind his oppone=\r\nnts&#39; anguished cries as\nhe \ncut them down=85 And for a second another image=\r\n, unexpected,\nflashed \ninto his mind out of his past: the strong, bony face=\r\n of Kondo Isami, \ncold in judgement of a once-respected figure who, through=\r\n the frailty \nof being no more than a man, had once betrayed the cause of t=\r\nhe \nShinsengumi.\n\nHe sighed. &quot;I understand what you are saying,&quot; he said sa=\r\ndly.\n&quot;But  \nyou misjudge us, because you are a human yourself. For us demon=\r\ns,  \nthere is only the destiny. Like a job to be done. We are here simply \n=\r\nto stop any potential revolutions at all costs. The charity and mercy \nare =\r\nfor you, they are the only things by which men are able to exist \ntogether =\r\nin peace. But in this hard case that we are in, confronting \nthe Choshu and=\r\n the other such renegade factions, we can make no use \nof them.&quot;\n\nSouji rea=\r\nched down and lifted his hyperactive pet, cradling it \nagainst his chest as=\r\n it grunted in satisfaction. A fine rain began to \nmist the streets of Kyot=\r\no. He turned around then and began his long \nwalk back to the Headquarters.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Soujiro,&quot; The voice behind him called out softly. &quot;It is\na cold  \nworld =\r\nyou live in, my boy. I do not think so far ahead, myself. I \nwould take one=\r\n human being over all the principle, all the time.&quot;\n\nHe stopped then. &quot;Some=\r\ntimes,&quot; he said slowly over his\nshoulder, &quot;in \nthis sort of a war, it is no=\r\nt possible to pause, to smooth the way \nfor one human being, because even t=\r\nhat one small thing could mean an \nend for countless others.&quot; Then bowing h=\r\nis head slightly, and \ngathering round him his robes, he glided away.\n\nFor =\r\nall he knew, the lady&#39;s son could very well have joined a\nrival \nfaction. I=\r\nn that case, it was quite likely that he, Okita Souji, \ndemon-child of the =\r\nShinsengumi, have played some part or other in the \nman&#39;s postulated demise=\r\n. No one would know: he had already killed\nso \nmany. Perhaps the lady would=\r\n never know security: what right had he \nto value an individual less than t=\r\nhe potential collapse of a regimen \nas he knew it? Suffering is not increas=\r\ned by numbers: one body can \ncontain all the suffering the world can feel. =\r\nHe had judged like a \ntrue assassin in terms of quantity.\n\nTwilight had pas=\r\nsed into night; he wandered through the network of \nturns, with Saizo whini=\r\nng for his late dinner. The city was full of \nnarrow streets and alleys, al=\r\nl of which he knew like the back of his \nhand, but he was too careless of h=\r\nis own welfare and safety to be  \ncautious and he had left his katana in hi=\r\ns room.\n\nSo it came as no surprise when he saw Tetsunosuke waiting at the \n=\r\ngates to the Headquarters: &quot;Okita-san! Hijikata-san would have\nfifty \nfits =\r\nif he sees you in this state!&quot;\n\nSouji smiled and patted the boy&#39;s head abse=\r\nnt-mindedly as he \npassed. &quot;A little rain won&#39;t kill me, Tetsu-kun.&quot;\n\n\n=85 =\r\n=85\n\n\nHijikata Toshizo did have fifty fits when he passed him in the  \nhall=\r\nway. Soujiro stifled a snigger as he watched his brother-in-arms \nturn an a=\r\nlarming shade of bright purple. Could fits be quantified? he \nthought, and =\r\nburst out laughing.\n\n&quot;Souji! What did you think you were doing? A Shinsengu=\r\nmi captain \nreduced to this state! What is the world coming to?&quot;\n\nSouji fou=\r\nnd himself promptly divested of his robes and his hair dried \nby a pair vig=\r\norous hands. In minutes, he was clad warmly in a crisp \nclean robe, hair tr=\r\nailing down his back. \n\nBehind him, Toshi said unexpectedly, &quot;You are killi=\r\nng\nyourself.&quot;\n\nOne human being over all the principle.\n\nSouji lay down on h=\r\nis futon, curling into a ball, pulling up his \nknees. &quot;Oh, so would I,&quot; he =\r\nsaid sadly to himself. &quot;So\nwould I, if I \ncould. It would feel a lot better=\r\n inside me. But it wouldn&#39;t\nwork.&quot;\n\nToshi couldn&#39;t have known that his youn=\r\ng friend was not replying\nto \nhim when he said that. He stood up stiffly an=\r\nd left the room, \nremembering to close the screen doors firmly to shut out =\r\nany draught.\n\nHe thought of the day years ago and Souji kneeling in front o=\r\nf him, \nwith his wide innocent eyes on the katana bestowed upon him. How he=\r\n \nwished there existed someone to whom he could say he was sorry.\n\nThe End\n=\r\n\nThe end? Well, maybe not. We shall see. Meanwhile, if there is anyone \nout=\r\n there reading this, please review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
