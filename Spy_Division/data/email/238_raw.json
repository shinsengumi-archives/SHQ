Sorry it&#39;s so late.\n\n--M.\n\n\n&gt; 1) While writing you...\n\na. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts\nare finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.\n\nAND, I listen to a very wide variety of music while I type. And\nsometimes I write with pencil and paper.\n\n&gt; 2) After writing you... \n\n a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important \nthan Proof-read!\n\n&gt; 3) When you get reviews you... ???\n\n&gt; b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!\n\n&gt; 4) When you get a critique you... ???\n\nb. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis \n&gt; and then correct if need be...\n\n&gt; 5) When it comes to updates you...\n\n&gt; a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\n\n&gt; 6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \n&gt; you...\n&gt; a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written \n&gt; now!\n\n&gt; 7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\n\n&gt; a. Post on every messageboard, yahoo group and even e-mail close \n&gt; (not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need to \n&gt; read ASAP or else!\n\n\n"
