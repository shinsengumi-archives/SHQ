Mini-questionnaire for the writer in you.\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=172588298\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: maryannsfanfic\r\n\r\nHi Grace! \n\nA questionnaire is always a good idea=85 I just love questionna=\r\nires! \nHere are my answers.\n\n\n&gt;1) While writing you... ????\n&gt;a. Type non-st=\r\nop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts \n&gt;are finished. Spell=\r\n/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.\n&gt;b. Stop intermittently. Gra=\r\nb a smoke or snack or coke or whatever\n&gt;c. Stop stare at the computer scree=\r\nn 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, \n&gt;oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.\n&gt;\n\nDef=\r\ninitely (b). Strangely, I always find it easier to have new ideas \nwhile wa=\r\nlking or doing anything else. You have no idea of how many \ntimes I leave t=\r\nhe room, do something else, and then come back running \nto add my latest id=\r\nea. \n\n\n &gt;2) After writing you... ????\n&gt;a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-rea=\r\nd! Nothing is more important \n&gt;than Proof-read!\n&gt;b. One quick read. I&#39;m con=\r\nfident enough in my work.\n&gt;c. Oh who needs to check? It&#39;s too late. I wrote=\r\n and posted the \n&gt;thing already!&gt;\n\nDefinitely (a). After the first draft is=\r\n written, I put the chapter \naside for a whole week. Then I come back and a=\r\nlmost completely re-\nwrite it, and put the chapter aside for another week. =\r\nAnd then=85 Well, \nI think that you get a clear idea by now that this re-wr=\r\niting process \ncan be repeated many times before I&#39;m finally satisfied. The=\r\nn the \nchapter goes to the beta-reading stage and when it comes back, there=\r\n \nis generally another series of re-writes.\n\n\n&gt;3) When you get reviews you.=\r\n.. ???\n&gt;a. Oh that&#39;s nice. I&#39;ll check it in a bit. *feels good*\n&gt;b. Wow a r=\r\neview! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!\n&gt;c. Review... Well=\r\n that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it. &gt;\n\n(b) I&#39;m thrilled when I r=\r\neceive reviews and I have to read them right \naway. But when the review ale=\r\nrts follows a very harsh critic, then \nI&#39;m a bit anxious and hesitate befor=\r\ne opening the review, although \nwhile actually reading it, I forget about m=\r\ny fears. \n\n\n&gt;4) When you get a critique you... ???\n&gt;a. What was he/she talk=\r\ning about? This fic is perfect!\n&gt;b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and s=\r\nee if there&#39;s any basis \n&gt;and then correct if need be...\n&gt;c. What? You didn=\r\n&#39;t like it. Oh! I&#39;ve got to fix that quick!\n\nWhen the critique is justified=\r\n, and when I&#39;m truly mistaken, I will \nacknowledge the fact and try to make=\r\n the necessary changes. But \nunjustified or unfair critiques really morally=\r\n affect me. After I \nreceive such a thing, it generally takes me days befor=\r\ne writing \nanything again. \n\n\n&gt;5) When it comes to updates you... ???\n&gt;a. G=\r\not to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\n&gt;b. I&#39;ll update exac=\r\ntly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a \n&gt;defined routine.\n&gt;c. Update? D=\r\noes the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this \n&gt;great idea or if this=\r\n writers block ever goes away.\n\n(c) without any doubts. When was the last t=\r\nime I updated=85? Two months \nago=85?\n\n\n&gt;6) An idea pops in your head that =\r\nwould make for a good story.. \n&gt;you...\n&gt;a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your l=\r\naptop.. This needs to be written \n&gt;now!\n&gt;b. Take a quick note. Write about =\r\nit later when it&#39;s more convenient.\n&gt;c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!\n\n\n=\r\nGenerally (b) I have difficulties writing without have a very, very \nclear =\r\nidea of the plot. I tried that the other week, but=85 the re-\nwriting proce=\r\nss is very painful. The fic is full of plot-holes!\n\n\n&gt;7) You published some=\r\nthing, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\n&gt;a. Post on every message board, =\r\nyahoo group and even e-mail close \n&gt;(not so close) friend that you have thi=\r\ns great fic that they need to \n&gt;read ASAP or else!\n&gt;b. Let some friends kno=\r\nw here and there. Maybe post an announcement \n&gt;in a community where you are=\r\n an active member or popular\n&gt;c. Pray to God every night that someone mirac=\r\nulously find your fic \n&gt;in the depths of ff.net.\n\n(c) I fear to annoy peopl=\r\ne by making such an announcement, so I just \nhope that miraculously people =\r\nwill notice.\n\n\n\nMary-Ann (^-^)\n\n\n\n"
