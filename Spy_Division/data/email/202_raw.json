The woman is: &quot;See! This one wasn&#39;t there before,THEY grow&quot;, and Yagi is &quot;Yes, but isn&#39;t this one a otoko-mae?&quot; (otoko-mae: creme de la creme, manly and good looking, in summary, the best specimen of man). The guy playing Yagi, Itoh, is very popular as an actor, and so ironic, a delight. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI KNEW that&#39;s what Mrs Yagi was saying even though I couldn&#39;t understand \na word!\n\nSO the little slimeball with Katsura was Takasugi...\n\nHey Firuze can you find out what the deal was with the guy Serizawa \nkilled last night the one who lef the note for Kondou?\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
