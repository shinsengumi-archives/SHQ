For example,=\r\n in &quot;Akizuki Teijiro...&quot; many of\nus would not know the meanings of the word=\r\ns so Hirotada Tokugawa gave\na brief explanation.\n--------------------------=\r\n----------------------\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/art.htm\nNew Kondou Isam=\r\ni fanart by Hirotada\n------------------------------------------------\nhttp:=\r\n//www.shinsengumihq.com/fanficFriendofaFriend.htm\nOLD fanfic w/ new  cover\n=\r\n\nI mentioned this fic before when it was uploaded to\nhttp://www.shinsengumi=\r\nfics.com\n\nHowever, I found more interesting historical information well aft=\r\ner I\ncompleted the fic which may sort of buttress the fictional scenario.\n\n=\r\nI don&#39;t know what to say about this fic --- all I know is that\nhopefully hi=\r\nstorical Fujita Goro was unaware of the details\nsurrounding the fight for K=\r\nondou&#39;s life. \n\nSatsuma was more inclined to save Kondou while Tosa wanted =\r\nKondou\nexecuted based on their belief that the Shinsengumi had murdered Ryo=\r\nma\nSakamoto. The strongest voice came from Tosa man Tani Tateki. \n\nSo I wil=\r\nl explain how historically Fujita Goro was always &quot;one spot&quot;\naway from Tani=\r\n Tateki the man who really pushed for the death penalty\nfor Kondou Isami.\n\n=\r\nso here is a diagram (ignore the names in the [middle], just notice\nhow Fuj=\r\nita Goro is &quot;close&quot; to *Tani).  The relationships are\nespecially strong in =\r\nthe years right after Fujita Goro retired from\nthe Tokyo Metropolitan Polic=\r\ne Dept.\n\n#1 [VERY VERY strong connection]\nFujita Goro (friends w/) Yamakawa=\r\n Hiroshi (friends w/) Tani Tateki\n\n****this is also discussed by Japanese f=\r\nans, it is well known that\nFujita Goro spent alot of time at Hiroshi&#39;s hous=\r\ne and Tani ALSO was at\nHiroshi&#39;s home too!\n\n****the basis of the fic is bas=\r\ned on this strongest connection\n\n#2 [weak connection]\nFujita Goro (friends =\r\nw/) Takamine Hideo (opposition in career w/) Tani\nTateki\n\n#3 [weakest conne=\r\nction]\nFujita Goro (employee of) Jigoro Kano (friends w/) Tani Tateki\n\nthe =\r\ndiagram implies a LINEAR relationship however I should also add\nthat Yamaka=\r\nwa Hiroshi (+) Takamine Hideo and (+) Jigoro Kano all\ninteracted on a profe=\r\nssional and personal level extensively as well\nhowever it is NOT CLEAR if T=\r\nani&#39;s memoirs (WHICH CLEARLY STATED HIS\nINVOLVEMENT WITH KONDOU&#39;s DEATH) wa=\r\ns published during Fujita Goro&#39;s\nlifetime or not OR if the peole in the [mi=\r\nddle] such as Yamakawa\nHiroshi or Takamine Hideo (BOTH OF WHOM KNEW FUJITA =\r\nGORO was formerly\na member of the Shinsengumi) read Tani&#39;s own writings. So=\r\n if the\npeople in the [middle] knew then surely they would never let Tani a=\r\nnd\nFujita Goro interact even if Mr. Fujita was completely oblivious to\nTani=\r\n&#39;s past...\n\nAs I researched these interaction by examining the educational =\r\nnetwork\nI couldn&#39;t help feeling that somehow there is cruel irony involved.=\r\n (T_T)\n------------------------------------------------\n***coming soon, fan=\r\nart for Tokio&#39;s page\n***Yamaguchi Yukiko by Hirotada Tokugawa (niece of Fuj=\r\nita Goro, and\nstudent at &quot;Tokio&#39;s School&quot;) ok it was not technically &quot;Tokio=\r\n&#39;s\nschool&quot; but we&#39;ll call it that to keep things simple\n\nTokio + Yamamoto Y=\r\naeko (Joushitai) Fanart (housed on the Bakumatsu/Edo\nArt page)\nhttp://www.s=\r\nhinsengumihq.com/edoart.htm\n*I mentioned this on the edojidai mailing list =\r\nbut I guess maybe some\npeople here want to see Tokio fanart too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
