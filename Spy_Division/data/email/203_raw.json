The woman is: &quot;See! This one wasn&#39;t there before,THEY grow&quot;, and   Yagi is &quot;Yes, but isn&#39;t this one a otoko-mae?&quot; (otoko-mae: creme de la creme,   manly and good looking, in summary, the best specimen of man). The guy playing   Yagi, Itoh, is very popular as an actor, and so ironic, a delight.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI KNEW that&#39;s what Mrs Yagi was saying even though   I couldn&#39;t understand \na word!\n\nSO the little slimeball with Katsura   was Takasugi...\n\nHey Firuze can you find out what the deal was with the   guy Serizawa \nkilled last night the one who lef the note for   Kondou?\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan        \n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n\nSHQ   - Shinsengumi Headquarters\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\n\nComing   soon:  SHQ - The Website\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/\n\nSHQ   Spy Office -- SHQ LiveJournal\nhttp://wwww.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office   \n\n\n                Yahoo!
