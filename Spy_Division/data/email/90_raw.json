Most of the members \nlooks SO FAMILIAR :O)\n\nUmm... Just wanted to introduce myself first to be polite. \n\nmg_batt here from Miburo, edojidai and SHQ. My pen name is wounds in \nfanfiction.net. Crazy about Saitou-sama and a fast growing interest \non the Shinsengumi. I love reading the post in the groups, so many \ninformative people and it gives me something to write about. Not much \nof a contributor as everytime I get anything juicy someone is already \none step ahead. Oh well, that&#39;s how good the group is... :O)\n\nI write stories and poems that are Saitou-sama based. I like to \nwrite/read, alternate pairings a lot. I like to pair Saitou-sama with \njust about anyone. Just started last December and not really a \nwriter. Heck hated English and writing back in school, was more of a \nMath/Science person. So please don&#39;t kill me if by chance you read my \nfic and didn&#39;t like it. PLEASE? My bestfriend already did and she \nonly read one chapter...   :O)\n\n\n\n\n\nSHQ - Shinsengumi Headquarters\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\n\nComing soon:  SHQ - The Website\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/\n\nSHQ Spy Office -- SHQ LiveJournal\nhttp://wwww.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office \n\n\nYahoo!
