Read at your own risk.\nDisclaimer: T=\r\nhis story is entirely mine, and is not based on anything.\nYou _may_ read it=\r\n, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entire\nShinsengumi to descend =\r\non your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nThank you.\n\nChapter 6\n\n\tDawn=\r\n found Hiro eagerly practicing sword cuts in the courtyard,\ntaking advantag=\r\ne of the fact that he had the day off. However brief it\nmay have been, his =\r\ntime with Yuki the night before had left him\nenergized. In an effort to wor=\r\nk off the energy, he&#39;d woken up just as\nthe 2nd Unit headed out on patrol b=\r\nefore dawn, and made use of the\nmorning quiet to practice his technique by =\r\nhimself. Just as he brought\nthe wooden sword downwards to a chudan stance, =\r\nparallel to the ground,\nhe felt someone&#39;s presence nearby. Turning around, =\r\nhe saw a man with a\nlong fishbone between his teeth, leaning on a wooden pr=\r\nactice spear\nthat nearly towered over him.\n\t&quot;Ah, Harada-sama! Good morning!=\r\n&quot;\n\tHarada Sanosuke, the captain of the 10th Unit, started to laugh amusedly=\r\n.\n\t&quot;And what a good morning it seems for you, especially. I heard about\nhow=\r\n you got a `breath of fresh air&#39; last night.&quot; He paused for a\nmoment, appar=\r\nently very amused at the way Hiro&#39;s face suddenly turned\npale. &quot;Don&#39;t worry=\r\n, don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t tell anyone. But I can help\nyou and your wife, if yo=\r\nu&#39;re looking for some time alone.&quot;\n\tHe motioned to Hiro to come closer, and=\r\n whispered something in his\near. Slowly, Hiro&#39;s face lit up even more.\n\t&quot;Th=\r\nank you, Harada-sama! Thank you!&quot;\n\t&quot;Shut up, idiot,&quot; he said, good-naturedl=\r\ny. &quot;You&#39;ll wake up\nHijikata-san. Don&#39;t want him finding out, now do you?&quot;\n\t=\r\nHiro shuddered.\n\t&quot;Nope, definitely not.&quot;\n************\n\tNakamura Midori, the=\r\n woman in charge of the kitchen, was also up\nbefore any one of her colleagu=\r\nes, and was beginning the preparations\nfor breakfast, hoping to get as far =\r\nalong as she could until her\nassistants arrived.\n\tJust as she was about to =\r\nstart slicing some takuan pickles, Midori\nnoticed a familiar figure=97with =\r\na familiar fishbone=97lean in through the\ndoorway.\n\t&quot; `Morning, Mi-chan.&quot;\n\t=\r\n&quot;Good morning, Sanosuke-sama,&quot; she answered with a smile.\n\t&quot;How&#39;s work?&quot;\n\t&quot;=\r\nWell, you know=85the 3rd Unit is off-duty today, so I&#39;ve got extra\nwork on =\r\nmy hands. You=85um=85need anything?&quot;\n\t&quot;Actually, yes. I have a favor to ask=\r\n=85&quot; He strode over to her and\nwhispered an explanation in her ear.\n\t&quot;Yeah,=\r\n I heard about it, too=85I&#39;ll help you out, Sanosuke-sama.&quot;\n*********\n\tArou=\r\nnd half an hour later, Yuki strode briskly into the kitchen, with\na wistful=\r\n smile on her face. The events of the night before were still\nvivid in her =\r\nmemory. She&#39;d wished to spend the whole night with Hiro,\nbut knew that it w=\r\nasn&#39;t possible. So, in as high spirits as possible,\nshe&#39;d come to throw her=\r\nself wholeheartedly into her work. She bowed to\nMidori, and would have star=\r\nted helping with cooking the rice, had\nMidori not stopped her.\n\t&quot;Yuki-han=\r\n=85I have an=85errand for you to run.&quot;\n*********\nHiro was ecstatic. If what=\r\n Harada had told him worked, it&#39;d be a\nperfectly convenient and legitimate =\r\nway for him to spend off-duty time\nwith Yuki. All that was left to do was t=\r\no find Saitou and ask about\nthe 3rd Unit&#39;s next patrol.\nAlmost at that mome=\r\nnt, Saitou emerged from his room. In no time, Hiro\nwas standing next to him=\r\n and bowing profusely.\n&quot;Saitou-sama, good morning.&quot;\n&quot;Good morning, Tokugawa=\r\n-san.&quot;\n&quot;I have a question.&quot;\nSaitou appeared intrigued=97not exactly sure of=\r\n what was going on, but\nprobably possessing some inkling of what Hiro had i=\r\nn mind.\n&quot;Yes?&quot;\n&quot;When are we back on duty?&quot;\n&quot;Not until just before noon tomo=\r\nrrow. Why?&quot;\n&quot;Oh=85&quot; Hiro blushed visibly. &quot;I=85was planning on spending som=\r\ne time in\nthe city, and wanted to be sure that I&#39;d be back at the right tim=\r\ne.&quot;\nSaitou nodded=97slowly.\n&quot;I see. Well then, have a=85good time, Tokugawa=\r\n-san.&quot;\nHiro bowed quickly.\n&quot;Thank you, Saitou-sama.&quot;\nEverything finally tak=\r\nen care of, Hiro picked up the straw hat that\nhe&#39;d left leaning against the=\r\n outer wall, and tied it on as he passed\nthrough the gate. With a nod to th=\r\ne gatemen, he was off.\nThings were definitely looking up=85\n********\nYuki l=\r\neft the headquarters quickly and quietly, her feet moving almost\nof their o=\r\nwn accord. What Midori had helped arrange was wonderful=97and\nsince Harada =\r\nwas Midori&#39;s lover, Yuki sensed that he&#39;d played no small\npart in all of th=\r\nis, either. Then again, like the history books said,\nhe was known for being=\r\n the kind of person who knew of such places and\nthings=97among which was Yu=\r\nki&#39;s destination, the Yanagi-ya inn.\nBlissfully unaware of anything but her=\r\n destination, she kept walking=85\n*********\nAfter a brisk, two-mile hike, H=\r\niro arrived at the Yanagi-ya. Unlike\nother inns, the innkeeper didn&#39;t stand=\r\n outside and advertise his\nestablishment. Hiro only saw him after he&#39;d ente=\r\nred the building. The\nyoung innkeeper was apparently, was a good friend of =\r\nHarada, and Hiro\ndidn&#39;t seem surprised when the man told him that the capta=\r\nin came by\nand rented a room regularly. Perhaps that was why the man didn&#39;t=\r\n need\nto advertise like other inns=97he had a guaranteed, good income=97and=\r\n\nwhere anyone from the Shinsengumi or Military Commission went, high\nregard=\r\n was sure to follow.\nThe innkeeper showed Hiro to a small, 2nd floor room, =\r\nlooking out onto\nthe street, and excused himself, saying that he&#39;d keep an =\r\neye out for\nanyone `looking&#39; for him. Slowly pacing over to the window, Hir=\r\no noted\nthat the day had begun in earnest, and life moved along just the sa=\r\nme\nas ever. Just like it probably still does, `back&#39; in the 21st century,\nH=\r\niro thought with a chuckle, as he removed the swords from his belt\nand plac=\r\ned them carefully on the provided weapon rack by the wall. The\nscreen next =\r\nto the rack caught his eye. It was painted with a scene\ndepicting the trium=\r\nphant entry of Tokugawa Ieyasu into Osaka, after\nthe fall of that castle&#39;s =\r\ngarrison in 1615. Hiro grinned as he found\nthe figure of his ancestor, agin=\r\ng yet still proud and fierce, riding\ninto the castle with his head held hig=\r\nh.\nThe room&#39;s door slid open, suddenly bringing him back to attention in\nth=\r\ne real world.\nTurning on his heel, he saw Yuki standing in the doorway, clu=\r\ntching a\nwoven straw mat with one hand. She bowed and closed the door behin=\r\nd\nher. Hiro slid the window shutter closed, as well, and stood up.\n&quot;I&#39;m=85s=\r\nupposed to be getting daifuku sweets as a surprise for the\nserving women, a=\r\nccording to Midori-san,&quot; Yuki said with a smile.\n&quot;Harada-sama sent me to `i=\r\nnvestigate&#39; the area for him=85&quot; added Hiro.\nIn the blink of an eye, they f=\r\nound themselves with their arms wrapped\naround each other tightly, almost a=\r\ns if each one was afraid that the\nother would vanish if not held onto firml=\r\ny. Melting into each other&#39;s\nembrace, they relaxed, as if a great weight ha=\r\nd been lifted from their\ncollective consciousness. For a time, they could b=\r\ne their own selves\nagain.\n&quot;Hiro=85it&#39;s been so long=85&quot; sighed Yuki. &quot;So ve=\r\nry long=85&quot;\nHe smiled as she looked up at him, reaching a hand out to cares=\r\ns his face.\n&quot;I love you, Yuki-chan=85&quot;\nSlowly, gently, they brought their l=\r\nips together in a deep, warming,\nheartfelt kiss, which sent a sudden wave o=\r\nf euphoria rushing through\nboth of them, from head to toe. Then they sank d=\r\nown onto the empty\nfuton, which lay waiting=85and nature restored to them t=\r\nhe oneness that\nthey had to deny themselves in the outside world=85\n*******=\r\n****\n\tThey arose early the next morning, hoping to get back to headquarters=\r\n\nbefore the 3rd Unit&#39;s scheduled patrol. After getting dressed and\npaying t=\r\nhe innkeeper a decent amount, they stepped out into the\nsunshine. Hiro tigh=\r\ntened the sash of his swords, and glanced at Yuki.\n\t&quot;Shall we be going?&quot;\n\t&quot;=\r\nOnly if you promise to do this again soon.&quot;\n\tHe smiled.\n\t&quot;Of course. And be=\r\ning one yourself, you know that a samurai&#39;s word is\ntrue.&quot;\n\tThey started wa=\r\nlking=97unable to hold hands, but walking closer\ntogether than they had the=\r\n day before, basking in the glow of the left\nover euphoria and giddiness. L=\r\nife would be so much easier, now that\nthey had a way of relieving this part=\r\nicular tension in their\nrelationship. And if anyone said anything, it would=\r\nn&#39;t matter. They\ndidn&#39;t need to care about what anyone said=97it was their =\r\nbusiness, and\nperfectly legal in any time period.\n\tSuddenly, the sound of s=\r\nwords being drawn brought the euphoria to a\ncrashing halt. Hiro&#39;s hands ins=\r\ntinctively went to his own swords, as\nhe turned around to see who had drawn=\r\n on him.\n\t&quot;I am Takada Gennosuke of the Kyoto Mimawarigumi,&quot; announced the =\r\nman\nwith the drawn sword. He was tall, well-groomed, and wearing a haori\nmo=\r\nre muted in color than that of the Shinsengumi=97as befitting a member\nof t=\r\nhe Mimawarigumi, which also operated under the auspices of the\nKyoto Milita=\r\nry Commission, but was made up of more well-to-do\nindividuals than the Shin=\r\nsengumi&#39;s ex-farmers and masterless samurai.\n\tTakada stepped closer, the ti=\r\np of his sword rising slightly.\n\t&quot;Present identification now, or prepare to=\r\n die.&quot;\n**********\n\n\n\n"
