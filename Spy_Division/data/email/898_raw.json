Now, the =\r\n\nstory \n&gt; features an original version of the Shinsengumi in a yaoi work an=\r\nd \n&gt; also some genre-bending elements.  I believe yaoi, like any genre \ncan=\r\n \n&gt; be a vehicle for other themes which can add diversity to the \nfield.  \n=\r\n&gt; Illusion of Love does have very minimal man x man and also a thread \nof \n=\r\n&gt; spirituality which will hopefully make the work very unique to \nreaders.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The story is hosted at http://www.samurai-on-samurai.com\n&gt; Please comp=\r\nlete the (free) registration.  \n&gt; You must be 18 years old to join.\n&gt; \n&gt; Il=\r\nlusion of Love is under the category &quot;Samurai Shorts&quot; and you \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; mis=\r\ns this section of the website because it has male lower torsos \n&gt; covered i=\r\nn just fundoshi (^_^)\n&gt; \n&gt; Flames, comments for the story can be sent to se=\r\ncretarytocapt3(at)\n&gt; hotmail.com\n&gt; \n&gt; ~secretarytocapt3\n&gt; http://www.silapa=\r\njarun.com\n&gt; \n&gt; KATANA DUET: Samurai&#39;s Forbidden Love\n&gt; Published by Bookstr=\r\nand.com July 2008\n&gt; &quot;For a Matsumoto twin, true love can be\n&gt; found in his =\r\nown living reflection.&quot;\n&gt; (an original work of historical fiction)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
