I suspected from the  way Ayunee and her brother talked earlier in the series that she had some deep connection to Hijikata.\n\nTHe goodbye scene was more subtle.... perhaps it was the fact that this conversation occurred while he was washing and her subdued way of speaking that made me think that both were at least aware of her feelings.   \n\nWhat puzzled me most , however, was the way Hijikata did not show up normally to grieve her.  Was he simply angry? Or deeply and personally upset?\n\nThis is actually the one fanfic idea I had kicked around as far as writing.  I&#39;m reluctant to at the moment because my hands are too full.   I would not mind one of you writers taking on the idea, however. ^_^\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\n"
