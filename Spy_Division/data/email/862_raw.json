I did this for S-girl&#39;s \nShinsengumi art (=\r\nif you visit her gallery you will find more Rurouni \nKenshin fanart too htt=\r\np://s-girl.deviantart.com/)\n\nI know that in the 2nd paragraph I said that t=\r\nhe SHQ gallery has to \nbe somewhat rated-G...but I&#39;m actually tempted to st=\r\nart drawing more \nadult stuff too which I&#39;ll post in the future (yuri/yaoi.=\r\n..and maybe \neven straight stuff).\n\nI&#39;m into shinsengumi x shinsengumi\nAizu=\r\n Joshitai x Joshitai (women&#39;s samurai brigade)\n\nthat sort of stuff (not -he=\r\nntai- but pervy enough)...
