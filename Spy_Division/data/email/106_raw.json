For example, if you have chat or keyboard dialogue in author notes but not the story, the entire story will be considered for removal. To sum it up, everything you upload is subject to the content guidelines and TOS. \n\nWhere is  the &#39;Unleash your imagination&#39; thingy went?  first they forbade the NC 17, then they external links to our NC17 chapters (which of course can be circumvent with little effort, btw) and/or recourses about history or culture related to our stories, later the Author Notes as separate chapters, and now this. Next time, what? Is  just me or I detect a more and more repressive trend here? I mean, I don&#39;t write such kind of things in the Author&#39;s notes, but they have to control EVERYTHING we decide to express?&gt;&gt;\n\n\nI agree that the earlier NC 17 purge was unfair but I&#39;m wondering if \nthis and the other recent thing about getting rid of poetry--certain \npoetry---whatever is more a way of trying to save space/bandwidth. I \nhave a feeling they got a hell of a lot bigger than they first imagined \nand it&#39;s costing them more than they want to spend to have the equipment \nand such to handle the traffic so they&#39;re going to cut every corner they \npossibly can as long as they have some &quot;viable&quot; reason for it.\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;m SOOOOOO fed up with them. It&#39;s a real pity that Media Miner hadn&#39;t gotten more popular, because this place sucks more and more with each passing day. &gt;.&lt;\n\nWell, so you are warned, beware of FF net new adding to their censor&#39;s scissors. They are out there just for you.\n\nFiruze&gt;&gt;\n\nI have some stuff on Media Miner but it&#39;s such a PITA for me. It never \nseems to work right and changing a password is a major adventure. \nAdultff.net is even more of a pain because you have to jump through \nmultiple hoops to get anything to upload properly.\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
