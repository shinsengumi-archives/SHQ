Just because it comes from a book doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s correct.  :-D  How frustrating...\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s a good point -- but  the &quot;correctly attributed&quot; internet information is still generally referencing print. Print&#39;s credibility lies in its permanence and verifiability.   Most books out there are in the habit of referencing or get nailed by the critics and academics ^_^. The majority of websites do not reference, or point to links that may be broken.    It&#39;s unfortunate that the conventional library scientists were not the first to jump onto the internet and help shape its direction. I bet we&#39;d be a lot more organized today... :-(\n\nIn the medical field in particular, this is extremely troublesome.   A lot of information exists out there to which there are no supportive claims. It&#39;s perturbing.\n\nAs for translations, some things from a few fan translations in the RK-verse have been quoted ad nauseum,  but now that the Viz translations have come out, there are apparent differences.   Of course, arguing that the Viz translation may be in fact better has no effect with some fans.  The fans are still going to compare everything against the first translation. \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n"
