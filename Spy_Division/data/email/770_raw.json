Where&#39;s Okita?  Oh don&#39;t worry he&#39;ll be in the film too.\n---=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\nBefore projects which take =\r\nup to 3 days to complete I do various\nbrainstorm collages in video/audio fo=\r\nrmat.  For I-KE-DIE-YA I did the\nsame thing \n\n[warning! 17.6 mb of audio wi=\r\nth no script]\nhttps://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/DVDPROMOfinal2.mp3\n\n=\r\nThe film makers are students at the Aizu hangakko (domain school)\nNisshinka=\r\nn (they are all 10 years old in 1864 so the movie will\nreflect their inexpe=\r\nrience in movie making)...they have big plans for\nthe movie and are plannin=\r\ng a DVD release already---however they are\nbeing monitored by Aizu&#39;s warrio=\r\nr women the Joushitai\n(http://www.shinsengumihq.com/WB.htm). \n\nThey make va=\r\nrious obscure references to stuff which will be cut out in\nthe final versio=\r\nn (just don&#39;t worry if it is all confusing).  So all\nof a sudden if someone=\r\n talks about *Teruhime*--then it is because they\nare her otaku.  \n\nThe disc=\r\nussion descended into a fanboy chatter fest which seems to\nparody every sin=\r\ngle fan discussion of multiple Shinsengumi universes\nincluding (RK and PMK)=\r\n. Like many &quot;serious&quot; fan discussions---it gets\nheated and nasty LOL!!!!!!\n=\r\n\n*Incidentally, Teruhime (Matsudaira Teruko) is -not- Matsudaira\nKatamori&#39;s=\r\n wife---she was his adoptive (older) sister. In the world of\nfiction it is =\r\nfun to have Katamori have a crush on her (after all they\naren&#39;t related by =\r\nblood and she was beautiful).  Please direct\nquestions on Teruhime to Hirot=\r\nada Tokugawa.\n--------------------------------------------------\nI keep try=\r\ning various methods to create a serious Shinsengumi film and\nI tried to &quot;wa=\r\nrm up&quot; by making a short Byakkotai vid (made with\nWindows Movie Maker--noth=\r\ning fancy)\n\nthere is a link to the .wmv file\nhttp://community.livejournal.c=\r\nom/edo_meiji/18615.html#cutid1\n\nif you want to leave comments you may do so=\r\n at the youtube.com page\nfor the short vid\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\r\n=3DY1IIo4o3beo\n\nByakkotai Info\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotaiinfo.h=\r\ntm\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n"
