We&#39;re here for your DATA.  We&#39;ve come to pillage your \n&gt; research.  Hand it over, or feel our wrath!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; :-D  Someone should draw a picture of this so we can use it as a banner...  If only ff.net would allow it!!  Maybe our flag should also have the babelfish icon.\n&gt; \n&gt; phil (who wants to reply to the more serious previous \n&gt; posts, but too playful to be serious right now...)\n\n\nAgreed. We need that banner.\n\nHey, I&#39;ve discovered the Babelfish has an evil brother. It&#39;s Alis Translation Solutions and the program is Gist. And that&#39;s all you get of the page - the gist. Seriously, in some ways it is worse, but occassionally it is clearer than the fish. And it translated both the www.3-hajime.com and the www.toshizo.com/toshizo/ sites with no problems. The fish has been giving me error messages for weeks now... -GASP- So is this it for the evil carp?! Will the babelfish babble no more on my computer?! Stay tuned to find out...\n\n-Snicker- I was just glancing back at that forum I mentioned earlier and realized something. Angrybee, you&#39;re the one who brought up that idea I was talking about. I&#39;ve been thinking of a story where Kenshin never trains with Hiko and ends up on the other side of the fight! O.o&quot; Are you a mind reader?!\n\n-Alicia\n\n"
