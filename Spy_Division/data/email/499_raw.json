All mine. HAHA=\r\nHAHAA\n\nAizu Castle\nApril, Heisei 17 (2005)\n\nThe white walls of Aizu Castle =\r\nrose majestically over the\nferroconcrete city skyline, lost in their own ag=\r\ne-old mystery. A wind\nblew from the northeast, and all was peaceful, with t=\r\nhe air awash in\nthe scent of spring. In the cemeteries, the ghosts of the m=\r\nen and\nwomen of old Aizu kept watch over the spirit of the new Aizu. In the=\r\n\nfields where life once lay dying, the tall grass was truly &quot;all that\nremai=\r\nned of warriors&#39; dreams.&quot;\nPausing on the bridge over the castle moat, Tokug=\r\nawa Hirotada gazed\nquietly at the sloping eaves of the tower. The fishlike =\r\ntalismans on\nthe very top of the highest roof seemed to stretch skyward in =\r\na quiet\nprayer for peaceful rest.\n&quot;Tragic=85&quot; he murmured. &quot;Tragic indeed.&quot;=\r\n\nHiro felt an urge to stay there, to contemplate the deep sadness of\nthe ca=\r\nstle tower, to let its mystery seep into his soul, but he had a\njob to do. =\r\nTugging smartly at his haori overcoat, he resumed his brisk\nstride across t=\r\nhe bridge, soon passing through the gate and into the\ninner circle. Directl=\r\ny below the slope of the tower&#39;s stone base sat a\nshallow pit, with several=\r\n men and women in dusty clothing digging and\nbrushing away at the rich brow=\r\nn soil. One of them caught his eye, and\nhe waved.\n\t&quot;Hi, Yuki!&quot;\n\tA short, en=\r\nergetic woman in the deepest part of the pit waved back,\nbrushing her long =\r\nbangs away from her eyes.\n\t&quot;Hi! Be with you in a minute!&quot; Exchanging a shor=\r\nt word with the\nsupervisor, she picked up her cloth shoulderbag and clamber=\r\ned out of\nthe pit to join him. Exchanging a quiet kiss, they left the inner=\r\n\ncircle of the castle, hand in hand.\n****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
