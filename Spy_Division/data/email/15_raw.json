My parents were killed a few \nyears back and I&#39;ve been living with my older brother who is the worst! \nHe makes me sleep in a closet. He&#39;s always lecturing me and shoving me \non the ground and accusing me of doing something bad even when I&#39;m \ntotally innocent.  I thought things would change when he got a new job \nin the finance office of a local paramilitary group and I decided to \napply too, to show him that I really am grown up. What a mistake that \nwas! The job is a dead end and what&#39;s worse is my boss! The man is an \nabsolute demon and nothing I do is ever good enough to suit him!\n\nIf that&#39;s not bad enough the guys here treat me like I&#39;m some kind of a \nfreak just because I&#39;m a little short for my age. They tease me \nconstantly and act like I&#39;m some kind of personal pet. I do have one \nfriend among them but he&#39;s always busy working, he hasn&#39;t been feeling \nwell and even though he doesn&#39;t say anything I think he&#39;s having \nproblems with his &quot;significant other&quot;.\n\nOh, wait, Ayu-nee it gets even worse!  There&#39;s this guy (my age) who \nworks here too and for some reason I can&#39;t stop thinking about him. He \ndoes a lot of undercover work and sometimes he has to disguise himself \nas a woman and when he does he&#39;s so freakin&#39; kawaii I can&#39;t stand it! \nLately I&#39;ve been having this dream where I&#39;m walking down the street and \nhe&#39;s dressed like a  girl and he grabs me and drags me into an alley and....\n\nWell, let&#39;s just say that the past few nights I&#39;m kind of glad my \nbrother makes me sleep alone in a closet.\n\nThe bad part is that it&#39;s hard trying to explain why I need clean sheets \nevery day...\n\nCan you help me? Will things ever get better?  Do those dreams mean \nI&#39;m-----gay?\n\n-----Don&#39;t call me Puppy-kun!\n\nDear Pup,\n\nThis is quite a complicated set of events and I do sympathize. However, \nI think the best advice I can give would be in person and I encourage \nyou to send me a note c/o this paper to arrange a private meeting.\n\n# # # # # # # #\n\nFull Page Notice:\n\nAttendance is Mandatory for Captain Harada&#39;s lecture tomorrow\n\nevening--My Brush with Seppuku and What it Means to You.\n\nThere will also be a quiz on the Internal Regulations.\n\n# # # # # # # # # #\n\nThis Just In:\n\nYamanami Keisuke, formerly with the Shinsengumi was found dead this \nmorning of\n\nan apparent suicide. No details are available and an official \ninvestigation is under way.\n\n# # # # # #  # # # #\n\nOfficial Notice:\n\nAll members are Strongly Encouraged to attend the memorial service for \nCaptain Okita Souji&#39;s cat Buttons tomorrow noon at Mibu Temple. While \nspecial dispensation will be granted to those members scheduled to be on \npatrol such members are expected to offer their condolences to Captain \nOkita immediately following the end of their shift.\n\n -----Hijikata\n\n# # # # # # # # # #\n\nAddendum to Official Notice:\n\nAll rumors circulating in the compound concerning the demise of Captain \nOkita&#39;s cat Buttons shall cease immediately as it is upsetting my Souji. \nThe cat was not eaten by anyone. It was merely caught in the crossfire \nof Captain Harada&#39;s skirmish with Ishin scum while it attempted to jump \nup and play with the fuzzy ball thing on his uniform.\n\n----Hijikata\n\n                         # # # # # # #\n\nDear Editor:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that I have been slandered in your \npublication. I refer to the recent letter by one Mr. (Or Miss) Katsura \nconcerning my runaway adoptive son and kenjutsu pupil Kenshin Himura.\n\nI have never abused Kenshin in any manner. I rescued the boy from slave \ntraders and gave him a stable home as well as instruction in the great \nHiten Mitsurugi Ryu--- Instruction which he clearly did not appreciate \nas he ran off before his training was complete.\n\nI&#39;m certain that those of you with teenagers can understand how it is \nwhen your child falls in with the &quot;wrong crowd&quot;--- in this case a bunch \nof older left wing political extremists . I tried my best to talk sense \ninto the boy but he refused to listen so that I had no choice but to let \nthe little shit choose his own path and learn from his mistakes.\n\nAs far as allegations of my alleged &quot;sake addiction&quot; I will have you \nknow, Katsura K. that I drink no more t han the average citizen. And \nsince when is it a crime to enjoy a cup of fine sake to help one relax?  \nAgain, those of you with teenagers can surely appreciate this simple \npleasure I allow for myself.\n\nShould anyone be in contact with my son please tell him that I have not \npermanently closed the door to him he has only to seek my guidance and I \nwill be there.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHiko Seijuro\n\n                        # # # # # # # #\n\n                               \n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe AOIYA restaurant and Inn is now open for your dining pleasure.  Come \nsample our Grand Opening Lunch and Dinner Buffet Specials!\n\nWe would like to assure you that contrary to certain false rumors \ncurrently being circulated by our competitors *cough* Ikeda-ya *cough* \nwe are a legitimate business and not a front for a subversive shinobi \norganization.\n\n                         # # # # # # #\n\n                               \n\nNote from the Interim Editor:\n\nSince many readers have requested a personals advertisement column we \nhave decided to give it a trial run beginning with the next issue. Ad \nplacement is free and there will be a nominal fee for private reply \nboxes at the barracks post office. We respectfully ask that you keep \nyour ads as &quot;clean&quot; as possible as this is a family newspaper.\n\n                         # # # # # # #\n\nDear Ayu-nee:\n\nI am a member of one of the most respected units of a local law \nenforcement agency and while I take great pride in my unit I am \nconcerned with the way our Captain treats us. He is a rather intolerant \nman whose personal code of Aku Soku Zan leaves no room for even the \nsimplest human error. I hesitate approaching his immediate superior as \nthey seem to be cut from the same mold.  Can you offer any advice? \nTransferring to a new job is out of the question, I&#39;m afraid.\n\nNervous\n\nDear Nervous:\n\nPerhaps your Captain is under a bit of stress. I know that the crime \nrate has been steadily rising and it&#39;s quite possible that your \nsuperior&#39;s superiors are giving him a hard time. Please hang in there \nand keep me posted.\n\n                   \n\n                          # # # # # #\n\n                               \n\nEmployment Opportunity\n\nThere is an opening for a skilled, non nonsense swordsman in the Third \nUnit.\n\nSend letters of application to Shinsengumi Headquarters Attention \nCaptain Saitou.\n\n                          # # # # # #\n\n                               \n\nOfficial Notice:\n\nInterested citizens who may have come to earlier meetings concerning the \nlatest Shinsengumi Recruitment Drive are encouraged to come back for the \nnext round of information sessions.\n\nIt seems that Captain Saitou slightly overstated the dangers associated \nwith our organizations. The probability of being slaughtered by a single \nIshin hitokiri is far smaller than the good captain may have led you to \nbelieve and while our Internal Regulations are rather stringent they are \nby no means an automatic death sentence for even the slightest \ninfraction.  \n\nFuture meetings will be overseen by Captain Nagakura of the Second Unit \nand a nurse will be in attendance should we have anymore fainting \nincidents.\n\n                         # # # # # # #\n\nDear Ayu-nee,\n\nIt&#39;s Plum again, I&#39;ve been holed up here in the middle of nowhere with \nthe boy wonder for weeks now and he&#39;s been looking at me like he wants \nto...you know,  play house &quot;for\nreal&quot;...Ewwwwwwww. What do I do now?\n\n Plum Crazy but not in Kyoto\n\nDearPlum,\n\n \n\nJust sit the young man down and explain gently but clearly that you&#39;re \nflattered by his attention, but that you&#39;re not interested in him that \nway. Remind him you&#39;re only doing your job. &#39;m sure he&#39;ll understand.... \nIt&#39;s not as if he&#39;s violent or anything, right?\n\n P.S. Perhaps if you have a brother he might help set this young man\n\nstraight.\n\n                          # # # # # #\n\n                                \n\nDear Ayu-nee, It&#39;s Red, remember me :-)\n\nThe job thing has settled down a bit and now I&#39;m on an out of town \nassignment, the problem is y roommate. She&#39;s an older woman and I think \nI&#39;m in love with her, well maybe not love but definitely lust, *blush* \nShe&#39;s really hot in a dazed sort of way and well, I&#39;m not as experienced \nas you might think so how do I , um, you know, do it?\n\n Red\n\n Dear Red,\n\nI&#39;ve referred your letter to you to my colleague Capt Harada who offers \nthis advice:\n\n&quot;Loosen her up with a bit of sake, some candelight and a nice meal. Talk \na little about &quot;chick stuff&quot;--- you know, family, gardening, etc and \nthen make like it&#39;s no big deal and sit by yourself\nwhile she goes off and combs her hair or reads a book. If she comes and \nsits near you just follow our instincts and do what comes naturally. If \nShinpachi can score with this plan then anyone can!\n\n                        # # # # # # # #\n\n                               \n\nEmployment Opportunity\n\nWanted Laundry supervisor, preferably male (or a female not prone to \nfainting at the accidental sight of 100+ naked men.)\n\nApply Shinsengumi HQ\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
