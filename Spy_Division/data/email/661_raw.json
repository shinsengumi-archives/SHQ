I just shove them on my cheapo mp3\nplayer and listen to them while I wander aimlessly in my school&#39;s\nlibrary---or when I have to do alot of typing (beats listening to\neither left or right wing political talk radio)\n\nso Please email me off-list by clicking the &quot;email&quot; button at the top\nor secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com\n[OR] if you have this really great list you&#39;d like to share you can\njust post here on the mailing list\n\nyou can give the song name, CD and just one or two words why you think\nit may fit a shinsengumi theme---I work near a used CD store so it\nshouldn&#39;t be too hard for me to find the song you mention\n\nnote: I already some more obvious OST like &quot;Last SAmurai (Hans zimmer)\nor Mibugishiden (Joe Hisaishi)---a sample track is available at\nhttp://www.hajimenokizu.com\n\nthank you \n\n\n\n"
