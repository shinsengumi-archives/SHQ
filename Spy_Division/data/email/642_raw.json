You can get a critique of your work and support a good cause by\n&gt;checking out the &quot;Fire Fund&quot; auction currently being held on eBay to\n&gt;help romance and young adult author Marianne Mancusi whose home was\n&gt;destroyed by fire while she was out of town at a conference last month.\n&gt;\n&gt;There are top agents and editors donating critiques and while those bids\n&gt;are getting &quot;way up there&quot; you can get in a bid with other\n&gt;multipublished, award winning authors (myself included) for bids\n&gt;starting at $1.\n&gt;\n&gt;Surely one of you has $1 to spare to salvage my pride (I have no bids\n&gt;yet) and more importantly to help a worthy cause. The link to the\n&gt;various auctions is below.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQfsooZ2QQfsopZ3QQsassZmariannefirefund.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;Barbara Sheridan\n&gt;http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt;The Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n\n"
