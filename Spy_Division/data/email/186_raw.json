Hey... So this is your gift ne? :O)\nI&#39;m not sure about the laws about this but do you think I can use it \non my desktop at work? Can I use it after the contest (or earlier if \npossible)...\n\nLast month my pic was all the real faces of the members of the \nShinsengumi and people including my boss kept stopping by asking who \nthey were... Then I&#39;d go on a long explanation.. Basically giving \nthem a history lesson. The good thing about it is that they seem to \nappreciate the lesson...\n\nThis pic could make a good conversational piece about the SHQ group \ntoo... Let me know! ^_^\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;tnamwong@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; I submitted fanart to the contest Angrybee informed us about\n&gt; Pic\n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/PMKSH1.jpg\n&gt; Title: Saitou Hajime:Bored as Usual\n&gt; Media: overhead projecter marker\n&gt; Note I made him left-handed just because I think historical Saitou \nwas\n&gt; left handed.  The mon/kamon in the background is historical Fujita\n&gt; Goro&#39;s family crest (nine bamboo leaves).\n&gt; \n&gt; I think his head is a bit big...and he looks like he used the \nentire\n&gt; can of hairspray...but its not like I can white it out or anything.\n\n\n"
