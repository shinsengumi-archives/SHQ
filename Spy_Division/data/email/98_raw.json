I&#39;ve already read this doujinshi online. \nLooky:\nhttp://siusiak.nie.com.pl/~minak666/doujinshi.htm\nIt&#39;s got the same title, and the same plot as described in that other site. \nThough I&#39;m not entirely sure if it&#39;s the same thing since the cover arts are \ndifferent. Maybe it&#39;s a sequel, since I remember seeing the webmistress of \nBishounen Sanctuary talk about a sequel to Black Point.\n*shrugs*\n\n\nMiser Bellatrix\n\n&quot;Allow me to give you a hand...with your doom.&quot;\n\n-----------------\n\nYup it&#39;s definitely in English. Actually I think they re-arranged\ntheir site, which is really a disadvantage to us since now I don&#39;t\nsee the sample pages or the online doujinshi that they used to do.\n\nHmm... From what Spiritus_Saitou said it&#39;s now for June? Hmm... The\npushed it back? In the e-mail they sent me it was May. Well either\nway if you want to see a couple of sample pages (non-explicit,\nfrankly a little bland - probably because they didn&#39;t know if I was\n18+) e-mail me and I will forward their e-mail to me.\n\nI love doujinshi... I&#39;m sure this is old news but for those who do\nnot know and is interested in Japanese doujinshi&#39;s go to\naestheticism.com, doujinshiplanet.com and dojindomei.com. They have\nboth yaoi and non-yaoi.\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan\n&lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n &gt; Whoa! That looks like some &quot;interesting&quot; stuff.  I didn&#39;t check out\nthe\n &gt; link tot he publisher yet but I am safe in assuming this is an\nEnglish\n &gt; language thing?\n &gt;\n &gt; Personally I&#39;m quite intrigued by that cover art as it&#39;s sort of\nkeeping\n &gt; in line with my current fanfic on ff.net that takes a really\ndifferent\n &gt; look at the Saiitou/Sano thing.
