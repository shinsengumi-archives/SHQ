Please, have a seat.=\r\n&quot;\n\tHiro bowed, and took his seat next to Saitou, facing Kondou and Hijikata=\r\n.\n\t&quot;Thank you, Kondou-sama, Hijikata-sama.&quot;\n\tKondou nodded briskly, and pul=\r\nled some papers out from a stack to his\nright, laying them flat on the mats=\r\n in front of him.\n\t&quot;No use in wasting time, so let&#39;s get straight to busine=\r\nss, shall\nwe?&quot; asked the commander briskly.\nHijikata and Saitou nodded thei=\r\nr assent quietly. Kondou continued.\n&quot;I&#39;ve spoken with the men who were upst=\r\nairs with you at the Ikedaya.\nFrom what they told me, I understand that you=\r\n fought almost\nunstoppably, getting cut repeatedly but not allowing your bo=\r\ndy to give\nout until you were sure that the floor was secure. You even went=\r\n out\nonto the nearby roofs with Okita-san and chased some people who had\ntr=\r\nied to escape.&quot;\n\t&quot;Well,&quot; said Hiro sheepishly, remembering his run-in with =\r\nYamazaki on\nthe roof, after he&#39;d almost been impaled by a spear. &quot;I really =\r\ndon&#39;t\nremember much. It was all so dark.&quot;\n\tKondou nodded.\n\t&quot;Still, I believ=\r\ne that your conduct was exemplary. I&#39;ve spoken with\nHijikata-san and Saitou=\r\n-san, and with their approval, I&#39;m going to\npromote you to gochou=97corpora=\r\nl.&quot; He handed the promotion papers to\nHiro, who accepted them with two bows=\r\n, first a short bob of his head,\nthen a full bow all the way to the floor m=\r\nats.\n\t&quot;Thank you so much, Kondou-sama. I am unworthy of such honor, but I\nw=\r\nill do my utmost to deserve your trust.&quot;\n\tHiro was about to sit back up whe=\r\nn Hijikata cleared his throat.\n\t&quot;If you&#39;ll stop being overly grateful, Corp=\r\noral, there&#39;s  something\nelse that Kondou-san wishes to say.&quot;\n\tSlightly bur=\r\nning with rage, Hiro kept his gaze turned to the\nfloorboards. His gut react=\r\nion, had revealing his background been an\noption, would&#39;ve been to tear Hij=\r\nikata apart for what he&#39;d said.\nSucking up? Hiro was simply being respectfu=\r\nl to Kondou, who was one of\nhis childhood heroes and whom he personally adm=\r\nired. Hijikata was\ndifferent for him. He had a grudging respect for the man=\r\n, and\nadmiration for the effectiveness of his technique, but otherwise, he\n=\r\ncouldn&#39;t stand him and felt that he deserved the nickname &quot;Devil&quot; one\nhundr=\r\ned percent.\n\t&quot;Tokugawa-san,&quot; said Kondou, trying to sweep away the uneasy s=\r\nilence.\n&quot;After consultation, and much thought, I&#39;ve come to a decision. I&#39;m=\r\n\ngoing to allow your wife to fight alongside you tomorrow, as=85a\npersonal =\r\nattendant.&quot;\n\tHiro couldn&#39;t believe his ears. That wasn&#39;t supposed to be pos=\r\nsible!\nThen again=85he realized that he and Yuki were changing history simp=\r\nly\nby being there. Things could be different. They were.\n\t&quot;I=85understand, =\r\nKondou-sama.&quot;\n\t&quot;Very good. She can obtain her weapons and armor at the same=\r\n time\nthat you do. That&#39;s all. You&#39;re dismissed, Corporal Tokugawa.&quot;\n\tHiro =\r\ngave a short bow.\n\t&quot;Understood. Thank you, Kondou-sama.&quot;\n*********\n\tJuly 19=\r\n\nYuki tightened the strings of Hiro&#39;s helmet, deftly pulling at the\ntough l=\r\nacquered cords with nimble fingers. Giving the knot a tug, she\nmade sure th=\r\nat it was secure.\n\t&quot;You&#39;re set, Hiro-sama.&quot;\n\t&quot;Thanks, Yuki-chan. Are you re=\r\nady?&quot;\n\tLooking herself over, she made sure that she was fully armed and\narm=\r\nored. Gauntlets, short sword, naginata, armored headband, and\nbreastplate=\r\n=97all present and accounted for. Since she was going to be\nfighting, she a=\r\nlso wore hakama, wide-legged trousers, over her kimono.\nShe nodded eagerly.=\r\n\n\t&quot;Hai, gochou-sama. I&#39;m ready.&quot;\n\tYuki still couldn&#39;t entirely believe it. =\r\nNot only had Hiro been\npromoted, but she was his personal attendant! The ri=\r\nsk of battle still\nremained, but Yuki felt a lot better, since she&#39;d be wit=\r\nh Hiro more\noften. And beyond that=85she was eager to help him in his quest=\r\n for\nretribution against Choshuu. Her own clan also suffered at the hands\no=\r\nf the rebels, and ended up seeing their domain torn apart by the last\ngreat=\r\n battle of the period, the Battle of Hakodate. Whatever path Hiro\nchose to =\r\npursue, Yuki knew one thing=97their minds and swords, as\nalways, were one.\n=\r\n\tThere was an eerie silence among the forces arrayed around the\nImperial Pa=\r\nlace. It seemed like just another day, but deep down\ninside, everyone knew =\r\nwhat was about to happen. Hiro and Yuki could\nalmost sense it, as well. The=\r\n Choshuu samurai may not have come into\nview yet, but they knew very well t=\r\nhat they were there, and drawing\ncloser by the second.\tBehind Hiro and Yuki=\r\n, the group of 3rd Unit\npatrolmen under Hiro&#39;s command tensed. Swords alrea=\r\ndy drawn, they\ncrouched behind a barricade, waiting for the order to charge=\r\n.\n\tYuki tapped him on the shoulder. &quot;&quot;Hiro-sama=85feel that?&quot;\n\t&quot;Feel wha=97=\r\n&quot; The words were left half-said in Hiro&#39;s mouth as the\nonce-faint war cry e=\r\nchoed from the streets west of the palace.\n\tOh dear God=85Hiro mouthed. We =\r\nare all so dead=85\n\tHe turned to Yuki, and nodded.\n\t&quot;Get ready.&quot;\n\tNearby, t=\r\nhe voices of the Aizu brigade commanders could be heard.\n\t&quot;Alright, boys!&quot;\n=\r\n&quot;Get ready! Here they come!&quot;\n&quot;No prisoners!&quot;\nHiro wasn&#39;t concerned with the=\r\nm. He just wanted to further his quest\nfor retribution and vengeance agains=\r\nt the warriors of Choshuu.\nFrom the surrounding streets and alleys, a seemi=\r\nngly huge force\nsuddenly materialized, brandishing every type of weapon\nima=\r\nginable=97from the standard katana to muzzle-loading muskets. An\nagonizing,=\r\n terrible eternity passed. Then they charged.\nThe Aizu forces wasted no tim=\r\ne. Everywhere there was a musket unit,\nthe same command resounded.\n&quot;First l=\r\nine, fire!&quot;\nThe thunder of gunfire echoed in the hot midsummer air. For a m=\r\noment,\nonly the smell of spent ammunition and burning flesh hung in the air=\r\n.\nHiro looked through the haze, hoping to see most of the enemy wiped\nout, =\r\nbut in vain=97they seemed not only to not have lost anyone, but\nalso to hav=\r\ne multiplied in number. What was more, they weren&#39;t slowly\nadvancing anymor=\r\ne=97they were running as fast as their legs could carry\nthem, charging the =\r\ngovernment positions. Before any member of the\ngovernment force=97Aizu, Sat=\r\nsuma, Kuwana, Shinsengumi, or Mimawarigumi=97\nbefore any of them could move=\r\n, the enemy closed the gap and was upon them.\nHiro was adrift, seemingly de=\r\ntached from the flow of time. His blade\nslashed through the torso of the fi=\r\nrst Choshuu samurai, shattering\nflesh and bone in a rapidly rising kesa-gir=\r\ni slash from the right hip\nup to the left shoulder. For a moment, Hiro felt=\r\n horror at what he\nsaw, a horror that nearly swallowed him whole.\nThen he b=\r\nrought the past to mind. He remembered stories of the defeat\nof the Tokugaw=\r\na clan in battle at Toba-Fushimi, the slaughter at\nNagaoka, the burning, bu=\r\nllet-riddled banners at Tsuruga Castle in\nAizu, bearing his family&#39;s triple=\r\n-hollyhock crest. He forced himself\nto remember that these were the people =\r\nwho had done that-- these men\nwho marched under the banner of Mori, lord of=\r\n Choshuu. And with no\neffort at all he remembered the words of a middle-age=\r\nd Emperor Meiji,\nwho after a lifetime of support for the Choshuu clan, said=\r\n the words\nthat still made his blood boil: \n\nYesterday I was finally able t=\r\no do something to show my gratitude to\nTokugawa Yoshinobu. I ought to be gr=\r\nateful; after all, I took the\ncountry away from him!\n \nIt was in that insta=\r\nnt that he made a critical decision. However\ndifficult, however dangerous, =\r\nhe had to put his knowledge to good use.\nThe past may have turned out one w=\r\nay, but he was able to change that.\nBeing in the past himself, there was no=\r\n way that he could allow for\nthe same defeats and humiliation to happen a s=\r\necond time. He would\npreserve his family&#39;s power and honor, no matter what =\r\nthe cost. The\nTokugawa Shogunate would survive=97he would make absolutely s=\r\nure of it.\nDeftly rotating his sword back into position, he prepared to bri=\r\nng his\nsword downwards and through another enemy again, when shots rang out=\r\n.\nAt first he thought that it might be some Aizu riflemen firing at\nwill. W=\r\nhen a couple of Mimawarigumi members went down near him, he\nknew how wrong =\r\nhe was. Choshuu had been stockpiling guns, and now they\nwere using them. Ho=\r\nw obvious. How plainly, stupidly obvious.\nHe started to turn toward the dir=\r\nection of the shots, hoping to cut\ndown some gunners. His sword seemed to g=\r\nuide itself, progressing to\nthe more lethal techniques of the Yagyu Ryuu, s=\r\nlowly progressing\nonward, foot by foot. Totally absorbed in his swordsmansh=\r\nip, Hiro\ndidn&#39;t see the enemy sword coming down toward his head until there=\r\n was\na loud clanging noise. Glancing up for a moment, he saw the blade of a=\r\n\nnaginata holding the sword back. In the instant before her grip\nwould&#39;ve g=\r\niven way, he took advantage of the diversion and swept in\ntoward his oppone=\r\nnt, cutting him down in a shower of blood.\n&quot;Yuki!&quot;\n&quot;We&#39;re right behind you!=\r\n&quot;\nThere was no point in talking. All they had to do was fight. Eight of\nthe=\r\n men who were assigned to Hiro fought their way forward, until they\nwere fi=\r\nghting back-to-back with him and Yuki. Try as they might, they\nwere held up=\r\n, and couldn&#39;t find the source of the gunfire. One by one,\npeople were goin=\r\ng down, helpless against the incoming bullets.\n\tA whistling noise filled Hi=\r\nro&#39;s ears. He had heard of such a noise\nbeing heard by soldiers in World Wa=\r\nr II and Vietnam=85now he knew\nhimself what it was like=97a terrible, blind=\r\ning white noise that he was\nsomehow numbed to. Hiro pointed his sword forwa=\r\nrd and ordered a\ncharge. Five people responded to him, led by Yuki. With a =\r\ntremendous\nbattle cry, they threw everything into each cut, slash, and thru=\r\nst,\ntrying to advance in the face of the never-ending go-for-broke spirit\no=\r\nf the Choshuu warriors.\n\tTaking a lunge, Hiro prepared to follow, when he h=\r\neard repeated\ncracking noises ripping through the air like miniature thunde=\r\nrclaps.\nHis eyes widened in shock and frozen horror as he watched his five =\r\nmen\ngetting torn apart by shot after shot from the Choshuu guns, with Yuki\n=\r\njust behind them, her naginata ready to strike at anything in her way.\n\tYuk=\r\ni&#39;s words echoed through his mind.\nIf you were to fall=85I would=85slit my =\r\nthroat and willingly follow you in\ndeath=85\nYuki=85he thought, holding his =\r\nsword off to one side, and putting his\nentire being into a dead run. Yuki=\r\n=85if you were to fall, I would commit\nseppuku and follow you in death, as =\r\nwell. My life has no meaning\nwithout you. Vengeance may be important, but y=\r\nou are even more\nimportant. I love you=85forever=85\nAs he fell onto her, he=\r\n closed his eyes and mentally said a prayer.\n\nGreat Lord, God whom my ances=\r\ntors detested, Lord whom I have chosen to\nfollow=97 We are like grass befor=\r\ne the Harvester. If it is Your will,\npreserve us and let us survive this te=\r\nrrible bloodletting. If it is\nnot, let us pass from this world of grief and=\r\n tears hand in hand=85\n\n\n\n"
