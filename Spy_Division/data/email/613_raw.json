I was particularly floored by Yamanami&#39;s slyness at a critical juncture for the Roshigumi (*cough* Serizawa), but also the circumstances and decisions that led up to his willing seppuku in the NHK version.   \n\nAs for Kondou, he changed substantially over the course of the 49 episodes and it was very clear he was the reason for so many people of various backgrounds and subtly different feelings and even subtly different ideologies to come together; and it&#39;s something I appreciate.   \n\nS\n\n\n"
