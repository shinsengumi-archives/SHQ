I am a huge fan of Sait=F4 Hajime. The \ncoloring=\r\n and details of the picture are phenomenal. You are very \ngood at digital p=\r\nainting. \n\nHe looks so lost in thought.

This dig=\r\nital painting\n&gt; was based on a black-and-white manga-style drawing of Saito=\r\n at the\n&gt; back of a doujinshi called Spark! (sadly, I don&#39;t know who the \na=\r\nrtist\n&gt; was). Even though it was simply a stark monochrome image, I was\n&gt; c=\r\naptivated. I just had to paint my own version of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.devian=\r\ntart.com/deviation/37693516/\n&gt; \n&gt; The next drawing I&#39;m working on is of Sai=\r\ntou in his Shinsengumi\n&gt; uniform (as he&#39;s seen in Rurouni Kenshin). I&#39;m als=\r\no thinking of \nmaking\n&gt; Souji Okita (Peacemaker Kurogane) art. ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; Tha=\r\nnk you for your time! I hope you enjoy my work!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
