What also annoys the hell out o=\r\nf me is the complaints about how dare Saitou even consider *looking* at som=\r\neone else.  Come on, people... he&#39;s a male!  He&#39;s also samurai and they had=\r\n their own ideas about what was permissable.  And, let&#39;s face it, it was al=\r\nso probably an arranged marriage that might not have been romantic or fulfi=\r\nlling (and that&#39;s just speculation, not any kind of inside track --- just s=\r\nomething that&#39;s possible).  I really resent comments that make it clear to =\r\nme that anything but a monogamous, adoring husband is all Saitou can be.  (=\r\nBeing a SaiSa writer, I get my fair share.)&lt;&lt;\n\n \n\nOhohoho=85 this is a slip=\r\npery path we are getting into, phil=85 You see, while personally I don=92t =\r\nsee him having affairs, I do not do it from a =91they are meant for each ot=\r\nher/eternal love=92 perspective. It has to do more with practicality and hi=\r\ns nature, at least as I understand it. To get entangled in love affairs can=\r\n bring unwanted waste of time and may compromise security and the quality o=\r\nf his job. Besides, I see him as a guy committed to his word. Aside of thes=\r\ne objections, for any other man, yes, the scenario is very likely. Not only=\r\n because he is a man, but because of the time period and the conventions of=\r\n what was allowed to males then. This woud be un-Politically Correct now, t=\r\no say the least, however, visits to brothels, lovers and concubines were ve=\r\nry, very, very common in XIX century, East and West alike. The idea of non =\r\narranged marriages in the West is also pretty new. In any case, I had this =\r\nlittle chat before about Kenshin . Realistically speaking, like in Saitou=\r\n=92s case,\n there is a HIGH chance that (if he had been a human being, and =\r\nnot an ink-and-paper creature), as a man, he would have had his fair share =\r\nof affairs. Straight, homosexual, etc. Because, that=92s the way humans are=\r\n. So if you want to be realistic, yeah, he can have affairs, or AT LEAST fe=\r\nel temptation (though personally for the above mentioned reasons, I don=92t=\r\n feel likely, but that=92s my personal take on it). I find that in this are=\r\na many people feels very strongly and come with the idea of Celibate Love G=\r\nods, which IMO is barely possible.\n\n &gt;&gt;And as far as &quot;Mary Sue Tokio&quot; goes?=\r\n If I don&#39;t like-ey, I don&#39;t read-ey. End of story.&lt;&lt;\n\n\nConcerning  general=\r\n MS, well, I respect your opinion MissB, but I don=92t share it, as you don=\r\n=92t have to share mine. \n\nIn any case, if I find one specially annoying,  =\r\nI prefer to point it out. And I do it with the sincere intention to help th=\r\ne author, not to make mock of her/him. I only get upset if the author can=\r\n=92t take the criticism the right way ( The right way to me is =91politely=\r\n=92, she has the right to disagree with me too, and I have to accept this) =\r\nand lashes out. In this case, I answer back.\n\nFiruze\n\n\n\n\t\t\n----------------=\r\n-----------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
