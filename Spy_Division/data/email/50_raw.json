Now take your st=\r\nance,&quot; replied Yuki. Grinning\nconfidently, she moved her wooden sword into =\r\nchudan stance. Under the\nrules of Tendo Ryuu, she was required as an instru=\r\nctor to assume the\nrole of uketachi, or &quot;receiving sword&quot;, during one-on-on=\r\ne training,\nallowing the student to learn the strengths and weaknesses of t=\r\nheir\nparticular technique, whatever weapon of Tendo Ryuu&#39;s broad curriculum=\r\n\nthey might be using.\nHaving taught intensive naginata every day for the la=\r\nst week and a\nhalf, she&#39;d quickly seen that Midori was the fastest learner,=\r\n and had\nmade a point of practicing with her privately, very early in the\nm=\r\norning, in order to properly train her to be an assistant instructor.\nIroni=\r\ncally, back in 2004, her assistant instructor had been one Inoue\nKyoko, a d=\r\nescendant of one of the more famous statesmen of Choshuu,\nInoue Kaoru. My, =\r\nhow times have changed=85thought Yuki, as she watched\nMidori slide her nagi=\r\nnata to a ready stance.\nThis session was special. Here, they would be doing=\r\n more than\ntraining=97they would actually spar, using the entire courtyard =\r\nas their\n`arena&#39;. In doing so, Yuki wanted to test Midori on her skill, to =\r\nsee\nhow much she&#39;d learned to exploit the weakness of the sword against\nthe=\r\n naginata. Her grasping of this point was vital, especially because\nif she =\r\never had to defend herself, it would most likely be against a\nsword.\nOr a g=\r\nun=85said a voice in the back of Yuki&#39;s head. Scenes from the end\nof the Ba=\r\nkumatsu flashed before her eyes, where thousands of samurai\nloyal to the sh=\r\nogunate were mowed down by the thousands in the\ndesperate, pitched battles =\r\nfurther north, starting from Nagaoka, to\nAizu, and all the way to the Goryo=\r\nkaku fort at Hakodate. Squeezing her\neyelids shut, she forced the visions o=\r\nut of her mind. Not yet=85that&#39;s\nnot for another 5 years. Not yet=85\n&quot;I&#39;m r=\r\neady, Yuki-han.&quot;\n&quot;Very well. Then please begin.&quot;\nMidori nodded, and tighten=\r\ning her grip on the naginata, she took a\nstep forward. After what seemed li=\r\nke an eternity, Yuki stepped in.\n&quot;Toh!&quot; Her kiai=97the vocal projection of =\r\nher force=97was more muted than\nusual. It was, after all, early, and she di=\r\ndn&#39;t want to wake anyone up\nif she could help it.\n&quot;Ei!&quot; Midori swept the cu=\r\nt, and dashed her naginata upward on Yuki&#39;s\nsword, knocking it aside and mo=\r\nving around to continue the attack. She\nwas too slow, though, and Yuki had =\r\nalready come around and assumed\nanother chudan stance.\n&quot;Faster, Midori-san.=\r\n Faster.&quot;\nMidori closed her eyes, and brought the naginata back around to r=\r\neady\nposition. She paused for a moment, staring Yuki down. Then suddenly,\ns=\r\nhe lunged forward, using too much force and not enough finesse.\nAgain, Yuki=\r\n came around and assumed a chudan stance.\n&quot;Don&#39;t think, Midori-san. Just mo=\r\nve.&quot;\nSighing in slight exasperation, Midori moved back into ready stance.\nS=\r\nensing the change in her attitude, Yuki moved to a low gedan stance,\ncrouch=\r\ning a bit as she did so.\nWithout warning, Midori came toward her, almost dr=\r\nifting through the\nair. Pointing the blade of the naginata downwards, she t=\r\nried to come\nin over the top of Yuki&#39;s defense, aiming straight for her che=\r\nst. Yuki\nwatched the blade, mesmerized and utterly in amazement at how some=\r\none\ncould grasp naginata so quickly in this age. But where her mind\nrefused=\r\n to work, her reflexes did, dashing her sword upwards at\nMidori&#39;s naginata =\r\nand knocking it out of one of her hands.\nMidori bowed.\n&quot;Thank you, Yuki-han=\r\n.&quot;\nYuki relaxed her grip on the sword, and bowed back.\n&quot;Thank you, Midori-s=\r\nan, for being such a willing student to an\nunworthy teacher.&quot;\n&quot;No, I should=\r\n=97&quot;\nThe guardsmen&#39;s voices cut her off.\n&quot;3rd Unit has arrived! 3rd Unit ha=\r\ns arrived!&quot;\nStartled, Midori moved alongside Yuki. Lowering their weapons, =\r\nthey\nbowed together as Saitou and the 3rd Unit passed through the gate.\nYuk=\r\ni immediately saw Hiro near the front of the unit, looking as\nimmersed as e=\r\nver in his job. Their eyes met briefly, and he nodded to her.\nSo something =\r\nwas up. In the &quot;code&quot; they had developed over the last\ntwo weeks, a silent =\r\nnod of that sort meant Meet me behind the kitchen\ntonight. We need to talk.=\r\n The only other person who knew about this\nwas, naturally, Midori, without =\r\nwhose cooperation these secret\nmeetings could not take place.\n&quot;Midori-san?&quot;=\r\n Yuki asked. She didn&#39;t need to finish her\nsentence=97Midori had seen Hiro =\r\nnod, and already knew.\n&quot;Yes, Yuki-san. You may.&quot;\n**********\nAfter what seem=\r\ned like an agonizingly slow day, the time finally came\nfor their rendezvous=\r\n.\n&quot;You alright?&quot; asked Yuki, the moment Hiro arrived. &quot;You look very\nworrie=\r\nd.&quot;\n\t&quot;You know why I&#39;m worried,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Tomorrow night=85it&#39;s th=\r\ne\nnight. There&#39;s a suspicion amongst the patrolmen of all the units that\nso=\r\nmething&#39;s about to happen, but as yet, everyone from Saitou-sama on\nup is k=\r\neeping quiet about it.&quot;\n\tYuki nodded. She knew very well that he was talkin=\r\ng about the attack\non the Ikedaya, which was barely a day away. Having read=\r\n many accounts\nof that night, she knew about the kind of fighting that took=\r\n\nplace=97that there would have been so many fights going on at the same\ntim=\r\ne that the beams of the inn would be hacked to pieces, forcing its\ndemoliti=\r\non. Yuki also knew that even though Hiro had been fighting=97and\nsometimes =\r\nkilling=97in the true classical style for about two weeks, he\nwas still tho=\r\nroughly grounded in the 21st century martial style, which\nwas ultimately le=\r\nss aggressive in even its most `traditional&#39; forms.\nShe worried, too, but t=\r\nried not to think too much of that night.\n\t&quot;I know. We both know.&quot;\n\tHiro pa=\r\nused.\n\t&quot;Yuki. If I fall=85&quot; His voice trailed off gradually, as if he was\ns=\r\nearching for the right words. &quot;If I fall=85what will you do?&quot;\n\tFor a moment=\r\n, there was silence, as Yuki&#39;s eyes brimmed with tears.\n\t&quot;Well=85&quot; she bega=\r\nn with a chuckle, trying to keep her sense of humor\nsharp, &quot;Are you going t=\r\no ask me to do what a true samurai&#39;s wife would\ndo, or what I would do?&quot;\n\t&quot;=\r\nWe may come from that samurai background=97and a noble samurai\nbackground a=\r\nt that=97but we are, ultimately, our own people, and not the\nsame as our an=\r\ncestors. I know what a samurai&#39;s wife would do=97I don&#39;t\nneed to be reminde=\r\nd. I want to know what you, Matsumae Yuki, the woman\nI love, the woman I pl=\r\nedged to honor and care for with my life=97I want\nto know what you would do=\r\n.&quot;\n\tYuki was utterly speechless=97she hadn&#39;t expected him to ask such a\nque=\r\nstion. Silently, she wrapped her arms around Hiro and wept silently.\n\t&quot;Hiro=\r\n=85Hirotada-sama,&quot; she murmured, using his full name and honorific\nfor once=\r\n. &quot;Hirotada-sama=85much as I love this period, and am somewhat\nenjoying mys=\r\nelf, you are the only one who makes it bearable in any\nway. I don&#39;t mind do=\r\ning small household things, but the way women are\ntreated, and the menial l=\r\nabor that they do in this time period=97it&#39;s\nutterly, totally miserable at =\r\ntimes. If you were to fall=85I would=85slit\nmy throat and willingly follow =\r\nyou in death. Not because it is what a\nsamurai&#39;s wife would do, but because=\r\n it is what I would do. I cannot\nlive without you. Not here=97not ever.&quot;\n\t&quot;=\r\nShhhhh=85&quot; Hiro whispered, rocking her gently, back and forth, trying\nhis b=\r\nest to soothe her. &quot;Yuki=85if I fall at the Ikedaya tomorrow, know\nthat it =\r\nI fall with your name on my lips. And=85know that I will see you\nsoon after=\r\n.&quot;\n\t&quot;Hirotada-sama=85&quot; Yuki clung to him, unable to rely on her own strengt=\r\nh.\n\t&quot;And=85I know I could get killed for saying this, but I&#39;m going to say\n=\r\nit anyway. Since you&#39;re the one who led me to kirisuto-kyo,&quot; he added\nquiet=\r\nly, being sure to use the 21st century word for `Christianity&#39;\nand not the =\r\n19th century kirishitan, which could cost him his head\nunder the anti-Chris=\r\ntian laws of those days. &quot;Since you&#39;re the one who\nled me to kirisuto-kyo, =\r\nplease say a silent prayer for me.&quot;\n\t&quot;I will=85&quot; she murmured, burying her =\r\nface in the folds of his haori.\n&quot;I love you, Hirotada-sama.&quot;\n\t&quot;I love you t=\r\noo, Yuki-dono,&quot; he replied, adding the honorific on her\nown name, which he =\r\nhadn&#39;t done since they&#39;d first met each other.  He\nheld her tightly, knowin=\r\ng that he might be holding her for the last time.\n\tHe moved her chin up, an=\r\nd looked at her deeply and longingly.\n&quot;Always remember I love you=85even be=\r\nyond death.&quot;\n**********\n\n\n\n"
