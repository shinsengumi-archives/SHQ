(This is what \nI get for ignoring LJ lately).\n&gt;  \n&gt; There&#39;s a new RK musicvid out by a very talented person.  It&#39;s \ncalled &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; and it&#39;s by schwarefee (better \nknown as kuroiyousei, aka Black Faery).  Extremely well done... I \nreally don&#39;t expect anything less than excellent from her in \nanything she tries her hand at.  It&#39;s her first musicvid and she&#39;s \nreally looking for some feedback and any encouragement to keep \nputting time into making musicvids.  Yeah, it&#39;s yaoi-inspired, but \ndoesn&#39;t have to be taken in that perspective.  It&#39;s as much about \nthe tentative friendship between two opposites who really aren&#39;t \nopposites at all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.animemusicvideos.org/members/members_videoinfo.php?\nv=39760\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please take a look and give kuroiyousei an honest opinion of the \npiece.  She&#39;s a wonderful person who puts a lot of time and love \ninto making us RK Saitou fans happy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; phil\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
