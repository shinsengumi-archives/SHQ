Itou in NHK&#39;s Shinsengumi!  --- two words:  Shosuke Tanihara.  ^_^  I would&#39;ve followed *him* anywhere (and I wouldn&#39;t be alone, right Barb?).  I love his calm and intelligence and the way his face changes mood so quickly and effortlessly.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n*Nods head wildly* What Phil said yep! ^_^ RK Saitou is certainly at  in \nthe top tier of the favorite list and I&#39;m sure he inspired all of us  in \nsome way or other and i know it&#39;s the reason I became so interested in \nlearning more about the real man and his cohorts.\n\nItou/Tanihara...there are not enough words, but I know the phrase &quot;Sonno \nJoi&quot; never sounded so good before he said it.\n\nI also like NHK Takeda and Okita.\n\n_Love_ PMK Yamanami and also like the NHK version\n\nPMK Yamazaki also the best the ones from NHK and Gohatto/Taboo are _just \nWrong_\n\nI think Jo Odagiri in NHK was an excellent Saitou and I like Koichi \nSato&#39;s  nasty tempered version in Mibu Gishi Den (which was close to the \nRK version imho)\n\nKoichi scored the _absolute best_ Serizawa in NHK\n\nand #1 Okita has to be Mibu Gishi Den too and that Nagakura was very \ncool but so under used :(.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n\n"
