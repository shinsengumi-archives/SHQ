His 2nd \nadopted son-- his nephew by blood, Yuugoro-- married Kondou&#39;s &quot;real&quot; \ndaughter Tama. The current descendant of the Miyagawa/Kondo line is Miyagawa \nToyoji, descended from Kondo&#39;s brother Miyagawa Otogoro. Hijikata had no \nchildren (they say, but it&#39;s not known for sure), but descendants of his \nsiblings survive. I believe the same goes for Okita.\n\n--M.\n\n\n\n"
