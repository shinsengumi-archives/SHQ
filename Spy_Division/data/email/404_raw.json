Call me crazy, but I&#39;m putting together a Shinsengumi \n&gt; calendar with Shinsengumi-related things like the Ikedaya Inn and \n&gt; birthdays and stuff. Anyone want to help?  This is what I have so \n&gt; far:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Shinsengumi Calendar -\n&gt; \n&gt; January 1: Saito Hajime\n&gt; September 9, 1834:  Kondo Isami\n&gt; May 5, 1835:  Hijikata Toshizo\n&gt; June 1:  Okita Souji\n&gt; June 14, 1864:  Ikeda Inn Affair\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s all I have for now.  (insert Megumi laugh)  More will come.  \n&gt; *nods head vigorously*  I&#39;m even looking at Japanese sites to get \n&gt; some dates and stuff.  (hey, if you know the kanji for numbers, and \n&gt; months, and days and stuff, you can find nearly anything...)\n\n\n\n\n"
