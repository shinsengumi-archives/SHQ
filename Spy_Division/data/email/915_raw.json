The =\r\npost does not \nactually contain yaoi and is rated-G.]\n\nDear Friends,\n\nI&#39;ve =\r\nread the early drafts of GOJOU HAJIME, a \nwork of yaoi so here is my review=\r\n of the work...\n\nWhereas well known films like TABOO/GOHATTO move\nat a medi=\r\ntative pace and leaves key narrative themes\nup to viewer interpretation GOJ=\r\nOU HAJIME is the exact \nopposite.  The novel&#39;s pace is very even and balanc=\r\nes out\nthe chapters by switching between the various pairings and\nleaves *n=\r\nothing* to the imagination.\n\nWhat struck me the most about GH is the tone o=\r\nr voice of the\nwriting is very youthful and matches the age range of the \nm=\r\nain characters.  One will notice how effective this &quot;voice&quot; is\nin regards t=\r\no the Hajime and Okita pairing.  The humorous interaction\nbetween the more =\r\nmature pairing, Hijikata and Kondou is absolutely\nexciting and contrasts wi=\r\nth the dominance and submission psychology in\nthe Toudou and Serizawa coupl=\r\ne.\n\nThe homosexuality in the work deviates for a refreshing mxf romance\nI&#39;l=\r\nl not reveal here.\n\nMy only complaint is I wanted more action. I hope that =\r\nthe female lead\nbecomes more developed in the sequel.\n\nGOJOU HAJIME is a re=\r\nlaxing read where the plot is based on emotional\nand physical reaction betw=\r\neen characters.  \n\n[BLURB]\nDuring Japan&#39;s 1800&#39;s the samurai\nbecame dissati=\r\nsfied with the shogun\nfor opening their isolated nation to\nthe Western Barb=\r\narians. Many\nrebelled and plotted to overthrow\nthe shogun and restore their=\r\n emperor\nto a seat of power. The shogun\narranged a band of expert swordsmen=\r\n\nto manage the revolution. Given the\nname, Shinsengumi (Newly Selected\nCorp=\r\ns), the brave men were\ncommissioned to eliminate the unruly\nsamurai and ron=\r\nin, sanctioned to kill.\nThe men lived for the moment, for their\nlives could=\r\n end in an instant. Under\nstressful circumstances some of the\nmen turned to=\r\n one another for comfort,\nbut how far did they venture from there\ninto the =\r\nrealm of taboo?\nA fascinating historical, gay, yaoi,\nerotic fiction for the=\r\n adult reader 18+.\n\nBUY IT\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3345828\n\nLEARN MORE\n=\r\nhttp://www.samurai-on-samurai.com\n\n\n"
