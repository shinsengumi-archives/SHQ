I found this little &#39;pearl&#39; in the \nmain page of ff net today:\n&gt; \n&gt;  April 19th, 2004 -- Please note that FanFiction.Net&#39;s content \nguidelines apply to the entire story. For example, if you have chat \nor keyboard dialogue in author notes but not the story, the entire \nstory will be considered for removal. To sum it up, everything you \nupload is subject to the content guidelines and TOS. \n&gt; \n&gt; Where is  the &#39;Unleash your imagination&#39; thingy went?  first they \nforbade the NC 17, then they external links to our NC17 chapters \n(which of course can be circumvent with little effort, btw) and/or \nrecourses about history or culture related to our stories, later the \nAuthor Notes as separate chapters, and now this. Next time, what? Is  \njust me or I detect a more and more repressive trend here? I mean, I \ndon&#39;t write such kind of things in the Author&#39;s notes, but they have \nto control EVERYTHING we decide to express?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that the earlier NC 17 purge was unfair but I&#39;m wondering \nif \n&gt; this and the other recent thing about getting rid of poetry--\ncertain \n&gt; poetry---whatever is more a way of trying to save space/bandwidth. \nI \n&gt; have a feeling they got a hell of a lot bigger than they first \nimagined \n&gt; and it&#39;s costing them more than they want to spend to have the \nequipment \n&gt; and such to handle the traffic so they&#39;re going to cut every corner \nthey \n&gt; possibly can as long as they have some &quot;viable&quot; reason for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;m SOOOOOO fed up with them. It&#39;s a real pity that Media Miner \nhadn&#39;t gotten more popular, because this place sucks more and more \nwith each passing day. &gt;.&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, so you are warned, beware of FF net new adding to their \ncensor&#39;s scissors. They are out there just for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Firuze&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I have some stuff on Media Miner but it&#39;s such a PITA for me. It \nnever \n&gt; seems to work right and changing a password is a major adventure. \n&gt; Adultff.net is even more of a pain because you have to jump through \n&gt; multiple hoops to get anything to upload properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
