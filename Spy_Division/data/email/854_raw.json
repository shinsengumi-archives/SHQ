In my truthful opinion, this little drawing of Fujita-sama \nis th=\r\ne BEST one I&#39;ve ever seen.  I&#39;m not kidding around here.  I&#39;m an \nolder per=\r\nson and I love the older version of Fujita-sama. I can \nrelate to the pictu=\r\nre without feeling like I&#39;m some sort of pervert \nlooking at a young man wi=\r\nth lust twinkling in my eyes *hee hee*.  You \ndid one heck of a job with th=\r\nis portrayal.\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secre=\r\ntarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess so.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/Hostin=\r\ng/FG.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; Fujita Gorou (yes the name is spelled a bit wrong on purpose)=\r\n as \n&gt; depicted in my novel here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/Ono/index.ph=\r\np\n&gt; \n&gt; yes he has a moustache in part of the story (cuz it takes place in \n=\r\n&gt; the 1880s)...also in the novel you see him later on in a different \n&gt; way=\r\n.  He also has some grey hair too. He is supposed to look rugged \n&gt; and all=\r\n that but I was in a hurry last night and did a quick \nsketch.  \n&gt; His narr=\r\native is heightened in chapter 4.  Fujita&#39;s interest in \nthis \n&gt; case is al=\r\nso explained in chapter 4, he is not only fascinated with \n&gt; the case just =\r\n&quot;because&quot; it&#39;s a mystery, it deals with his early \nmuch \n&gt; more impoverishe=\r\nd days in Tokyo after immigrating back from the \nnorth.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone want=\r\ns to read my new super improved draft of Chapter 1\n&gt; (really is the last dr=\r\naft, now with more m x m action and a new \n&gt; scene) just let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI&#39;m still waiting for one more publisher to reject it and then I&#39;ll \n&gt; put =\r\nit on createspace for cheap or something.  The monies will be \n&gt; used to pa=\r\ny for my internet bill and my domains XD\n&gt; \n&gt; it&#39;s a decent story, except i=\r\nt really has no market at this time\n&gt; \n&gt; the advantage to self-publishing i=\r\ns that I truly want to KEEP THE \n&gt; FOOTNOTES.  The footnotes are really gen=\r\neral, there are even major \n&gt; arcs in the narrative which are all 100% accu=\r\nrate and that stuff is \n&gt; explained in the videos at the novel&#39;s webpage (y=\r\nes the vids are me \n&gt; going on and on about stuff---but it&#39;s the Meiji Era =\r\nwhich is much \n&gt; more fascinating than the sanitized version you get in you=\r\nr \nstandard \n&gt; book on the era).\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
