Hey,\nit was the Revolution, for crying out loud! There _was_ blo=\r\nod flowing\nin the streets and secret trysts in inns and teahouses! Ehem...r=\r\night.\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based on anything=\r\n.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entire\nShin=\r\nsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nThank you=\r\n.\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAfter being given a clean bill of health by the doctor and a=\r\n long,\nhealing bath, Yuki was helped out to the courtyard, where she&#39;d been=\r\n\ntold Hiro was to duel Hijikata for entrance into Shinsengumi. Herself\na ma=\r\nrtial arts instructor, she was well familiar with Hijikata&#39;s\nlegendary mast=\r\nery of his style, Tennen Rishin Ryuu. Hiro probably\ndidn&#39;t stand a chance=\r\n=97though a senior instructor of the Tokugawa\nfamily&#39;s branch of Owari Yagy=\r\nu Shinkage Ryuu swordsmanship, there was\na fundamental difference between h=\r\nis and Hijikata&#39;s attitude towards\nthe sword: Hiro knew it as a means of se=\r\nlf-discipline and protection,\nwhile Hijikata, like most samurai, ultimately=\r\n took it as a weapon of\nwar. Hiro may have killed two people that morning, =\r\nbut Hijikata had\nprobably been doing so for at least the last year that he&#39;=\r\nd been in\nKyoto, and probably long before.\nIt was still a bit unbelievable =\r\nto Yuki that they were now in Kyoto in\nthe middle of the Bakumatsu period. =\r\nThe atmosphere, sounds, sights,\nand smells were exactly how she&#39;d imagined =\r\nit, but more surreal.\nEverything had a bright, wondrous aura about it, maki=\r\nng her feel like\nshe was seeing the world through new eyes. Everything, fro=\r\nm the\nblueness of the sky all the way down to her new light-green kimono\nwi=\r\nth the darker green brocade obi, was bright and beautiful. Eager to\nforget =\r\nabout what had happened to her in the morning, she focused her\nentire atten=\r\ntion on that sense of wonder and awe.\nHiro and Okita finally emerged from o=\r\nne of the rooms. Yuki saw the new\nswords that her husband wore, and smiled.=\r\n He&#39;d finally managed to live\nout his dream=97to be a samurai in the age of=\r\n samurai, instead of being\nan anachronism in the modern age. Okita, walking=\r\n next to him, carried\na suit of practice armor and a bamboo sword. Unable t=\r\no restrain\nherself, Yuki strode over to them.\n&quot;Hiro-kun?&quot;\nHiro jerked uprig=\r\nht at the sound of her voice. Turning on his heel, he\nsaw her, and tried to=\r\n protest. Yuki simply put a finger to his lips,\nand smiled.\n&quot;I&#39;m here to he=\r\nlp you get ready.&quot;\nWithout waiting for a response, she took the breastplate=\r\n from Okita\nand started tying it into place.\n&quot;Yuki=85I=85&quot;\nAfter tying the =\r\nprotective apron up, she undid the sash of his katana,\nand took it carefull=\r\ny.\n&quot;I&#39;ll hold this for you.&quot;\nHe nodded quietly, and took her hand, holding =\r\nit up to his cheek. On\nthe inside, she ached to be held, and knew that he p=\r\nrobably wanted to\ndo so just as badly. Both of them restrained themselves. =\r\nThey knew\nvery well what the social constraints of the age were, and how op=\r\nen\ndisplay of affection was considered &quot;improper&quot; and &quot;barbaric&quot;. Yuki\ncoul=\r\nd feel that Hiro wanted to say something deep and romantic, but\ninstead, se=\r\nemed to be content with two words.\n&quot;Thank you.&quot;\nShe didn&#39;t need to answer. =\r\nGiving him a short bow, she stepped back to\nwhere the maids and serving wom=\r\nen stood. \n&quot;Fine man ya got there, Yuki-han,&quot; said one of the maids\nenthusi=\r\nastically, in the fast-paced Kansai accent characteristic of\nnatives of the=\r\n Kyoto area.\n&quot;Yes=85&quot; she sighed wistfully.\nOnce Okita helped Hiro tie the =\r\nhelmet into place, it was time to\nbegin. Hiro and Hijikata had moved into t=\r\nheir starting positions\nopposite each other. Kondou Isami, the commander of=\r\n the Shinsengumi,\nstood between and a safe distance back from them, acting =\r\nas the referee.\n&quot;Ready?&quot; called Kondou. Both combatants nodded. &quot;Begin!&quot;\nYu=\r\nki could hear the collective gasp among the onlookers when Hiro\nmoved into =\r\na jodan stance=97sword angling backwards, held over his head.\nThe jodan sta=\r\nnce was the most aggressive stance in all Japanese\nswordsmanship, the equiv=\r\nalent of shouting You want a piece of me? by\nway of posture. Consequently, =\r\nto take a jodan stance against Hijikata\nToshizou, even in a practice duel, =\r\nwas seen as a brash and\nunrestrained challenge of authority.\nTry as she cou=\r\nld, Yuki couldn&#39;t read Hijikata&#39;s intention or direction\nat all. The man wa=\r\ns an utter enigma, not allowing any opening\nwhatsoever. Truly worthy of the=\r\n appellation of &quot;demon&quot;=85\nSuddenly, Hijikata began moving to the side a bi=\r\nt, probably only to\ntest Hiro&#39;s reaction, but illiciting none. Hiro simply =\r\nstayed in\njodan, facing the vice-commander, looking him as straight in the =\r\neyes\nas possible without letting his blood curdle from fear=85and then it\nh=\r\nappened. Hijikata bolted, dashing straight in toward Hiro with a\ntremendous=\r\n kiai, a vocal projection of inner force, moving quickly\nbehind the shout w=\r\nith the linear, frontal assault style that was the\nhallmark of Tennen Rishi=\r\nn Ryuu.\nYuki gasped. Hiro seemed frozen in place, somehow transfixed by the=\r\n\nsight of Hijikata rushing him, coming closer and closer and closer,\nhis au=\r\nra somehow inducing a total paralysis. Suddenly, he seemed to\nregain contro=\r\nl of his senses, and stepped out of the way, forcing\nHijikata to quickly st=\r\nick out a foot and halt his forward momentum,\nspinning around and facing Hi=\r\nro again with a growl.\nNow Hijikata moved into a jodan stance, more out of =\r\nrage than anything\nelse. Hiro moved to chudan stance, and tried staring his=\r\n opponent down.\n&quot;You&#39;re a fool if you think you can defeat me!&quot; snarled Hij=\r\nikata.\nKeeping his sword high, he tilted it forward. Then he vanished=85Hir=\r\no\nlifted his sword quickly to a vertical kasumi stance to protect his\nface =\r\nand torso, just when Hijikata reappeared right in front of him,\ndelivering =\r\na diagonal kesa-giri slash that sent Hiro and his sword\nflying in opposite =\r\ndirections. Yuki bit her lip, stifling the urge to\nrun to him and block Hij=\r\nikata&#39;s next attack with her own body.\nSuddenly, though, Hiro stuck an arm =\r\nout and rolled backward, quickly\ndashing back up and running for his sword.=\r\n He grabbed it just in time,\nright when Hijikata tried to make a final, dec=\r\nisive slash, bringing it\nup to meet the vice-commander&#39;s weapon. The two of=\r\n them seemed fixed\nin place, frozen somehow=85and then Hiro let loose a tre=\r\nmendous kiai,\nsweeping Hijikata&#39;s sword to one side, and then sweeping back=\r\n upward\ntoward his head=85just when Hijikata jerked his sword up and stoppe=\r\nd\ninches from Hiro&#39;s throat.\n&quot;Aiuchi! A tie!&quot; called Kondou. Both of them s=\r\nlowly lowered their\nweapons, and bowed to each other. Yuki let out a sigh o=\r\nf relief. So\nher Hiro had survived after all=85\n&quot;Why&#39;re you so red all of a=\r\n sudden, Yuki-han?&quot; asked another one of\nthe serving women, a girl probably=\r\n around fourteen years of age.\n&quot;Oh=85me? Blushing? No, far from it!&quot; she sa=\r\nid, trying to act the part\nof the brave, steady samurai wife. The women sni=\r\nckered to themselves,\namused at her awkwardness.\nShe walked over to where H=\r\niro stood, being helped out of his armor by\nOkita.\n&quot;Your sword,&quot; Yuki annou=\r\nnced. As she held it out to him with both\nhands, she realized that her grip=\r\n on it had been very tight. Yuki\nremembered the old saying=97the sword is t=\r\nhe soul of the samurai=97and\nsmiled. So she&#39;d been able to hold a part of H=\r\niro, after all=85\n&quot;Ah. Thank you, Yuki-chan.&quot; He received the katana with b=\r\noth hands and\ntied it back into place at his left hip, next to his short sw=\r\nord.\n&quot;This your wife?&quot; asked Kondou.\n&quot;Yes, Kondou-sama,&quot; answered Hiro, not=\r\n being able to help smiling.\n&quot;I&#39;m Matsumae Yuki,&quot; she said quietly, and bow=\r\ned low, as was\nappropriate for a woman of those days.\n&quot;She&#39;s a good cook, a=\r\nnd quite skilled with the naginata (halberd) and\nkodachi (short sword).&quot;\nKo=\r\nndou laughed. &quot;Well, it sounds like we&#39;ll have good use for someone\nof her =\r\ntalents. But for now, Tokugawa-san, there is something you must\ndo.&quot; Pullin=\r\ng a piece of paper from inside the sleeve of his kimono, he\nread, in an off=\r\nicial voice:\n&quot;Tokugawa Hirotada. As a new member of the Shinsengumi, you mu=\r\nst swear\nby the following rules:\nFirst, never to deviate from the Way of th=\r\ne Samurai.\nSecond, never to abandon the Shinsengumi.\nThird, never to raise =\r\nmoney selfishly.\nFourth, to never engage in private lawsuits.\nFifth, not to=\r\n engage in petty quarrels.\nSixth, to fight and die on the spot, should your=\r\n unit captain be\nkilled in combat.\nSeventh, to not go back for the body of =\r\nany member of any unit except\nthe unit captain, whether the death toll is l=\r\now or high.\nAnd finally, whether on duty or not, to immediately commit sepp=\r\nuku,\nshould you engage an enemy in single combat and fail to kill him. Do\ny=\r\nou swear to live by these rules?&quot;\nHiro swallowed hard, and nodded.\n&quot;Well th=\r\nen, sign in blood,&quot; answered Kondou, holding out the paper.\nYuki looked on =\r\nas Hiro pulled out his short sword a bit, exposing the\nblade. He pricked hi=\r\ns right thumb on the cold steel, and when he saw\nthe blood seep from the cu=\r\nt, he stuck his thumb out, and pressed down\nfirmly on the paper.\n&quot;Tokugawa =\r\nHirotada,&quot; said Hijikata coldly, finishing for Kondou, &quot;you\nhave pledged in=\r\n blood to honor these rules. Welcome to the Shinsengumi.&quot;\n\n\n\n"
