Kikuchi Akira-sensei, in his groundbreaking \nanalytical work &quot;Shinsengumi Hyakuichi no Nazo,&quot; states, based on evidence \nhe has gathered, that the name &quot;Kyokuchu Gohatto&quot; and the articles \nthemselves, were a creation of the novelist Shimozawa Kan. Shimozawa Kan did \nspeak to some former Shinsengumi, as well as to Yamakawa Kenjiro, the Aizu \nretainer devoted to historical preservation, who was a friend of Saitou \nHajime (Fujita Goro)....but the rules themselves appear to have been \nShimozawa&#39;s exercise of creative license.\n\nYou said your teacher was a professor at a popular university in \nJapan....could he by any chance be the same Kikuchi Akira?\n\n-M.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
