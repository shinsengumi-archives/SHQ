This just an\nannouncement and therefore worksafe.)\n\nI recently completed a short story for Samurai-on-Samurai.com\n&lt;http://www.samurai-on-samurai.com/&gt;   called &quot;Sacred Blood&quot; which takes\nplace during feudal times.\n\nA young handsome daimyo, Lord Akodo, is shot with an arrow during an\nexcursion in the forest.  Desperate to save him, the retainers take him\nto a mysterious shrine attended by a priestess named Airi.  Before Airi\ncan do anything she requests that the archer be found.  &quot;Sacred Blood&quot;\nis about sibling rivalry between brothers Hayato, the warrior, and Haru\nthe healer and advisor and their loyalty to the injured daimyo.\n\nThe tale contains blood, very little mxm sexuality and touches of the\nparanormal.\n\nAside from &quot;Sacred Blood&quot;, Samurai-on-samurai.com is also hosting\n&quot;Illusion of Love&quot; which is an interesting Saitou x Yamazaki story with\na twist.\n\nJust a footnote, Sacred Blood is a short story told by some characters\nfrom, KATANA DUET,\n&lt;http://www.bookstrand.com/authors/silapajarun/kd.asp&gt;   a novella of\nmine which was recently published by Bookstrand.com (the title is\ncurrently on sale at 15% off so check it out) (^_^).\n\nI&#39;m already planning another Shinsengumi story for Samurai-on-Samurai.\n\n~secretarytocapt3 (Silapa Jarun) below my sig is promo spam :P\n  &lt;http://www.bookstrand.com/authors/silapajarun/kd.asp&gt;\nSilapaJarun.com\nKATANA DUET: Samurai&#39;s Forbidden Love\nAvailable at Bookstrand.com\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6hqpog &lt;http://tinyurl.com/6hqpog&gt;\n\n\nFALLEN ANGEL REVIEWS ~ 5/5 Angels!\nhttp://tinyurl.com/5dowxz &lt;http://tinyurl.com/5dowxz&gt;\n\n\nCheck out my book trailer ~ http://www.youtube.com/writersilapajarun\n&lt;http://www.youtube.com/writersilapajarun&gt;\n\n   &lt;http://www.bookstrand.com/authors/silapajarun/kd.asp&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
