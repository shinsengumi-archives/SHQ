Information on the challenge guidelines and notes about the Ripper case can be found at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/files/Challenges%20and%20Contests/SH%20Meets%20SH/ .  If you&#39;re needing information on Sherlock Holmes, a Google search will turn up lots of interesting and informative sites.\n \nREMEMBER:  Do not post the story to the list or upload it into the Files.  Send *completed* stories to me, preferably as attachment(s).  On November 9, the anniversary of the last credited murder, I will upload the submissions in Archive of Stories (in Files) in a folder named &quot;SH Meets SH&quot;.  This is not a contest... just a fun challenge.  Also, please provide the header information so people can be warned of things they may be sensitive to (I know that sounds kind of funny given the nature of the idea, but you have to know that anything *I* write will be SaitouxSano yaoi inspired, so... headers, please.)\n \nThe game is afoot... and almost finished.  Please don&#39;t make me the only one to have a story in the folder, okay?  :-D\n \nphil (spiritus_saitou@...)\n \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
