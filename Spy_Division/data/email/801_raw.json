We\nunderstand how you got confused because he looks like\na girl, but he is a boy. Feel free to consult with us\non any Japanese-comic articles you do in the future. \n\nDarla, 14\nAntonia, 12 \nKaitlyn, 12 \nNew York \n\nI go back to that issue (although I check the major\narticles when the magazine comes out, I rarely get a\nchance to go through it cover to cover), and for sure,\nthere it is on page 40, with the caption &quot;Well, hello\nboys!&quot; And in the background are the Shinsengumi, of\nwhich Saitou is recognizable. \n\nI had to laugh. Hello boys indeed! Though, and I may\nbe accused of condescension, I was just as surprised\nthat girls so young were actually reading The\nEconomist. \n\nBest wishes and hope everyone is having a good day, \n\nMio. \n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nWin a BlackBerry device from O2 with Yahoo!.
