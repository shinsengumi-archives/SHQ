I enjoyed reading it !!!\nAnd I wanted to appologi=\r\nse for the info I gave you. It wasn&#39;t\nincorrect or anything but if I knew w=\r\nhat time period you were working\nwith I would have given you what was known=\r\n about Sobek at that time,\nwhich would be slightly differant from what is k=\r\nnown/pulbished now. I\ndid try and look into it but Budge hurts me so it wil=\r\nl probably take\nme a few days.. but there are two other authors of that tim=\r\ne period\nwhos works I have and can look there if you would like.\nand thank =\r\nyou for that story. It has some elements simalar to the one\nIm working on a=\r\nnd someday I will be finished w/it.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;secretary&quot;\n&lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Aiyaaah!\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s tru=\r\ne, I converted and older version of the story into pdf (I use \n&gt; pdfonline-=\r\n--very cool free service).  I use a mac at one of my jobs, \n&gt; a computer in=\r\n a PC lab and use either my dead laptop at home or a \n&gt; borrowed laptop so =\r\nusually I have to keep straight in my mind the \n&gt; versions of documents I u=\r\npload and overwrite.\n&gt; \n&gt; SO today, I spent....5 hours going through the st=\r\nory and RE-EDITING \n&gt; it (T_T) http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOSUZUE=\r\n.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks Hirotada Tokugawa for informing me that it was full of \n&gt; =\r\nspelling errors (that&#39;s how I knew I converted the wrong draft) and \n&gt; prob=\r\nably overwrote the GOOD draft, with an older version (I&#39;m stupid).\n&gt; \n&gt; Any=\r\nways I think that people who want to learn about the Meiji era \n&gt; should gi=\r\nve the story a chance, especially the last chapter will \n&gt; cover an importa=\r\nnt death (not really popularized in manga or pop-\n&gt; culture yet) and a very=\r\n key development of the era.\n&gt; \n&gt; Footnotes galor all over the place, howev=\r\ner there are tons of details \n&gt; which are accurate but I did not footnote, =\r\nbecause it would be \n&gt; annoying to see footnote number 105 and then have to=\r\n read an \n&gt; explanation at the bottom of the page.\n&gt; \n&gt; I forced one friend=\r\n to read the story and she finished it in five \n&gt; days and her frank review=\r\n was the story was atleast &quot;strange&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again you can support SHQ by pay=\r\npaling $$ to shinsengumihq@...\n&gt; or you can donate money to me at silapajar=\r\nun@... \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope everyone likes my version of Fujita Goro (I purposefull=\r\ny \n&gt; altered his name to Fujita Gorou, just as I tweaked the names of many =\r\n\n&gt; historical figures in the story).\n&gt; \n&gt; Please review and email me---I&#39;ll=\r\n even take one word reviews.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;secretary&quot; \n&gt; &lt;secretarytocapt3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wro=\r\nte an original novel which is what I&#39;d call &quot;historical&quot; \n&gt; &gt; fanfic. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFujita Gorou plays a key supporting role in it however he is in no \n&gt; &gt; way=\r\n similar to portrayals we have seen in the past \n&gt; (anime/manga/live \n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nction movies)  he is just simply my &quot;take&quot; on him.  Yes it will \n&gt; &gt; also d=\r\nepict the Fujita family and explain some stuff.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The story is mainl=\r\ny about the Meiji Era however there will be scene \n&gt; &gt; which take place dur=\r\ning the Bakumatsu.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The rating for this story is NC-17 due to the p=\r\nortrayals of various \n&gt; &gt; forms of sexuality. Please, only people over 17-1=\r\n8 should read it.  \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t want to traumatize the youngins.  I am buil=\r\nding a website \n&gt; &gt; for this story and for the general public to acquire th=\r\ne story \n&gt; &gt; they&#39;d have to paypal some amount of money (which basically me=\r\nans \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; they are old enough to have a credit card or checking accoun=\r\nt---\n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; can read my story).  It was not professionally edited, and=\r\n ofcourse \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not a professional writer.  It will not be published or =\r\n\n&gt; anything \n&gt; &gt; so you will notice that each chapter has a different theme=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; nearly a different tone to it.  That&#39;s because this novel is sort=\r\n \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; an experiment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a nerd.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So there will be f=\r\nootnotes in the story (^_^)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is OVER 70,000 words long.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOSUZUE.pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if the story was=\r\n even mildly entertaining to you, please consider \n&gt; &gt; sending me money (^_=\r\n^) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; members of SHQ have generously donated money for the upgrade o=\r\nf the \n&gt; &gt; website, which is now in its final phase (basically 2 weeks to g=\r\no) \n&gt; &gt; and aside from teh initial donations, I&#39;ve been paying for stuff \n&gt;=\r\n out \n&gt; &gt; of my own pocket.  I know the website hasn&#39;t &quot;changed&quot; or been \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; updated in months, but that is because updates would drive the \n&gt; &gt; prog=\r\nrammer insane due to the database format we are implementing. \n&gt; &gt; Once eve=\r\nrything is done then updates will resume immediately.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can payp=\r\nal the email contained in the story ($1, $1.50---I \n&gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; care)\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; OR\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can paypal shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com and help support =\r\nthe \n&gt; site&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; server\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s totally voluntary because ofcourse =\r\nI just gave the link to the \n&gt; &gt; story above (^_^)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if you have com=\r\nments, please email the author (email is in the \n&gt; &gt; header of every page)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
