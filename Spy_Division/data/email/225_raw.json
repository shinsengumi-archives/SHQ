I loved the \nMiburo list and love the SHQ lists because we&#39;re all more than a bit \nobsessed with finding out the truth behind the men of RK, PMK and the like.\n\nI&#39;ve always had the feeling that what&#39;s been contributed was done so in \nthe spirit of sharing with like minded souls. And to me that sharing \nincludes using any facts gathered as a source for our fictional and \nartistic endeavors.\n\nOn the lists it&#39;s between us members but anything I transfer to the \nwebsite is open to all much like Serizawa&#39;s site or that of Christopher \nMayo.  As far as crediting where the info/inspiration originally came \nfrom in a fanfic I wouldn&#39;t be stressed if someone used something I came \nacross in an obscure book or whatever  and didn&#39;t credit me.\n\nHowever if they used it for an original project and made money off it \nthen it would be a definite courtesy to thank the sources but even then \nit&#39;s just a courtesy and you can&#39;t enforce it in an way unless a word \nfor word copying is passed off as original work.\n\nSo maybe we need to add a blurb to the Yahoogroup page stating that \ninformation shared is for the benefit of all the listers to use as \ninspiration or background for any creative endeavors?\n\nLastly, while I try to remember to check in and ask if essays or \nwhatever can be used on the website (I do make certain to credit written \nreports) there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll forget to contact you for permission to \npost ahead of time   so if you don&#39;t want this info you&#39;ve shared made \npublic in anyway then perhaps you can make this known upfront.\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
