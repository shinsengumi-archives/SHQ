Few where able to continue wit=\r\nh the only way they know of \nhow to live but in a state of hiding, unable t=\r\no fulfill their Samurai \nDuties. Few, however=85 former Mibu Wolves in the =\r\ndays of the Shogunate \nwhere still amongst the world of modernization. Sait=\r\no Hajime, now \ngoing by the name Fujita Goro, he patrols the city of Tokyo&#39;=\r\ns streets \nas a one of the sword-baring policemen. He is known for the Tenn=\r\nen-\nRishen Gatotsu stance and is known to be equally powerful to the now \nd=\r\neceased Souji Okita, former Captain of the 1st Shinsengumi Unit. \nSaito was=\r\n the former 3ed Unit Captain. One of his specialties was his \nso said abili=\r\nty to see beyond the normal human eye. He was able to \nsee spirits and even=\r\n speak with them, seeing those who haunt others \nand those who are unable t=\r\no rest in peace. Other survivors, such as \nthe 2nd and 10th unit captains S=\r\nhinpatchi Nagakura and Sanosuke \nHarada, where trying there best to coup up=\r\n and live with the new \nMejia Modernization days. Sanosuke was known for hi=\r\ns ways with a \nspear, being rather horrid at sword fighting. He was a maste=\r\nr of \nTaneda Style Spear-Fighting. But this story is about two samurai who =\r\n\nwhere only recruits of the Shinsengumi in the Bakumatsu war. They are \nTai=\r\nka Noezoe and Fujiwara Makoto. They continue to strive as Samurai \nin the n=\r\name of the Shinsengumi. They still patrol the roads of Kyoto \nand live as i=\r\nf it where still the &quot;good old days&quot;. Here is their \nstory, about the reviv=\r\nal of the Shinsengumi.\n\n\n\n&quot;Hey=85. Taiki=85 wake up.&quot; Eye opening, Taiki No=\r\nezoe wakes to see his \npartner Fujiwara kneeling down beside him. &quot;Hm=85. F=\r\nujiwara=85. Is it \nmidnight?&quot; &quot;Yes brother, it is. Its time now so get off =\r\nyour ass and \nlets go.&quot; Taiki stumbled from his small bed. Fujiwara was sta=\r\nnding \nnext to him. He was wearing his blue white uniform with the &quot;Faith&quot; =\r\n\nsymbol on the back in white. The body of the uniform was a darkish \nblue a=\r\nnd on the bottom of the sleeves where white spick like patterns \nrunning up=\r\nward. He wore a black fishnet shirt with his dark black \nkimono. Fujiwara w=\r\nalked to the closet of their small one roomed home. \nHe slid open the door =\r\nand took out Taiki&#39;s matching uniform and his \nlight gray kimono. Taiki wal=\r\nked up to Fujiwara who then took in hand \nhis clothing then quickly slide o=\r\nn his dressage. Fujiwara then went \nup to his sword rack that was sitting o=\r\nn the floor next to his \nbedding. He lowered and lifted up his black and re=\r\nd sheathed katana \nas well as the matching wakizashi. He tied them to his b=\r\nelt then \nstood there, ready for there upcoming night. Taiki as well went t=\r\no \nhis sword stand and took in hand and tied to his belt his sword set. \nTa=\r\niki looked up at Fujiwara and gave a slight smile. &quot;Well Fuji, you \nready?&quot;=\r\n &quot;Heh=85 always am, brother.&quot; Taiki nodded then walked to the \ndoor and slo=\r\nwly slid it open then peeked out into the dark night. \nSmall faint lights l=\r\nit the sides of the street showing a few people \nsitting here and there on =\r\na corner. Taiki and Fuji then quickly \nrushed out into the night, quickly r=\r\nunning into a dark alley for \ncover. Taiki went farther into the alley whil=\r\ne Fuji stayed at the \nopening of the alley peeking out into the open. Fuji =\r\nthen rushed out \nof the alley up to another alley with Taiki right behind h=\r\nim. Taiki \nthen took watch. He saw in the distance four men walking down th=\r\ne \nstreet, all four wearing blue uniforms and dress blue jean pants, \nsymbo=\r\nlizing them to be a local police brigade on patrol. &quot;Hey Fuji, \nwanna test =\r\nout our blades on these simpletons?&quot; &quot;Heh. Taiki, you \ndon&#39;t want to stain =\r\nyour sword with government pigs blood now do \nyou?&quot; He said giving a small =\r\nlaugh showing sarcasm. Taiki gave a \nsmall laugh as well as he unsheathed h=\r\nis blade. &quot;Lets get em bro!&quot; \nFujiwara drew his blade as well. They both wa=\r\nited for their moment of \nattack. The men walked until they came to one of =\r\nthe few houses that \nwhere still light inside. They simply walked in. &quot;Huh=\r\n=85 what in the \nworld? Hey Fuji, they went into that local home. You think=\r\n there \nsuppose to be there?&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t know but lets go crash their little wa=\r\nlk \nin and go see what their up to.&quot; They both ran swiftly to the edge of \n=\r\nthe house. Fujiwara peeked into a window that had barely enough eye \npeekin=\r\ng room. In there he was able to see three of the police and \npart of one ot=\r\nher person but he was unidentifiable. &quot;Okay, on my \ncount=85. 1=85. 2=85. 3=\r\n=85 NOW!&quot; Taiki rushed into the door followed right \nnext to Fuji. As they =\r\nentered they both quickly took out one of the \npolicemen as if they wanted =\r\nto fight fairly with the others. &quot;What in \nthe hell?!?!?  HEY?! Who the hel=\r\nl are you?&quot; The other two policemen \ndrew their sabers. The other man drew =\r\na katana. &quot;How dare you jump \ninto my home and kill a government official. =\r\nWait a second=85.&quot; The man \nstared at Fuji and Taiki then went into slight =\r\nshock. &quot;SHINSENGUMI?! \nDAMN YOU SHOGUNATE DOGS YOUR ALL SUPOSE TO BE DEAD!&quot;=\r\n Fuji smiled \ndemonically. &quot;Yeah, I guess we are suppose to be dead. Maybe =\r\nwe ARE \ndead. He he he.&quot; Taiki laughed with him. The police then charged th=\r\ne \ntwo, their sabers up. &quot;Wow, thinking they can overcome us with wimpy \nsa=\r\nbers.&quot; Fuji quickly went into Tennen-Reshen stance, lifting the \nblade up i=\r\nnto the policemen, their blades striking. Taiki dodged the \npolicemen&#39;s att=\r\nack then glanced around. He saw a spear hanging above \nthe fireplace and we=\r\nnt for it, grasping it in hand then pulling it \ndown. &quot;I&#39;m not to hot with =\r\na sword so I&#39;ll just use this for now. He \nthen lunged at his enemy police =\r\nofficer, pulling off a move that made \nthe policeman&#39;s saber fling out of h=\r\nis hands and into the wall. Taiki \nthen jabbed the blade of the spear into =\r\nthe gut of his enemy and \nclaimed the officer&#39;s death as his victory. &quot;Hah =\r\nhah. That&#39;s what I&#39;m \ntalking about!&quot; Fuji was messing with his enemy. He c=\r\nontinued \nblocking wimpy attacks while taunting the police. &quot;Come on man. \n=\r\nAren&#39;t you government pigs suppose to be great fighters. So kill me \nalread=\r\ny.&quot; &quot;Damn it. Shut your face and die!&quot; Fuji lunged backward \nfrom the offic=\r\ner&#39;s supposedly strongest jabbing attack. &quot;Wow, you&#39;re \nstarting to really =\r\nbore me. Guess I&#39;ll just finish you off right \nNOW!&quot; Fuji quickly got into =\r\nGatotsu stance and struck at the officer, \nhis blade sliding right through =\r\nhis chest, another death. The other \nman, owner of the house, stared at the=\r\n two now seen as \nmurderers. &quot;Damn you. Why the hell did you kill them?&quot; &quot;W=\r\nell, where \nbig time Mejia Government haters. So where going to end the ter=\r\nror of \nthe ones who think modernization is what Japan needs.&quot; Fujiwara&#39;s \n=\r\nspeech spread fear into the mind of the man, him being a Loyalist-\nExclusio=\r\nnist. The man quickly got into his sword stance. He looked to \nbe a master =\r\nof Hokushin Single Sword Style, the same as the now dead \nex-vice-commander=\r\n of the Shinsengumi, Kuisuke Yamanami. Fujiwara \nstared at him in slight co=\r\nnfusion. \n&quot;Vice Commander! Vice Commander Yamanami. Where is he?&quot; \n\t&quot;Oh, Fu=\r\nji=85&quot;\n\t&quot;Master Okita? Where is Yamanami?&quot;\n\t&quot;He=85 committed=85&quot;\nThe attack=\r\n was on. The man lunged at Fuji who was still in shock. The \nblade was swun=\r\ng downward right above Fuji.  CLING!!!  Taiki was \nstanding right next to F=\r\nuji, the spear right above Fuji&#39;s head, \nblocking the attack. &quot;Damn it Fuji=\r\n what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; &quot;Huh=85 WHAT \nTHE?!&quot; Fuji stared up at the crossed=\r\n blades. &quot;He, sorry about that \nTaiki.&quot; Fuji then took up his blade and lun=\r\nged it into the neck of \nthe Loyalist. He then pulled it out, blood spewing=\r\n everywhere. The \ncorpse fell backward onto the floor. Fujiwara&#39;s eye gleam=\r\ning \ndemonically, he took out a small napkin and whipped the blood from \nhi=\r\ns blade. &quot;Well then, we best be go=85&quot; He was interrupted of the \nsight of =\r\nthe fourth police officer staring at them from the back \nroom. The terrifie=\r\nd officer ran for his life out the back door then \ninto the streets, headin=\r\ng back to the precinct. &quot;Humph, guess we \nmissed one.&quot; Stated Taiki. &quot;He, w=\r\nhat a shame. Well we better continue \nwith our original plan.&quot; Fuji re-shea=\r\nthed his blade then ran out the \nfront door, followed by the now spear usin=\r\ng Taiki. They rushed down \nthe street, taking a right on the next road inte=\r\nrsection. They ran \npast Shimabara, the local whorehouse that was soon to b=\r\ne sold out by \nthe government. They past a few thrift shops then finally ca=\r\nme to one \nin particular, Masuya Thrift. &quot;Damn shame this part of the city =\r\n\nwasn&#39;t burned to the ground.&quot; Taiki remarked. &quot;Apparently so.&quot; They \nbuste=\r\nd down the boarded up door. The shop had close down because of \nthe death o=\r\nf Masuya. He had been hiding Choshu Loyalist in his shop \nand they based th=\r\nere for a while till they attacked the city. Okita, \nKoundo, Hijikata, Sait=\r\no, Harada, Nagakura, and Todo where able to \ninfiltrate Masuya&#39;s shop and k=\r\nill all who apposed. They began to \nsearch the wreckage, Fujiwara taking up=\r\nstairs and Taiki taking down. \nFujiwara found a few papers stacked on an en=\r\nd table in the back of \nthe main room. He lifted up the stack to see that t=\r\nhey where nothing \nbut a bunch of sale papers. Taiki then came storming dow=\r\nn the stairs. \nIn his hand was a small bag. &quot;Hey Fuji check out what I foun=\r\nd.&quot; He \nopened up the small bag revealing almost 50 Ryo. &quot;Check it out man.=\r\n \nWere gonna be fine for a while with this.&quot; bragging about his \ndiscovery.=\r\n Fuji glanced onto the ground. There next to the end table \nwas an abacus l=\r\nying on its side.\n\n\t&quot;He committed Seppuku=85 I killed him with my own hands=\r\n.&quot;\n\t&quot;But=85 Mr. Okita=85 why would you=85 WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING \nLIKE =\r\nTHAT?!&quot;\n\t&quot;Because Fuji=85 because of the rules of the Shinsengumi.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Fuji=\r\n=85 dude are you all right?&quot; Fuji looked back to his \nfriend. &quot;Yeah.. I&#39;m f=\r\nine. Just=85 remembering of things back before the \nwar.&quot; &quot;Man=85 don&#39;t thi=\r\nnk of such depressing things. It&#39;s not good for \nyou.&quot; &quot;Well seems they ref=\r\nuse to get out of my mind.&quot; &quot;Hm=85&quot; Fuji sat \ndown as well as Taiki in fron=\r\nt of him. &quot;Well what WERE you \nremembering.&quot; &quot;=85 When Yaminami=85&quot; &quot;Oh=85 =\r\nthat=85 I remember that.&quot; Vice \nCommander Yaminami. Everyone befriended him=\r\n. Unlike his fellow \npartner Vice-Commander, Toshizo Hijikata, Keisuke Yami=\r\nnami was a kind-\nhearted man who never really seemed to get angry. One day =\r\nthough, he \nwas getting fed up with how Hijikata was treating him and how t=\r\nhe \nShinsengumi seemed to be getting out of control. He abandoned the \nShin=\r\nsengumi, but was caught by Souji Okita. He brought him back to \nShinsengumi=\r\n headquarters. Their Koundo made it final that Yamanami \nwere to commit sep=\r\npuku, Okita being his second. \nSeppuku is when a samurai is in so much dish=\r\nonor that he decides or \nis forced to take a small blade into his stomach. =\r\nThe person called \nthe second, in this case, Souji Okita, then beheads him =\r\nto relieve \nhim of the pain of his now sliced open gut. \n\nOne, You must not=\r\n stray from the samurai&#39;s code.\nTwo, Desertion is not permitted.\nThree, You=\r\n will not raise private funs without permission.\nFour, You will not take up=\r\n litigious matters without permission.\nFive, Private conflicts are not perm=\r\nitted.\n\tThose who defy these articles shall be sentenced to commit \nseppuku=\r\n without fail.\n\n&quot;Well did you find anything, Fuji?&quot; Naw. Just some stupid s=\r\nales \npapers.&quot; &quot;Oh. Well I guess we can head out now if theirs nothing else=\r\n \nhere of use.&quot; Fujiwara and Taiki then stood up and walked to the \ndoor. T=\r\nhey walked out then began rushing back to their home. Once \nthere they disa=\r\nrmed then got back into bed. The sun was visible now \nout from the window, =\r\nslowly rising up to bring morning light.\n\n_________________________________=\r\n_____________________________________\n\nSecond part.\n\nSamurai of the Shinsen=\r\ngumi\nMeiji era Rounin\n\n\n\t&quot;Open up now!&quot; A loud slam came from the door. Fuj=\r\niwara&#39;s \neyes widened as he woke from the banging from outside. &quot;Open now i=\r\nn \nthe name of the Meiji Police.&quot; Fuji looked over to Taiki. He was \nawake =\r\nas well. Fuji whispered, &quot;Taiki, what are we to do?&quot; \n&quot;Heh. Beats me. All I=\r\n knows that we gotta get out of here and \nfast.&quot; &quot;Open up now or we will be=\r\n forced to break down the \ndoor.&quot; &quot;Heh. You know Taiki=85 these Meiji fools=\r\n are wimpy. If we as \nShinsengumi where after someone locked in a home or r=\r\noom we would \nhave broken down the door without saying word.&quot; &quot;Hah!&quot; They t=\r\nhen both \nquickly got from their beds and ran for their uniforms and \nsword=\r\ns. &quot;Lets get going.&quot; They then snuck out the back of their door, \nseeing in=\r\n front that the police had just busted down the door. They \nboth started ru=\r\nnning to the west, Fujiwara in front.\n\n\t&quot;Hey Souji, do you think me and Tai=\r\nki will get as strong as \nyou one day?&quot;\n\t&quot;Huh=85? Well of coarse you two wi=\r\nll. I bet you two will be \nstronger then me and even Mr. Hijikata.&quot;\n\t&quot;Huh!?=\r\n No way! That&#39;s imposable.&quot;\n\t&quot;Heh heh. Nothings imposable Fuji.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;So, Fuj=\r\ni, where on hell we gonna be stationing at \nnow?&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t know to tell you t=\r\nhe truth, but it can&#39;t be here in \nTokyo. If we stay here the police will s=\r\nurly catch up with us one of \nthese days.&quot; &quot;Damn it! We shouldn&#39;t have let =\r\nthat one police get \naway!&quot; They continued going past many houses down the =\r\nstreet. They \nmade sure not to stray onto the main road knowing there would=\r\n be many \nother police out looking for them. They would be a prime look out=\r\n now \nin Kyoto until captured. They would have to escape to another city, \n=\r\nbut where?\n\n\tThey made their way to the out skirts of town after five \nminu=\r\ntes of non-stop running. They came to a gate and collapsed next \nto it. &quot;Da=\r\nmn Taiki=85 we=85 haven&#39;t=85 ran so=85 damn fast in=85 so damn \nlong.&quot; &quot;Hah=\r\n=85 its not=85 that=85 its only that you=85 are so out of=85 \nshape.&quot; &quot;Hah =\r\nhah=85 really=85 funny.&quot; Taiki stabbed his spear into the \nground and leane=\r\nd on it. Fuji was leaning his back to the gate. &quot;Well \nwe better keep going=\r\n. Its lucky us that theirs no one watching over \nthis gate during the day.&quot;=\r\n Fuji looked up at the sun. He could tell \nfrom its position that it was ar=\r\nound noontime. He pulled out his set \nof prayer beads and wrapped them arou=\r\nnd his hand and began to pray. \nTaiki looked at him and sighed. &quot;Why on Ear=\r\nth do you still pray to \nBuddha?&quot; &quot;Because=85 its forever my second most im=\r\nportant thing in \nlife.&quot; &quot;Oh really. So tell me=85 I&#39;m the first most impor=\r\ntant thing is \nthat correct.&quot; &quot;=85 No.&quot; Taiki laughed. &quot;Of coarse not. Samu=\r\nrai first \nlike same with me.&quot; &quot;No, that&#39;s not entirely true.&quot; &quot;Oh Fuji you=\r\n \ngotta be shit&#39;n me. Don&#39;t tell me your still attached to your wife.&quot; \nFuj=\r\ni stayed in silence. While he and Taiki where living in a small \nvillage ou=\r\ntside of Kyoto for the time being two years ago, Fuji had a \nwife who was k=\r\nilled during the 2ed year of Meiji. They where only \nmarried for a year and=\r\n bared a one and a half year old child. Both \nhis wife and his son where ki=\r\nlled in a raid on their home after Fuji \nwas suspected for killing the loca=\r\nl tax collector, which, of coarse, \nwas true. The tax collector was being r=\r\nuthless and unjust. He was \ntaxing way more then reasonable and always had =\r\nhis way because he had \na group of bodyguard Ninjas. Fuji and Taiki both de=\r\ncided to take up \nthe sword, and spear in Taiki&#39;s case, and bring justice=\r\n=85 old fashion \nstyle. Fuji and Taiki lived because they where out for the=\r\n moment, \ncollecting food from the local farm. When they came back, they sa=\r\nw \nthe bodies of Megumi, his wife, and Shintada, his son.\n\n\t&quot;Fuji=85 I was =\r\nable to get over the death of my wife. How come \nyou cant?&quot; &quot;Because I refu=\r\nse to. I know I will be with her again one \nday.&quot; &quot;Well yeah=85 you will=85=\r\n when you&#39;re dead!&quot; Fuji glared at Taiki, \nwho was really starting to get o=\r\nn his nerves. Taiki&#39;s wife had died \nearlier, in the 1st year of Meiji. She=\r\n and him where married three \nmonths before the war. They settled down in M=\r\nibu but shortly, Taiki \nwas called to battle with the 10th Unit. When the w=\r\nar was over, Taiki \ncame back to see that his wife, Toki, had died from a f=\r\natal case of \npneumonia. This brought him to a temporary insanity and he al=\r\nmost \nkilled Fuji but Fuji was able to get through to him after having a \ns=\r\npear in his side and a katana in Taiki&#39;s shoulder. \n\n\t&quot;Hey=85 Taiki. You wa=\r\nnt to go to Mibu for a while?&quot; &quot;Hmm=85 oh=85 I \ndon&#39;t know.&quot; Fuji took his =\r\nprayer beads and slide them back into a \npocket in the inside of his unifor=\r\nm. &quot;Well we have to go somewhere, \nand fast.&quot; &quot;Well I don&#39;t really want to =\r\ngo back to Mibu. Don&#39;t want \nany bad memories to get to me.&quot; &quot;Well, why don=\r\n&#39;t we go to Edo!&quot; &quot;HAH. \nAre you crazy? Okay A its now named Tokyo and B it=\r\n&#39;s the capital of \nthe Meiji government. Walking into the capital wearing S=\r\nhinsengumi \nuniforms with swords strapped to our hips is like intentionally=\r\n \nwalking into the gates of hell.&quot; Fuji stared at Taiki with a blank \nlook.=\r\n &quot;You nimrod=85 like anyone would know where there in the first \nplace.&quot; Ta=\r\niki looked down at the ground. &quot;Well what ever man. Its \nyour call.&quot; &quot;Right=\r\n then. We go to Tokyo. There, we can be two of the \nvery few Rounin there.&quot;=\r\n &quot;Yeah good luck with that.&quot; Taiki rolled his \neyes then took a firm hold o=\r\nf his spear then lifted it up out of the \nground. &quot;Lets just get going now =\r\nbefore we have more pansy&#39;s in blue \nafter us.&quot; Taiki slightly laughed at h=\r\nis own joke. Fuji stood back up \nthen began walking, Taiki following him. T=\r\nhey where now on their way \nto Tokyo, the capital of the Meiji Restoration,=\r\n The Capital of modern \nJapan.\n\n\t&quot;Mr. Harada!&quot;\n\t&quot;Oh! Hey they&#39;re Taiki. Wha=\r\nt&#39;s up?&quot;\n\t&quot;Nothing much. Hey could me and you spar?&quot;\n\t&quot;What! Are you seriou=\r\ns? You=85 want to spar with me=85 spear \nagainst sword?&quot;\n\t&quot;Heck no! Spear a=\r\ngainst spear&quot;\n\t&quot;Hey now that&#39;s more like it. So you wanna be a spear fighte=\r\nr \nlike me hm?&quot;\n\t&quot;Of coarse I do. You&#39;re the coolest guy here.&quot;\n\t&quot;Shucks, r=\r\neally. Your to kind just so to kind.&quot;\n\t&quot;Mr. Harada stop being so boosting a=\r\nnd fight me!&quot;\n\t&quot;Alright dude, simmer down. Ready?  FIGHT!&quot;\n\n\tTaiki looked u=\r\np at the sky then at his spear. He smiled at it \nknowing he was king of all=\r\n spear fighters in Japan, of coarse right \nnext to Sanosuke Harada. &quot;Hey Ta=\r\niki, you remember where Sanosuke went \nto after the war?&quot; &quot;Beats me. All I =\r\nknow is he&#39;s settled down with a \nwife somewhere with Shinpatchi living wit=\r\nh him.&quot; &quot;Heh, you could \nnever get those two jokers apart could you.&quot; Nope =\r\nnot at all.&quot; Taiki \nstretched backward. He then gazed at his spear yet agai=\r\nn. It was a \nvery nice and from the looks of it a very expensive piece of \n=\r\nweaponry. It had a smooth polished wood shaft and a sharp cross blade \nat t=\r\nhe top. There was a blue strap wrapped around the end and the \nmiddle of th=\r\ne red colored shaft to allow a good grip. &quot;Wonder how \nmuch the poor bastar=\r\nd spent on this fine spear. Well too bad for him \ncuz I have it.&quot; &quot;That and=\r\n he&#39;s dead so to sad for him as well.&quot; &quot;Heh \nheh. Of coarse.&quot; They where no=\r\nw coming up to a intersection of the \npath. In one direction you could see =\r\nthat it lead to a sea road and \nin the other direction it lead to Mibu. The=\r\nre was a sign that said \nMibu right and Tokyo left. &quot;Well I guess where tak=\r\ning left eh \nFuji?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Fuji turned left, Taiki of coarse right=\r\n behind \nhim. Taiki looked backward to get a last glimpse at the once long =\r\n\ntime home of his, Kyoto then looked down the path to Mibu.\n\n\t&quot;Well Taiki, =\r\nwhere at the intersection. One way goes to Mibu \nvillage and the other to t=\r\nhe capital, Kyoto. Where are we to go?&quot;\n\t&quot;I say we go to the capital. I bet=\r\n we could find a great \nopportunity to make so real cold hard ryo.&quot;\n\t&quot;That&#39;=\r\ns true, so very true. Well Kyoto, make way cuz here \ncomes the two greatest=\r\n samurai in the land.&quot;\n\n\t\n\n\nEnd=85 \n\tFOR NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
