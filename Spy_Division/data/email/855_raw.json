In my truthful opinion, this little drawing of Fujita-sama \nis the BEST one I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m not kidding around here. I&#39;m an \nolder person and I love the older version of Fujita-sama. I can \nrelate to the picture without feeling like I&#39;m some sort of pervert \nlooking at a young man with lust twinkling in my eyes *hee hee*. You \ndid one heck of a job with this portrayal.\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess so.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/FG.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; Fujita Gorou (yes the name is spelled a bit wrong on purpose) as \n&gt; depicted in my novel here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/Ono/index.php\n&gt; \n&gt; yes he has a moustache in part of the story (cuz it takes place in \n&gt; the 1880s)...also in the novel you see him later on in a different \n&gt; way. He also has some grey hair too. He is supposed to look rugged \n&gt; and all that but I was in a hurry last night and did a quick \nsketch. \n&gt; His narrative is heightened in chapter 4. Fujita&#39;s interest in \nthis \n&gt; case is also explained in chapter 4, he is not only fascinated with \n&gt; the case just &quot;because&quot; it&#39;s a mystery, it deals with his early \nmuch \n&gt; more impoverished days in Tokyo after immigrating back from the \nnorth.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone wants to read my new super improved draft of Chapter 1\n&gt; (really is the last draft, now with more m x m action and a new \n&gt; scene) just let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still waiting for one more publisher to reject it and then I&#39;ll \n&gt; put it on createspace for cheap or something. The monies will be \n&gt; used to pay for my internet bill and my domains XD\n&gt; \n&gt; it&#39;s a decent story, except it really has no market at this time\n&gt; \n&gt; the advantage to self-publishing is that I truly want to KEEP THE \n&gt; FOOTNOTES. The footnotes are really general, there are even major \n&gt; arcs in the narrative which are all 100% accurate and that stuff is \n&gt; explained in the videos at the novel&#39;s webpage (yes the vids are me \n&gt; going on and on about stuff---but it&#39;s the Meiji Era which is much \n&gt; more fascinating than the sanitized version you get in your \nstandard \n&gt; book on the era).\n&gt;\n\n\n\n                         \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nMoody friends.
