(Entertainment sources include PMK, NHK, and Shin Kepp.)\nMain Characters: Hijikata Toshizo\nArchived on the website: no\nGeneral Rating: Will vary from post to post. Should not be higher \nthan an R.\nWarning: Nothing as of yet, but that will vary from post to post\nDisclaimer: While this is my version of the character and I draw as \nmuch as possible on historical sources, I do also draw a considerable \namount of inspiration from the above listed sources. I do not own \nPMK, NHK, or Shin Kepp. Nor do I own any of the pics used in the fic.\n\n\nSummary - Hijikata gets stranded on an island in the middle of \nnowhere and soon discovers the natives are crazy. And then there is \nthat monkey...\n\nThis story is not located here at SHQ Spy Division. It is being \nwritten from post to post in a community on LiveJournal. \nhttp://www.livejournal.com/community/miburo_island/ \n\n\n\n\n"
