Light dust falling \nfrom a dark sky.  I walk and feel it fall on my head, the tingle of \ncold on my skin and scalp.  The flakes are large and slow.  They \ngather on the heavy sack I carry over my shoulder  They cling to \ntrees and ground and cloth.\n\n\tWhen I was young, I loved the snow.  I would wait all autumn \njust for the first falls to come, so that I could go out and play in \nit.  I would toss it above my head and run with all the exuberance of \nyouth.  My feet and hands would be numb from hours in it, my mother \nwould chide me for not coming when called, saying my sniffles and \nsneezes where what I deserved for not obeying her.  My grandmother \nwould just shake her head, a slight smile on her face.  \n\n\tSometimes at night I would sit outside with my grandmother \nunder the awnings and watch the flakes swirl in the garden.  White \nclusters to replace the white cherry blossoms.  We would sip our tea, \nand maybe nibble some little snack she had made.  But we would never \ntalk.  We would just watch.  One night, I asked her where the snow \ncame from.\n\n\t&quot;Where does the snow come from Hayasuke?  That is a very old \nquestion indeed.  I asked my father the same question when I was your \nage.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Did he know?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Oh yes dear.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;What did he tell you?!&quot;  \n\n\tExcitement and anticipation filled my voice.  The mystery was \nabout to be solved.  Calmly my grandmother took another sip of tea.  \nNo hurry.  I felt as if I would burst from containing my eagerness.  \nShe spoke softly.\n\n\t&quot;One night, after a great snowfall, we were walking home and \nI asked him your question.  He looked thoughtful for a second, and \nthen he told me to look in the sky and tell me what I saw.  I looked \nup and saw nothing but the stars.  I didn&#39;t understand.  He was \npatient with me, as parents can be with children.&quot;\n\n\tShe took another sip of her tea.\n\n\t&quot;&#39;The stars Yoki, don&#39;t you see&#39;, he said to me.  The stars \nare fires in the sky, and the snow is their ashes falling to earth.&quot;\n\n\tI was puzzled.\n\n\t&quot;But grandmother, if the stars are fire, and the snows ash, \nthen why is it cold?&quot;\n\n\tShe smiled.\n\n\t&quot;Another question that I asked.  Because you see dear, the \nstars aren&#39;t like regular fire that we have.  Their special.  The \nstars are cold fire.  And the snow is their cold ashes.  Cold ashes, \nfrom cold fire.&quot;\n\n\tShe stood up with the tea tray and went inside, leaving me to \nlook at the snow falling to the earth.\n\n\tJust cold ashes from a cold fire, falling on the cold earth.  \nCold...\n\n\tSnow melts so easily in blood.\n\n\tThe memory is startling the way it appears.  Last year was \nit?  Two?  In the streets of Kyoto.  He had to be barely half my age, \nyet he had run at me with his blade.  Ran at me in the snow.  Without \nthought, I cut him down and watched him bleed.  Watched as the \nsteaming red blood melted the snow.  The life left his eyes and \nbecame cold.\n\n\tCold world.  The cold world of a dead mans eyes.  Blood in \nthe snow.  Ashes of a cold fire.  Dead mans eyes.  Bloody snow.  Cold \nfire.  Dead...  Bloody...  Cold...\n\n\tI shake myself from the trance with a start.  So vivid the \nvisions, the memories.  Where am I?\n\n\tIn front of an inn.  It&#39;s small and looks empty.  Yet light \ncomes from within.  Not totally empty.  I walk up too the door and \ncall out.\n\n\t&quot;Hello?  I want a room for the night!  Anyone around?&quot;\n\n\tI hear movement from within.  Slow and lazy.  An older man \nopens the door, holding a lantern.\n\n\t&quot;My, my, my.  What are you doing out in this weather son?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Walking.&quot;  I shuffle my feet impatiently.  &quot;Might I come \nin?  It&#39;s cold out here.&quot;\n\n\tHe steps aside to let me pass.  I slip off my shoes and move \ninto the main chamber.  A fires going in the pit, a pot simmering \nover it, cushions gathered around.  No one else here it seems.  I \ngently lower my sack.\n\n\t&quot;Its rather late son.  You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m a night owl; \notherwise I might not have heard you.  Want a room you said?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;A room and a hot meal if I can get it.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;What do you think the pot is?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;How much?&quot;\n\n\tHe names his price.  I pay it, not caring to haggle.  A wave \nof hunger has come over me.  He serves me my food, the rice still \nhot.  I eat in silence with the old man.  He keeps stealing looks at \nme though.  I pretend not to notice.  He pours us tea after we \nfinish, sitting around the fire.  He clears his throat to speak.\n\n\t&quot;So friend, where do you come from?&quot;\n\n\tI stare into the fire as I answer his question, watching the \nflames dance.\n\n\t&quot;Kyoto.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Kyoto?!  My, but you&#39;ve walked quite a ways then haven&#39;t \nyou?&quot;  I shrug.  He falls silent, staring into the flames with me \nbefore he speaks again.\n\n\t&quot;You fought there?&quot;\n\n\tI nod my head in response.\n\n\t&quot;What was it like?&quot;\n\n\tMy voice is a whisper.\n\n\t&quot;Hell.&quot;\n\n\tWe are quiet for a very long time after that.\n\n                            * * * *\n\n\tI ate breakfast with the old man in the morning before \nstarting out.  The snow has stopped but the sky is still gray.  The \npath is growing slightly steeper now.  Entering the mountains.  I \nremember my last words with the old man.\n\n\t&quot;Where are you planning on going?&quot;\n\n\tI point up the road I&#39;ve been walking.  \n\n\t&quot;Where ever this path takes me I guess.  I really don&#39;t care.&quot;\n\n\tHis expression twisted into one of fear.  \n\n\t&quot;You mustn&#39;t go that way.  That way leads only to death.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;What do you mean?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;That mountain is cursed with death.  It&#39;s said that so much \nblood has been shed there, the streams run red.  What evil it truly \nis up there, I can&#39;t tell you not, no one knows.  The only people \nthat live up there are crazy or cursed or both.  You mustn&#39;t go that \nway.&quot;\n\n\tI loop up the road which he tells me to avoid.  It stretch&#39;s \noff into the dead forest that covers the mountain.  Dark and \nuninviting.  Perhaps the old man is right, there&#39;s a branching path \nthat leads away in another direction.  I could take it and avoid \nwhatever superstition he&#39;s feeding me.  Or at least a hard uphill \nwalk.  But still...\n\n\tI turn and smile for the first time in days.\n\n\t&quot;Sorry old man, I&#39;ll keep going this way.  I&#39;ve never been \none too take the easy way in life.&quot;\n\n\tWith that I started walking.\n\n\t&quot;Thanks for the food and the company!&quot;  \n\t\n\tI wave over my shoulder, not looking back.  He calls out \nafter me.\n\n\t&quot;You&#39;ll be sorry, trust me!  You shouldn&#39;t go that way!&quot;\n\n\tHe falls silent.  I continue walking, not looking back.  Then \nI hear him faintly behind me again.\n\n\t&quot;May the gods watch over you!&quot;\n\n\tGods.  What gods in this cold world are there, but cold \nstatues?\n\n\tI continue walking.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
