So I&#39;d be happy\nto answer some of the questions. \n\nSaitou is not necessarily PMK influenced - although\nhis hairstyle seems like it is. However, Saitou in\nthis fan-universe is portrayed as a retainer of Aizu\n(Yamaguchi Hajime) who is sent to work for the\nShinsengumi as an insider. \n\nThe site is very much a Toshihime-Katamori &#39;ship, as\nwell as Saitou-Tokio and Yamanami-Akesato. So, the\npics of Saitou with a woman are Saitou-Tokio. There\nare a few where he is messing with Toshihime, and only\none where it&#39;s implied that the woman is Yaso: \nhttp://gasi2dou.moo.jp/35555.jpg \nThe theme is &quot;Tonami-han&quot; and the caption for Saitou\nreads &quot;the mysterious local wife&quot;, which might not\nmake any sense but &quot;genchi-zuma (local wife)&quot; is not\nexactly a word with positive connotations. \nThere are a few others with the Joushitai - but my\npersonal favourites are the ones of Teru Hime and\nTokio. \nAlso, Yamakawa is depicted here as Ookura. And there\nare a few with his younger brother too. \n\nI seriously thought that everyone else knew about this\nsite already - I&#39;d be happy to try and translate some\nof the comic strips and the character descriptions. It\nreally, really cracks me up. \n\nBut I must get back to work now - hope I helped answer\nsome of the questions. \n\nBest wishes, \n\nMio. \n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nAll New Yahoo!
