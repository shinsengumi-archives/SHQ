You&#39;ll notice that they are \n&gt; individual folders rather than files.\n&gt; \n&gt; In discussing possibilites regarding the archive on the \n&gt; shinsengumihq.com site, it may be that only finished stories will \nbe \n&gt; archived there.  Unfinished stories would remain available here for \n&gt; reading (and hopefully encouraging authors to finish them... always \na \n&gt; treat to both author and reader!)  When you&#39;re posting a story in \n&gt; progess, create a folder in the Fiction folder with an indication \nin \n&gt; the descripton field that it&#39;s not finished (unfinished, \nincomplete, \n&gt; work in progress, in progess... just something to let us know it&#39;s \n&gt; not a completed story) and keep the chapters/parts within it.  It&#39;s \n&gt; easier for readers to access and alerts website archive maintainers \n&gt; that it&#39;s an unfinished story.  When the story *is* complete, you \ncan \n&gt; either upload it in one file (like I did with &quot;Fast Carriage&quot;) or \ngo \n&gt; in and edit the description of the folder to change it from \n&gt; unfinished to (yeah!) FINISHED.\n&gt; \n&gt; I posted up what I had completed so far in one big file for each \n&gt; story.  If I ever get to write again, you&#39;ll see individual \nchapters \n&gt; go up for &quot;Yasou,&quot; since they&#39;ll be uploaded as I write.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please bear with me as I try to keep things easy to access \n&gt; (especially as newcomers arrive) and easier for Barb and others to \n&gt; transfer to the website archive.  I know it&#39;s a lot to take in all \nat \n&gt; once, but once you start doing it, it&#39;s a snap.  I&#39;m putting my \nstuff \n&gt; up not because I want to reap hordes of praise, but because I know \nI \n&gt; have the author&#39;s permission (I hope), it&#39;s a learning exercise for \n&gt; me, and it can provide examples of what can be done with our \nlimited \n&gt; resources here.\n&gt; \n&gt; phil\n\n\n"
