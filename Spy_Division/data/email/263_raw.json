I have to add a D. answer, none of the above. \nCall me old fashioned but I actually WRITE a fic out with pencil and spiral \nnote pad BEFORE I put it into my computer.\n\n2) After writing you... ???? Another D. answer here, once it&#39;s in my computer \nI send it to my beta reader, I do the proofreading before I put it in my \ncomputer.\n\n\n3) When you get reviews you... ???\nb. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick! Finally an \nanswer I don&#39;t have to add to the quiz!!!!\n\n4) When you get a critique you... ???\nb. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis \nand then correct if need be...  Two listed answers in a row!! We&#39;re on a roll \nhere!\n\n5) When it comes to updates you... ???\nc. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this \ngreat idea or if this writers block ever goes away. Unless it&#39;s a one shot, \nI&#39;ve had the worst case of writers block in history for over two years!!!\n\n6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \nyou...\nc. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain! Blasted a fore mentioned writers block is \nmanifested in not getting enough of any ONE fic to actually write so much as \na chapter!\n\n7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you... D. Once I get \nit back from my beta I post it to whichever group it&#39;s fandom would make it \nappropriate for, I&#39;ve YET to post anything to FFN. \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
