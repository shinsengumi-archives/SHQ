If\nyou feel that the loss of his precious undergarments may result in an\nirreversible mental break down,  soak his uniform with the latest\npopular women&#39;s perfume.\n2)  Should you ask a simple question and he DARES to reply by stating\n&quot;it is classified information&quot; or otherwise ignores your respectful\nrequests replace the matcha powder in his green tea with a generous\namount of wasabi.  If he prefers coffee replace java with soy sauce.\n3)  If your beloved decides to smoke indoors just because it is\nraining or snowing outdoors, sew adorable bunny ears on his police hat.\n4)  If he decides to bring home another mouth to feed without warning,\n&quot;accidently&quot; leave his sword collection on the curb.\n5) Should he turn down a nice safe desk job in the police force for\ndangerous spy missions threaten him with the possibility of a nice\ndesk job in a school filled with shallow immature constantly\ngiggling/peppy girls.  If you even catch your usually loyal man making\na pass towards any one of students, mention to the principal that your\nhusband enjoys directing rickshaws in the rain, without an umbrella.\n6) If he makes you iron out the teeth marks on his gloves tell him\nthat you would be more than happy to co-author the upcoming &quot;tell all&quot;\nnovel currently being serialized in a newspaper by one of his old pals.\n7) If he forgets to promptly deposit his paycheck at the bank in your\naccount reveal your secret identity as the Hijikata Toshizo Fangirl&#39;s\nClub president.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
