I dont&#39; have a lot of Saitou standalone pieces, however, so I thought that might be an issue.  (Other than that oekaki, and the pic I did for Angrybee&#39;s marvelous fic which has my version of Tokio.)\n\nI do think Saitou will be one of my next subjects and will of course let you guys know about that.  (But which one? PMK?  RK? whee!)\n\n\n\n*\n&gt;It&#39;s not weird at all. I thought the same thing by the way he reacted to \n&gt;her death. He couldn&#39;t even bear to be in the same room with her \n&gt;body....which my little romance writing mind tends to perceive as \n&gt;&quot;something was between them even if it was never acknowledged or acted upon&quot;\n\n\nIt could be overwhelming guilt and something not romantic.   But I like to think as you do regardless.   Or rather, I overthink ^_^\nS\n\n\n\n"
