In my own case, I&#39;ve been happy to adapt Fujita\n&gt; Goro=\r\n into my own short story, which turned into a novel (still being\n&gt; edited) =\r\nand now a screenplay for this contest http://www.capeusa.org\n&gt; (don&#39;t enter=\r\n if you can&#39;t devote yourself to it---it&#39;s going to cost\n&gt; you $40, no exce=\r\nptions).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes, creators are overwhelmed by the &quot;scope&quot; of the \nSh=\r\ninsengumi\n&gt; story, and they should not be.  Pick 1 or 2 characters, a theme=\r\n, an\n&gt; angle and work at it.  You won&#39;t be able to fit everyone into your\n&gt;=\r\n story---that&#39;s fine.  Just work with the ones which speak to you. \n&gt; Don&#39;t=\r\n think &quot;epic&quot;---think smaller drama, horror or comedy.  The\n&gt; pitfall of ep=\r\nic stories is it gets so &#39;big&#39; you lose the intimacy\n&gt; between audience and=\r\n character.  You &#39;think&#39; 20 chapter novel, but\n&gt; your stamina tells you ---=\r\n you can manage 5 chapters.  Listen to the\n&gt; practical voice in you.  It&#39;s =\r\nbetter to finish something rather than\n&gt; abandoning a work.\n&gt; \n&gt; I watch fa=\r\nnfiction.net to see if stories are being finished---\nthey&#39;ve\n&gt; been abandon=\r\ned (-_-) either because no one is posting reviews or the\n&gt; writer gets bore=\r\nd.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can&#39;t get bored if the work is truly unique.  \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s why =\r\nI wondered why no one has written a Shinsengumi &quot;horror&quot;\n&gt; piece yet....\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"
