Purchasing manga/doujinshi and even scanning and =\r\n\nhosting material will raise the costs of our site.  Therefore it is \na mat=\r\nter of lack of resources and time---*not interest.\n\nFor instance, Hirotada =\r\nTokugawa contributed scans\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/getsumeiseiki.htm\nw=\r\ne posted them right away to this section\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.h=\r\ntm\n\nthere are hundreds of Shinsengumi manga/doujinshi and as much as \nwe&#39;d =\r\nlike to we don&#39;t have the resources to highlight them all---so \nwe need you=\r\nr help to keep us informed\n\nanyone who wants to be a volunteer Shinsengumi =\r\npop-culture \ncorrespondence raise your hand!!!!  (^_^)\n\nwe are just a cross=\r\nroad for many Shinsengumi fields whether it be \nhistory, fanart, fanfic or =\r\nmovies\nwe are 100% driven by volunteers\n\n\n\n\n\n"
