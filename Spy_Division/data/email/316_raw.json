So there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rokugatsu n=\r\no Yume\n&gt; Dream of the Sixth Moon\n&gt; Prologue: A Moment of Peace\n&gt; By Shimazu=\r\n Masayoshi\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tShimabara District, Kyoto\n&gt; \t1st Year of Genji, 6th month=\r\n, 1st day (July 1, 1864)\n&gt; \n&gt; 11 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; Hijikata Toshizou was late. For on=\r\nce, outside of his daily routine \nof\n&gt; being a &quot;demon&quot;, he was actually con=\r\ncerned with the opinion of \nsomeone\n&gt; aside from himself. Finally coming to=\r\n his objective, he paused for\n&gt; breath, taking little time to read the writ=\r\ning on the paper lantern\n&gt; outside, which he&#39;d memorized long ago: Sakurada=\r\n-ya\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Irasshaimase! Welcome, Hijikata-dono! Asako is waiting for \nyou\n=\r\n&gt; upstairs.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tHijikata slipped out of his sandals and went up the stai=\r\nrs, \nwithout\n&gt; even glancing at the young maid, who stared after him with a=\r\n \ncombined\n&gt; sense of fear and wistful romantic longing. She&#39;d wanted him t=\r\no \nlinger\n&gt; around a bit longer, but the vice-commander of the Shinsengumi =\r\nwas\n&gt; already up the stairs and with his hand on the door. Sliding it \nopen=\r\n,\n&gt; he bowed curtly.\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t&quot;Omadaseshimashita. Sorry to keep you waiting, =\r\nAsako-chan.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Hijikata-sama=85I was so worried!&quot;\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t&quot;It&#39;s alright=\r\n=85&quot; Shutting the door, he sat down in front of the\n&gt; courtesan, who carefu=\r\nlly poured sake for the two of them into small\n&gt; saucers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;You&#39;ve bee=\r\nn working hard, I&#39;m sure, Hijikata-sama. Please \nfeel free\n&gt; to relax tonig=\r\nht.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tGratefully accepting the sake, he sipped it slowly. &quot;Things \nhav=\r\ne been\n&gt; getting quiet recently. Too quiet=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Maybe you should enjo=\r\ny the quiet while you can? Peace, like \nthe\n&gt; beautiful cherry blossoms, do=\r\nes not linger for long.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tHe set his drink down, and edged closer.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \t&quot;Yeah? And will you help me with that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tA passionate smile passed =\r\nover her face as she felt her legs \ngo numb\n&gt; from the erotic thrill that s=\r\nwept through her body.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;And how would a simple courtesan like me help=\r\n you, the great \nand\n&gt; marvelous vice-commander of the Shinsengumi?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t=\r\nFor a moment, there was humanity in the demon&#39;s eyes. He \nbrought\n&gt; Asako&#39;s=\r\n hand to his face, and touched her face with his own. Asako\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure, =\r\nbut she thought that she saw tears form in his eyes for\n&gt; the briefest of i=\r\nnstants.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;By helping me enjoy a moment of peace=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tShe undid t=\r\nhe simple knot at the front of her kimono, letting \nthe\n&gt; silk fabric fall =\r\naway, leaving the pale richness of her bare skin \nand\n&gt; full curves of her =\r\nbody exposed to the dim candlelight. The demon\n&gt; wasted no time in taking h=\r\ner into his arms. And for a moment, there\n&gt; was peace in that small room in=\r\n Shimabara=85\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJuly 2nd\n&gt; \n&gt; \t2 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \tAs Hijikata =\r\nand Asako still pursued their moment of peace, \nSaitou\n&gt; Hajime, captain of=\r\n the Shinsengumi 3rd squad, awoke in a geisha \nhouse\n&gt; in Gion, after a lon=\r\ng night of lovemaking. Feeling the touch of his\n&gt; lover&#39;s deft, slender han=\r\nds, he momentarily gasped before regaining\n&gt; self-control.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Mmm=85Haj=\r\nime-sama=85your fundoshi was sooo starched=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Good thing it&#39;s out o=\r\nf the way now, eh, Chise-chan?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Oh yes=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tSaitou closed his e=\r\nyes and breathed deeply of Chise&#39;s \nperfume. She\n&gt; took such incredible car=\r\ne to be the best for him, and he wanted to\n&gt; show her every bit of his grat=\r\nitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;I meant to ask, Chise-chan, how&#39;s your novel about the 47 \nlo=\r\nyal\n&gt; retainers coming?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Very well=85I just had my heroine inadverte=\r\nntly bump into \nHoribe\n&gt; Yasubee-sama&#39;s hidden stash of illicit woodblock p=\r\nrints=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tHe laughed. True to their reputation, geisha were quite \nen=\r\ngaging and\n&gt; entertaining in everything=85\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Sounds like a rather emba=\r\nrrassing moment for Horibe-dono.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;Indeed=85he was most definitely no=\r\nt pleased. Although, even \nthough he\n&gt; didn&#39;t say it, he was rather amused =\r\nby the whole incident.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;I see=85well, shall we, in turn, amuse ourse=\r\nlves again?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;So impatient, Hajime-sama=85&quot; she said playfully. &quot;Yes,=\r\n let&#39;s \nget back\n&gt; to amusing ourselves=85&quot; And then, like Hijikata, Saitou=\r\n Hajime also\n&gt; knew peace=85\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------\n\nPeace is a good thing.=\r\n.. I think I know now what (who) you meant \nearlier when you PM&#39;d me. Great=\r\n start M!\n\n\n"
