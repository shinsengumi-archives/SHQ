You guys both contribute sooooooo much to our \ncommunity, and we&#39;re all really appreciative.\n\ns-girl, I hope you won&#39;t take this the wrong way, but your nighttime \npicture REALLY reminds me of my favorite hakubaikou painting &quot;Cry \nHavoc&quot;.  It gives me the same sort of chills and evokes similar \nbloodthirsty type thoughts in my head.  This is to say that I REALLY \nenjoyed it a lot.\n\nTiffany, WOW.  Just wow.  That is such an incredibly unique style, \nsomething very new and different and vivid.  I don&#39;t think I will be \ngetting those drawings you did out my head for a while.\n\nI hope neither of you mind if I steal these pictures and put them in \nmy personal wallpaper rotation at home?  No one else looks at it \nbesides me, really.\n\n------\n\nI also wanted to blather a bit about Mary Sues.  You can often find \nher posing under the name &quot;Tokio&quot; in many fanfics.  She&#39;s somehow a \nswordswoman who can take down the entire Shinsengumi, but, in her \noff-time, she&#39;s stunningly beautiful, charming, and poised.  Also, she \ncan verbally browbeat (RK) Saitou into doing whatever she wants, \nturning her Wolf into a puppy with a snap of the fingers.\n\nAnd everyone in the Kamiya dojo ADORES her.\n\nI&#39;d go on, but then I would be targeting specific stories, and that&#39;s \njust mean.\n\nAngrybee.\n\n\n"
