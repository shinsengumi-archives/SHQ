I didn&#39;t know that. Where did you get this information from?\n\nI actually do much of my research in libraries and other such places (as \nopposed to the internet), so I believe it was in a book I read somewhere. \nBut for people who aren&#39;t sick with TB, black cats are generally good luck-- \nbut it really depends on who you ask.\n\n&gt;Lucky you! And I am stuck here slaving away over mountains of reports.\n\nI haven&#39;t been to Shinsengumi headquarters, but I saw one of them-- \nNishi-Honganji Temple-- as I drove by. I&#39;ve seen a lot of other important \nShinsengumi/Aizu places, like Hamaguri Gate, Nijo Castle, and Fushimi. And I \nhave a Shinsengumi headband and battle flag, as of today...the store in the \nKyoto bullet train station had them for cheap.\n\n-M.\n\n\n\n"
