You are the second person who \nsurvived reading my amat=\r\neur work ::teeehehehehehe::\n\nI have finished the entire website and uploade=\r\nd video trailers for \nthe chapters too.  Please see the vids...everything i=\r\ns factual.  I \nhighly recommend it for people who want the history [under t=\r\nhe story \nsection] but not the &quot;boring&quot;. The story is full of details about=\r\n the \nMeiji Era. \n\nThis story is long, but not boring.... (^_-) around 70K =\r\nthe actual \nlength is 75K but I think this is due to the footnotes etc...\n\n=\r\nhttp://silapajarun.1happyturtle.com\n\nThe story is based on the original cha=\r\nracter named Ono Suzue a man \nborn into the samurai rank of Satsuma-han.  H=\r\nis peculiar name is \nexplained in the story, as Hirotada Tokugawa (M) point=\r\ned out it is a \nsoft (woman&#39;s) name.\n\nThere is varied forms of sexuality an=\r\nd that&#39;s the reason why only \npeople 18 and above should read it...so if yo=\r\nu want it email \nsilapajarun(a)1happyturtle.com.\n\nFujita Goro, again, is no=\r\nt based on an established universe, this is \nmy independent interpretation.=\r\n\n\nThe chapters:\n\nI.    THE PET RABBIT, covers Boshin 1868 and Aizu especial=\r\nly. Fujita \nGoro (I spelled it Gorou in the story) will also appear as Yama=\r\nguchi \nJiro. (theme:childhood)\n\nII.   SLEEP ON THE SEA, the Iwakura Mission=\r\n of 1871 starring Okubo \nToshimichi and Mori Arinori (fictionalized as Mori=\r\nyama Arinori) \n(theme:formative years)\n\nIII.  RED ON BLACK, you enter the I=\r\nmperial Palace, 19th century \nspiritualism and the campus of Yale Universit=\r\ny starring Yamakawa \nKenjiro (Yamagawa Kenziro) (theme:young adult)\n\nIV.   =\r\nMEASUREMENTS you go to a time right before THE PET RABBIT and \nalso learn m=\r\nore about the Fujita Family starring Fujita Tokio in a \nminor role and disc=\r\nusses the Numazawa adoption (theme:family)\n\nV.    TINTED GLASSES the death =\r\nof a man of talent, the biography ends \nand the &quot;blossoming&quot; of the Meiji E=\r\nra truly begins... (theme:death)\n\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@...=\r\nm, &quot;nefret_nubti&quot; \n&lt;nefret_nubti@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Your story was GREAT !!!! =\r\nI enjoyed reading it !!!\n&gt; And I wanted to appologise for the info I gave y=\r\nou. It wasn&#39;t\n&gt; incorrect or anything but if I knew what time period you we=\r\nre \nworking\n&gt; with I would have given you what was known about Sobek at tha=\r\nt time,\n\n\n\n"
