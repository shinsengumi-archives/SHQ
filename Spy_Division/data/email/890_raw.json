In m=\r\ny own case, I&#39;ve been happy to adapt Fujita\nGoro into my own short story, w=\r\nhich turned into a novel (still being\nedited) and now a screenplay for this=\r\n contest http://www.capeusa.org\n(don&#39;t enter if you can&#39;t devote yourself t=\r\no it---it&#39;s going to cost\nyou $40, no exceptions).\n\nSometimes, creators are=\r\n overwhelmed by the &quot;scope&quot; of the Shinsengumi\nstory, and they should not b=\r\ne.  Pick 1 or 2 characters, a theme, an\nangle and work at it.  You won&#39;t be=\r\n able to fit everyone into your\nstory---that&#39;s fine.  Just work with the on=\r\nes which speak to you. \nDon&#39;t think &quot;epic&quot;---think smaller drama, horror or=\r\n comedy.  The\npitfall of epic stories is it gets so &#39;big&#39; you lose the inti=\r\nmacy\nbetween audience and character.  You &#39;think&#39; 20 chapter novel, but\nyou=\r\nr stamina tells you --- you can manage 5 chapters.  Listen to the\npractical=\r\n voice in you.  It&#39;s better to finish something rather than\nabandoning a wo=\r\nrk.\n\nI watch fanfiction.net to see if stories are being finished---they&#39;ve\n=\r\nbeen abandoned (-_-) either because no one is posting reviews or the\nwriter=\r\n gets bored.\n\nYou can&#39;t get bored if the work is truly unique.  \n\nThat&#39;s wh=\r\ny I wondered why no one has written a Shinsengumi &quot;horror&quot;\npiece yet....\n\n\n=\r\n\n"
