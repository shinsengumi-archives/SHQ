I asked about this image on the 3-hajime.com board and\nthe reply I got was that no one knows where it is and we assume it is\nstill the property of the family...there is no background info on this\npainting at all or even if it was produced when he was alive even. \nThe pic is not on any website at all.\n\nHere it is (reminder: pics are all at the old Miburo Yahoo Groups\n&quot;Files&quot; section)\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/SH5.jpg\n\nwell taking a picture back then was a big deal but I&#39;m sure the Fujita\nfamily could afford it so it is a shame we don&#39;t have a pic of them\ntogether...\n\nThe Fujita Family house collapses or was damaged (after S.H. died) to\nthe point that his son+wife had to move... due to the major\nearthquake...it is possible that the house may have even caught on\nfire (Kanto(?) earthquake damage was magnified by major fires all over\nthe city) and perhaps photos or other personal items were lost :(\n\n\n"
