Most of them are in Mibu\nand within walking distance from one to another. Just\ntake the bus to Mibu and ask for directions there, if\nneeded :)\n\n\n&gt; The Maekawa residence (Maekawa-tei),\n\n\nJust reminding that you can&#39;t enter the residence\n(after all, there are people living there!), but you\ncan give a look at the front entrance and buy a\nblueprint of the house.\n\n\n&gt; the Yagi residence \n&gt; (Yagi-tei), \n\n\nYou can visit (enter) this. The Yagi residence, the\nMaekawa residence, the Shintoku-ji temple (where\nKiyokawa Hachiro stayed) and the Mibu Temple are next\nto each other.\n\n\n&gt; Aizu headquarters\n&gt; (Konkaikomyo-ji/Kurotani), Nijo Castle \n&gt; (Nijo-jo), Imperial Palace (Kyoto Gosho), Koudai\n&gt; Temple (Koudai-ji), &quot;Ruins&quot; \n&gt; of Fushimi Shinsengumi HQ (Fushimi-bugyosho ato).\n\n\nThere is a stone marking the place where Ikeda-ya was\nlocated, but it&#39;s a bit hard to find. You can visit\nSumiya as well. While in Mibu, don&#39;t forget to visit\nthe Mibu temple, where most of the Shinsengumi related\ntombstones are.\n\n \n&gt; There are other sites, but the easiest and cheapest\n&gt; thing to do (if you \n&gt; don&#39;t have the money to pay for train trips to\n&gt; Hiroshima and \n&gt; Aizu/Tokyo/Hakodate/Sendai, where the other major\n&gt; sites are) is to stick to \n&gt; Kyoto.\n\n\nI agree. And besides, it&#39;s a pretty place to go :) Buy\na 1-day bus token, which will allow you to ride all\nbusses in Kyoto and enjoy! :)\n\n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n&quot;I am the bone of my sword.\n    Steel is my body,and fire is my blood.\n  I have created over a thousand blades.\n       Unknown to Death.\n   Nor known to Life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\n     Yet, those hands will never hold anyting.\n         So as I pray, unlimited blade works.&quot;\n\n                               (Fate/Stay Night)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
