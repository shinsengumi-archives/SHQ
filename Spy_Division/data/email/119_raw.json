I have a brain chemistry \ndisorder called dysthymic disorder that occasionally reminds me it&#39;s \nstill there and causes something similar to a &quot;brain storm&quot; (uh, as \nopposed to the productive &quot;brainstorming&quot;).  Storm clouds are \nbrewing... I&#39;m recognizing all the symptoms of an &quot;episode&quot; coming \non, so I&#39;m not thinking very straight and I may seem AWOL for a while \nafter this.  I&#39;ll be reading posts, just not participating (except if \nsomething administrative should arise).  As I told Barb in a private \nemail, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how quickly I snap out of it since \nI don&#39;t have nearly the number of stresses and things to worry about \nthat I&#39;ve had in the past.  Unfortunately meds don&#39;t prevent or cure \nthe episodes... it&#39;s always just a matter of riding out the storm.  \nblah blah blah\n\nThankfully, Yahoo has straightened out my account... finally.\n\nTiffany, I am the most undisciplined writer imaginable... or close to \nit, anyway.  An idea strikes me --- a mood, a phrase, a picture, \nsometimes an event in my life... anything can inspire the idea.  I \nopen up a new MSWord document and just start writing.  Sometimes the \nstory completely evolves on its own; other times I end up writing \nbits and pieces as scenes or dialogue come, then either bridge them \nor keep them around for use later in other stories.  The one thing I \nnever do is ignore the urge to write... even if I sit bolt upright at \n2 a.m. with something that needs to get out.  It may or may not come \nto a realized story, but so often those stray fragments have come \ninto play perfectly in other stories.  If I hadn&#39;t written them down, \nthey would&#39;ve been lost.\n\nAbout LJ --- you can still use it as a private journal.  You don&#39;t \nhave to make your entries public.  I&#39;ve started using mine to track \ndates of things happening with this disorder.  No one else can read \nthem.  As I&#39;m online more than off, it&#39;s handy to have available.  \nEasier than keeping a physical journal or carrying around a \nlaptop.  ;-)\n\nOccasionally a story has had to be mapped out to a certain degree.  \nThe unfinished &quot;Oujougiwa no Seizonsha&quot; relies on the timing of the \nwithdrawal symptoms of opium.  Where chapters begin and end are marks \nof time when one set of symptoms end and another set begin.  (That is \nremains unfinished has to do with the depressing nature of the story, \nwhich I haven&#39;t been in a frame of mind to deal with.) &quot;Kitaku&quot; began \nto go astray, but the idea was (and still is) to have two stories \nrunning concurrently (present and past) that (hopefully) complement \nand explain each other. What happens beyond those markers and/or \nlimitations is completely open to chance.  (BTW, I see structure as \nlimitation, which isn&#39;t a bad thing... I&#39;m simply more creative \nwithout the structure.)\n\nPart of my problem with trying to structure or outline a story is \nthat I deal with two characters who don&#39;t behave.  RK Saitou & Sano \nare friggin&#39; mind gamers --- they take my perfectly laid plans and \nbefore I know it, I&#39;m so far away from my original intentions that \nthe story has gone in an unexpected direction.  Obviously, they don&#39;t \ndo that literally... it&#39;s still all in my head, but be forewarned \nthat characters can take on a voice of their own.  Only you & your \npersonal style can dictate how much freedom you give them to take a \nstory in any given direction.  I stopped trying to fight it because I \nfound myself blocking if I tried to force them into a container I \nwanted them in.  Your subconscious is very powerful, unhindered as it \nis by rules and structure.  Sometimes it pays to let it out for a \nrun... even if you rope them in later.\n\nWhere do chapters end?  Like MissB (I think) said, they end when they \nend.  More often than not I just have a sense that it wants to end at \na certain point.  The mood or the activity is complete or reached a \nstage where it&#39;s time to take a breather, or it&#39;s the perfect place \nfor a cliffhanger.\n\nI also took the time before I ever started writing to learn something \nabout the background --- about Saitou, the Shinsengumi, the bakumatsu \nand Restoration, etc.  I really couldn&#39;t write RK fanfic until I had \nsome basic foundation, which you already have.  I started watching RK \njust over a year ago and didn&#39;t start writing (RK fanfic, that is)\nuntil December.  Now, as I write and come upon something that I feel \nI need to know more about, I stop and do some research.  (Or more \nlike, in my case, if the writing bug is biting hard, I just move \nbeyond that point and keep writing, altering as necessary once I do \nget information I want.)  There&#39;s no way of knowing it all --- it&#39;s \nlike waiting to have a baby until you can afford it --- you&#39;ll never \nget the story written or conceive the child!  ;-)  One thing I warn \nyou about though in writing about this time period (or any historical \nsetting) is the problem of new and changing information.  It will \ndrive you *crazy*!  Just when things are falling into place, \n*someone* (like secretarytocapt3???) runs into new info that blows \neverything out of the water.  Be flexible or be firm... there&#39;s no in \nbetween.  Either be willing to rewrite or stick to a specific history \nno matter what new info comes around.  Personally, I&#39;m beginning to \nfavor the latter with a disclaimer that new info is constantly being \ndiscovered or that there are several versions of the history.\n\nEditing --- I majorly edit as I write, which is supposed to be the \nwrong thing to do in creative writing, but I can&#39;t stop doing it.  \nWhen a chapter is finished, I read it over immediately and do more \nediting.  Then I take a little time away from it to clear my mind and \nreturn to read it over again, making only minor grammar or spelling \ncorrections, maybe something more major that hits me over the head \nright then and there.  Then I go back over it again, watching purely \nfor finer grammar points, like overused words, pronoun usage, etc.  \nSome people read it aloud to check for flow and understanding, but as \nI&#39;m someone who cannot bear to be read to, it&#39;s been pointless.  I&#39;m \nalso someone who needs to experience immediate accomplishment \n(because of the focus & concentration problems I have with the \ndisorder), so once I&#39;m satisfied, out it goes into the ether.  If you \nhave someone who has the time and the skill to beta, go for it.  \nUntil a few weeks ago, although there have been plenty of people \nwilling to read over stuff & have given me encouragement, I&#39;ve never \nreally felt I had access to a beta-reader. Most people I know & trust \nsimply don&#39;t have the time. I now have someone who is starting to \nwork with me and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how much she can help \nme improve.  Other than that, I&#39;ve relied on feedback from readers in \ngeneral (when I can get it).\n\nIt all comes down to everyone has their way of doing things. \nHopefully with many of us giving you some insight into how we \napproach it, you&#39;ll find things that work for you. My advice is to be \nopen to experimentation, to many false starts, to play and &quot;verbal \ndoodling.&quot;  Don&#39;t be shy about sharing with someone and be open to \nwhat they&#39;re telling you, good and bad. If you&#39;re new to fiction \nwriting, give yourself some exercises in order to find your voice, \nyour style.  And start out with something short at first.  Don&#39;t \nassign yourself to writing a novel straight out of the gate. :-) You \nalready have the research capabilities.  Time to find the verbal \nartist!  :-D  Just be sure to have fun along the way.  May the muses \nbe kind to you!!\n\nphil (the now mentally exhausted...)\n\n\n\n\n"
