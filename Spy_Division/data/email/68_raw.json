Many of the members have acheived\n&gt;          legendary status for their skill, honor and devotion. Under\n&gt;          the banner of &quot;loyalty&quot;, they would sacrifice their lives for\n&gt;          their ideals...\n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;Soshite Haru no Tsuki&quot; is a series by Miya Ikushima,\n&gt;          currently spanning 5 books that give a decidedly yaoi-friendly\n&gt;          interpretation of the Shinsengumi. The main pairing is between\n&gt;          the young first captain, Okita Souji, and his vice-commander,\n&gt;          Hijikata Toshi, but practically all of the well-known members\n&gt;          have their own stories... and plenty of steamy love scenes\n&gt;          interspersed with the fighting and intrigue the Shinsengumi\n&gt;          were known for.\n&gt; \n&gt;          \n&gt; http://sanada.from-beneath-you.net/soshite/index.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\nAre you already telling people about that disturbing site?! Some of you may be asking what is so disturbing about it. Well, it&#39;s not the yaoi! It&#39;s Hijikata and Toudou! Hijikata looks NOTHING like himself. He has weird brown hair. (Think Saito&#39;s aku-detecting hair.) And Toudou likes like an evil Keebler&#39;s elf in that one pic of him in the &quot;characters&quot; section! Tell me that&#39;s not disturbing. The only saving grace is that Kondou actually looks pretty good for once...\n\n-MissBehavin\n\n"
