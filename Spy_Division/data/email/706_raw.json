However, it turne=\r\nd out to be supremely problematic and the ensuing frustrations have resulte=\r\nd in the trash below. Forgive me! *Cringes* It will not happen again.\n   \n =\r\n Summary: This takes place soon after Itou joined the Shinsengumi. A little=\r\n random madness never kills anyone. Link to the story: http://www.fanfictio=\r\nn.net/s/2664997/1/ \n   \n   \n  MORNING MADNESS!\n   \n   \n  =93Poor little thi=\r\nng,=94 Souji sighed that morning as he lay beside Toshi, his long fingers c=\r\nurled around the man=92s limp arousal. =93I don=92t think he gets nearly en=\r\nough fun.=94\n   \n  Toshi grunted, but at least his eyes were focused on him=\r\n now. =93What have you got in mind?=94\n   \n  =93Oh,=94 he mused, =93a littl=\r\ne variety maybe. Something special.=94\n   \n  The entrapped member twitched =\r\nin apparent agreement despite the brooding silence. Toshi=92s eyes narrowed=\r\n suspiciously. =93You are always asking for favours.=94\n   \n  Souji blew at=\r\n the dark strands of hair that had fallen into Toshi=92s eyes. =93Maybe,=94=\r\n he said with a slight, endearing pout, =93but you could always say no.=94\n=\r\n   \n  A moment of careful consideration, and then: =93What is it?=94\n   \n  =\r\nSouji sat back on his heels, the minx smile in his eyes. =93I was with Sann=\r\nan yesterday. It appears that Itou-sensei enjoys your company tremendously.=\r\n He couldn=92t understand why you brushed him off repeatedly.=94 He paused =\r\nfor effect. =93That was very rude, Hijikata-san.=94\n   \n  =93Rude?=94 Toshi=\r\n was incredulous. =93Of course I had to be rude. Look, he=92s just=85 he=92=\r\ns creepy.=94 He shuddered as he recalled the times the conniving bastard ma=\r\nde various excuses to get up close and personal with him. He scratched his =\r\nneck nervously. =93It=92s disgusting; I wouldn=92t touch him with a bargepo=\r\nle.=94\n   \n  =93Oh, I know that, Hijikata-san,=94 said Souji, languidly rea=\r\nrranging his limbs to accommodate the upthrust member. Its owner grunted in=\r\n appreciation as Souji=92s firm bottom sank slowly on his middle, making im=\r\nmediate contact possible. He brushed his fringe back from his eyes with a s=\r\nlender forearm. =93What I meant was, maybe you should stop avoiding him. It=\r\nou-sensei would feel much better if you talked to him directly instead of a=\r\nttempting to communicate with him through Sannan as you are doing now.=94\n =\r\n  \n  =93No way,=94 said Toshi irritably, thrusting his pelvis urgently sinc=\r\ne Souji did not seem to be performing with usual dedication. =93I thought y=\r\nou would know me better than most.=94\n   \n  Souji looked down upon him seve=\r\nrely. Certain muscles of his contracted. Toshi winced.\n   \n  =93Souji! Stop=\r\n that!=94 The pressure eased off and Toshi gasped. =93Where did you learn t=\r\nhat trick?=94\n   \n  =93Learn?=94 Souji said with a straight face. =93I didn=\r\n=92t learn that: it=92s a form of exercise.=94 The corners of his mouth twi=\r\ntched. =93One has to exercise to remain fit, no?=94\n   \n  =93Right, so exer=\r\ncise.=94 Toshi frowned. =93But don=92t practice on me.=94\n   \n  =93Yes, sir=\r\n!=94 Souji grinned; he leaned forward slightly, his long hair a feathery se=\r\nnsation on Toshi=92s chest. =93So, when are you going to talk to him =96 pr=\r\noperly?=94\n   \n  The frown deepened. =93Sannan is handling him pretty well,=\r\n isn=92t he? Why can=92t we leave things as they are now?=94\n   \n  =93Reall=\r\ny, you shouldn=92t be so uptight, Hijikata-san. Itou-sensei has approached =\r\nseveral others as well, even Hajime-san.=94\n   \n  =93That=92s different,=94=\r\n Toshi said stubbornly.\n   \n  =93No, it=92s not,=94 Souji was equally stubb=\r\norn. He swung off and stood up, rubbing his toned abdomen with one hand as =\r\nhe breathed in deeply. Toshi watched the filtered sunlight glisten on the p=\r\nale skin and wished fervently he would get back to what he had been doing. =\r\n\n   \n  =93I=92ve been talking it over with Sannan, you know, and I agree,=\r\n=94 Souji was serious now. =93For the Shinsengumi to remain cohesive, there=\r\n must not be dissension within its ranks. And the last person you want to a=\r\nntagonise would probably be the Military Advisor. Even Kondou-san agrees wi=\r\nth us. At least he didn=92t say anything when we brought it up.=94\n   \n  =\r\n=93He=92s not supposed to say anything,=94 Toshi pointed out. =93He has to =\r\nremain neutral.=94\n   \n  =93I feel sure he agrees with us,=94 Souji insiste=\r\nd. He planted his feet firmly apart, hands on hips, frowning down at the ot=\r\nher man. Toshi had an agonisingly splendid view of what he wanted most in t=\r\nhe world at the moment.\n   \n  =93Well, maybe=85 if=85=94 he started hesitan=\r\ntly.\n   \n  Souji smiled, apparently relenting, then knelt and performed for=\r\n only a tantalisingly few seconds that other operation which was so preciou=\r\ns to Toshi. Then he slid his mouth up Toshi=92s chest and to his ear. He wh=\r\nispered.\n   \n  =93No!=94 Toshi exploded, shaking his head vehemently.\n   \n =\r\n He whispered again, telling Toshi what he would not do ever again if he di=\r\nd not grant him this one, tiny, insignificant favour. He groaned: Souji=92s=\r\n hand was busy.\n   \n  Then he told him what he would do if he did just that=\r\n tiny little thing for him.\n   \n  =93Alright,=94 he gave in.\n   \n  =93When?=\r\n=94\n   \n  =93Soon. Not now, of course. Soon.=94\n   \n  And Souji laughed, a =\r\nbright sound, descending from a high note like bells.\n   \n   The End\n   \n  =\r\n \n  Right. This is the tragic result when too much caffeine overwhelms the =\r\nauthor=92s mind. Late night (early morning) madness! Sorry if the character=\r\ns (and author) are OOC. This is a one-time madness. I promise it would not =\r\nhappen again. \n   \n  My titles are really bad. They either contain =91The=\r\n=92 or bad alliteration. Suggestions for a better title would definitely be=\r\n considered. \n   \n  Anyone wants to read the sequel about Toshi=92s fateful=\r\n encounter with dear Itou-sensei? Tell me, yes?\n   \n  Meanwhile, please rev=\r\niew if you are reading this. Yes. Collapses from sheer exhaustion.\n   \n\n\n\t\t=\r\n\n---------------------------------\n Yahoo!
