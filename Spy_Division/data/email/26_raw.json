The address is \nhttp://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office/ .  You don&#39;t have to be \nan LJ user or a member of the community to look at the site in \ngeneral... you just can&#39;t read any of the posts (except for my LJ-\nuser guinea pig, Masayoshi, who&#39;s already a member).  If you can, \nplease contact me ASAP.  And by posts I don&#39;t necessarily mean the \nmain entries.  If you see an entry, try getting to the good stuff \nwhen you click on the link to get what hides behind the lj-cut.  If \nyou can read either of the stories that are posted there, let me know \nASAP.\n\nMore details about what&#39;s going on, including guidelines and help, \nare in the document I&#39;ll be uploading into List Business on the LJ \nCommunity after I post this.  I&#39;m sure a notification will be sent to \nthe list announcing it&#39;s been uploaded.  Please be sure to read this \ndocument before you start sending stories up to the LJ.  Please??? :-)\n\nAnd, you&#39;ll get notification that the Main guidelines have been re-\nuploaded.  In working with archiving, it became necessary to add a \nline to the header to create key words that will search for stories.  \nIt&#39;s EXTREMELY limited, but better than nothing.  For now, we&#39;re \nlimited to 5 key words that use only 40 characters and I&#39;m making \ncertain demands on them. I want a pen-name, the source material, and \nthe rating.  For the other two, I&#39;d like to see either the \nShinsengumi as a whole or a specific member who&#39;s most prominent in \nthe story for one of the key words and lastly, an indication of genre \nso people looking for action, romance, angst, yaoi, whatever, can \nfind things by that.\n\nThanks to Masayoshi for helping me and for sending me the makoto \nflag.  I&#39;m going to bed!  I hope...\n\npachi\n\n\n"
