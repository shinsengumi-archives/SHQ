Not=\r\nhing major.\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based on an=\r\nything.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entir=\r\ne\nShinsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nTha=\r\nnk you.\n\nChapter 11\n\nJuly 15th\n\nThe night of chaos at the Ikedaya was slowl=\r\ny becoming a distant\nmemory. Life in Kyoto moved on as usual, but things we=\r\nre different for\nthe Shinsengumi. Gone were the days of their appellation b=\r\ny most as\n&quot;wolves&quot;. Since they had saved the city from almost certain\nannih=\r\nilation, they were still feared, but were now respected by many\nmore people=\r\n than before=97commoner, lord, and courtier alike. In the\nwake of their suc=\r\ncess, Lord Matsudaira had personally sent a monetary\nreward for the Shinsen=\r\ngumi&#39;s exceptional conduct, as had Emperor\nKomei. It seemed as though the S=\r\nhinsengumi was on the top of the\nworld, unshakeable in its sincerity to the=\r\n Shogunate&#39;s cause and its\npursuit of public order in Kyoto.\nAway from the =\r\nhustle and bustle of the Shinsengumi headquarters, the\nYanagi-ya was silent=\r\n, adrift in the morning calm. The sunlight,\nstronger now that the sun had r=\r\nisen a bit above the horizon, filtered\nin through the shutters, casting pat=\r\nterns of light and shadow on the\nfloor mats inside. Feeling the warmth on t=\r\nheir faces, Hiro and Yuki\nawoke from a deep peaceful sleep. They&#39;d had a ve=\r\nry, very good night\ntogether, and the new day seemed wonderful and bright, =\r\nfull of new\nmemories to be made. There were other battles to be fought, but=\r\n for\nthe time being, they could focus on loving again.\nSlowly opening her e=\r\nyes, Yuki pressed close against Hiro&#39;s body,\nlosing herself in his scent, h=\r\nappily drowning in the ecstasy of\nfeeling his bare skin against her own. Ge=\r\nntly, she kissed the long,\ndark red scar on his left shoulder, and traced i=\r\nts path with her\nlittle finger.\n&quot;Good morning, Hirotada-sama,&quot; she murmured=\r\n with a smile.\nHiro ran his fingers through her hair, which hung freely in =\r\ndark,\nglossy waves over her shoulders and back. Yuki&#39;s hair had a tendency\n=\r\nof growing rather fast. Hiro remembered that her hair was only\nchin-length =\r\nwhen they had arrived, but now, it reached down to her\nshoulders. Her bangs=\r\n had also grown longer and silkier. Hiro thought\nit was cute when she would=\r\n tuck them behind her ears every now and then.\n&quot;Good morning, koishii. I se=\r\ne that they&#39;re right when they say that\n`kissing it will make it feel bette=\r\nr&#39;. And you know, you really don&#39;t\nhave to call me `-sama&#39;.&quot;\nShe sighed dee=\r\nply and passionately, hanging onto him as though he was\nthe only real thing=\r\n in the world.\n&quot;I enjoy saying it,&quot; she said playfully, stroking his chin.\n=\r\n&quot;To-ku-ga-wa Hi-ro-ta-da-sa-ma. It sounds different.&quot;\nHiro rolled his eyes.=\r\n Their pillow talk could be very amusing, indeed.\n&quot;If you want to, then I g=\r\nuess that&#39;s alright.&quot;\nA comforting silence followed.\n&quot;Neh, anata,&quot; whispere=\r\nd Yuki. &quot;Is Kinmon really in four days?&quot;\nHiro sighed. The Battle of Kinmon=\r\n=97Choshuu&#39;s attempted retaliation for\nthe loss at Ikedaya=97was only four =\r\ndays away. He knew that at that very\nmoment, thousands of Choshuu samurai h=\r\nad left their home domain and\nwere marching across the Chugoku region, or s=\r\nailing in vessels across\nthe Inland Sea, all bearing eastward toward Kyoto.=\r\n At the same time,\nseveral times that number of pro-Shogunate warriors were=\r\n also\nconverging on Kyoto, from domains as near as Kuwana and Aizu to as\ndi=\r\nstant a region as Satsuma. In four days&#39; time, they would meet at\nKinmon, t=\r\nhe &quot;forbidden&quot; western gate of the Imperial palace. The\nbattle itself would=\r\n only last a matter of hours, but would cause\nuntold ruin and destruction, =\r\nconsuming much of Kyoto in fire. The\nShogunate would win, but at that terri=\r\nble price not only to its\nsoldiers but to the city as a whole=97and just li=\r\nke before the Battle of\nIkedaya, Hiro wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d survive. He could=\r\nn&#39;t avoid Yuki&#39;s\nquestion, though.\n&quot;Yes. Kinmon, or Hamagurigomon, or whate=\r\nver, happens in four days.\nWhat&#39;s more, I go back to active duty tomorrow.&quot;=\r\n\nYuki held his face in her hands, and smiled as courageously as she\ncould. =\r\nShe had to be strong, for his sake at least.\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be fine. Yo=\r\nu know that, right, Hirotada-sama? I got\nthrough the night of the Ikedaya I=\r\nncident in one piece, didn&#39;t I?&quot;\nHiro embraced her tightly.\n&quot;Yes. And you s=\r\naved me, too. Thank you again.&quot;\nYuki giggled.\n&quot;That was more Doctor Takani&#39;=\r\ns handiwork than mine.&quot;\n&quot;All the same,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Thank you. And I&#39;ll s=\r\nay it again=97anata\nga watashinotaisetsuna takaramono. You are the most pre=\r\ncious treasure\nof my life.&quot;\nHiro caressed her face softly, and then brought=\r\n her lips to his. They\nkissed deeply, a kiss that tasted of the exhilaratio=\r\nn of life and the\nthrill of victory.\nSuddenly someone knocked on the slidin=\r\ng door, interrupting their kiss\nrather abruptly. Rolling out of bed, Hiro a=\r\nnd Yuki quickly donned\ntheir yukata. As Yuki hurriedly started folding the =\r\nfuton, Hiro walked\nover to the door and opened it a crack.\n&quot;Harada-sama=85M=\r\nidori-san=85&quot;\nHarada smiled broadly, giving Hiro a good-natured pat on the =\r\nshoulder.\n&quot; `Morning, Lord Shogun! Hope you had a good night!&quot; He indicated=\r\n a\nsmall stack of trays in Midori&#39;s arms. &quot;Want to have breakfast together?=\r\n&quot;\nHiro glanced over his shoulder at Yuki, who had just finished folding\nthe=\r\n futon and putting it in a corner. Opening the door the whole way,\nhe bowed=\r\n curtly.\n&quot;We&#39;d be honored, Harada-sama.&quot;\nHarada turned to Midori, and nodde=\r\nd.\n&quot;Well then, Mi-chan.&quot;\n\tHarada greeted Yuki, who by now had also come up =\r\nto the door.\n\t&quot;Good morning, Yuki-san! You sure look=85rested.&quot;\n\tYuki giggl=\r\ned happily.\n\t&quot;You could say that.&quot; She noticed that Midori was also there, =\r\nand\nsmiled. &quot;I see Midori-nee is here too.&quot;\n\tHiro scratched his chin in cur=\r\niosity. This was a phrase he hadn&#39;t\nheard before.\n\t&quot;Midori-nee?&quot;\n\t&quot;Yeah! We=\r\n&#39;ve become quite close in the last few weeks, Hiro-sama!\nIsn&#39;t that right, =\r\nMidori-nee?&quot;\n\t&quot;Sure is, Yu-chan,&quot; answered Midori, as she arranged the tray=\r\ns and\nthe food on them properly. Turning to Hiro, she gave a short bow.\n&quot;Hi=\r\nrotada-sama, your wife is amazing. Somehow she can relate to\nanything, unde=\r\nrstand any circumstance. Not only is she a great cook,\nshe&#39;s also a great n=\r\naginata teacher, as well. She&#39;s=85beyond words.&quot;\n\tHiro allowed himself a sm=\r\nall smile.\nIf you only knew why both of us know so much=85\nHarada elbowed H=\r\niro with a laugh, interrupting his musings.\n&quot;Well, shall we?&quot;\n&quot;Ah=97yes, of=\r\n course, Harada-sama.&quot;\nThey all sat down, and began eating at a leisurely p=\r\nace, enjoying the\ncoolness of the room and the cheerful, bright sunlight co=\r\nming in from\nthe outside. Taking a sip of sake, Harada tapped Hiro on the s=\r\nhoulder.\n&quot;Say, Tokugawa-kun, have you heard the rumors?&quot;\nHiro knew that he =\r\nwas most probably referring to the impending battle,\nbut feigned ignorance,=\r\n hoping to hear Harada&#39;s version of the rumor.\nAfter all, he reasoned, hist=\r\nory is more interesting when you hear a\ndifferent version of it.\n&quot;No=85I&#39;ve=\r\n been out for most of the time since Ikedaya.&quot;\nHarada started laughing so h=\r\nard, he nearly choked on his sake.\n&quot;In more ways than one=85but anyway, the=\r\n rumor is that there&#39;s going to\nbe another battle soon. Kondou-sama said so=\r\nmething yesterday morning\nabout getting spy reports that there are thousand=\r\ns of you-know-which\nclan warriors marching here in droves, by land and by s=\r\nea. The Chugoku\nand Inland Sea are swarming with `em.&quot;\nContinuing the act, =\r\nHiro faked shock=97not entirely dishonestly, though,\nas he was still worrie=\r\nd about what the outcome would mean for him\npersonally.\n&quot;Really? You don&#39;t =\r\nsay=85&quot;\nMidori pouted, and leaned against Harada&#39;s shoulder.\n&quot;Mou, Sano-kun=\r\n, please talk about pleasant things. We&#39;re all off duty\nhere=85&quot;\nHarada lau=\r\nghed pleasantly.\n&quot;Mi-chan, you&#39;re so adorable when you pout. Alright, we wo=\r\nn&#39;t talk\nbusiness. For now, we&#39;ll just enjoy the food and the company.&quot;\nIns=\r\ntinctively, Hiro raised his sake cup, and almost said Hear, hear in\nEnglish=\r\n, which could&#39;ve gotten him into deep trouble.\nHarada and Midori looked at =\r\nhis sudden pause with a mix of confusion\nand amusement.\n&quot;Is the sake too st=\r\nrong, Tokugawa-kun?&quot; Harada asked, breaking the\nsilence.\nYuki looked at him=\r\n in thinly veiled shock, fully aware of what was\ngoing on in his head, and =\r\nwhat had nearly come out of his mouth. The\ntwo of them had received their c=\r\nollege education abroad, in the United\nStates, and had picked up some Ameri=\r\ncan mannerisms as a result.\nHowever, they were now in a situation where peo=\r\nple of their station\nhad no logical business speaking English unless they w=\r\nere spies for\nthe Shogunate or the rebels. All Yuki could do was watch as H=\r\niro\nteetered on the brink of inadvertently ruining everything.\nGathering hi=\r\ns wits about him, he laughed, and forcibly willed Japanese\nto come out of h=\r\nis mouth.\n&quot;It&#39;s been awhile since I had sake=97it tastes stronger than I\nre=\r\nmembered. At any rate, I&#39;ll drink to what Midori-san said,\nHarada-sama. To =\r\npeace and calm. Beautiful and priceless, yet as\nephemeral as the falling ch=\r\nerry blossoms.&quot;\n***********\n\n\n\n"
