I think you did a great job on his hair too!\n\nNagakura&#39;s Portrait...as good as Nanae Kurono! This may sound odd but\nI appreciated the detail of the bandage it actually looks like the\nbandage is &quot;on&quot; his nose...you added some dimension there.  I like\nyour way of highlighting his eyes too.  Simple yet effective in\ncapturing the mischievous nature of the PMK&#39;s capt. of the 2nd squad.\n\nHarada&#39;s Portrait is interesting because to me it looks like Harada\n-before- the Shinsengumi....teenage Harada!  and no doubt even MORE\nwild than the Harada we know 0_0\n\nThank you for sharing your art.  I think other members may have\nemailed you privately or something but I wanted to post my comments here.\n\nTiffany/secretarytocapt3\nhttp://www.shinsengumimb.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumidb.com\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, GCW &lt;saitohworship@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; okies^^ I found 2 other pics i drew of Nagakura Shinpachi and\nHarada... i forget his first name... eek! anyway, they&#39;re in black and\nwhite only, tho... feel free to download and color them,\nanybody...lol... oh, and i moved the yamazaki and saitoh pics to\nillustration folder along with the 2 new ones... sorry if i uploaded\nthem to the wrong folder ^^;;; please check them out, everyone!
