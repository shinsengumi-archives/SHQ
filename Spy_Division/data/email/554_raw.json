No anime characters here...all real historical\npeople. I own this stuff! LOL No I don&#39;t...who DOES own these people? lol\nMajor Characters: &quot;Other&quot;-- Yamamoto Kakuma, Yamamoto Yaeko, Aizu soldiers\n\nNote: These stories are in no particular chronological order, I just\nwrite them as they come. This one is a bit more historically accurate.\nComments, please!\n\nAizu Joushigun\nDai-ni: Ame\nTwo: Rain\n\nSummer 1864\nKyoto\n\nThe door of the inn flew inward with a crash. The swirling dust and\nrain obscured the entrance for but a moment, before the waiting forms\noutside became visible. As the leader stepped inside, his white sleeve\ninsignia with the black letter &quot;Ai&quot; on it could plainly be seen by one\nand all. The shopkeeper&#39;s face contorted. He shuddered in fear for a\nmoment, noting the waiting soldiers outside carrying spears and guns.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re being sear--&quot; his words ended with the squish of steel through\nflesh.\n\n&quot;I am Yamamoto Kakuma of Aizu-han!&quot; the squad leader brandished his\nsword, stained with fresh blood, at the cowering commoners. &quot;We come\non official business!&quot; The others poured in, the stamping of their\nboots resounding throughout the building as some spread out to secure\nthe ground floor while the rest bounded up the stairs. There was a\nghastly stillness for a moment, and then a bloody heap fell down the\nstairs. They were right...there were Shishi here, just like the spy\nreport had said. Just as Yamamoto started to turn, there was a blur of\nmotion.\n\n&quot;Choshu!!&quot;\n\nHe began to turn, blade hissing outward in a flash of light, before a\nloud crack resounded in the dead air...Yamamoto only saw the dead body\njust as his eyes began to adjust. At the far side of the room, one of\nhis men was busy reloading his Spencer rifle. The remaining men and\nwomen, most probably employees, cowered in shock.\n\n&quot;Resist and you will all pay the consequences! Cooperate and the law\nwill be lenient!&quot;\n\nThe unit from the upper floor pounded down the stairs, kicking along a\ncouple of bound and struggling men. Yamamoto nodded, and pointed to\nthe others on the floor. &quot;You, you, and you, tie these people up and\ntake them to Kurotani for questioning. You and you, board up the\nentrance and go inform the Kuwana troops at Nijo. And you...&quot; he\npointed at the young soldier who&#39;d been so quick to shoot. &quot;With me.\nNow.&quot; With a sharp cleaning whip to his sword, he sheathed and turned\nto leave.\n\nThe young soldier quickly fell in step next to Yamamoto as he emerged.\n\n&quot;It stopped raining...&quot; he shook his head. With his men in tow, he\nstarted on the long road back to Aizu headquarters.\n\n&quot;I did good, didn&#39;t I?&quot; asked the soldier with a slight cough. &quot;Damn,\nit&#39;s so hard to keep my voice low.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yae...&quot; he whispered, keeping his own voice low. &quot;Your technique is...&quot;\n\n&quot;Clean?&quot;\n\nYamamoto turned to his...sister, and proffered a hand towel from under\nhis breastplate. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to call it, but I guess...&quot; She\nwiped her forehead and grinned happily.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re like the Murasaki Shikibu of gunnery.&quot;\n\n&quot;Does that mean I outdo you? Murasaki was better than her brother at\nwriting, you know...&quot;\n\n&quot;Just shut up, Yae. People will stare.&quot;\n\n&quot;Haha...I&#39;m better than you!&quot;\n\n&quot;Save it for the demonstration before Lord Katamori tomorrow.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re on!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"
