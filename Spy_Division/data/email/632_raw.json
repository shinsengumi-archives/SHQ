The New New \nSelection Group all live happily in a nearby suburb where they share \na communal bath (this was suggested by captain Takeda) and to build a \nsense of camaraderie they all have a chance to room with capt. Takeda \natleast once a week on a rotating basis (this too was suggested by \ncapt. Takeda).\n\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/makoto/Kyoto911.jpg\n\nIf Kondou looks like he is about to cry that&#39;s because he knows his \nmen too well.  \n\nOkita after growing out of the purple hair and pet pig phase moved \nonto a J-pop look.  \nItou-sensei originally was recruited to be a military strategist \nhowever he prowls the halls of their headquarters in his loose \nfitting (and tends to fall off during inappropriate moments) black \ncrepe kimono and constantly poses for an imaginary camera.  \nNagakura has been demoted several times for his tendency to run to \nMatsudaira Katamori and &quot;tattle&quot; as Kondou calls it.  He currently \nworks at koban (police box) where he gives directions and \noccasionally holds up a stop sign for children crossing the street.\nHarada was assigned to guard and inspect the docks and search for \nillegal imported weapons.  Sadly, he has interpreted his seaside job \nas nothing more than a chance to play &quot;lifeguard&quot; for attractive \nfemale swimmers.  Occasionally he works overtime by applying sun tan \nlotion on the mentioned attractive females.  Due to the strict dress \ncode he was not allowed to wander around in his swim trunks, \ntherefore he adopted an old battered life jacket.\nHijikata, while at his weekly salon appointment was called on an \nemergency and thus his hair was burned a nice corn blonde.\nNakano Takeko is the leader of Aizu&#39;s Joushitai (Women&#39;s Brigade).  \nShe was sent by Teruhime, who expressed grave doubts over her adopted \nbrother&#39;s choice in men for the job, to inspect and report on the \nShinsengumi.  Nakano Takeko has realized that her orders and \nsuggestions are taken more seriously if she sports her bullet proof, \nextra shiny, sleeveless body tight armor.\nLastly, the man Matsudaira Katamori calls to drive him to the nearest \nStarbucks for a green tea Frapacinno is Saitou Hajime. His quiet \ndemeanor is a shield for his shocking insecurity and fear of change.  \nBehind his back he is called horrible things like &quot;the unknown MIB \nagent&quot;.  He has refused to cut his long hair because one of the new \nladies at the emergency switchboard, Tokio an associate of Nakano \nTAkeko, likes his hair like that.\n\n\n\n"
