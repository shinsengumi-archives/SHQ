First I don&#39;t think the PMK \n&gt; &gt;Hijikata would really do/say what Saitou did in your story.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; See that&#39;s the beauty of the H/A pairing (which I wish I would \nhave \n&gt; considered sooner)---we know that Hijikata had a hidden &quot;soft \nside&quot; and \n&gt; that&#39;s the thing that would ultimately make him behave very much \nlike my \n&gt; version of Saitou did.\n\nI&#39;m not sure where you got the hidden soft side... Maybe there were \nsnippets of it in the first or second episode, but through out of \nwhat I saw (until episode 19) he really didn&#39;t strike me as that. I \nwonder where I missed it though... Hmmm.... :O(\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Second \n&gt; &gt;because if you used Hijikata, we will not hear of Ayunee&#39;s mother \n&gt; &gt;which I think was a good inclusion. &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Considering Saitou&#39;s abilities in the 6th sense area and knowing \nhow \n&gt; mothers are it seemed natural\n\nHai hai!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Third because wasn&#39;t Hijikata in \n&gt; &gt;real life a playboy?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Once again that&#39;s why it would be so cool to use Hijikata. No one \nwould \n&gt; expect it and yet after seeing the whole series it now makes \nperfect \n&gt; sense. with the same or similar  plot\n\nI see... Maybe that is why we share very different views at the \nmoment. I have not finished PMK yet... Won&#39;t know until March 7... \nArgh!!! I hate SBC.. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fourth (and this might not be important), I LOVE \n&gt; &gt;ALL INCARNATIONS OF SAITOU-SAMA.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; As we all do!!! I have a serious thing going for the live action \n&gt; versions lately. *grin*\n&gt; \n - OH... I understand what you mean completely... I&#39;ve only seen one \nepisode of the NHK and hahahaha... I think I&#39;m developing a fondness \nfor him there... Thanks by the way about (you know what)... :O)\n\n\n"
