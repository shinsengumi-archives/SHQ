You can get a critique of your work and support a good cause by \nchecking out the &quot;Fire Fund&quot; auction currently being held on eBay to \nhelp romance and young adult author Marianne Mancusi whose home was \ndestroyed by fire while she was out of town at a conference last month.\n\nThere are top agents and editors donating critiques and while those bids \nare getting &quot;way up there&quot; you can get in a bid with other \nmultipublished, award winning authors (myself included) for bids \nstarting at $1.\n\nSurely one of you has $1 to spare to salvage my pride (I have no bids \nyet) and more importantly to help a worthy cause. The link to the \nvarious auctions is below.\n\n\nhttp://search.ebay.com/_W0QQfsooZ2QQfsopZ3QQsassZmariannefirefund.\n\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\nThe Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\n"
