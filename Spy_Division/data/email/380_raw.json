I also own all \n  &gt; episodes/DVDs of each series and or movie. I am also interested in \n  &gt; learning the history behind all the character whether they are in \n  &gt; anime or not. For example, I am interested in learning more about \n  &gt; Kawakami Gensai, the person for whom Kenshin Himura of Rurouni \n  &gt; Kenshin was based upon.\n\n\n  Hey hey! Just wanted to say hi to you! It&#39;s a little quiet right now \n  but trust me it&#39;s only for now.
