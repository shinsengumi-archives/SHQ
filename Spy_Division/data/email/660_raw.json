I=\r\n own the title.\n\nAs usual, I leave the link to the story on ff.net for pote=\r\nntial \nreviewers and for those who don&#39;t like to read from their mails: \nht=\r\ntp://www.fanfiction.net/s/2350302/1/\n\nHAIKU: SUMMER\n\n\nThey were outside the=\r\n great gate of Kyoto, and all the crowd was \ngone. Before them lay broad gr=\r\neen fields, and a rough sandy road \nstretching brown-gold into the distance=\r\n with a wood beyond. The \nvoices from the city died away. Somewhere a lark =\r\nsung in the summer \nsky; a blue sky, patched here and there with puffy fair=\r\n-weather \nclouds, the sun high amongst them now. They turned up the sandy r=\r\noad \nand went on without breaking step, at a steady walk. \n\nHeisuke eyed th=\r\ne flower in Tetsu&#39;s sash. &quot;Oooh!&quot; he said in a mocking \nfalsetto. &quot;A flower=\r\n for the puppy, is it?&quot;\n\nTetsu said irritably. &quot;Leave off.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not as pretty=\r\n as Saya, the one who gave it to you.&quot; Heisuke leaned \ncloser, his face inc=\r\nhes from the boy. \n\n&quot;As who?&quot;\n\n&quot;Saya-chan. Don&#39;t you think she&#39;s pretty, th=\r\nen?&quot; The lopsided grin \ngrew wider.\n\n&quot;I suppose so, yes,&quot; Tetsu flushed. &quot;I=\r\n never thought about it.&quot;\n\nHeisuke laughed, &quot;One good thing about you, you&#39;=\r\nre uncomplicated.&quot;\n\nBut Tettsu&#39;s mind had jumped backward to the tableau he=\r\n had \nunwittingly interrupted last night. He wound a loose string \nthoughtf=\r\nully round one finger as he walked. &quot;I wonder what Okita-san \nis doing now,=\r\n back there.&quot;\n\nHeisuke snorted. &quot;The usual, of course. The Demon is probabl=\r\ny moping \naround in his room and Okita is most likely with him since he is =\r\nnot \npatrolling today.&quot; His next remark startled Tetsu. &quot;Too bad the Demon =\r\n\ndidn&#39;t take a shine to Itou-san.&quot;\n\nTetsu stopped abruptly and frowned, con=\r\nfused. &quot;Well, Itou-san, of \ncourse! But Hijikata-san? I thought he was =96 =\r\nwell, you know. I \nthought =96 &quot;\n\n&quot;You thought the Old Demon was gay?&quot; Heis=\r\nuke roared, and half a dozen \nlarks rocketed into the air. He put a long ar=\r\nm around Tetsu&#39;s \nshoulders, obviously tickled by the notion. &quot;Oh, my. No-o=\r\n-o. Not by a \nwondrous long shot. Hijikata-Toshizou,&quot; he informed him as th=\r\ney \nstrolled along, &quot;is in love with Nature and women are nature at its \nfi=\r\nnest for the Old Demon! Couldn&#39;t say no if a woman came to him, and \ncome t=\r\nhey surely did.&quot;\n\n&quot;But=85 &quot; Tetsu said, more confused now. &quot;But I saw them =\r\nyesterday, and \nhe was undoing Okita-san&#39;s sash=85&quot;\n\n&quot;Note, if you will,&quot; H=\r\neisuke said, face grave, eyes alight, &quot;the awe-\ninspiring lack of shock wit=\r\nh which I greet your announcement.&quot;\n\nTetsu growled at the man he was very n=\r\nearly content to call his \nfriend. &quot;Eat shit,&quot; he said through gritted teet=\r\nh, &quot;and die.&quot;\n\n&quot;Your master has had a lamentable influence on your vocabula=\r\nry,&quot; \nHeisuke said with starchy disapproval.\n\nThey sat for a time listening=\r\n to the sounds of the woods and staring \nat the western sky, blazing now wi=\r\nth the colours of sundown. Heisuke \nseemed to be working something out, so =\r\nTetsu just waited until he \nspoke again.\n\nHeisuke was concerned about how t=\r\nhe Shinsengumi would fare after the \nupheaval; he did not want to see anyon=\r\ne hurt. Okita&#39;s all guts and \nbrains on the outside, but there is broked gl=\r\nass inside that child. \nIf he had to choose, the Old Demon is going to choo=\r\nse to follow \nthrough with his plans and draconian laws, and he would hate =\r\nto think \nhow Souji would take that.\n\nI, for one, am not going to make the =\r\nsame mistake Sannan made all \nthose years ago.\n\n\n=85 =85\n\n\nThe object of th=\r\nis conversation was unaware of the extent to which \nthe exalted state of hi=\r\ns soul was drawing notice. Toshi was sweating \nbuckets with Saizou curled u=\r\np on his lap, radiating heat like a \nsecond sun in the late afternoon. If, =\r\ninstead of assuming that he was \nmeditating on the future of Japan or synth=\r\nesising some new forms of \ntorture for the Choshu members, anyone had asked=\r\n him directly what he \nwas thinking about, he would have said, without hesi=\r\ntation, &quot;I was \nthinking that I could really use a drink of tea.&quot;\n\nA tea an=\r\nd peaceful quiet as he worked, that would have been \nperfection. But even w=\r\nith those two elements of bliss, he knew he \nwould never be completely happ=\r\ny.\n\nStill, there was great contentment in the simplest moments. Like now: \n=\r\nsitting in his room in the Mibu Temple, where he could relax in the \naftern=\r\noon while the others slept, without so many interruptions. All \nthe screen =\r\ndoors were set open, which gave a pleasant sense of summer \nfreedom.\n\nLulle=\r\nd by the afternoon heat, the stilly hum and the warm breeze, \nSouji would r=\r\nelax and Toshi would feel his breathing slow and his \nsweet weight settling=\r\n against him. Sometimes he would simply sit and \nwatch him sleep, enjoying =\r\nthe rare silence. Toshi pushed the hair off \nhis forehead one-handedly and =\r\nlooked down at Souji, shifting slightly \nto ease the numbness in his right =\r\narm. \n\nAnd he wondered, as he recently did with startling frequency, if \nSo=\r\nuji still missed his sister. Such topics were usually off-limits \nand deftl=\r\ny turned aside when brought up. Mitsu was the ideal wife: \ndignified, devot=\r\ned, subtle, confident =96 in other words, a woman of \ntrue samurai descent.=\r\n He loved her low husky voice; similar to \nSouji&#39;s, now that he thought of =\r\nit, but unusual among grown men.\n\nMore than anything, he wished to know if =\r\nSouji blamed him for the \nabject misery they had known since the move to Ky=\r\noto =96 endless \npatrols and raids that more often than not ended with bloo=\r\ndshed.\n\n&quot;Grief =96 where should it end?&quot; Toshi muttered, his mind strugglin=\r\ng \nsluggishly with the vague introit. He glared at the Book in the far \ncor=\r\nner of the room; he would rather be spanked a hundred times than \nrisk waki=\r\nng Souji just to get to it. He tried again, his voice barely \na whisper:\n\n&quot;=\r\nGrief =96 where should it end?\n Where the leaves go in Autumn.&quot;\n\nHe stopped=\r\n, surprised at how fast he had managed to come up with two \nlines of a haik=\r\nu. It usually took him a full afternoon to complete \njust one. Heartened, h=\r\ne started again.\n\n&quot;Grief =96 where should it end?\n Where the leaves go in A=\r\nutumn.&quot;\n\nAnd how should he proceed from there? He frowned.\n\n&quot;Where the leav=\r\nes go in Autumn.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where=85&quot; \n\nAnd then Toshi realised the warm weight on =\r\nhis arm was gone and that \nthe distracting prickling sensation heralding th=\r\ne return of normal \nblood circulation was starting. Souji, roused from his =\r\nlight nap, \nyawned and craned his neck to look at Toshi. &quot;That&#39;s very poeti=\r\nc, \nHijikata-san. Of course the trouble with leaves is, they grow again.&quot;\n\n=\r\nToshi grunted, choosing to remain otherwise silent. \n\n&quot;Why, the great Vice-=\r\nCommander of the Shinsengumi is well and truly \nstumped!&quot; he paused, a fing=\r\ner tapping insistently on the chin. &quot;How \nabout this, Hijikata-san: Plum bl=\r\nossoms in spring. ?&quot;\n\nToshi started. What exactly is he getting at? His fac=\r\ne, however, \nremained an unassailable mask of calm and logic as he puffed o=\r\nn his \npipe. &quot;You insufferable brat. That has no logical link to the \nprevi=\r\nous lines.&quot;\n\nSouji gazed wistfully at the courtyard. &quot;There is a link, alri=\r\nght.&quot; \nHe looked at Toshi and seemed suddenly to relax; he grinned. &quot;There =\r\n\nare references to plants and seasons in the second line, aren&#39;t \nthere?&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;That&#39;s it. I&#39;m quitting. I&#39;ve had enough,&quot; Toshi declared. &quot;It&#39;s too \nhot,=\r\n and this has become entirely too silly.&quot;\n\n&quot;At least it isn&#39;t bratty,&quot; his =\r\nfriend pointed out, laughing.\n\nThe screen door leading to the corridor slid=\r\n open and Tetsu entered \nsurreptitiously with the made tea. &quot;Anou, Okita-sa=\r\nn, who were you \nreferring to?&quot;\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Toshi said, reading from an i=\r\nnvisible scroll and \ndeliberately talking over Souji&#39;s head. &quot;Brats. It say=\r\ns, Okita Souji \nand Ichimura Tetsunosuke. It also says here, insufferable.&quot;=\r\n\n\nIgnoring Toshi, Souji winked at Tetsu and assured him with perfect \naplom=\r\nb, &quot;It&#39;s a form of endearment.&quot;\n\n\n=85 =85 The End =85 =85\n\n\nI admit this is=\r\n rather rushed too, but I tried my best given the \nvarious constraints, so =\r\ngimme some feedback, yes? That would be \nwonderful and nice and beautiful. =\r\nAnd heavenly. \n\nYou know what I mean.\n\nReview! Grovels on the floor.\n\nAnywa=\r\ny, this is not finished. I mean, don&#39;t you people want to know \nwhat Tetsu =\r\nsaw? Snickers. You decide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
