Many of the members have acheived\n&gt;           legendary status for their skill, honor and devotion.

The main pairing is between\n&gt;           the young first captain, Okita Souji, and his vice-commander,\n&gt;           Hijikata Toshi, but practically all of the well-known members\n&gt;           have their own stories... and plenty of steamy love scenes\n&gt;           interspersed with the fighting and intrigue the Shinsengumi\n&gt;           were known for.\n&gt; \n&gt;           http://sanada.from-beneath-you.net/soshite/index.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
