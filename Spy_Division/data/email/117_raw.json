But this is very personal, and it doesn&#39;t happens like this to=\r\n everyone. When I am hit with a story, it just reveals itself as a whole, f=\r\nrom the beginning. When I really have an story to tell, and I sit ready to =\r\nstart it. I know exactly what will happen from beginning to end. But it&#39;s n=\r\not often the case with most writers I know.\nOnce I have the whole plotline =\r\nin my head, second step: RESEARCH. Time period, cultural tips, maps, everyt=\r\nhing.\n \n&lt;I notice the need for chapters and scenes any criteria on deciding=\r\n\nwhether a chapter is &#39;over&#39; so to speak?&gt;\n \nAs Barb pointed the chapter is=\r\n over when it&#39;s over. But it&#39;s a good help to do a list of the main events =\r\nyou want to happen in the history, checking them as you add them to each ch=\r\napter. In my case, I generally have an idea of what things will be included=\r\n in each chapter, and how many scenes, but sometimes the chapter jumps to y=\r\nour throat or blackmails you, and you cannot help but surrender to its will=\r\n, and let it write itself as it wishes.\n \n \n&lt;Do you develop one character a=\r\nt a time on paper?\n-or- do you develop the situation and try to &quot;insert&quot; th=\r\ne character?&gt;\n \nit depends. If it&#39;s manga based (it also is valid to the hi=\r\nstorical ones), well, I try to be as faithful to the original as possible, =\r\neven fanatical to detail. Now, if the character is mine, then I do a comple=\r\nte and thorough profile, including his/her bio. Then, I NEVER step out of i=\r\nt, I act as if I am working with a canon character of a manga. I don&#39;t twis=\r\nt a plot to fit the character(s), rather is the character which has to inte=\r\nract with the plot. In my writing is the way I have to control and avoid th=\r\ne OOCness or internal contradictions in my own character. To me, it makes t=\r\nhem more real, because the core of real persons doesn&#39;t really changes, it =\r\nis constant. And most importantly: look at real people. How they would reac=\r\nt in a given situation. If you have any kind of traumatic situations (abuse=\r\n, post traumatic syndrome, etc) do research too. The actual reactions are f=\r\nar from the common stereotypes. Sorry to be a bug here, but truly, I found =\r\nlots of books and novels whose main\n flaw is this.\n&lt;Anyone use &quot;diary&quot; jour=\r\nnal software of any kind.  &gt;\n \nto write the &#39;life&#39; of the character as a gu=\r\nide? No. I&#39;ve heard some people does, with the bio I mentioned at first it&#39;=\r\ns enough to me.\n \n&lt;I sometimes find\nmyself synthesizing historical+fictiona=\r\nl characters and then comparing\nthem with my own pathetic life or pondering=\r\n their ethics/morality with\ntoday&#39;s ethics/morality blah blah blah.&gt;\n \nPers=\r\nonally... Never.  I mean, you&#39;d probably would never guess how far of my ow=\r\nn beliefs this &#39;universe&#39; is. I simply cannot apply my morals, or think of =\r\nthem applied to a period (meiji/Edo, etc) universe. So, my solution has bee=\r\nn to try to do a complete abstraction of my values/morals and try to put my=\r\nself in the mindset of someone living in that society, with the given backg=\r\nround. I don&#39;t know if it makes any sense, but kind of work for me...\n&lt;Or a=\r\nnyone know how to setup something where I can\ntype in an internal dialogue =\r\nlike Q&A with a character?&gt; \n Apart from Liver Journal? Xanga is another op=\r\ntion. There are other  live-journal type of sites. I don&#39;t use them like th=\r\nis. Rather I prefer to use them for posting bits of my job-in-progress and =\r\nget some feedback.\n \n&lt; Anyone want to share how weird it is to try to think=\r\n as someone of the\nopposite gender? :)&gt;\n \nohhhhh this one is good... it is =\r\nVERY difficult, but good observation skills help. Personally men are myster=\r\nies on legs sometimes... *pets hubby*\n \nAnyway, as I said in the beginning,=\r\n take this with a grain of salt. It just works for me, but it&#39;s not a guide=\r\n for all... everyone of us finds his/her path or &#39;voice&#39;, and each one is v=\r\nalid as long as it works for the writer. I hope you can find your own &#39;voic=\r\ne&#39;, and the our comments helps.\nTake care\nFiruze\n \n----- Original Message -=\r\n---- \n  From:   Tiffany \n  To: SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com   \n  Sent: =\r\nThursday, April 22, 2004 10:30   PM\n  Subject: [SHQ_Spy_Division] Writing  =\r\n Questions\n  \n\nI have a really basic idea for one of the challenges~may   t=\r\nake months\nto write :P\n\nI have some questions:\n\nDo you guys   outline the e=\r\nntire story first?\nDo you develop one character at a time on   paper?\n-or- =\r\ndo you develop the situation and try to &quot;insert&quot; the   character?\nHave you =\r\never written a &quot;diary&quot; for your character as an aid to   writing?\nI notice =\r\nthe need for chapters and scenes any criteria on   deciding\nwhether a chapt=\r\ner is &#39;over&#39; so to speak?\n\nAnyone use &quot;diary&quot;   journal software of any kin=\r\nd.
