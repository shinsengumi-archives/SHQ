The post does not\n&gt; actually contain yaoi and is rated-G.]=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve read the early drafts of GOJOU HAJIME, a\n&gt; work=\r\n of yaoi so here is my review of the work...\n&gt;\n&gt; Whereas well known films l=\r\nike TABOO/GOHATTO move\n&gt; at a meditative pace and leaves key narrative them=\r\nes\n&gt; up to viewer interpretation GOJOU HAJIME is the exact\n&gt; opposite.  The=\r\n novel&#39;s pace is very even and balances out\n&gt; the chapters by switching bet=\r\nween the various pairings and\n&gt; leaves *nothing* to the imagination.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wh=\r\nat struck me the most about GH is the tone or voice of the\n&gt; writing is ver=\r\ny youthful and matches the age range of the\n&gt; main characters.  One will no=\r\ntice how effective this &quot;voice&quot; is\n&gt; in regards to the Hajime and Okita pai=\r\nring.  The humorous interaction\n&gt; between the more mature pairing, Hijikata=\r\n and Kondou is absolutely\n&gt; exciting and contrasts with the dominance and s=\r\nubmission psychology in\n&gt; the Toudou and Serizawa couple.\n&gt;\n&gt; The homosexua=\r\nlity in the work deviates for a refreshing mxf romance\n&gt; I&#39;ll not reveal he=\r\nre.\n&gt;\n&gt; My only complaint is I wanted more action. I hope that the female l=\r\nead\n&gt; becomes more developed in the sequel.\n&gt;\n&gt; GOJOU HAJIME is a relaxing =\r\nread where the plot is based on emotional\n&gt; and physical reaction between c=\r\nharacters.\n&gt;\n&gt; [BLURB]\n&gt; During Japan&#39;s 1800&#39;s the samurai\n&gt; became dissati=\r\nsfied with the shogun\n&gt; for opening their isolated nation to\n&gt; the Western =\r\nBarbarians. Many\n&gt; rebelled and plotted to overthrow\n&gt; the shogun and resto=\r\nre their emperor\n&gt; to a seat of power. The shogun\n&gt; arranged a band of expe=\r\nrt swordsmen\n&gt; to manage the revolution. Given the\n&gt; name, Shinsengumi (New=\r\nly Selected\n&gt; Corps), the brave men were\n&gt; commissioned to eliminate the un=\r\nruly\n&gt; samurai and ronin, sanctioned to kill.\n&gt; The men lived for the momen=\r\nt, for their\n&gt; lives could end in an instant. Under\n&gt; stressful circumstanc=\r\nes some of the\n&gt; men turned to one another for comfort,\n&gt; but how far did t=\r\nhey venture from there\n&gt; into the realm of taboo?\n&gt; A fascinating historica=\r\nl, gay, yaoi,\n&gt; erotic fiction for the adult reader 18+.\n&gt;\n&gt; BUY IT\n&gt; https=\r\n://www.createspace.com/3345828\n&gt;\n&gt; LEARN MORE\n&gt; http://www.samurai-on-samur=\r\nai.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
