I happened to think the artwork itself was wonderful, certianly anything beyond *my* skill. While I was there I checked out some of the other artwork there and each one seemed better than the last.\nA few years ago a creative writing teacher consoled me in a similiar situation with some advice;think of it as ice cream. There are hundreds of different varieties of ice cream and the only flavor that almost everyone can agree on they like in general is vanilla---and only because its pretty bland. Bland=Boring. \n\nTo the artist; I saved your site to my favorites and am really looking forward to seeing more of your work and of others posted on this list. Never be bland, dear. \n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: kikue.mugen &lt;kikue.mugen@...&gt;\nTo: SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Saturday, April 12, 2008 7:28:18 PM\nSubject: [SHQ_Spy_Division] Re: Wonderful Saito and Soji Original Art\n\n\nDear Shinsengumi fan,\nTo some of us, this disgusting is a good disgusting. Relax, no one&#39;s \nmad at you for having an opinion. But this is a forum for intelligent \ndiscussion and not the, &quot;oh ewwwww disgusting,&quot; and leave it at that. \nLeast you can do is tell us why.  Or maybe, tell us why you were \noffended.  You know, be civil about it, or els the poor artist may be \ntraumatized from this whole issue of disgust.\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;l17842&quot; &lt;l17842@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, no...
