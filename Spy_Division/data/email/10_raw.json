The \ncorners of h=\r\ner mouth tipped gently upward in a smile that on any \nother woman he would&#39;=\r\nve taken for coyness.  Reds and golds sparkled \nin her brown hair as dapple=\r\nd sunlight penetrated beyond the treetop \ncanopy.\n\nWhen he was close enough=\r\n to touch her, she lifted her face and looked \ndirectly into his eyes.  Her=\r\n voice was soft and inviting.  &quot;My lord=85 &quot;\n\n&quot;Shirou,&quot; he corrected her, g=\r\niving her the gift of his name as he \ncrouched down before her.\n\nShe smiled=\r\n at the touch of his fingertips on her lips.  &quot;Naname.&quot;\n\n***\n\nHad he been a=\r\nny other man, Saitou would&#39;ve whistled.  As he was not \nany other man, Sait=\r\nou walked the wide street towards home in complete \nsilence and bland decor=\r\num.  Commissioner Kawaji wasn&#39;t the only one \nwho never knew what was going=\r\n on inside the Wolf&#39;s head.  Saitou \nintended to keep it that way.\n\nHis wor=\r\nkday was officially over.  It wasn&#39;t as though government \nlackeys and unde=\r\nrworld thugs weren&#39;t plotting away for their own \nselfish gain on any given=\r\n street in any town in Japan, but right now \nhe couldn&#39;t be bothered too mu=\r\nch about it.  They&#39;d still be there \nwhen he was ready to stop living the d=\r\nream life of an ordinary police \ninspector.\n\nTwo months strapped to a Tokyo=\r\n desk=85 he couldn&#39;t have been happier.\n\nNot as happy, however, as about wh=\r\nat he knew awaited him at the end \nof this journey.  Something new=85 somet=\r\nhing fresh and alive and as \nvibrant as the flowers spilling over planters =\r\nand hedge rows in the \nwelcoming warmth of late spring.  Something that mad=\r\ne Saitou feel \nreborn and young again.  Something unexpected in the form of=\r\n a young \nman by the name of Sagara Sanosuke.\n\nThe thought was more appetiz=\r\ning than anticipating his next bowl of \nplain, hot soba.\n\nSaitou let a part=\r\n of his mind wander=85 a phenomenon rarely indulged.  \nHe could picture San=\r\nosuke waiting for him, checking and rechecking \nthe clock every five minute=\r\ns as he listened for the familiar steps up \nthe short walkway to the front =\r\nof the house.  The impact of the \nstrong body as he welcomed Saitou home --=\r\n- his way of congratulating \nthe cop for making it through to the end of an=\r\nother day still alive --\n- quickly becoming a routine neither would ever ti=\r\nre of; a perfect \ntouch to define the end of one part of the day and herald=\r\n the start \nof another.\n\nIt would wake Saitou up and rekindle the fire in d=\r\nulled senses, \npreparing him for the night to come.\n\nAs he stepped off the =\r\nstreet and onto the walk, Saitou mentally \nbraced himself to withstand the =\r\nstrength behind Sanosuke&#39;s exuberant \ngreeting and unconsciously cursed the=\r\n politicians and yakuza who \ninsisted on always untying the leash that kept=\r\n him behind a desk.\n\n***\nPOST SCRIPTS:\nYasou =3D wildflowers\n\nKoshima Shiro=\r\nu was the real name of Sagara Souzou.  Naname was Sano&#39;s \nmother&#39;s name in =\r\nthe manga.  You have to know where this is leading.  \nAnd the fact I can&#39;t =\r\nleave Sagara alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
