So there.\n\nRokugatsu no Yume\nDream of the Sixth Moo=\r\nn\nPrologue: A Moment of Peace\nBy Shimazu Masayoshi\n\t\n\tShimabara District, K=\r\nyoto\n\t1st Year of Genji, 6th month, 1st day (July 1, 1864)\n\n11 PM\n\nHijikata=\r\n Toshizou was late. For once, outside of his daily routine of\nbeing a &quot;demo=\r\nn&quot;, he was actually concerned with the opinion of someone\naside from himsel=\r\nf. Finally coming to his objective, he paused for\nbreath, taking little tim=\r\ne to read the writing on the paper lantern\noutside, which he&#39;d memorized lo=\r\nng ago: Sakurada-ya\n\n\t&quot;Irasshaimase! Welcome, Hijikata-dono! Asako is waiti=\r\nng for you\nupstairs.&quot;\n\n\tHijikata slipped out of his sandals and went up the=\r\n stairs, without\neven glancing at the young maid, who stared after him with=\r\n a combined\nsense of fear and wistful romantic longing. She&#39;d wanted him to=\r\n linger\naround a bit longer, but the vice-commander of the Shinsengumi was\n=\r\nalready up the stairs and with his hand on the door. Sliding it open,\nhe bo=\r\nwed curtly.\n\t\n\t&quot;Omadaseshimashita. Sorry to keep you waiting, Asako-chan.&quot;\n=\r\n\n\t&quot;Hijikata-sama=85I was so worried!&quot;\n\t\n\t&quot;It&#39;s alright=85&quot; Shutting the doo=\r\nr, he sat down in front of the\ncourtesan, who carefully poured sake for the=\r\n two of them into small\nsaucers.\n\n\t&quot;You&#39;ve been working hard, I&#39;m sure, Hij=\r\nikata-sama. Please feel free\nto relax tonight.&quot;\n\n\tGratefully accepting the =\r\nsake, he sipped it slowly. &quot;Things have been\ngetting quiet recently. Too qu=\r\niet=85&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Maybe you should enjoy the quiet while you can? Peace, like the\n=\r\nbeautiful cherry blossoms, does not linger for long.&quot;\n\n\tHe set his drink do=\r\nwn, and edged closer.\n\n\t&quot;Yeah? And will you help me with that?&quot;\n\n\tA passion=\r\nate smile passed over her face as she felt her legs go numb\nfrom the erotic=\r\n thrill that swept through her body.\n\n\t&quot;And how would a simple courtesan li=\r\nke me help you, the great and\nmarvelous vice-commander of the Shinsengumi?&quot;=\r\n\n\n\tFor a moment, there was humanity in the demon&#39;s eyes. He brought\nAsako&#39;s=\r\n hand to his face, and touched her face with his own. Asako\nwasn&#39;t sure, bu=\r\nt she thought that she saw tears form in his eyes for\nthe briefest of insta=\r\nnts.\n\n\t&quot;By helping me enjoy a moment of peace=85&quot;\n\n\tShe undid the simple kn=\r\not at the front of her kimono, letting the\nsilk fabric fall away, leaving t=\r\nhe pale richness of her bare skin and\nfull curves of her body exposed to th=\r\ne dim candlelight. The demon\nwasted no time in taking her into his arms. An=\r\nd for a moment, there\nwas peace in that small room in Shimabara=85\n\n-------=\r\n----\n\n\tJuly 2nd\n\n\t2 AM\n\n\tAs Hijikata and Asako still pursued their moment o=\r\nf peace, Saitou\nHajime, captain of the Shinsengumi 3rd squad, awoke in a ge=\r\nisha house\nin Gion, after a long night of lovemaking. Feeling the touch of =\r\nhis\nlover&#39;s deft, slender hands, he momentarily gasped before regaining\nsel=\r\nf-control.\n\n\t&quot;Mmm=85Hajime-sama=85your fundoshi was sooo starched=85&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Go=\r\nod thing it&#39;s out of the way now, eh, Chise-chan?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Oh yes=85&quot;\n\n\tSaitou c=\r\nlosed his eyes and breathed deeply of Chise&#39;s perfume. She\ntook such incred=\r\nible care to be the best for him, and he wanted to\nshow her every bit of hi=\r\ns gratitude.\n\n\t&quot;I meant to ask, Chise-chan, how&#39;s your novel about the 47 l=\r\noyal\nretainers coming?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Very well=85I just had my heroine inadvertently =\r\nbump into Horibe\nYasubee-sama&#39;s hidden stash of illicit woodblock prints=85=\r\n&quot;\n\n\tHe laughed. True to their reputation, geisha were quite engaging and\nen=\r\ntertaining in everything=85\n\n\t&quot;Sounds like a rather embarrassing moment for=\r\n Horibe-dono.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Indeed=85he was most definitely not pleased. Although, ev=\r\nen though he\ndidn&#39;t say it, he was rather amused by the whole incident.&quot;\n\n\t=\r\n&quot;I see=85well, shall we, in turn, amuse ourselves again?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;So impatient, =\r\nHajime-sama=85&quot; she said playfully. &quot;Yes, let&#39;s get back\nto amusing ourselv=\r\nes=85&quot; And then, like Hijikata, Saitou Hajime also\nknew peace=85\n\n---------=\r\n--------\n\n\n\n"
