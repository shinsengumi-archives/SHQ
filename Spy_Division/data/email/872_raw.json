Tension gripped Okita\nSoujiro&#39;s shoulders and neck. As the=\r\n captain of the first unit walked\ndown the hallway of headquarters he nearl=\r\ny knocked over one of the\nofficers too slow to get out of his way as he wal=\r\nked into the gym.\nHarada was kicking the boxing bag, so he went to the shoo=\r\nting range\ninstead.\n\nHe took off the ear muffs to hear the shots and hoped =\r\nthat with each\nbullet he could erase Hijikata&#39;s words from his mind.\n\n~~~~~=\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n&quot;What the fuck are you doing reading this trash?&quot; I=\r\nsamu threw the\nprint outs in Okita&#39;s face, &quot;Where did you print them? At a =\r\ncaf=E9?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m studying the enemy,&quot; the younger man was emotionless as he s=\r\ntared\nat Hijikata, &quot;and to answer your question, yes the Himeya coffee hous=\r\ne.&quot;\n\n&quot;They&#39;ll have to be inspected tomorrow, or perhaps closed down then.\nT=\r\nhese businesses with internet access know the rules about\ndisseminating inc=\r\norrect information under the Homeland Security Act,&quot;\nIsamu folded his arms,=\r\n &quot;That bastard Mitsujima is in a refrigerator at\nthe basement of the Kyoto =\r\nsecurity department now where he can&#39;t spout\nanymore poison to confuse the =\r\npeople.&quot;\n\nOkita collected the papers, &quot;Do you really disagree with him? Dee=\r\np\ndown you agree and many warriors believe his words. They&#39;re coming and\nwe=\r\n can&#39;t stop them=85&quot;\n\nThe Lieutenant Colonel shoved his subordinate back, &quot;=\r\nDon&#39;t compare me\nto that Mitsujima! I disagree with any motherfucker who th=\r\ninks they\ncan touch Kyoto when I&#39;m _on_duty_.&quot; \n\n&lt;i&gt;&quot;We will become impoten=\r\nt, obsolete Hijikata.&quot;&lt;i&gt; Okita swallowed\nand looked at the floor as his mi=\r\nnd briefly acknowledged that leader\nof the Shinsengumi has not touched him =\r\nfor some time.\n\n&quot;_On_duty_? Or when you are in full control of the city?&quot;\n\n=\r\nIsamu&#39;s dark eyes locked onto Soujiro&#39;s as his voice became icy, &quot;We\nknow o=\r\nur place under A-han&#39;s mandate. Don&#39;t speak those words in\npublic Okita.&quot;\n\n=\r\nOkita closed his eyes briefly if only to appreciate the delicate scent\nof s=\r\nandalwood which Hijikata used to perfume his clothes. For such a\nfierce man=\r\n, Isamu paid close attention to his appearance and was most\ncareful with hi=\r\ns manners in front of representatives from A-han. Okita\nwas one of the few =\r\nwho knew what the Demon was really capable of when\nat the height of his ang=\r\ner, but he was the only man who could satisfy\nIsamu&#39;s lust as well.\n\n&quot;What =\r\nis Nippon&#39;s future?&quot; Okita looked out the window at the Aizu\nPhoenix Unit h=\r\nelicopters moving slowly over the city in the darkness\nlike large silent pr=\r\nedatory birds, &quot;Mitsujima is not the only one who\nwill weaken our country f=\r\nrom within. He has followers.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who will be dealt,&quot; Hijikata stood behind =\r\nSoujiro, but refrained from\nputting his chin on the young man&#39;s shoulder. I=\r\nsamu shoved his hands\ninto his slacks, in a desperate attempt from running =\r\nthem across\nOkita&#39;s tone chest and torso.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHe =\r\ntried to bring his focus back to emptying the standard issue\nhandgun into t=\r\nhe target. Soujiro squeezed his eyes shut and heard the\nwhish of a new shee=\r\nt being replaced over the target and pulled the\ntrigger. He ground his teet=\r\nh, &quot;We don&#39;t have a response to the\nAmerican States. We can&#39;t do anything=\r\n=85&quot;\n\nAnother hand pushed down the gun. Okita opened his eyes, &quot;Saitou?&quot;\nTh=\r\ne captain of the third unit was unshaven and tired from spending the\nentire=\r\n night interviewing the witnesses and survivors of the incident.\n\n&quot;Soujiro,=\r\n if you want to kill a member of the Shinsengumi, always aim\nfor the head. =\r\nThe body armor developed for us by the Temple of Light,\nHoko-in, would prot=\r\nect our vital organs.&quot; Saitou cocked his head at\nthe target.\n\nOkita put dow=\r\nn his weapon and looked up, &quot;That son of a bitch Harada\nmust have replaced =\r\nsome of the targets.&quot;\n\nBoth captains stared at the life size, color image o=\r\nf their leader,\ndressed in traditional attire peppered with bullet holes. I=\r\nn a way,\nthe paper representation was a shadow of the humble man a few of t=\r\nhem\nknew back at the Tama Regional Martial Arts Training Center.\n\nThe secur=\r\nity camera recorded the image of one tall tan skinned man\nwith long hair he=\r\nld back in a pony tail and a slightly shorter man who\ncould pass as one of =\r\nthe fashion models plastered on billboards around\nthe city, if only he smil=\r\ned more. The small device was a state of the\nart closed circuit recorder wh=\r\nich stored images and sound in the\nmiburo&#39;s headquarters.\n\nUnbeknownst to t=\r\nhe wolves these cameras also relayed valuable insight\nto the offices of A-h=\r\nan.\n\nThe Shinsengumi, who made it their duty to watch over the city were\nth=\r\nemselves being watched very closely.\n\n\n"
