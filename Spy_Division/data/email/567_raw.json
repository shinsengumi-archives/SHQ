Randomness. Hope you all enjoy.\n\n--M.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nM�s guide to the Shinsengumi\n\n(Author�s note: Written on a stomach full of Chinese Food, altogether too \nmuch caffeine, and horrible pre-going to Japan jitters)\n\n(Author&#39;s 2nd note: Inspired by Waiting for Godot, appropriately read at 2 \nAM)\n\n(Star Wars Opening Theme (as played by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra) plays as \na palanquin passes through a snowy street)\n\nM: 1860. Yes, just another date in history. Today is the day that tairo Ii \nNaosuke heads to Edo Castle for another rousing session of rooting out the \nextremists infecting our government today. In just a few minutes� time�\n\n(shrouded figures run past)\n\nShrouded figures: SONNO JOI!!\n\nM: Right! (pulls down backdrop to reveal a chalkboard). Some would say that \nthis has nothing to do with the Shinsengumi. Or does it? Do manju�those oh \nso delectable pounded rice cakes�have anything to do with it? Or how big one \ncan open their mouth?\n\n(thinks)\n\nM: MITOCHONDRIA!!\n\n(enter Sec)\n\nSec: M, where�s that timeline?\n\nM: Working on it!! (Hides compromising photos of Aizu Women�s Brigade)\n\nSec: �The Effect of Hotter-than-Wasabi Bikini-clad Naginata Masters on \nJapan�s Bakumatsu Period.� HAHAHAHAAAA�.some research, eh?\n\nM: Not much better than your �Fundoshi: A History��\n\nSec: Oww�.well met�\n\nM: But we�re here to explain the Shinsengumi.\n\nSec: And what manju has to do with all of it.\n\nM: But manju does have to do with it! And big mouths, too!\n\nSec: Nowadays even die-cast cars have to do with it.\n\nM: But I�ll �newly select� Teruhime any day�*sparkle sparkle*\n\nSec: (pulls out paper fan and whacks M) The Shinsengumi!!\n\nM: RIGHT! The Shinsengumi!\n\nSec: But the manju!\n\nM: What about the manju?\n\nSec: That�s your line!\n\nM: My line?\n\n(enter Barb)\n\nBarb: I just got some manju on Ebay!! Oh wait�it�s a manju-patterned haori.\n\nM: Not bad, not bad�\n\nSec: But the fundoshiiiiii�.\n\nM: Can we get back to the topic at hand?\n\nSec: Yeah, I feel like we�re waiting for Godot.\n\nM: No, we�re waiting for Kon-do.\n\nBarb: LOL\n\nM: (Writes �Shinsengumi to ha nani ka?� on the board) So, back to our topic. \nWhat is the Shinsengumi?\n\nSec: (looks up from Barb�s Satou Koichi fundoshi desktop) Huh? You say \nsomething?\n\nM: But the manju!!\n\nBarb: Oh�hey, look at what I got today! (tosses M a big Tennen Rishin Ryu \nbokken. M falls over)\n\nSec: You okay?\n\nM: M�.manju�Ooh�I like it. Just the right weight for bashing in slow \ncomputers.\n\n(Enter MissB)\n\nMissB: Why are you guys going on about the size of Kondou�s mouth and \nth�oooooo fundoshi�..\n\nM: Manju, anyone?\n\nSec: I don�t see any.\n\n(Manju rain down from the ceiling)\n\nBarb: Isn�t that supposed to be manna?\n\nMissB: But we�re in Japan, after all.\n\n(enter Phil in Sekihoutai uniform)\n\nPhil: (catches manju in midair) Ooh, manju.\n\n(M gets up) M: But the Shinsengumi!\n\nEveryone else: KOICHI SATO!!! (all run offstage)\n\nM: ����.\n\n(Fundoshi start flying wildly from offstage)\n\nM: And now for something completely different.\n\nOWARI!! (The end)\n\n\n\n"
