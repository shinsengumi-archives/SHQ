She was the one who started me thinking (a=\r\nnd remembering Barb telling me about how fun a round robin could be with th=\r\ne writers & Shinsengumi nuts (my description, not hers=85 don=92t go after =\r\nher with katana in gatotsu stance) we have here) by imagining directing Hij=\r\nikata in a commercial to advertise a bath sponge over on the message board.=\r\n\n\n \n\nSo, chime in.  What do you guys think about starting a round robin her=\r\ne?  I=92m willing to keep tabs on the organization, but what do YOU want to=\r\n do?  We need ideas about scenarios=85 some rules, like how long a person h=\r\nas to get their section posted and what happens if they can=92t get it done=\r\n=85 anything else that comes to mind.  It=92s been a while for me, but thos=\r\ne I participated in were private and very small=85 really more like RPG tha=\r\nn a true round robin, so I=92m counting on veterans to make suggestions bas=\r\ned on their experience.  If we come up with a list of scenarios, I can crea=\r\nte a poll for us to make a final choice (and anything else that needs decid=\r\ning).\n\n \n\nAnd, please, don=92t anyone be shy!!!
