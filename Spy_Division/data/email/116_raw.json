You can analyze and chart and plan and do \nnotes and fill journals of the intimate lives of your characters but \nwhen all is said and done it all comes down to you thinking What if \n_____ ???  and taking off from there, chronicling what you think your \ncharacters would feel and do in any given situation or presented with \nany certain set of circumstances or problems.\n\nAdmittedly some writers are &quot;Plotters&quot; who plan all the events and \nscenes out in detail long before writing them *points to Miss B * While \nothers find that very notion enough to make them gag if not faint dead \naway. They (like) me tend to be &quot;Pantsers&quot; or those who start with a \nkernel, a character, a line of dialogue or some such little thing and \nfly off into the great creative mist by the &quot;seat of their pants&quot; and \nand find out what happens next along with the characters.\n\n&lt;&lt;I notice the need for chapters and scenes any criteria on deciding \nwhether a chapter is &#39;over&#39; so to speak?&gt;\n\nChapters are over when they&#39;re over. That&#39;s  not  too specific, I know, \nbut each chapter tends to have a scene or two or more perhaps in which  \na roadblock is thrown into your characters&#39; paths or one part of a \npuzzle is solved while a new problem might arise or yet another \ncomplication is thrown at them.\n\nBasically something has to happen to further their adventure or hinder \nit and the best way to close out a chapter is to leave a type of \ncliffhanger so your reader can&#39;t wait to come back to see what happens next.\n\nI don&#39;t know if any of this has helped. I hope it has.\n\n----\nBarbara Sheridan\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n"
