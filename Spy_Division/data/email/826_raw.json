Yes it will \nalso depict =\r\nthe Fujita family and explain some stuff.\n\nThe story is mainly about the Me=\r\niji Era however there will be scene \nwhich take place during the Bakumatsu.=\r\n\n\nThe rating for this story is NC-17 due to the portrayals of various \nform=\r\ns of sexuality. Please, only people over 17-18 should read it.  \nI don&#39;t wa=\r\nnt to traumatize the youngins.  I am building a website \nfor this story and=\r\n for the general public to acquire the story \nthey&#39;d have to paypal some am=\r\nount of money (which basically means if \nthey are old enough to have a cred=\r\nit card or checking account---they \ncan read my story).  It was not profess=\r\nionally edited, and ofcourse \nI&#39;m not a professional writer.  It will not b=\r\ne published or anything \nso you will notice that each chapter has a differe=\r\nnt theme and \nnearly a different tone to it.  That&#39;s because this novel is =\r\nsort of \nan experiment.\n\nI&#39;m a nerd.\n\nSo there will be footnotes in the sto=\r\nry (^_^)\n\nIt is OVER 70,000 words long.\n\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJaru=\r\nn/ONOSUZUE.pdf\n\nif the story was even mildly entertaining to you, please co=\r\nnsider \nsending me money (^_^) \n\nmembers of SHQ have generously donated mon=\r\ney for the upgrade of the \nwebsite, which is now in its final phase (basica=\r\nlly 2 weeks to go) \nand aside from teh initial donations, I&#39;ve been paying =\r\nfor stuff out \nof my own pocket.  I know the website hasn&#39;t &quot;changed&quot; or be=\r\nen \nupdated in months, but that is because updates would drive the \nprogram=\r\nmer insane due to the database format we are implementing. \nOnce everything=\r\n is done then updates will resume immediately.\n\nYou can paypal the email co=\r\nntained in the story ($1, $1.50---I don&#39;t \ncare)\n\nOR\n\nYou can paypal shinse=\r\nngumihq(a)yahoo.com and help support the site&#39;s \nserver\n\nit&#39;s totally volun=\r\ntary because ofcourse I just gave the link to the \nstory above (^_^)\n\nif yo=\r\nu have comments, please email the author (email is in the \nheader of every =\r\npage)\n\n\n"
