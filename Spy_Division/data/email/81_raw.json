It&#39;s just that history starts=\r\n to change here.\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based =\r\non anything.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the =\r\nentire\nShinsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly=\r\n.\nThank you.\n\nChapter 13\n\nFor a long time there was nothing but silence and=\r\n death hanging in the\nair. Many buildings were destroyed, and many more wer=\r\ne still burning.\nIn the distant foothills, the low, echoing rumble of gunfi=\r\nre meant the\nbattle was still raging, albeit in its final hours. The whistl=\r\ning\nstill raged on in Hiro&#39;s ears, until suddenly=85\n&quot;Hiro-sama!&quot;\nHis eyes =\r\nflew open, and he remembered where he was, and more\nprecisely, whom he was =\r\nlying on top of.\n&quot;Hiro-sama=85I can&#39;t breathe=85&quot;\nHiro rolled off slowly, m=\r\noving to a sitting position and helping Yuki\nto her knees. She coughed a co=\r\nuple of times, and took several deep\nbreaths, before looking him in the eye=\r\ns.\n&quot;Hiro-sama=85thank you=85&quot;\nDespite the restricted movement afforded to h=\r\ner by the armor, Yuki\nstraightened up and bowed with her forehead to the gr=\r\nound.\n&quot;Yuki=85there was nothing else to be done. I=97&quot;\nThe sound of hoofbea=\r\nts cut him off. Turning to the source of the\nsound, they both went pale wit=\r\nh shock. Lord Matsudaira Katamori, the\nofficial shogunate representative in=\r\n Kyoto, was slowly riding by,\nsurveying the damage with a mixed group of mo=\r\nunted retainers and foot\nsoldiers. Unable to control his gut instinct, Hiro=\r\n looked the lord\nstraight in the eyes, not as the defiant low-rank Shinseng=\r\numi corporal\nwhich he pretended to be, but as a member of the Tokugawa hous=\r\ne, which\nhe was. He looked at Matsudaira honestly, as a kinsman.\nThe lord n=\r\noticed, and rode closer. Yuki pulled Hiro down into the\nlowest bow possible=\r\n, noting what was happening with some degree of\nhorror. Even if Matsudaira =\r\nwas a kinsman, it was utterly inexcusable\nfor anyone of such a low rank, ev=\r\nen a pretended low rank, to stare\nsuch a high lord directly in the eyes.\nTh=\r\ney remained bowing, until the sound of hooves stopped directly in\nfront of =\r\nthem.\n&quot;You,&quot; said Matsudaira, addressing Hiro. &quot;Look at me.&quot;\nSlowly, Hiro l=\r\nooked up, straight into Matsudaira&#39;s eyes again.\n&quot;My lord.&quot;\n&quot;You&#39;re with Sh=\r\ninsengumi?&quot;\n&quot;Yes, my lord.&quot;\n&quot;Your name?&quot;\nHiro suddenly felt very weak. His =\r\nname=97that would give everything\naway, especially to Lord Matsudaira. He w=\r\nould have to reveal\nhimself=85Silently, he gritted his teeth, steeled his n=\r\nerves, and looked\nup again.\n&quot;Tokugawa. Tokugawa Hirotada, my lord.&quot;\nMatsuda=\r\nira&#39;s face went white as a sheet for a moment. Then he burst\nout laughing.\n=\r\n&quot;You can&#39;t honestly be serious. The battle must have gotten to you,\nsamurai=\r\n. I&#39;m feeling rather good today, so I&#39;ll excuse that. Now I ask\nyou again, =\r\nwhat is your name? Try to be honest with me.&quot; The foot\nsoldiers tensed at t=\r\nhis remark, their hands tight on the hilts of\ntheir swords.\nNot about to be=\r\n intimidated, Hiro brought his ancestors to mind=97on his\nfather&#39;s side, To=\r\nkugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shogun. On his\nmother&#39;s side, Honda Tadak=\r\natsu, one of Ieyasu&#39;s chief captains. The\nblood and spirit of those men and=\r\n their progeny ran in him. He knew he\nhad nothing to fear.\n&quot;Tokugawa Hirota=\r\nda, my lord.&quot;\nMatsudaira sighed.\n&quot;I need some humor today. Alright, then, s=\r\namurai, so you&#39;re Tokugawa.\nProve it.&quot;\n&quot;I am of the Mito house.&quot;\n&quot;Whose son=\r\n?&quot;\n&quot;Tokugawa Tadanobu and Honda Masako&#39;s eldest son.&quot;\nMatsudaira snickered =\r\nto himself.\n&quot;There are no such people in the Mito house. But go on.&quot;\n&quot;Our c=\r\nlan&#39;s swords bear our hollyhock crest, and are made by the\nYasutsugu. Our c=\r\nlan&#39;s official armorers are the Miochin.&quot;\n&quot;Anyone who knows their history c=\r\nould tell me that.&quot;\nHiro was desperate. He had to prove himself.\n&quot;Two of yo=\r\nur lordship&#39;s direct retainers are named Sagawa Kanbei and\nNakano Heinai. N=\r\nakano Heinai has a wife by the name of Kouko, and two\ndaughters by the name=\r\n of Takeko and Yuuko, who are reknowned for their\nskill with the naginata.&quot;=\r\n\nMatsudaira nodded to his foot soldiers, who unsheathed their swords.\n&quot;I&#39;m =\r\nsorry, samurai, but I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you go. Whatever\nspying you&#39;ve b=\r\neen doing on my clan must end now. Thank you for\namusing me, though.&quot;\nHiro =\r\nand Yuki stood up together. Gripping Yuki&#39;s hand firmly, he\nlooked Matsudai=\r\nra in the eyes again, this time with the fiercest stare\nthat he could summo=\r\nn. There was no more pretense. Hiro was bent on\nusing the position of his f=\r\namily to full advantage. The Matsudaira\nfamily of Aizu may have been relati=\r\nves of the shogun, but they were\nlower-ranking than Hiro&#39;s family, who were=\r\n one of the main branches\nfrom which the shogun was chosen.\n&quot;Many years ago=\r\n, during the Age of the Country at war, when our common\nancestor Toshogu (T=\r\nokugawa Ieyasu) was still a child, his mother,\nO-dai no Kata, was sent back=\r\n to her brother Mizuno Nobutomo&#39;s castle.\nShe was accompanied by some of th=\r\ne samurai of Matsudaira Hirotada, who\nis my namesake=97&quot;\n\t&quot;Again, anyone wh=\r\no has read history knows that, samurai. My patience\nis wearing thin--&quot;\n\t&quot;Wh=\r\nen they neared the castle, O-dai no Kata bade her husband&#39;s\nsamurai to leav=\r\ne. She said, `If you come with me, my brother will kill\nyou all. If that ha=\r\nppens, then my son will forever despise his uncle.\nAs long as my son lives,=\r\n I will never think of you Matsudaira men as\nenemies. Since both my son and=\r\n Nobutomo are related, sooner or later\nour clans will make peace. But if yo=\r\nu stay with me and get killed,\nthat will be utterly impossible.&#39; Having und=\r\nerstood what she said,\nthey let her proceed on her way alone.&quot;\n\tMatsudaira&#39;=\r\ns jaw dropped.\n\t&quot;How did you=85?&quot;\n\t&quot;As I said, my lord, I am who I am.&quot;\n\tA =\r\nlook of utter confusion passed over Matsudaira&#39;s face. Finally, he\nshook hi=\r\ns head, and barked an order to his foot soldiers.\n\t&quot;Take their weapons. I d=\r\non&#39;t want any trouble.&quot;\n\tLooking at Hiro again, he nodded with a touch of c=\r\nontempt.\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t know how you know that, but I can assure you, if you&#39;re =\r\nnot\nwho you say you are, you can consider yourself utterly, without\nquestio=\r\nn, dead. I assume this is your battlefield attendant?&quot; he said,\npointing at=\r\n Yuki.\n\t&quot;She is Matsumae Yuki, my wife and battlefield attendant.&quot;\n\t&quot;Strang=\r\ne, but very well. I&#39;ll allow her to remain with you. Now let&#39;s\nget going.&quot;\n=\r\n********\n\tHiro and Yuki were quickly brought to Nijo Castle, the shogunate&#39;=\r\ns\nheadquarters in Kyoto. After being given a bath and a change of\nclothes, =\r\nthey had been shown to the antechamber before the main\naudience hall, where=\r\n, they were told, Lord Matsudaira would see the\ntwo of them.\n\tKneeling alon=\r\ngside and slightly behind Hiro, Yuki was in awe. The\ndecorations and detail=\r\n on the sliding doors and walls were quite\nspectacular, as was the immacula=\r\nte cleanliness of the tatami mats.\nThis life, the life of the upper class, =\r\nwas how Yuki had previously\nimagined the past. And yet, having spent severa=\r\nl weeks with\nlower-ranking samurai and former peasants, she could no longer=\r\n hold on\nto that image. She looked at her fresh, light-green kimono, and\nsi=\r\nghed, thinking of Midori and the other women back at Shinsengumi\nheadquarte=\r\nrs, who wore clothing of coarse weave and went to tremendous\nlengths and sa=\r\ncrifices to support the men of the group.\n\tShe turned her eyes toward Hiro.=\r\n Dressed in a formal black kimono and\nhaori, and striped gray hakama, he lo=\r\noked resplendent and somehow\nnaturally commanding=97worthy of someone of hi=\r\ns rank and heritage. Since\nhe had yet to fully prove himself to Lord Matsud=\r\naira, the clothing\nissued to him bore no family crest.\n\t&quot;His lordship will =\r\nsee you now,&quot; said an attendant, and moved forward\nto slide open the doors.=\r\n\n\tHiro nodded curtly. As the doors opened, he and Yuki bowed all the\nway do=\r\nwn to the floor mats, and then moved forward slowly using shiko,\na delicate=\r\n process of sliding on the kneecaps. When they came before\nthe slightly rai=\r\nsed platform where Lord Matsudaira sat, they bowed again.\n\tMatsudaira gave =\r\na nod to the attendant, who left the room and slid\nthe doors shut.\n\t&quot;Good a=\r\nfternoon,&quot; said Matsudaira, with a slightly tired tone. &quot;There\nare things I=\r\n&#39;d rather be doing, believe me. But if I don&#39;t address\nthis immediately, it=\r\n&#39;s not going to go away. You&#39;ll notice that I have\nhere my official secreta=\r\nry, who will write down any responses you give\nand keep them on record. I r=\r\nemind you that should you be found to be\nlying, I will not hesitate to take=\r\n your head personally.&quot;\n\tHiro bowed again, and cleared his throat.\n\t&quot;My lor=\r\nd, before I begin, may I ask one indulgence?&quot;\n\t&quot;What is it?&quot;\n\t&quot;I ask that y=\r\nour lordship listen to every word I say, and then make\nup your mind as to w=\r\nhat to do with me and my wife.&quot;\n\tMatsudaira grunted.\n\t&quot;Very well. Now begin=\r\n.&quot;\n\t&quot;Yes, your lordship. As I said before, I am Tokugawa Hirotada, son of\nT=\r\nokugawa Tadanobu of Mito and Honda Masako, daughter of Honda Masahiro\nof Su=\r\nnpu. I am descended from Lord Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Much as it may\nsound like=\r\n madness, I come from the future.&quot;\n\tMatsudaira&#39;s face contorted, but being =\r\na man of his word, he kept silent.\n\t&quot;I do not know how I came here=97I and =\r\nmy wife were blown here by what\nI can only call a very fierce wind. But now=\r\n that I am here, I must\ntell your lordship that if you do not move quickly,=\r\n the shogunate will\nfall. The Tokugawa clan and many of its vassals will be=\r\n stripped of\npower and ruined. Lord Yoshinobu will be the last shogun, and =\r\nwill die\na heartbroken old man. Your own domain will suffer greatly=97many =\r\nwill\ndie, the castle will be demolished, and your people will be exiled to\n=\r\nthe Shimokita Peninsula in northern Honshu, where a great number of\nthem wi=\r\nll die of starvation. Also, the shogunate has enemies not only\nin Choshuu, =\r\nbut also in the Imperial Court, in the Satsuma domain, and\nin the province =\r\nof Tosa. And what&#39;s more, in my time, there are no\nmore samurai or domains.=\r\n If your lordship would give me the\nopportunity, I will tell you all that I=\r\n know, so that you may work\ntoward the good of Japan, and for the preservat=\r\nion of our clan&#39;s name\nand honor.&quot;\n\tHiro bowed to the floormats again.\n\t&quot;I =\r\nam done, my lord. You may do with me as you please.&quot;\n\tMatsudaira Katamori w=\r\nas silent for a long time. Finally, he spoke.\n\t&quot;I do not know what sort of =\r\nperson you are, nor if you are absolutely\ntelling the truth, but I will say=\r\n this=97if you are indeed an heir of\nthe Lord Yoshinobu, you certainly have=\r\n his presence.&quot; He turned, and\nnodded to his secretary, who finished his no=\r\ntes, and calmly bowed.\n\t&quot;Very well, waka-dono (young lord). The coming days=\r\n will prove if\nyour words are indeed true. For the time being, I will allow=\r\n you to\nremain in this castle, and wear the hollyhock crest on your clothin=\r\ng.\nThe next time we meet, I expect a concrete example of something that\ncan=\r\n be done to avert this catastrophe you speak of.&quot;\n\tHiro bowed.\n\t&quot;Thank you,=\r\n Lord Matsudaira. I will not disappoint you.&quot;\n\tMatsudaira nodded.\n\t&quot;Let us =\r\nhope you don&#39;t, young Lord Tokugawa.&quot;\n*********\n\n\n\n"
