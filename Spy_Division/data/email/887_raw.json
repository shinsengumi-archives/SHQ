I do\nnow realize that &quot;l17842&quot; is a Shinsengumi fan and perhaps yaoi\nmat=\r\nerial maybe offensive to this individual.  The image shared in my\npost was =\r\ncompletely rated-G.  From now on, on the subject line I will\ntype [Yaoi] so=\r\n that people who dislike this sort of material can avoid\nthe message entire=\r\nly.  So I do take responsibility for my post and\nsuggest anyone else who wi=\r\nshes to share the art/fiction/multimedia to\ncontinue to post  here without =\r\nany worries given they provide the\nappropriate warning.\n\nOfcourse, this lis=\r\nt is for -all- genres, not just yaoi.  \nAny Shinsengumi fan would know thou=\r\ngh, that yaoi has long since been\npart of the fandom for many, many years a=\r\nnd it started in Japan.  So\nif you dislike it---just avoid it.  No need to =\r\nbe mean about it.\n\nThanks,\nsecretarytocapt3 \n\n\n"
