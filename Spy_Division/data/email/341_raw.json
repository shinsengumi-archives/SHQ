(I&#39;ve been having trouble with that lately... which I much prefer over 23 copies of the same message!)\n \nFor the record, none of my stories qualify for this year&#39;s nominations... Fast Carriage was the first real story I wrote and I didn&#39;t begin posting it until January of this year (and I *think* the rules state they have to be posted before December 31, 2003).  I had already decided to start dating my stories on my site just to be able to say that no matter how much we learn differently about the history, as of such-n--such a date, I was no longer going on new information, but now maybe I have another reason (one can always dream, ne?).  And, though I don&#39;t know why anyone would want to know, but for the sake of any who haven&#39;t made the connection, phil/spiritus_saitou is the same nut as philalexandros.\n \nThank you, Kalli, for wanting to nominate it.  I feel really honored and touched by your support of the story.\n \nphil (who&#39;s always been a little &quot;touched&quot; in the head... BUT finally back to writing)\nP.S.  Thanks, Barb, for sending out the site URL!  :-D \n\nKalli &lt;kallipygia@...&gt; wrote:\nBarbara,\n\nCan I bug you again?
