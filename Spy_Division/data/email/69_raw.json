There\nisn&#39;t really anything questionable in this story, unless the t=\r\nhought\nof a married couple sitting in bed talking turns your stomach...(lol=\r\n).\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based on anything.\nY=\r\nou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entire\nShinsen=\r\ngumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nThank you.\n\n=\r\nChapter 11\n\nJuly 15th \nThe night of chaos at the Ikedaya was slowly becomin=\r\ng a distant\nmemory. Life in Kyoto moved on as usual, but things were differ=\r\nent for\nthe Shinsengumi. Gone were the days of their appellation by most as=\r\n\n&quot;wolves&quot;. Since they had saved the city from almost certain\nannihilation, =\r\nthey were still feared, but were now respected by many\nmore people than bef=\r\nore=97commoner, lord, and courtier alike. In the\nwake of their success, Lor=\r\nd Matsudaira had personally sent a monetary\nreward for the Shinsengumi&#39;s ex=\r\nceptional conduct, as had Emperor\nKomei. It seemed as though the Shinsengum=\r\ni was on the top of the\nworld, unshakeable in its sincerity to the Shogunat=\r\ne&#39;s cause and its\npursuit of public order in Kyoto.\nAway from the hustle an=\r\nd bustle of the Shinsengumi headquarters, the\nYanagi-ya was silent, adrift =\r\nin the morning calm. The sunlight,\nstronger now that the sun had risen a bi=\r\nt above the horizon, filtered\nin through the shutters, casting patterns of =\r\nlight and shadow on the\nfloor mats inside. Feeling the warmth on their face=\r\ns, Hiro and Yuki\nawoke from a deep peaceful sleep. They&#39;d had a very, very =\r\ngood night\ntogether, and the new day seemed wonderful and bright, full of n=\r\new\nmemories to be made. There were other battles to be fought, but for\nthe =\r\ntime being, they could focus on loving again.\nSlowly opening her eyes, Yuki=\r\n pressed close against Hiro&#39;s body,\nlosing herself in his scent, happily dr=\r\nowning in the ecstasy of\nfeeling his bare skin against her own. Gently, she=\r\n kissed the long,\ndark red scar on his left shoulder, and traced its path w=\r\nith her\nlittle finger.\n&quot;Good morning, Hirotada-sama,&quot; she murmured with a s=\r\nmile.\nHiro ran his fingers through her hair, which hung freely in dark,\nglo=\r\nssy waves over her shoulders and back. Yuki&#39;s hair had a tendency\nof growin=\r\ng rather fast. Hiro remembered that her hair was only\nchin-length when they=\r\n had arrived, but now, it reached down to her\nshoulders. Her bangs had also=\r\n grown longer and silkier. Hiro thought\nit was cute when she would tuck the=\r\nm behind her ears every now and then.\n&quot;Good morning, koishii. I see that th=\r\ney&#39;re right when they say that\n`kissing it will make it feel better&#39;. And y=\r\nou know, you really don&#39;t\nhave to call me `-sama&#39;.&quot;\nShe sighed deeply and p=\r\nassionately, hanging onto him as though he was\nthe only real thing in the w=\r\norld.\n&quot;I enjoy saying it,&quot; she said playfully, stroking his chin.\n&quot;To-ku-ga=\r\n-wa Hi-ro-ta-da-sa-ma. It sounds different.&quot;\nHiro rolled his eyes. Their pi=\r\nllow talk could be very amusing, indeed.\n&quot;If you want to, then I guess that=\r\n&#39;s alright.&quot;\nA comforting silence followed.\n&quot;Neh, anata,&quot; whispered Yuki. &quot;=\r\nIs Kinmon really in four days?&quot;\nHiro sighed. The Battle of Kinmon=97Choshuu=\r\n&#39;s attempted retaliation for\nthe loss at Ikedaya=97was only four days away.=\r\n He knew that at that very\nmoment, thousands of Choshuu samurai had left th=\r\neir home domain and\nwere marching across the Chugoku region, or sailing in =\r\nvessels across\nthe Inland Sea, all bearing eastward toward Kyoto. At the sa=\r\nme time,\nseveral times that number of pro-Shogunate warriors were also\nconv=\r\nerging on Kyoto, from domains as near as Kuwana and Aizu to as\ndistant a re=\r\ngion as Satsuma. In four days&#39; time, they would meet at\nKinmon, the &quot;forbid=\r\nden&quot; western gate of the Imperial palace. The\nbattle itself would only last=\r\n a matter of hours, but would cause\nuntold ruin and destruction, consuming =\r\nmuch of Kyoto in fire. The\nShogunate would win, but at that terrible price =\r\nnot only to its\nsoldiers but to the city as a whole=97and just like before =\r\nthe Battle of\nIkedaya, Hiro wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d survive. He couldn&#39;t avoid =\r\nYuki&#39;s\nquestion, though.\n&quot;Yes. Kinmon, or Hamagurigomon, or whatever, happe=\r\nns in four days.\nWhat&#39;s more, I go back to active duty tomorrow.&quot;\nYuki held=\r\n his face in her hands, and smiled as courageously as she\ncould. She had to=\r\n be strong, for his sake at least.\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be fine. You know tha=\r\nt, right, Hirotada-sama? I got\nthrough the night of the Ikedaya Incident in=\r\n one piece, didn&#39;t I?&quot;\nHiro embraced her tightly.\n&quot;Yes. And you saved me, t=\r\noo. Thank you again.&quot;\nYuki giggled.\n&quot;That was more Doctor Takani&#39;s handiwor=\r\nk than mine.&quot;\n&quot;All the same,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Thank you. And I&#39;ll say it agai=\r\nn=97anata\nga watashinotaisetsuna takaramono. You are the most precious trea=\r\nsure\nof my life.&quot;\nHiro caressed her face softly, and then brought her lips =\r\nto his. They\nkissed deeply, a kiss that tasted of the exhilaration of life =\r\nand the\nthrill of victory.\nSuddenly someone knocked on the sliding door, in=\r\nterrupting their kiss\nrather abruptly. Rolling out of bed, Hiro and Yuki qu=\r\nickly donned\ntheir yukata. As Yuki hurriedly started folding the futon, Hir=\r\no walked\nover to the door and opened it a crack.\n&quot;Harada-sama=85Midori-san=\r\n=85&quot;\nHarada smiled broadly, giving Hiro a good-natured pat on the shoulder.=\r\n\n&quot; `Morning, Lord Shogun! Hope you had a good night!&quot; He indicated a\nsmall =\r\nstack of trays in Midori&#39;s arms. &quot;Want to have breakfast together?&quot;\nHiro gl=\r\nanced over his shoulder at Yuki, who had just finished folding\nthe futon an=\r\nd putting it in a corner. Opening the door the whole way,\nhe bowed curtly.\n=\r\n&quot;We&#39;d be honored, Harada-sama.&quot;\nHarada turned to Midori, and nodded.\n&quot;Well =\r\nthen, Mi-chan.&quot;\n\tHarada greeted Yuki, who by now had also come up to the do=\r\nor.\n\t&quot;Good morning, Yuki-san! You sure look=85rested.&quot;\n\tYuki giggled happil=\r\ny.\n\t&quot;You could say that.&quot; She noticed that Midori was also there, and\nsmile=\r\nd. &quot;I see Midori-nee is here too.&quot;\n\tHiro scratched his chin in curiosity. T=\r\nhis was a phrase he hadn&#39;t\nheard before.\n\t&quot;Midori-nee?&quot;\n\t&quot;Yeah! We&#39;ve becom=\r\ne quite close in the last few weeks, Hiro-sama!\nIsn&#39;t that right, Midori-ne=\r\ne?&quot;\n\t&quot;Sure is, Yu-chan,&quot; answered Midori, as she arranged the trays and\nthe=\r\n food on them properly. Turning to Hiro, she gave a short bow.\n&quot;Hirotada-sa=\r\nma, your wife is amazing. Somehow she can relate to\nanything, understand an=\r\ny circumstance. Not only is she a great cook,\nshe&#39;s also a great naginata t=\r\neacher, as well. She&#39;s=85beyond words.&quot;\n\tHiro allowed himself a small smile=\r\n.\nIf you only knew why both of us know so much=85\nHarada elbowed Hiro with =\r\na laugh, interrupting his musings.\n&quot;Well, shall we?&quot;\n&quot;Ah=97yes, of course, =\r\nHarada-sama.&quot;\nThey all sat down, and began eating at a leisurely pace, enjo=\r\nying the\ncoolness of the room and the cheerful, bright sunlight coming in f=\r\nrom\nthe outside. Taking a sip of sake, Harada tapped Hiro on the shoulder.\n=\r\n&quot;Say, Tokugawa-kun, have you heard the rumors?&quot;\nHiro knew that he was most =\r\nprobably referring to the impending battle,\nbut feigned ignorance, hoping t=\r\no hear Harada&#39;s version of the rumor.\nAfter all, he reasoned, history is mo=\r\nre interesting when you hear a\ndifferent version of it.\n&quot;No=85I&#39;ve been out=\r\n for most of the time since Ikedaya.&quot;\nHarada started laughing so hard, he n=\r\nearly choked on his sake.\n&quot;In more ways than one=85but anyway, the rumor is=\r\n that there&#39;s going to\nbe another battle soon. Kondou-sama said something y=\r\nesterday morning\nabout getting spy reports that there are thousands of you-=\r\nknow-which\nclan warriors marching here in droves, by land and by sea. The C=\r\nhugoku\nand Inland Sea are swarming with `em.&quot;\nContinuing the act, Hiro fake=\r\nd shock=97not entirely dishonestly, though,\nas he was still worried about w=\r\nhat the outcome would mean for him\npersonally.\n&quot;Really? You don&#39;t say=85&quot;\nM=\r\nidori pouted, and leaned against Harada&#39;s shoulder.\n&quot;Mou, Sano-kun, please =\r\ntalk about pleasant things. We&#39;re all off duty\nhere=85&quot;\nHarada laughed plea=\r\nsantly.\n&quot;Mi-chan, you&#39;re so adorable when you pout. Alright, we won&#39;t talk\n=\r\nbusiness. For now, we&#39;ll just enjoy the food and the company.&quot;\nInstinctivel=\r\ny, Hiro raised his sake cup, and almost said Hear, hear in\nEnglish, which c=\r\nould&#39;ve gotten him into deep trouble.\nHarada and Midori looked at his sudde=\r\nn pause with a mix of confusion\nand amusement.\n&quot;Is the sake too strong, Tok=\r\nugawa-kun?&quot; Harada asked, breaking the\nsilence.\nYuki looked at him in thinl=\r\ny veiled shock, fully aware of what was\ngoing on in his head, and what had =\r\nnearly come out of his mouth. The\ntwo of them had received their college ed=\r\nucation abroad, in the United\nStates, and had picked up some American manne=\r\nrisms as a result.\nHowever, they were now in a situation where people of th=\r\neir station\nhad no logical business speaking English unless they were spies=\r\n for\nthe Shogunate or the rebels. All Yuki could do was watch as Hiro\nteete=\r\nred on the brink of inadvertently ruining everything.\nGathering his wits ab=\r\nout him, he laughed, and forcibly willed Japanese\nto come out of his mouth.=\r\n\n&quot;It&#39;s been awhile since I had sake=97it tastes stronger than I\nremembered.=\r\n At any rate, I&#39;ll drink to what Midori-san said,\nHarada-sama. To peace and=\r\n calm. Beautiful and priceless, yet as\nephemeral as the falling cherry blos=\r\nsoms.&quot;\n***********\n\n\n\n"
