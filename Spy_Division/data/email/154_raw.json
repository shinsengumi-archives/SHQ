I got so behind that I was scared to come look at all the\nposts I got behind on, and then you all went and switched locations\non me!\n\nCheeky buggers.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to pimp the rkdreams.com forum.  A lot of the very\nrecognizable names in RK fanfiction are over there, but no one\norganizes and executes, as far as historical information-gathering\ngoes, like the Shinsengumi fans.  I&#39;ve been pushing a lot of people&#39;s\n(from here) writing over there when they ask for fic recommendations.\n\nAs far as related fic-writing goes, I&#39;m stalled out on the two\nSaitou-related stories I have going at the moment, but I hope to have\ninspiration soon (now that I have found you again!).\n\nI wrote an entry for the PMK fiction contest.  It&#39;s being hosted by\nsome of the mods of the PMK livejournal group. (Not a very\ninformational/historical-type group.  More interested in fanart and\nfanfiction.)\n\nANyway, here are the related links:\n\nPMK Livejournal group:  http://www.livejournal.com/users/pm_kurogane\n\nThe PMK Fanart/Fanfiction Contest:\nhttp://peacemakerfancontest.bravehost.com/\n\nRKDreams Forum:\nhttp://www.rkdreams.com/rk_forum/default.asp\n\nThe story I wrote:\n\nTitle: Hide and Seek\nGenre: Vignettes\nRating: PG-13\nCharacters: Assorted\nDescription: Hiding from the future, from the monster &#39;Fate&#39;, the\ndemons play, the demons smile, the demons lay in wait.\nhttp://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1809630\n\n(Special thank-you to everyone who has already read and reviewed it!)\n\nAngrybee.\n\n\n"
