Tokio was a woman of the 19th century probably in an arranged marriage who more than likely came to love her husband as she grew to know him.\n\nI see her being able to defend herself modestly well pre-Saitou and better after her marriage (c&#39;mon he was gone a lot he&#39;d want her to know how to handle things while he was absent). \n\nI see her as silently putting up with his more &quot;difficult&quot;  quirks and speaking her mind when it was very important to her to do so.\n\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
