Now how about the others?\n\nIt was great reading your responses. It&#39;s nice to get to know you \ngals better. Since everyone was expounding on their responses I \nthought I&#39;d do the same... So here goes...\n\nANSWERS:\n1) No I didn&#39;t mean to put A (I must&#39;ve really been sleepy)... I&#39;m \nmore of a B, smoke stop think stop drink soda (do this 10x over)\n2) I&#39;m definitely a C... I get so excited on my fic and post it ASAP. \nUnfortunately when I start reading I find typos here and there. I fix \nwhat I catch but it takes another hour to show the changes, by then \neveryone has read the story T__T\n3) B! I am crazy about reviews... They make me feel good. \n4) B! I check if there&#39;s a basis... I feel sad but I check and I \nappreciate those who have critiques to give.\n5) C! I&#39;m always on a writers block. ALWAYS!\n6) C! Eventhough I have writers block on a fic I&#39;m writing.. The \nideas for a new fic just keeps knocking... Baka Brain!\n7) B. I announce once in a while... I don&#39;t want my fic to be \nforgotten or left to Kami.... :O)\n\nThere you have it! Those who haven&#39;t answered please do so. \n\n~wounds\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grace Battista&quot; \n&lt;mg_batt@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hmmm... It&#39;s 1:33 AM from where I&#39;m at... Sleepy but funny can&#39;t \n&gt; sleep so here goes... Let&#39;s discuss about things you do, w/ regards \n&gt; to writing of course... This is in no particular order and if it&#39;s \n&gt; sounds kinda weird... It&#39;s 1:34 AM...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) While writing you... ????\n&gt; a. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts \n&gt; are finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.\n&gt; b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever\n&gt; c. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, \n&gt; oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) After writing you... ????\n&gt; a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important \n&gt; than Proof-read!\n&gt; b. One quick read. I&#39;m confident enough in my work.\n&gt; c. Oh who needs to check? It&#39;s too late. I wrote and posted the \n&gt; thing already!\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) When you get reviews you... ???\n&gt; a. Oh that&#39;s nice. I&#39;ll check it in a bit. *feels good*\n&gt; b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!\n&gt; c. Review... Well that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it. \n&gt; \n&gt; 4) When you get a critique you... ???\n&gt; a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!\n&gt; b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis \n&gt; and then correct if need be...\n&gt; c. What? You didn&#39;t like it. Oh! I&#39;ve got to fix that quick!\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) When it comes to updates you... ???\n&gt; a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\n&gt; b. I&#39;ll update exactly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a \n&gt; defined routine.\n&gt; c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this \n&gt; great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \n&gt; you...\n&gt; a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written \n&gt; now!\n&gt; b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it&#39;s more \nconvenient.\n&gt; c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!\n&gt; \n&gt; 7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\n&gt; a. Post on every messageboard, yahoo group and even e-mail close \n&gt; (not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need \nto \n&gt; read ASAP or else!\n&gt; b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement \n&gt; in a community where you are an active member or popular\n&gt; c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your fic \n&gt; in the depths of ff.net.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s mine...\n&gt; 1. a\n&gt; 2. c\n&gt; 3. b\n&gt; 4. b\n&gt; 5. c\n&gt; 6. c\n&gt; 7. b\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll post some sort grading system and interpretation to the \n&gt; results that you get. Right now though.. Well no way. Sleep has \n&gt; come! YEY! It might be nice though to see your responses so that we \n&gt; know a little bit more about each other. Maybe get a few laughs \n&gt; too. :O)\n&gt; \n&gt; ~wounds\n\n\n"
