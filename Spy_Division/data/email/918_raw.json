Is \nthere documented \n&gt; historical reasons for this? \n\n***Th=\r\nere are folktales which imply nanshoku occurred within the ranks \nof the Sh=\r\ninsengumi.  Over time these tales became popularized to the \npoint that it =\r\nhas become fact and I think logically in the minds of many it \nseems &quot;logic=\r\nal&quot; that men living in close quarters turned to each other \nespecially duri=\r\nng those dry periods between their paychecks so to speak \nand they couldn&#39;t=\r\n go to the red-light district.  \n\nIn popular media it&#39;s accepted canon to h=\r\nave Hijikata and Okita pairing \nwhen there is little to suggest they were m=\r\nore than friends in history.  I \nthink it has alot to do with the issue tha=\r\nt Okita as a TB patient has to \nbe &quot;perpetually weak/ill&quot; (even though that=\r\n does not have to be the case \nas TB patients have cycles of illness and &quot;n=\r\normal&quot; periods) and if he had \nan attractive older friend like Hijikata or =\r\neven Kondou then it doesn&#39;t hurt \nto imagine them as lovers with the weaken=\r\ned Okita playing a female \nrole. Combine nanshoku with the tragedy of TB an=\r\nd you have a really \ncompelling love story where one dies alone yearning fo=\r\nr his lover and \nhis comrades (below is a very old essay about Okita and TB=\r\n).\n\nThe details from history which support nanshoku amongst the \nShinsengum=\r\ni are:\n\n1) There was one very attractive Shinsengumi foot soldier and we do=\r\n \nhave his name who may have caused some fighting amongst the ranks \n\n2) It=\r\nou Kashitaro was described, historically, as being attractive to the \npoint=\r\n he made men and women take notice when he was out and about \non his stroll=\r\ns although we don&#39;t know for sure Itou&#39;s sexual leanings.\n\nIf not, why Shin=\r\nsengumi and not - say - the 47 Ronin or \n&gt; Miyamoto Musashi?\n\n** I&#39;m sure t=\r\nhat somewhere the 47 Ronin have been portrayed in yaoi \nmedia but I think b=\r\necause the group had 2 periods as retainers and then \nseparation before car=\r\nrying out the plot, people are less likely to think of \nthem as practicing =\r\nnanshoku.  I have never studied the 47 Ronin in detail.\nIn contrast the Shi=\r\nnsengumi&#39;s theme of &quot;togetherness&quot; comes across \nmore strongly and I think =\r\nthat is the reason they are so popular in yaoi \nmedia.\n\n** Miyamoto Musashi=\r\n, historically, did have male partners.\n\nGOJOU HAJIME is an interesting wor=\r\nk and while I can&#39;t say it was written \nfor -just- yaoi fangirls I think it=\r\n&#39;ll give people alot of insight into what \nyaoi fans would like to read and=\r\n why they find the &quot;emotional&quot; voice of \nthe characters so appealing.  \n\n--=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Affl=\r\nicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis and Okita Soujiro \n--------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;It was a cough, apparently---a=\r\n man&#39;s cough=85a cough devoid of any \nzest for life or love, which didn&#39;t c=\r\nome in spasms, but sounded as if \nsomeone were stirring feebly in a terribl=\r\ne mush of decomposing organic \nmaterial.&quot; (Mann 12)\n\n:: Edo Era :: Treatmen=\r\nt :: Society :: Fiction :: Bibliography ::\n\nThe following is a brief discus=\r\nsion on tuberculosis and its possible \neffects on both historical Okita and=\r\n how the illness aided in the \ndevelopment of his fictional persona. Ofcour=\r\nse, a physical condition does \nnot fully &quot;define&quot; a human being, so please =\r\ndo not view this exploration \nas an oversimplification of him as just TB pa=\r\ntient when obviously he was \nso much more.\n\nTo understand the biology of TB=\r\n please do not rely only on websites \nwhich often simplify the disease. Try=\r\n to seek out medical texts, or \njournal articles written by people in the m=\r\nedical community and \ncompare what we know now to the information available=\r\n in 19th century \nJapan to understand how Okita dealt with this illness. I =\r\nam not a \nbacteriologist nor a doctor so I will only touch on the science a=\r\nspect. \n\nPrior to Robert Koch&#39;s discovery of the tubercle bacillus, the cau=\r\nse of \ntuberculosis, was a universal mystery subject to superstition and in=\r\ntense \nfear. There are six different kinds of disease causing Mycobacteria.=\r\n Type \nA was the variation found in Japan since prehistoric times. Before t=\r\nhe \n1880s some scientists had theorized that the tubercle bacilli floated i=\r\nn \nthe air and infected people. The theory was very close to scientific fac=\r\nt \nbut was rejected by a majority of the scientific community at the time \n=\r\nbecause few believed in the existence of &quot;bacteria&quot;. \n\n&quot;Airborne particles =\r\n[of tubercle bacilli] formed by the evaporation of \nminute respiratory drop=\r\nlets can carry several bacilli=85Respiratory \nfunctions as simple as coughi=\r\nng, sneezing, spitting, and singing produce \nsuch particles=85in a closed r=\r\noom they disperse like tobacco smoke.&quot; \n(Johnston 27)\n\nExposure to the tube=\r\nrcle bacillus does not have to lead to infection. \nOther factors such as th=\r\ne host&#39;s environment, age (puberty and old age \nreduces the body&#39;s ability =\r\nto resist infection), sex, nutrition, working \nconditions (exhaustion can i=\r\nnitiate active tuberculosis or exacerbate the \ncondition) as well as extrem=\r\ne mental stress (the last factor has been \nobserved by modern clinicians bu=\r\nt there has been no extensive \nexperimentation) can determine the possible =\r\nonset of illness.\n\nJapan&#39;s experience with the white plague peaked between =\r\n1890-1950 \nand even the records between those years may not be accurate due=\r\n to \nfrequent, at times, purposeful misdiagnosis to protect both the doctor=\r\n \nand patient&#39;s reputation. Often, innocuous complex phrases like caseous \n=\r\npneumonia or bronchial catarrh were used in place of the most \nominous &quot;con=\r\nsumption&quot; on paperwork. The stigma attached to \ntuberculosis will be furthe=\r\nr explored below.\n\nEdo Era [return to top]\nMany foreign doctors and visitor=\r\ns who entered Japan right before the \nRestoration noted the prevalence of t=\r\nuberculosis.\n(this section will deal with what people believed and practice=\r\nd back \nthen, not what is scientifically accurate today)\n\nI have often read=\r\n that Okita was a victim of pulmonary consumption so \nwhat did that mean in=\r\n his lifetime? \n\nPulmonary consumption &quot;translates into Japanese as haibyo,=\r\n or &#39;lung \ndisease&#39;&quot; (Johnston 418) or the modern medical term hai kekkaku.=\r\n An \neven more common term was rosai (in Chinese, lao ji) (Johnston 43) \nwh=\r\nich appeared in Japanese texts for many centuries. Ro means &quot;to \nconsume&quot; a=\r\nnd sai means &quot;to hold a funeral ceremony&quot; because after \nsuffering from ema=\r\nciation, fever, night sweats, violent coughing and \neven the external appea=\r\nrance of tubercles (kekkaku) the victim most \ncertainly died.\n\nHow was Okit=\r\na treated? [return to top] \nVery likely his treatment was influenced by the=\r\n techniques prescribed by \nManase Dosan (1507-1574). Manase used Chinese me=\r\ndical theories and \nthe Tokugawa sanctioned this medical approach. Aside fr=\r\nom \npopularizing the term rosai, Manase standardized a four step diagnosis =\r\n\n(summary from Johnston 44) procedure involving \n\n1) Visual observation, no=\r\nting skin color, weight, weakness, condition of \nthe hair, sputum, feces, u=\r\nrine, and feces \n2) Auditory observation by listening to the sounds in the =\r\nchest by \ntapping. \n3) Interrogation using conversation to collect informat=\r\nion from the \npatient about appetite, waste elimination, emotions and what =\r\nfactors \ninduce the onset of illness\n4) Pulse diagnosis a sophisticated art=\r\n &quot;that analyzed the strength, speed, \nlocations, and other aspects of the p=\r\nulse to facilitate the identification of \na disease&quot; (Johnston 44)\n\nCommon =\r\ntreatment included moxibustion &quot;(a method of cauterizing \nspecific points o=\r\nn the body according to principles similar to those used \nin acupuncture)&quot; =\r\n(Johnston 44), recommendations to eat a diet rich in \neggs, chickens (note =\r\nthat they are all proteins), and residence in a rural \narea (western doctor=\r\ns also recommended exposure to clean dry air). \nOne of the behavioral patte=\r\nrns noted by doctors of this era was that \nexcessive alcohol and sexual int=\r\nercourse preceded illness thus they often \nprescribed patients to abstain f=\r\nrom both. Interestingly, there is a rumor \nthat Okita was a &quot;clean child&quot; o=\r\nr celibate. It is mentioned in \nShinsengumi &quot;lore&quot; that Hijikata gave the c=\r\naptain of his first squad the \nmedicine he once peddled, the Ishida Sanyaku=\r\n (I am not certain about \nthe spelling).\n\nGenerally, each symptom was treat=\r\ned because again, the cause had not \nbeen identified. The most fascinating =\r\nand common medicine was opium \nin &quot;tea&quot; [Edit 5/19/2006] (This may be an an=\r\n Asian form of poppy-head \ntea or a similar derivative) which was believed =\r\nto help stabilize the \ndigestive system and prevent diarrhea (tuberculosis =\r\naffected many parts \nof the body including the intestines). Note that there=\r\n were extremely \nstrict laws against opium usage during the Tokugawa becaus=\r\ne the result \nof this drug&#39;s prevalent use in China and Opium War were well=\r\n known to \nthe bakufu.\n\n[Edit 5/19/2006] &quot;There were no specific cures for =\r\ntuberculosis, \npneumonia or bronchitis and opium helped to alleviate sympto=\r\nms, \nsubduing coughing, expectoration and pain even if it could not touch t=\r\nhe \nroot cause. Discharges of all sorts, too, were dealt with by the drung.=\r\nIts \nuse in haemorrhage was well-known---&#39;of all the wonderful \ninfluences.=\r\n..exerted by opium, that by which it sustains the powers of \nlife...arrests=\r\n the flow of blood, is the most extraordinary,&#39; commented a \nmedical journa=\r\nl in 1846.&quot; (Berridge 67 originally from &#39;Review of Dr \nGriffin&#39;s Medical a=\r\nnd Physiological Problems, British and Foreign Medical \nReview, 221 (1846) =\r\npp. 105-107). Although the example is from western \nmedicine, a similar bel=\r\nief was found in the East. Remember, the British \nobtained opium from Asia =\r\nand studied its many uses in that part of the \nworld.\n\nMatsumoto Ryojun, ph=\r\nysician to Tokugawa Yoshinobu, was close to \nKondou Isami so very likely he=\r\n knew of the medical condition of \nmembers in the Shinsengumi such as Okita=\r\n. After the Restoration, \nMatsumoto became an important figure in establish=\r\ning medical \neducation. If you have information further establishing the re=\r\nlationship \nbetween this physician and Okita please contact shinsengumihq(a=\r\n)\nyahoo.com. \n\n[Edit 5/19/2006] As mentioned earlier, opium was frequently =\r\nused in the \ntreatment of TB. According to this website &quot;An anecdotal story=\r\n about his \nunorthodox techniques-- he successfully treated Tokugawa Yoshin=\r\nobu&#39;s \nstress condition by having him take opium (against government \nregul=\r\nation) and sleep for a day.&quot; (translated by Hirotada Tokugawa).\n\n[Edit 5/19=\r\n/2006] Matsumoto&#39;s connection to the Shinsengumi can be \nseen in the fact t=\r\nhat Kondou Isami met the physician. Matsumoto also \nleft an account of his =\r\nmeeting with the Shinsengumi chief (See \nHillsborough Shinsengumi 104-105).=\r\n Furthermore, after Kondou was \nshot by surviving members of the Itou Affai=\r\nr, he sought Matsumoto&#39;s \ncare in Osaka (Hillsborough Shinsengumi 140). Mat=\r\nsumoto&#39;s last \nconnection to the Shinsengumi is his involvement in composin=\r\ng a text for \nan important memorial to Kondou and Hijikata in Hino (Hillsbo=\r\nrough \nShinsengumi 174, 181-182).\n\n&quot;According to an old proverb, the best t=\r\nreatment for tuberculosis \nwas opium and lies.&quot; (Rosenberg II)\n\nHow did soc=\r\niety treat sick people like Okita? [return to top] \n\nIt is highly likely th=\r\nat Okita&#39;s condition was kept secret as long as \npossible for practical rea=\r\nsons. The Shinsengumi lived and worked as a \nunit, a community, and this il=\r\nlness would affect their morale. There are \nalso cultural beliefs connected=\r\n to pollution which should be taken into \nconsideration too. \n\nConsumption =\r\nfell under the category of fuchi no yamai or incurable, \ndisfiguring diseas=\r\ne. One of the symptoms of TB is hemoptysis or the \ncoughing up of blood, wh=\r\nich related the illness to &quot;red impurities&quot; such \nas menstruation, child bi=\r\nrth and so forth. Note that blood was one of \nmany liquids expelled by the =\r\npatient, usually they would cough up the \ndecomposing cheeselike material w=\r\nhich accumlulated in their lungs as \nwell.\n\nA more heavy term is gobyo or &quot;=\r\nkarmic disease&quot; which did not mean \nthat bad karma caused the disease but t=\r\nhat it was inescapable like the \nfruition of past action. Karma does not al=\r\nways mean &quot;negative&quot; action. \nThe significance of this term is that there i=\r\ns nowhere to run or hide from \nthe inevitable.\n\nMarriage would have been al=\r\nmost impossible. Both male and female \npatients could start a tubercular fa=\r\nmily lineage or kekkaku ketto. There \nare numerous accounts of women divorc=\r\ned due to the sickness for fear \nthat it would be passed down to their chil=\r\ndren via breast milk. Men, \nunable to maintain their family line or women u=\r\nnable to marry or \nproduce children were generally marginalized by society.=\r\n\n\nVictims were usually buried outside the village graveyard or separate \nfr=\r\nom the official family grave for fear that the pollution would mark their \n=\r\nblood line as a yamai make or diseased lineage. The belief that disease \nco=\r\nuld be inherited persisted well into the 20th century.\n\nFiction[return to t=\r\nop] \nHow come Okita is always smiling, childish and ummm girly?\n\nNot all fi=\r\nctional portrayals show as cheery and upbeat but many do \nbecause maintaini=\r\nng a positive attitude was believed to be beneficial. \nThe following repres=\r\nentative quotes are from a medical text however \nthey may be outdated.\n\nAga=\r\nin, writers and artists may have worked with these generalizations \nto &quot;bui=\r\nld&quot; the character of Okita, which means that it may not accurately \nreflect=\r\n on the historical person.\n\n&quot;The belief that there is a specific `tuberculo=\r\nus personality&#39;\ncharacterized by undue cheerfulness (Spes Phthisica)=85and =\r\nmarked\nintellectual productivity has gained wide support.&quot; (Calden 275)\n\n&quot;T=\r\nuberculous patients behave like deprived children.&quot; (Dunbar 226)\n\nDue to th=\r\ne patient&#39;s dependence on others during their illness, the \nresearchers cho=\r\nse representative quotes from the 570 subjects they \nused. One said &quot;I feel=\r\n like a baby again&quot; (Calden 288) \n\n&quot;Let us assume that the patients have pa=\r\nssed beyond the unavoidable \nbreaking-in period and have settled down to be=\r\ning ill and to being ill with \ntuberculosis. Afterwards a variety of mental=\r\n changes may take place \nwhich time and again have puzzled observers. It ha=\r\ns been said\nthat tuberculous patients are predominantly sensitive, neurotic=\r\n, \ndepressed, optimistic, elated, euphoric, easily suggestible, whimsical, =\r\n\nCHILDISH, selfish, self-centered, capricious=85Most patients with \ntubercu=\r\nlosis are in a mood of mild overt or concealed depression and \nanxiety, whi=\r\nch are normal and adequate reaction to indisious disease=85\nOffsprings of t=\r\nhese reactions and defenses against them are defiance, \nULTRA-CHEERFULNESS.=\r\n&quot; (Wittkower 164)\n\n&quot;Much has been written on the subject of tuberculosis an=\r\nd genius=85[list \nof geniuses]. The truth of the matter seems to be that tu=\r\nberculosis is a \ncommon disease, and therefore also occurs in men and women=\r\n of \ngenius=85tuberculosis for a variety of reasons favors fantasy producti=\r\non=85\nand the dreaded limitation of their span of life stimulates their \npr=\r\noductivity.&quot; (Wittkower 155-6)\n\nThere was an entire GENRE devoted to tuberc=\r\nulosis both in the West \nand Japan.\nUsually the illness is associated with =\r\nyoung frail, beautiful women. \nInterestingly, many girls after their first =\r\nmenses WERE likely to get TB, \nespecially if they had a lower intake of pro=\r\ntein (note many Japanese had \na vegetarian and fish diet that time). We kno=\r\nw that the Shinsengumi \nwere the subject of folktales and even the novel Na=\r\nkazato Kaizan&#39;s \nDAIBOSATSU-TOGE [the film SWORD OF DOOM] (although Okita w=\r\nas \nnot feminine or childlike in this work) it is easy to see how a doomed =\r\n\nswordsman with TB all of sudden takes on female qualities which would \nsol=\r\nidify him as a perpetually tragic figure in fiction. Most patients \nregardl=\r\ness of gender did experience exhaustion and thus if a masculine \nswordsman =\r\nis constantly weak he gradually becomes more and more \nlike the gender asso=\r\nciated with physical weakness.\n\n&quot;Life means that form is retained even thou=\r\ngh matter is being \ntransformed.&quot; (Mann 262)\n\n\nBibliography[return to top] =\r\n\n\nBerridge, Virginia and Griffith Edwards.
