It is based on homosexual \nactivity in the Shinsengumi but I don&#39;t think it is perverted at all.  The \nstory line is really good but all of the mine characters like Kondo, \nHijikata and others are really old which doesn&#39;t seem right seeing that \nthey were in their early 30&#39;s at that time.  I would recommend it if you \ncan take two men getting it on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hope this helps\n&gt; Megumi-san\n\nAs far as I know, many people said that they just didn&#39;t understand the \nending and some said it was suck. However, I guess Shinsengumi fan \nshould have a chance to watch it. At least I want to see my dear, Okita-\nsama.  ^^&#39; That must be nice.\n\nGiffy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
