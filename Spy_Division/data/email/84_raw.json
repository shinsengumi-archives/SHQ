Sighing, she leaned back onto t=\r\nhe mats, and looked up, out\nthe open window into the winter sky.\n&quot;Ugh=85the=\r\n sky is too sentimental=85&quot;\nTurning from the window, she looked down at her=\r\n growing abdomen. The\nperiod of constant queasiness early on in her pregnan=\r\ncy was long over,\nreplaced instead by a period of calm. Safe far within the=\r\n walls of the\ncastle, the troubles of the age=97even with Hiro&#39;s alteration=\r\ns to the\ntimeline=97seemed far, far away. Being freed from most responsibil=\r\nities,\nshe was actually able to afford herself the luxury of simply enjoyin=\r\ng\neverything that was happening to her, even with the emotional\nrollercoast=\r\ner that brought so many tears to her eyes. In recent weeks,\nshe&#39;d very ofte=\r\nn sit and wonder about her unborn child, and this would\ncarry over into her=\r\n conversations with Hiro=97they would talk about\nnames, education, clothing=\r\n, the ritual ceremonies that would\ndoubtlessly follow their child&#39;s birth. =\r\nMost of all, Yuki looked\nforward to holding the child in her arms. If thing=\r\ns were still going\nthe way they were at the moment, Hiro would continue to =\r\nbe away for a\nvery long amount of the day. If Yuki had the child with her, =\r\nshe&#39;d\nalways have a part of him nearby, and her mind would be at greater pe=\r\nace.\nThe sound of heavy footsteps suddenly brought her back into the\nrealit=\r\ny of the Bakumatsu period. Sitting up as quickly as she could,\nshe once aga=\r\nin wiped her eyes dry, straightened out the folds of her\novercoat, and read=\r\nied herself. Somehow, she knew that something major\nhad happened. A wry smi=\r\nle crept over her face as she thought to herself.\nMust be mother&#39;s intuitio=\r\nn=85\nSuddenly, the screen door opened, and in came Hiro with an armed\nretai=\r\nner. They appeared to be returning from a raid, and neither of\nthem had tak=\r\nen off their armor yet. Hiro was ecstatic and glowing.\nKneeling down next t=\r\no Yuki, he took her hand in his.\n&quot;Yuki! Wonderful news! We raided the estat=\r\nes of the courtiers and\nfound evidence that incriminates Sanjou Sanetomi an=\r\nd Iwakura Tomomi,\nas well as some people working with the radical samurai o=\r\nf Choshuu, in\na plot to poison Emperor Komei!&quot;\nYuki sat silently for a mome=\r\nnt, staring at Hiro listlessly. Suddenly,\nshe broke down in tears, leaning =\r\nforward into Hiro&#39;s embrace.\n&quot;Aren&#39;t you=85uh=85glad?&quot;\n&quot;Yes!&quot; she said, thr=\r\nough her uncontrollable tears. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m glad we\ngot them! I just=85don&#39;t k=\r\nnow why I&#39;m crying!&quot; She tried drying her eyes\nwith the sleeveless haori th=\r\nat Hiro wore over his armor, but to no avail.\n&quot;Yuki-chan=85&quot;\nHiro glanced o=\r\nver to his retainer and dismissed him. The man bowed,\nand left, silently sh=\r\nutting the sliding door behind him.\n&quot;Yuki=85daijoubu=85naitemo ii desu wa=\r\n=85It&#39;s alright to cry=85&quot;\n&quot;You know what I really want right now?&quot; she sai=\r\nd, feeling the tears\nsuddenly stop.\n&quot;What do you need? Just say what it is,=\r\n and I&#39;ll get it=97no matter how\nseemingly odd it might be.&quot;\n&quot;I really want=\r\n some=85root beer=85&quot;\nHiro held an armored hand up to his mouth, trying in =\r\nvain to suppress\na laugh.\n&quot;A root beer?&quot;\n&quot;Yes=85a root beer, like what we u=\r\nsed to drink in Philadelphia during\ncollege=85with crushed ice.&quot;\n&quot;Yuki-chan=\r\n=85&quot;\n&quot;I know that there&#39;s no root beer yet. Nor is there crushed ice=85at\nl=\r\neast, not how we know it. I just=85wish I were home!&quot; She broke out in\ntear=\r\ns again. &quot;I want my parents here to help!&quot;\n&quot;Yuki=85you know that we&#39;re most=\r\n probably stuck here. I know that it&#39;s\nhard. But if there&#39;s anything from t=\r\nhis time period that I can get for\nyou to make things even a little easier=\r\n=97even if it&#39;s as simple as a\nflower from Yoshino Mountain or as odd as a =\r\nperformance by a fat,\nbald-headed comedic storyteller from Osaka=97then don=\r\n&#39;t hesitate to tell\nme. We have the means to have pretty much anything we w=\r\nish now. If\nthere&#39;s anything=85anything at all that I can do=85&quot;\n&quot;There are=\r\n=85.two things you can do=85&quot;\n&quot;Anything. Name them.&quot;\n&quot;The best red miso sou=\r\np you can get. These people down here don&#39;t know\nhow to make miso=97they us=\r\ne the white type and all. Up north, where I\ncome from, we eat the red stuff=\r\n. It just tastes better! In fact, my\nmother used to make=85&quot; her voice trai=\r\nled off, and tears formed in her\neyes again.\n&quot;Sssh. Just try to focus on th=\r\ne here and now. What&#39;s the other thing\nyou wanted?&quot;\n&quot;Hiro-sama=85you&#39;re alw=\r\nays gone for so long. Nowadays we get even less\nof chances to be together t=\r\nhan we did when you were in the\nShinsengumi. I know you&#39;re wearing armor, b=\r\nut I would like very\nmuch=85for you to hold me=85&quot;\n&quot;Yuki-chan=85I&#39;m sorry=\r\n=85&quot; murmured Hiro, and gently wrapped his arms\naround her, holding her as =\r\nclose as he could in spite of the limited\nmovement offered to him by the ar=\r\nmor.\n&quot;Forgive me=85&quot;\n*********\n\tThe changes that Hiro made in the timeline =\r\nwere slow and gradual.\nHaving been an avid student of history, he was able =\r\nto immediately\ncontribute to the arrest of several Choshuu rebels, but coul=\r\ndn&#39;t find\nanyone major for a long time. The raid that caught Sanjou and Iwa=\r\nkura\nwas the first critical step toward changing history, because without\nt=\r\nhem, Emperor Komei would not be poisoned. Thus, a critical element\nfor the =\r\ncontinuation of the Tokugawa government, the Imperial mandate,\nwas secured.=\r\n However, things would not remain as simple as he thought.\nThings were abou=\r\nt to come utterly chaotic and undone, like a tapestry\nwith threads rapidly =\r\nunwinding.\nAbout a week after the raid that caught the two plotting nobleme=\r\nn,\nHiro was in his room, sleeping soundly after a particularly long\nmeeting=\r\n with Lord Matsudaira where he expounded the need for rapid\nacquisition of =\r\ncannons and Gatling guns. Suddenly, the sound of\nhurried footsteps startled=\r\n him out of his deep, dreamless slumber.\n&quot;Lord Tokugawa! Lord Tokugawa!&quot;\nSl=\r\nowly, Hiro drew himself up to a kneeling position. Rubbing his eyes\na coupl=\r\ne times, he stretched in exhaustion and then finally responded.\n&quot;Enter.&quot;\nTh=\r\ne sliding door opened, and in came a young, disheveled retainer,\nprobably s=\r\nerving under Lord Matsudaira.\n&quot;It&#39;s terrible, sir. After the raid last week=\r\n, Choshuu has=85&quot; the\nsamurai&#39;s voice trailed off suddenly, as if he truly =\r\nfeared what he\nwas about to tell Hiro.\n&quot;What? Out with it!&quot;\n&quot;Choshuu secret=\r\nly negotiated an alliance with the British awhile ago.\nLast week&#39;s raid has=\r\n thrown their lord into a rage, and he has openly\ncalled in the support of =\r\nthe British, who even now have a fleet\nsailing here from China and India!&quot;\n=\r\nHiro stared at the young man in shock. So this secret alliance was\nconclude=\r\nd before the start of his alterations to the timeline=85Once\nagain, he was =\r\npainfully reminded of a fact first told to him by his\nfather, years ago: Hi=\r\nstorians don&#39;t write everything down. There are\nunwritten parts of history =\r\nwhich can very well be truly, utterly\nterrifying=85\n&quot;I=85Impossible!&quot;\n&quot;I fe=\r\nar not, my lord.&quot;\n&quot;And what action is Lord Matsudaira taking?&quot;\n&quot;His lordshi=\r\np has sent an urgent letter to Edo, requesting that\nYoshinobu-sama come her=\r\ne immediately=97 as the regent for the shogun\nIemochi, he is best suited to=\r\n assume command for the defense of the\nrealm and of the Tokugawa house, and=\r\n to make that stand here. If\nChoshuu and the British intend to strike us, t=\r\nhey will strike us here.\nIn the meanwhile, Lord Matsudaira is also issuing =\r\norders for increased\nrecruitment by the Shinsengumi and Mimawarigumi. Lord =\r\nKondou and Lord\nSasaki will also be asked to present themselves here soon, =\r\nin order\nfor Lord Matsudaira to explain the plans for the region&#39;s defense.=\r\n&quot;\nHiro paused a moment.\n&quot;And what of guns?&quot; he finally asked. &quot;Has the Lord=\r\n Matsudaira said\nanything about guns?&quot;\n&quot;I do not know, Lord Tokugawa. That =\r\nis a subject which you would\nprobably do better to discuss directly with hi=\r\ns lordship than with a\nmere retainer.&quot;\n&quot;Understood. Does his lordship requi=\r\nre my presence?&quot;\nThe retainer nodded.\n&quot;Yes=85he&#39;s about to hold a meeting w=\r\nith those of his chief retainers\nwho are here. He told me to summon you, an=\r\nd said that from now on,\nwhen on duty, you should be fully armed and armore=\r\nd.&quot;\nHiro bowed.\n&quot;As his lordship wishes. Tell him that I shall join him sho=\r\nrtly.&quot;\n**********\n\tYuki awoke in a cold sweat.\n\tHiro=85she thought. Hiro=85=\r\n\n\tSlowly, she brought herself up to her feet, and shuffled over to the\nslid=\r\ning door.\n\t&quot;Psst=85Hiro.&quot;\n\tAfter not getting any response, she opened the d=\r\noor, and saw that he\nwas gone. Suddenly, though, the empty armor stand and =\r\nsword rack\ncaught her eye.\n\t&quot;Ugh=85gone again=85&quot;\n\tThe moonlight broke thro=\r\nugh the clouds, and cast its dim illumination\non a piece of paper which lay=\r\n on the neatly folded futon, addressed\nwith a simple &quot;Yuki&quot;. Slowly bending=\r\n over, she picked it up and opened it.\n\tMy dearest=97\n\tChoshuu has openly d=\r\neclared hostilities, and has called in British\naid. Fleet now sailing in fr=\r\nom China and India. Lord Yoshinobu coming\nfrom Edo. Called to Lord Matsudai=\r\nra&#39;s side, don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back.\n\tDon&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll be fin=\r\ne.\n\t--Hiro\nBelow the main body of the message, in small, barely visible let=\r\nters,\nwas Hiro&#39;s favorite English quote from Thomas Paine&#39;s The American Cr=\r\nisis.\nThese are the times that try men&#39;s souls=85\n*********\n\n\n\n"
