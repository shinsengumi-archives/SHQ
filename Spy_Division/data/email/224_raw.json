You can often \nfind \n&gt; her posing under the name &quot;Tokio&quot; in many fanfics.  She&#39;s somehow \na \n&gt; swordswoman who can take down the entire Shinsengumi, but, in her \n&gt; off-time, she&#39;s stunningly beautiful, charming, and poised.  Also, \nshe \n&gt; can verbally browbeat (RK) Saitou into doing whatever she wants, \n&gt; turning her Wolf into a puppy with a snap of the fingers.\n&gt; \n&gt; And everyone in the Kamiya dojo ADORES her.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d go on, but then I would be targeting specific stories, and \nthat&#39;s \n&gt; just mean.\n&gt; \n&gt; Angrybee.\n\nHi Angrybee... That&#39;s a really interesting take on Mary Sues. It&#39;s \nkind of interesting that since this is now out in the open, the \nreasons you said above is primarily the reason I don&#39;t dare write a \nTokio x Saitou story. When do does one overstep the boundaries? A \nlot of people seems to like this kind of portrait of Tokio but \npersonally, I don&#39;t. So those that makes it to my favorite stories \nlist tokio x saitou are those few who doesn&#39;t create an invincible \nTokio. Still though when writing, I&#39;m a bit afraid that I do the \nsame thing to my OC. Oh well.. *sighs* Such is the fate of an \ninexperienced psuedo-writer. I only hope that whoever reads my story \nwill be kind enough to mention if I overstep this boundary.\n\n\n"
