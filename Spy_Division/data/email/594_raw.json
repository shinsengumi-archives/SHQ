Archiving doujinshi poses a bit of \n&gt; a problem in two ways--space limits in the photos/files section and \nalso \n&gt; since doujinshi is a form of fanfiction  the author&#39;s permission would \n&gt; be needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can handle some screencaps in the &quot;photos&quot; section but again \nspace is \n&gt; a concern although if you have something that is very unique and not \n&gt; readily available I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love to see it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prepare yourself if you watch Gohatto--everyone is an ancient old \nman or \n&gt; pudgy and unattractive except for Kano, Okita and Tadanobu Asano** \nwhose \n&gt; character name I can never remember.\n&gt; \n&gt; **I&#39;m sure Sec will correct me if I got his real name wrong too ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; The Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n\nThank you for your answer. It&#39;s O.K. I do understand the problems. I \nwill find a place to upload what I want to show you instead. ^_^ Since \nI&#39;m a PMK fan, my soon-to-come collections must be about such manga \nfor sure.  ^^&#39;&#39;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
