So all your images shows up as &quot;x&quot; and when you \ntry to plug in the image to restore it all you end up screwing up \nthe timing...just one HUGE headache....so keep &quot;saving&quot; your work\notherwise windows movie maker is a very easy to learn program\n\nsecretarytocapt3\nweeping bitterly....\n\n\n\n\n"
