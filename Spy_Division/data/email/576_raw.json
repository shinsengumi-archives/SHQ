An OOC character can retain\nnone of the original traits given by the author of the series, of just a few\n but the main point is that he/she is not recognocible as the original\ncharacter.\n\nAn example of writing RK Saitou OOC would be making him to accept bribes, or\nperform corrupt deeds, or overlook corruption from officials. Or making\nAoshi a guy prone to emotional demonstrations, or extravagance. Or PMK\nHijikata mellow or oblivious of duty and/or discipline.\n\nFiruze\n \n-------Mensaje original-------\n \nDe: sabishiinokokoro\nFecha: 03/30/05 12:07:19\nPara: SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com\nAsunto: [SHQ_Spy_Division] I am sorry, but what&#39;s OOC?\n \n \n \nHi,\n \nI am new and doesn&#39;t know what OOC stands for, can anyone kindly inform\nme?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n------------------------ Yahoo!
