I use a mac at one of my jobs, =\r\n\na computer in a PC lab and use either my dead laptop at home or a \nborrowe=\r\nd laptop so usually I have to keep straight in my mind the \nversions of doc=\r\numents I upload and overwrite.\n\nSO today, I spent....5 hours going through =\r\nthe story and RE-EDITING \nit (T_T) http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOS=\r\nUZUE.pdf\n\nThanks Hirotada Tokugawa for informing me that it was full of \nsp=\r\nelling errors (that&#39;s how I knew I converted the wrong draft) and \nprobably=\r\n overwrote the GOOD draft, with an older version (I&#39;m stupid).\n\nAnyways I t=\r\nhink that people who want to learn about the Meiji era \nshould give the sto=\r\nry a chance, especially the last chapter will \ncover an important death (no=\r\nt really popularized in manga or pop-\nculture yet) and a very key developme=\r\nnt of the era.\n\nFootnotes galor all over the place, however there are tons =\r\nof details \nwhich are accurate but I did not footnote, because it would be =\r\n\nannoying to see footnote number 105 and then have to read an \nexplanation =\r\nat the bottom of the page.\n\nI forced one friend to read the story and she f=\r\ninished it in five \ndays and her frank review was the story was atleast &quot;st=\r\nrange&quot;.\n\nAgain you can support SHQ by paypaling $$ to shinsengumihq@yahoo.c=\r\nom\nor you can donate money to me at silapajarun@... \n\nI hope e=\r\nveryone likes my version of Fujita Goro (I purposefully \naltered his name t=\r\no Fujita Gorou, just as I tweaked the names of many \nhistorical figures in =\r\nthe story).\n\nPlease review and email me---I&#39;ll even take one word reviews.\n=\r\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secretarytocapt3@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I wrote an original novel which is what I&#39;d c=\r\nall &quot;historical&quot; \n&gt; fanfic. \n&gt; Fujita Gorou plays a key supporting role in =\r\nit however he is in no \n&gt; way similar to portrayals we have seen in the pas=\r\nt \n(anime/manga/live \n&gt; action movies)  he is just simply my &quot;take&quot; on him.=\r\n  Yes it will \n&gt; also depict the Fujita family and explain some stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The story is mainly about the Meiji Era however there will be scene \n&gt; whi=\r\nch take place during the Bakumatsu.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rating for this story is NC-17=\r\n due to the portrayals of various \n&gt; forms of sexuality. Please, only peopl=\r\ne over 17-18 should read it.  \n&gt; I don&#39;t want to traumatize the youngins.  =\r\nI am building a website \n&gt; for this story and for the general public to acq=\r\nuire the story \n&gt; they&#39;d have to paypal some amount of money (which basical=\r\nly means \nif \n&gt; they are old enough to have a credit card or checking accou=\r\nnt---\nthey \n&gt; can read my story).  It was not professionally edited, and of=\r\ncourse \n&gt; I&#39;m not a professional writer.  It will not be published or \nanyt=\r\nhing \n&gt; so you will notice that each chapter has a different theme and \n&gt; n=\r\nearly a different tone to it.  That&#39;s because this novel is sort \nof \n&gt; an =\r\nexperiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a nerd.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there will be footnotes in the story (=\r\n^_^)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is OVER 70,000 words long.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/Silapa=\r\nJarun/ONOSUZUE.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; if the story was even mildly entertaining to you, p=\r\nlease consider \n&gt; sending me money (^_^) \n&gt; \n&gt; members of SHQ have generous=\r\nly donated money for the upgrade of the \n&gt; website, which is now in its fin=\r\nal phase (basically 2 weeks to go) \n&gt; and aside from teh initial donations,=\r\n I&#39;ve been paying for stuff \nout \n&gt; of my own pocket.  I know the website h=\r\nasn&#39;t &quot;changed&quot; or been \n&gt; updated in months, but that is because updates w=\r\nould drive the \n&gt; programmer insane due to the database format we are imple=\r\nmenting. \n&gt; Once everything is done then updates will resume immediately.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; You can paypal the email contained in the story ($1, $1.50---I \ndon&#39;t \n=\r\n&gt; care)\n&gt; \n&gt; OR\n&gt; \n&gt; You can paypal shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com and help supp=\r\nort the \nsite&#39;s \n&gt; server\n&gt; \n&gt; it&#39;s totally voluntary because ofcourse I ju=\r\nst gave the link to the \n&gt; story above (^_^)\n&gt; \n&gt; if you have comments, ple=\r\nase email the author (email is in the \n&gt; header of every page)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
