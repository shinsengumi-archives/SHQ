He also has some grey hair too. He is supposed =\r\nto look rugged \nand all that but I was in a hurry last night and did a quic=\r\nk sketch.  \nHis narrative is heightened in chapter 4.  Fujita&#39;s interest in=\r\n this \ncase is also explained in chapter 4, he is not only fascinated with =\r\n\nthe case just &quot;because&quot; it&#39;s a mystery, it deals with his early much \nmore=\r\n impoverished days in Tokyo after immigrating back from the north.\n\nIf anyo=\r\nne wants to read my new super improved draft of Chapter 1\n(really is the la=\r\nst draft, now with more m x m action and a new \nscene) just let me know.\n\nI=\r\n&#39;m still waiting for one more publisher to reject it and then I&#39;ll \nput it =\r\non createspace for cheap or something.  The monies will be \nused to pay for=\r\n my internet bill and my domains XD\n\nit&#39;s a decent story, except it really =\r\nhas no market at this time\n\nthe advantage to self-publishing is that I trul=\r\ny want to KEEP THE \nFOOTNOTES.  The footnotes are really general, there are=\r\n even major \narcs in the narrative which are all 100% accurate and that stu=\r\nff is \nexplained in the videos at the novel&#39;s webpage (yes the vids are me =\r\n\ngoing on and on about stuff---but it&#39;s the Meiji Era which is much \nmore f=\r\nascinating than the sanitized version you get in your standard \nbook on the=\r\n era).\n\n\n\n\n"
