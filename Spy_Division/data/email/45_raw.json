Decided I really missed working on that story, so I&#39;m going to try tonight.  Gotta keep Sano warm.  :-)  At least staying busy is keeping new story ideas from sprouting up.  That&#39;s a first.\n \nAre we going to get new chapters of &quot;Jidai...&quot; tonight, Masayoshi, or do we have to wait?  \n \nphil\n\nnakkinomiko12 &lt;LMTame@...&gt; wrote:\nI hope you get to write again!  :-)  I&#39;ll be very sad if you don&#39;t!\n\n--L.\n\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;spiritus_saitou&quot; \n&lt;spiritus_saitou@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The unfinished tales I posted about yesterday are now available in \n&gt; the Fiction folder under Files.  You&#39;ll notice that they are \n&gt; individual folders rather than files.\n&gt; \n&gt; In discussing possibilites regarding the archive on the \n&gt; shinsengumihq.com site, it may be that only finished stories will \nbe \n&gt; archived there.  Unfinished stories would remain available here for \n&gt; reading (and hopefully encouraging authors to finish them... always \na \n&gt; treat to both author and reader!)  When you&#39;re posting a story in \n&gt; progess, create a folder in the Fiction folder with an indication \nin \n&gt; the descripton field that it&#39;s not finished (unfinished, \nincomplete, \n&gt; work in progress, in progess... just something to let us know it&#39;s \n&gt; not a completed story) and keep the chapters/parts within it.  It&#39;s \n&gt; easier for readers to access and alerts website archive maintainers \n&gt; that it&#39;s an unfinished story.  When the story *is* complete, you \ncan \n&gt; either upload it in one file (like I did with &quot;Fast Carriage&quot;) or \ngo \n&gt; in and edit the description of the folder to change it from \n&gt; unfinished to (yeah!) FINISHED.\n&gt; \n&gt; I posted up what I had completed so far in one big file for each \n&gt; story.  If I ever get to write again, you&#39;ll see individual \nchapters \n&gt; go up for &quot;Yasou,&quot; since they&#39;ll be uploaded as I write.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please bear with me as I try to keep things easy to access \n&gt; (especially as newcomers arrive) and easier for Barb and others to \n&gt; transfer to the website archive.  I know it&#39;s a lot to take in all \nat \n&gt; once, but once you start doing it, it&#39;s a snap.  I&#39;m putting my \nstuff \n&gt; up not because I want to reap hordes of praise, but because I know \nI \n&gt; have the author&#39;s permission (I hope), it&#39;s a learning exercise for \n&gt; me, and it can provide examples of what can be done with our \nlimited \n&gt; resources here.\n&gt; \n&gt; phil\n\n\n\nSHQ - Shinsengumi Headquarters\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\n\nComing soon:  SHQ - The Website\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/\n\nSHQ Spy Office -- SHQ LiveJournal\nhttp://wwww.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
