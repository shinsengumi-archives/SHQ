This might have been the road our boys took when they first \n&gt; came to Kyoto. Also, this may be helpful to those who write fanfics \n&gt; (at least the RK ones, where there is a lot of coming and going \n&gt; between the two cities) which is why I&#39;m posting it here. This is \n&gt; from a book called Reader&#39;s Digest Everyday Life Through the Ages \n&gt; (1992) ISBN# 0-276-42035-7 (Be forewarned there are only four pages \n&gt; in the whole book on Japan.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Grains and goods made by craftsmen were carried from place to place \n&gt; on a network of roads which included the Eastern Sea Road. This \n&gt; highway, 300 miles (480 km) long, connected Kyoto and Edo, and at the \n&gt; time it was probably the world&#39;s busiest road. A constant traffic of \n&gt; merchants, government officials, pilgrims, priests and doctors \n&gt; travelled along it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Most people travelled by horse or on foot, and it took 20 to 30 days \n&gt; for pedestrians to complete the journey. The few wheeled vehicles \n&gt; were used to carry very heavy loads. There were incessant stops at \n&gt; checkpoints where the agents of the shogun kept a watchful eye on \n&gt; travellers. Their main concern was to give the shogun advance warning \n&gt; of powerful local lords on the move with large bodies of armed men.&quot;\n\n\n"
