You don&#39;t write to please the readers, you write for yourself, \nb=\r\necause it&#39;s your hobby.\n\nNow, you could become as obsessed as I am with kee=\r\nping characters IC, \ngetting numerous beta-readers, taking months before po=\r\nsting anything, \njust in case=85  But you know what? No matter what you do,=\r\n there will \nalways be people unhappy about your work. Too complex, not eno=\r\nugh \ncomplex=85 Too many descriptions, not enough descriptions=85 Too many =\r\n\ncharacters, not enough characters=85 Not the pairing that they like, \nand =\r\nso on=85\n\nEven when you try to be historically correct, there will always b=\r\ne \nsomeone who, at one point, will feel obliged to say &quot;hey you are \nwrong =\r\nabout this=85&quot; even if you weren&#39;t.\n\nSo at the end of the day, if you feel =\r\nproud of what you wrote, then \neverything is just fine the way it is. You c=\r\nhange your writing style \nand habits if you want to change them, if you are=\r\n unhappy about your \nwork and think that you could improve, but not because=\r\n you feel \noblige to change.\n\nAnd alternate pairings are not necessarily a =\r\nbad thing. I enjoy them \nquite a lot. (^-^)\n\nMary-Ann\n\n\n\n"
