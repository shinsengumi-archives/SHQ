I&#39;m not sure if you got my e-mail about this, \nbut in case not I was wondering if you and I were thinking of the \nsame thing? What kind of database driven website did you have in \nmind and what kind of info do you want it to output? Just wondering, \nsince I&#39;m still pretty open to ideas and would really like to start \nan online server since I have this computer lying idly at home.\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;tnamwong@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Grace:I&#39;ve been thinking of putting up a database driven website \nbut my\n&gt; PHP/SQL knowledge is poor so it might be a while before I can do\n&gt; that. Hopefully by July...\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a wonderful idea and then a link can go on\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumhq.com\n&gt; \n&gt; I think filemaker pro can go online too..Please everyone keep \nupdating\n&gt; the &quot;DATABASE&quot;...this would make things easier for us fans...you \nguys\n&gt; have no idea how long it takes for me to search the Title, then the\n&gt; summary and then realize ff.net server is &quot;busy&quot;...the author alert\n&gt; feature is great on ff.net but I need to find stories/authors to \nbegin\n&gt; with!\n\n\n"
