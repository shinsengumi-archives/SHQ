Well, we need more of both. I&#39;ve been chatting with \nBarb and I&#39;m going to attempt to come up with some humor stuff for \nour website. Those two posts seem like as good a place to start as \nany.\n\nAmong the other topics I&#39;m considering is some sort of Shinsengumi \nLife Lessons category. So yeah, I need input for that as well. If \nanyone has anything they want to contribute please post it to the \nlist or e-mail me ASAP. Thanks.\n\n-MissBehavin (Digging herself deeper into the hole by taking on new \nprojects.)\n\n\n"
