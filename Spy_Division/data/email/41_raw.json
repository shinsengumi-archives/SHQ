You&#39;ll notice that they are \nindividual folders rather than files.\n\nIn discussing possibilites regarding the archive on the \nshinsengumihq.com site, it may be that only finished stories will be \narchived there.  Unfinished stories would remain available here for \nreading (and hopefully encouraging authors to finish them... always a \ntreat to both author and reader!)  When you&#39;re posting a story in \nprogess, create a folder in the Fiction folder with an indication in \nthe descripton field that it&#39;s not finished (unfinished, incomplete, \nwork in progress, in progess... just something to let us know it&#39;s \nnot a completed story) and keep the chapters/parts within it.  It&#39;s \neasier for readers to access and alerts website archive maintainers \nthat it&#39;s an unfinished story.  When the story *is* complete, you can \neither upload it in one file (like I did with &quot;Fast Carriage&quot;) or go \nin and edit the description of the folder to change it from \nunfinished to (yeah!) FINISHED.\n\nI posted up what I had completed so far in one big file for each \nstory.  If I ever get to write again, you&#39;ll see individual chapters \ngo up for &quot;Yasou,&quot; since they&#39;ll be uploaded as I write.\n\nPlease bear with me as I try to keep things easy to access \n(especially as newcomers arrive) and easier for Barb and others to \ntransfer to the website archive.  I know it&#39;s a lot to take in all at \nonce, but once you start doing it, it&#39;s a snap.  I&#39;m putting my stuff \nup not because I want to reap hordes of praise, but because I know I \nhave the author&#39;s permission (I hope), it&#39;s a learning exercise for \nme, and it can provide examples of what can be done with our limited \nresources here.\n\nphil\n\n\n"
