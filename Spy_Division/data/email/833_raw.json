You are the second person who \n survived reading my amateur work ::teeehehehehehe::\n \n I have finished the entire website and uploaded video trailers for \n the chapters too.  Please see the vids...everything is factual.  I \n highly recommend it for people who want the history [under the story \n section] but not the &quot;boring&quot;. The story is full of details about the \n Meiji Era. \n \n This story is long, but not boring.... (^_-) around 70K the actual \n length is 75K but I think this is due to the footnotes etc...\n \n http://silapajarun.1happyturtle.com\n \n The story is based on the original character named Ono Suzue a man \n born into the samurai rank of Satsuma-han.  His peculiar name is \n explained in the story, as Hirotada Tokugawa (M) pointed out it is a \n soft (woman&#39;s) name.\n \n There is varied forms of sexuality and that&#39;s the reason why only \n people 18 and above should read it...so if you want it email \n silapajarun(a)1happyturtle.com.\n \n Fujita Goro, again, is not based on an established universe, this is \n my independent interpretation.\n \n The chapters:\n \n I.    THE PET RABBIT, covers Boshin 1868 and Aizu especially. Fujita \n Goro (I spelled it Gorou in the story) will also appear as Yamaguchi \n Jiro. (theme:childhood)\n \n II.   SLEEP ON THE SEA, the Iwakura Mission of 1871 starring Okubo \n Toshimichi and Mori Arinori (fictionalized as Moriyama Arinori) \n (theme:formative years)\n \n III.  RED ON BLACK, you enter the Imperial Palace, 19th century \n spiritualism and the campus of Yale University starring Yamakawa \n Kenjiro (Yamagawa Kenziro) (theme:young adult)\n \n IV.   MEASUREMENTS you go to a time right before THE PET RABBIT and \n also learn more about the Fujita Family starring Fujita Tokio in a \n minor role and discusses the Numazawa adoption (theme:family)\n \n V.    TINTED GLASSES the death of a man of talent, the biography ends \n and the &quot;blossoming&quot; of the Meiji Era truly begins... (theme:death)\n \n --- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nefret_nubti&quot; \n &lt;nefret_nubti@...&gt; wrote:\n &gt;\n &gt; Your story was GREAT !!!! I enjoyed reading it !!!\n &gt; And I wanted to appologise for the info I gave you. It wasn&#39;t\n &gt; incorrect or anything but if I knew what time period you were \n working\n &gt; with I would have given you what was known about Sobek at that time,\n \n \n     \n                       \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBoardwalk for $500?
