I just finished reading your fic (the \nfirst PMK fic I ever read and it was wonderful) and I think Saitou \nwas a better choice than Hijikata. First I don&#39;t think the PMK \nHijikata would really do/say what Saitou did in your story. Second \nbecause if you used Hijikata, we will not hear of Ayunee&#39;s mother \nwhich I think was a good inclusion. Third because wasn&#39;t Hijikata in \nreal life a playboy? Fourth (and this might not be important), I LOVE \nALL INCARNATIONS OF SAITOU-SAMA.\n\n\n&gt; The innocence totally escaped me I thought he was just trying to \ntease \n&gt; them, but you know a &quot;&quot;virginal&quot; Saitou & the older woman would be \n&gt; interesting, ne?\n&gt; \n\nMuch much interesting... It&#39;s almost comical when I think about a \nvirginal PMK Saitou. He&#39;d probably take out those prayer beads as \nsoon as the lucky woman starts to reveal herself. Now that literally \nwould be a show stopper. :OP\n\n\n"
