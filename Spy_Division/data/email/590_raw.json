I happened to read the manga and see the anime episode \nconcerning the haiku at about the same time.  Hopefully, I will soon \nbe able to stop giggling madly whenever I see a french fry or a dill \npickle at the lunch table.  It is starting to make my co-workers a \nlittle nervous.\n  \n     So, in saner moments, what I am wondering:  was his haiku really \nall bad?\n\n      I remember studying the boys in baby blue in school, but there \nwas not mention of the haiku.  I have only seen the 1998 TV series and \nit was only mentioned in passing there.  I think Kondo&#39;s comment was \nsomething like &quot;....well you are improving...&quot;\n\n      I know very little about haiku, so any info. would be welcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
