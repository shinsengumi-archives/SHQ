(This is what I get for ignoring LJ lately).\n \nThere&#39;s a new RK musicvid out by a very talented person.  It&#39;s called &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; and it&#39;s by schwarefee (better known as kuroiyousei, aka Black Faery).  Extremely well done... I really don&#39;t expect anything less than excellent from her in anything she tries her hand at.  It&#39;s her first musicvid and she&#39;s really looking for some feedback and any encouragement to keep putting time into making musicvids.  Yeah, it&#39;s yaoi-inspired, but doesn&#39;t have to be taken in that perspective.  It&#39;s as much about the tentative friendship between two opposites who really aren&#39;t opposites at all.\n \nhttp://www.animemusicvideos.org/members/members_videoinfo.php?v=39760\n \nPlease take a look and give kuroiyousei an honest opinion of the piece.  She&#39;s a wonderful person who puts a lot of time and love into making us RK Saitou fans happy.\n \nphil\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun.
