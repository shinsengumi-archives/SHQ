Nice work here Sec! LOL!!!! I love that you include Nakano-san \nand hai Kondou-san is precious (yes yes I&#39;ve adopted the guy). \nNagakura tattling is a hoot... And of course we all know who \nthe &quot;Man in black&quot; is. LOL! Love the almost caustic air of this \npiece (including description)...\n\nOh with Saitou like that, it reminds me of one of my SaiSano \ndoujinshi here.. \nhttp://hajimenokizu.com/doujinshi/album03/Kamata_Koushinkyoku\nAlthough the Saitou in that dj lacks the fear of change and \ninsecurity for some reason... hehehe...\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; If COPS, Comedy Central&#39;s RENO911! and TNT&#39;s WANTED all got \ntogether \n&gt; and had a baby...and gave that baby a sword(s)... it would be \n&gt; Kyoto911!\n&gt; \n&gt; set in a strange alternate universe in a hybrid city resembling \nLos \n&gt; Angles, Tokyo/Kyoto, HOng Kong and San Francisco.  The New New \n&gt; Selection Group all live happily in a nearby suburb where they \nshare \n&gt; a communal bath (this was suggested by captain Takeda) and to \nbuild a \n&gt; sense of camaraderie they all have a chance to room with capt. \nTakeda \n&gt; atleast once a week on a rotating basis (this too was suggested by \n&gt; capt. Takeda).\n&gt; \n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/Kyoto911.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; If Kondou looks like he is about to cry that&#39;s because he knows \nhis \n&gt; men too well.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Okita after growing out of the purple hair and pet pig phase moved \n&gt; onto a J-pop look.  \n&gt; Itou-sensei originally was recruited to be a military strategist \n&gt; however he prowls the halls of their headquarters in his loose \n&gt; fitting (and tends to fall off during inappropriate moments) black \n&gt; crepe kimono and constantly poses for an imaginary camera.  \n&gt; Nagakura has been demoted several times for his tendency to run to \n&gt; Matsudaira Katamori and &quot;tattle&quot; as Kondou calls it.  He currently \n&gt; works at koban (police box) where he gives directions and \n&gt; occasionally holds up a stop sign for children crossing the street.\n&gt; Harada was assigned to guard and inspect the docks and search for \n&gt; illegal imported weapons.  Sadly, he has interpreted his seaside \njob \n&gt; as nothing more than a chance to play &quot;lifeguard&quot; for attractive \n&gt; female swimmers.  Occasionally he works overtime by applying sun \ntan \n&gt; lotion on the mentioned attractive females.  Due to the strict \ndress \n&gt; code he was not allowed to wander around in his swim trunks, \n&gt; therefore he adopted an old battered life jacket.\n&gt; Hijikata, while at his weekly salon appointment was called on an \n&gt; emergency and thus his hair was burned a nice corn blonde.\n&gt; Nakano Takeko is the leader of Aizu&#39;s Joushitai (Women&#39;s \nBrigade).  \n&gt; She was sent by Teruhime, who expressed grave doubts over her \nadopted \n&gt; brother&#39;s choice in men for the job, to inspect and report on the \n&gt; Shinsengumi.  Nakano Takeko has realized that her orders and \n&gt; suggestions are taken more seriously if she sports her bullet \nproof, \n&gt; extra shiny, sleeveless body tight armor.\n&gt; Lastly, the man Matsudaira Katamori calls to drive him to the \nnearest \n&gt; Starbucks for a green tea Frapacinno is Saitou Hajime. His quiet \n&gt; demeanor is a shield for his shocking insecurity and fear of \nchange.  \n&gt; Behind his back he is called horrible things like &quot;the unknown MIB \n&gt; agent&quot;.  He has refused to cut his long hair because one of the \nnew \n&gt; ladies at the emergency switchboard, Tokio an associate of Nakano \n&gt; TAkeko, likes his hair like that.\n\n\n\n"
