However, we \ndidn&#39;t finish enou=\r\ngh of the story to make a new installment of the \nShinsengumi radio talk sh=\r\now.\n\nSo pretend that this is a message on the Shinsengumi answering \nmachin=\r\ne...\nhttp://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/takedawhining.mp3\n\nnow Take=\r\nda turned to speak to a &quot;sensei&quot; who may be...Itou\n***films such as Gohatto=\r\n and the story which inspired it are all \nbased on rumors that Takeda was a=\r\n homosexual however, we honestly do \nnot know if that was the case. Further=\r\nmore, we do know that Kondou \nIsami did mention homosexual activity within =\r\nthe Shinsengumi in a \nletter to his friends...so who knows ::hehehehehe:::\n=\r\n\nScreencaps of IkeDIEya may be downloaded here\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com=\r\n/MFD.htm\n\n***Bunny \n&quot;Why does Pachi-kun have a band-aid all over his face? =\r\nAnd he also \ntook the lead!&quot;\n\nIt seems that the two kids who made the film =\r\nare huge fans of all \nShinsengumi universes. Their design for Nagakura was =\r\nprobably \ninspired by Peacemaker Kurogane&#39;s Nagakura who has a band-aid on =\r\nhis \nnose.\n\nThe creators of the movie really admire Nagakura who took their=\r\n call \non the Shinsengumi radio show &quot;Kyokuchou Hour&quot; (episodes can be \nfou=\r\nnd here http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm).\n\nAlso information we have on=\r\n Ikedaya is based on Nagakura&#39;s account \nso it is funny to have an &quot;exagger=\r\nated&quot; account by the captain of \nthe second squad.\n\n***Kikue Mugen\n&quot;You kno=\r\nw, I&#39;m motivated now to create something\nlike that&quot;\n\nI hope you do!

The digital camera would \nthen rotate around the suspended jelly =\r\n(and thread airbrushed out \nlater)...however the tripod for my camera was n=\r\not stable (kept \nsagging) and the images came out all a bit crooked so I to=\r\nssed those \nfiles. I had planned to have Kondou jump up and slice his attac=\r\nker \nand do a slow motion of the jelly sliding out of its container (as a \n=\r\nstand in for blood and guts)...I still wish I could do this scene \nhowever,=\r\n Kondou is now part of my tuna salad (he is just a boiled \negg you know).\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"
