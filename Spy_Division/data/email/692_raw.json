Well... remember episode 16-17 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;where =\r\n...the unforgettable Kichisaburou appeared in the Okita \n&gt;&gt;&gt;impersonator ar=\r\nc? Yes, yes, that&#39;s it. I vividly remember Toshi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;saying something to th=\r\nis effect: &quot;Souji? It can&#39;t be. He was in my \n&gt;&gt;&gt;room until late last night=\r\n.&quot; And then there were the naughty \n&gt;&gt;&gt;thoughts: what were they doing?\n\n\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;The fic is set in episode 17: just before the scene with Tetsu and \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sou=\r\nji enjoying the view of the night sky.\n\n\n\nAh, yes.  Souji&#39;s mysterious &quot;I c=\r\nouldn&#39;t get to sleep.  There&#39;s \nsomething that&#39;s been weighing on my mind.&quot;=\r\n  And then a minute later \nToshi saying &quot;He was with me in my room until la=\r\nte.&quot;  That was my \nfirst thought too - what were they doing that was now we=\r\nighing on \nSouji&#39;s mind?...\n\nThanks for the fic.  It fills in that mysterio=\r\nus gap in a fun way!  I \nespecially liked the bit &quot;unless the rest of the f=\r\nirst unit was \nwaiting just down the hall.&quot;  I&#39;m glad Toshi&#39;s thinking they=\r\n would be \nso loyal to their captain.\n\nAnd, a thanks to everyone who provid=\r\ned all the info and links during \nthe TB discussion.  I have a much better =\r\nunderstanding now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
