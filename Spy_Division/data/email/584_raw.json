I was born in L.A.\n\nAs for doujinshi the moderators here will answer your questions---we do have \nyaoi fans here.\n\nIf you can give me the webaddresses of Thai online bookstores which sell \nShinsengumi manga I would really appreciate it.  I can translate from Thai \nto English very well and I would love to share some scanlations to our \nlittle group.\n\nFor example, the later volumes of Kaze Hikaru, Burai, Peacemaker Kurogane.\nI have access to a great scanner at school so if I get the manga it would be \npretty easy for me.\n\nAlso I strongly believe that the novel Mibugishiden (which became the movie \nWhen the Last Sword is Drawn) is in Thai because as you know there is a HUGE \nmarket for martial arts novels in Thailand.  If you don&#39;t already know, \nMibugishiden is about...SAITOU HAJIME!  (^_^).  I&#39;m not sure if Thailand has \npurchased Mibugishiden yet for VCD distribution.\n\nYin dee tee dai ruu jak na kha,\n\nsecretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
