The word for &quot;makoto&quot; is embossed so that the word \npops out (as shown in the side view). He can wear wheatever shirt \nand pants over the plate, so\nI didn&#39;t draw them. The swords are contained in a &quot;dual shield&quot; so \nthere would be less hassle when trying to tie both swords to the \nwaist. It is basically a sheath with two openings for two swords. \nThe back view - the word &quot;makoto&quot; is printed on the back in black. \nSide view - here&#39;s a clearer\npicture of the chest armor. Cloth is attached to the sides so that \nit can be tied to his chest around the back. It is also lined with \nsoft cloth on the inside so that, at night, the cold steel would not \ntouch our hero&#39;s chest (and abs) and make him shiver. The shape is \ncurved to fit over a chest, so\nthat it can be worn comfortably. There is also a difference in the \npeak design - here, they are more in the form of ascending mountain \npeaks, instead of a flat mountain range design.\n\nAnd that&#39;s it! ^^ Thanks so much~!!!\n\n=====\nSaitoh Worship\n~Anime Mystique~\n\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secretarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:\n\nCONTEST PAGE\n&gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/contest.htm \n&gt; (scroll to the bottom) you may leave comments for the entry at\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumimb.com (go to the fanart section)\n\n&gt; **come on folks I have 3 prizes and 2 entries only!!! the deadline \nis\n&gt; December 5**\n&gt; \n&gt; THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO BE CREATIVE (^_^)\n&gt; \n&gt; email secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com\n&gt; or AIM = badgerturtle...\n\n\n\n\n"
