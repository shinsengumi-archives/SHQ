Ou=\r\nr squad leaders and members are very diligent about \nanswering calls for as=\r\nsistance and reports of crimes and they may not \nalways be able to see you =\r\nloitering outside the front gate (especially \nif your height falls below th=\r\nat of their waist).\n\nWhile our members take every effort to proceed with ca=\r\nution when \nanswering an urgent call sometimes accidents do happen and civi=\r\nlians \nmight be injured, however slightly.

The article in=\r\n \nquestion concerned an alleged runaway by the name of Himura Shinta a/k/a =\r\n\n&quot;Kenni&quot;.  I wish to assure this newspaper and your readers that young \nHim=\r\nura is by no means a runaway. The boy in question is in fact seeking \nrefug=\r\ne with my extended family after being severely mistreated by his \nabusive, =\r\nsake addicted adoptive father, who tried to keep him a prisoner \nin a seclu=\r\nded mountain retreat.\n\nKenni is currently in my employ (part time of course=\r\n considering his \ntender age) as a page and spends much of his time studyin=\r\ng kendo and the \nshamisen under the tutelage of an old family friend Sensei=\r\n Takasugi.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKatsura K.\n\n# # # # # # # # # #\n\nLocal News\n\nThe Fi=\r\nfth Unit under the command of Captain Takeda Kanryuusai was \nambused  late =\r\nSunday evening while on routine patrol.  Witnesses report \nthat twenty squa=\r\nd members were killed by a single assailant alleged to \nbe the reputed seri=\r\nal killer Hitokiri Battousai.\n\nWhile this reporter finds it hard to believe=\r\n that twenty of our elite \ntroops could be killed by a single man we are in=\r\nvestigating each and \nevery lead.  Citizens are encouraged to some forth wi=\r\nth any information \nno matter how insignificant it may seem.\n\n# # # # # # #=\r\n #\n\nEmployment Notice:\n\nThe Shinsengumi currently have openings for twenty =\r\n(20) men skilled in \nsword handling and general law enforcement duties.

I can&#39;t get\nenough of wearing them,=\r\n ,luckily I&#39;ve managed to incorporate my hobby\nseamlessly into my daily job=\r\n but I&#39;m afraid that might change\nsoon when I go on the night shift and hav=\r\ne to wear a dull black( no \nyummy silk components involved)  uniform. Can y=\r\nou offer any advice?\n\n---Nobody&#39;s brother.\n\nDear Brother--\n\nI strongly sugg=\r\nest that you find some other way to enjoy your hobby because\nsisters do not=\r\n like going to pick their favorite pink kimono for a date\nwith a certain da=\r\nshing eighth squad captain only to find that it has \nquestionable stiff, dr=\r\nied stains below the waist!\n\nDear Ayu-nee\n\nAll of my men are Ahous. What sh=\r\nould I do?\n\n-----WolfMan\n\nDear Wolfie:\n\nAhou Soku Zan.\n\nDear Ayu-nee\n\nI run=\r\n an elite group of samurai. I trained most of them. but I find I \nget no on=\r\ne&#39;s respect. They treat me like a kindly old man when I&#39;m not \nmuch older t=\r\nhan they are. What should I do?\n\n-Big Boss\n\nDear Boss:\n\n I don&#39;t wish to be=\r\n cruel but this sounds to me like a situation of your \nown making. Do you d=\r\nefer judgment to your second in command? Do you \narrange outings and harmle=\r\nss recreational activities for the men much \nlike a friend would do or do y=\r\nou rule them with an iron fist no matter what?\n\nI think you can turn this s=\r\nituation around but it won&#39;t be easy. You may \nhave to resort to tough love=\r\n and that means Seppuku----For Them! (except \nmaybe for certain third and e=\r\night squad leaders)\n\nDear Ayu-nee\n\nI am currently employed by an independan=\r\nt security firm here in Kyoto. \nPart of my duties include repelling certain=\r\n competitors of my employer \nbut a fanatical government sponsored faction k=\r\neeps getting in my way.\n\nHow can I get them to leave me alone and let me do=\r\n my friggin Job?! To \nbe honest we are both working towards the same goal b=\r\nut looking at the \nmatter from different perspectives.\n\n-Red\n\nDear Red,\n\nI&#39;=\r\nve always been fond of the kindness kills approach,\n\nbe friendly to your op=\r\nponents, invite them out for a cup of sake (well \nmaybe not the tall ones w=\r\nith the narrow eyes), be a pal, make them see \nhow alike you are and how mu=\r\nch your job means to you. I&#39;m sure with a \nlittle give and take on both sid=\r\nes you&#39;ll find common ground eventually.\n\n# # # # # # #\n\nNotice:\n\n Meeting =\r\nof Shinsengumi financial committee has been moved up to this \nFriday mornin=\r\ng to discuss excessive amount of company funds spent on \nsword sharpening e=\r\nquipment.\n\n----Hijikata\n\nLocal News:\n\nThere was a break-in last night at th=\r\ne Mitsubishi warehouse complex in \nthe city&#39;s south end. The investigating =\r\nunit fell that the burglar must \nhave been a youth or small statured adult =\r\nas the means of entry was a \nnarrow window in the building housing stock sl=\r\nated to be delivered to \nKeyaki&#39;s Womenswear and Cosmetics Outlet.\n\nA quick=\r\n inventory showed that the burglar attempted to make off with \nnumerous cas=\r\nes of White Plum Perfume but only managed to get a few \nbottles. Most of th=\r\ne merchandise was recovered a short distance away \nthough one of the cases =\r\nwas damaged causing some of the contents to \nspill on the investing unit&#39;s =\r\ncaption one  Saitou Hajime.\n\n# # # # # # #\n\nOther Local News\n\n A number of =\r\nShinsengumi members of the Third Unit were officially \nreprimanded for verb=\r\nally harassing their direct superior by &quot;making \njokes&quot; about his &quot;Smelling=\r\n as fresh as a just picked white plum&quot;.\n\nCoincidentally that night a fire b=\r\nroke out in the barracks housing the \nmen of the Third Unit.  An anonymous =\r\nwitness reported seeing a black \nclad man hurrying from the scene muttering=\r\n &quot;The heat will kill them....&quot;\n\nFurther official investigation is pending.\n=\r\n\n# # # # # # # # #\n\nDear Ayu-nee,\n\nI relocated to Kyoto following the death=\r\n of my fianc=E9 at the hands of an \nunknown mugger. I&#39;m a girl used to nice=\r\n surroundings and the finer \nthings in life but since coming here the only =\r\njob I could find was as a \n*groan*\n\nmaid to a bunch of smelly swordsmen at =\r\na small futon and breakfast.\n\nAs if that isn&#39;t demeaning enough now I&#39;m bei=\r\nng told I have to babysit a \nfifteen year old kid to keep him off the stree=\r\nts and out of trouble. \nThis is worse than having to look after my obnoxiou=\r\ns little brother! Help!\n\n----Plum Crazy in Kyoto\n\nDear Plum\n\nWe all go thro=\r\nugh frustrating times in our lives. This kid might not be \nall that bad onc=\r\ne you get to know him. My advice is to just grit your \nteeth, go along with=\r\n your boss&#39;s wishes, and try to make the most of \nit!  And don&#39;t jump in fr=\r\nont of any swords no matter how trying it gets!\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n\n\n"
