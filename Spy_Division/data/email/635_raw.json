Longtime reader and lover of RK/Shinsengumi (go\nShinpachi!), new to the forum. Some of you may remember me as Gem-chan\nfrom over at RK Dreams. \n\nAnyway, I posted to .pdf articles over in the files section under\nwriting tips, Japanese terms and concepts. They are two articles I\nfound in my files in hard copy and then hunted down online. One is\ncalled Samurai Discontent and Social Mobility in the Late Tokugawa\nPeriod, the other, The Popularization of Samurai Values, A Sermon by\nHoshi Heishu. They&#39;re academic tomes, and slightly old ones at that,\nbut I find them to be interesting glimpses into the late Tokugawa\nperiod. They should have their copyright notices at the front of the\narticles, and as long as they are used for personal and non-commercial\nuse, then they are within the letter of the law. \n\nAll you nerds who read them, enjoy! :p\n\n-Gem-chan\n\n\n\n\n\n"
