And what if, ju=\r\nst what if the people who read what I write enjoy\nthe trip?  How fulfilling=\r\n would THAT be?\n\nAll right, where&#39;s my pen?  I&#39;m all motivated now to get s=\r\nome pairing\ngoing ^__^\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary=\r\n&quot;\n&lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s more weird is that we know the t=\r\nop brass of the Shinsengumi had\n&gt; relationships with females.  In some case=\r\ns we have names of those\n&gt; females and I&#39;d like to know if any Japanese res=\r\nearchers have ever\n&gt; followed up with finding those women&#39;s records (since =\r\nthey were\ngeisha).\n&gt;\n&gt; In the case of Saitou Hajime he had Aioi Tayu.\n&gt;\n&gt; B=\r\nut I think ultimately the audience finds the m/m possibilities to\n&gt; be more=\r\n tantalizing.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; But t=\r\nhe Shinsengumi weren&#39;t the only group from that era who got\n&gt; the &quot;yaoi mak=\r\neover&quot;.  The Byakkotai&#39;s narrative as told by:\n&gt;\n&gt; Heise, Richard. Ueber Lo=\r\nyalit=E4t in Japan;\n&gt; umgearbeitet nach einem Vortrag ...\n&gt; B=F6hm.-Krumau =\r\n1931 (72 pages)\n&gt;\n&gt; also has homoerotic touches.  This is based on an inter=\r\npretation I\nread\n&gt; where Heise describes the bodies of the youths falling o=\r\nn one another\n&gt; in a very &quot;literary&quot; way which may imply homoerotic bonds b=\r\netween\n&gt; them.  I don&#39;t read German so I wouldn&#39;t know for sure and I don&#39;t=\r\n\nhave\n&gt; specific page numbers in Heise&#39;s book where his writing seems to le=\r\nan\n&gt; that way.  Since Heise was writing in an era where it may not be\n&gt; pru=\r\ndent to fully express his interpretation of the Byakkotai he may\n&gt; have jus=\r\nt held back from going overboard.  Then again my understanding\n&gt; is that Ge=\r\nrmans attach homoeroticism to military groups so maybe he is\n&gt; writing from=\r\n his own cultural standpoint.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt;\n&gt; Now shameless plugging of a novella I wrote.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone in the m=\r\nodo for *DARK* m/m set in 19th century Japan and WI USA\n&gt; should try KATANA=\r\n DUET: Samurai&#39;s Forbidden Love. Coming soon to\nAmazon\n&gt; at the end of Sept=\r\n 2008 in print form but the e-book version published\n&gt; and distributed by B=\r\nOOKSTRAND.com is cheaper and more environmentally\n&gt; sound.  Some people kno=\r\nw me on the list as being a nerd, well this\nbook\n&gt; does have nerd stuff in =\r\nit but I call it historical details goodness\n&gt; which sadly I could not foot=\r\nnote in the text. (^_^)\n&gt;\n&gt; KATANA DUET is a very unique work which manages=\r\n to combine a touch of\n&gt; the Boshin War, the struggles of samurai after tha=\r\nt period,\nimmigration\n&gt; and an uneasy integration into an isolated area in =\r\nthe USA.  The theme\n&gt; of blood ties, attraction between the same blood is m=\r\nixed in with\n&gt; research into a mysterious disease (it is actually TB).  Exo=\r\nticism of\n&gt; Orientals is conveyed through the vehicle of the circus (WI was=\r\n the\n&gt; home of the travelling show).\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone wants to buy it....(sorr=\r\ny only 18+ readers will be able to\n&gt; purchase)\n&gt;\n&gt; (This site has bookcover=\r\ns which are NOT worksafe and geared for a\n&gt; female audience)\n&gt;\n&gt; contains b=\r\nook blurb, buy link and rated G and rated adult excerpt\n&gt; http://www.bookst=\r\nrand.com/authors/silapajarun/kd.asp\n&gt;\n&gt; FALLEN ANGEL REVIEWS ~ 5/5 Angels!\n=\r\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/5dowxz\n&gt;\n&gt; DARK ANGEL REVIEWS ~ 4 Pixies\n&gt; http://tiny=\r\nurl.com/6bd7fa\n&gt;\n&gt; BOOK TRAILER (rated-G and is worksafe and my attempt at =\r\ncreating a\n&gt; movie with just Windows Movie Maker)\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/=\r\nwatch?v=3D1nG_1YTJBjk\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
