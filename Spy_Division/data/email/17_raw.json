I had image folders in the files \nsection and she&#39;s absolutely right about wanting to keep them \nindependent.  SOOOO...  In the photos section you will find various \nalbums all sitting clean and new and ready to take images.  Just so \nwe can find things, the albums are:\n\nDoujinshi scans --- images from doujinshi published by non-members \nyou find delightful or inspiring.\n\nDoujinshi Originals --- doujinshi created by members of the list.\n\nManga Scans --- same as for doujinshi, but for manga.\n\nManga Originals --- manga created by members.\n\nIllustrations --- scans of illustrations or calligraphy from books\n\nScreencaps --- captures from the various anime, films, and other \nmoving picture formats.\n\nSingle Originals --- the one-shots of the art world, pictures created \nby members that are meant to stand alone.\n\nAm I leaving out any other formats?\n\nIf you have a group of images (posting up an original manga or \ndoujinshi, for instance, would be in several separate uploads), \ncreate an album within the album it belongs in, giving your album the \ntitle of the piece.\n\nIn the next few days, the guidelines will change again... this time \noriented towards art.  For now, I&#39;m going to try to leave you guys \nalone, stop bugging you.  :-)\n\nRK &#39;Jime, pachi, phil... take your pick\n\n\n"
