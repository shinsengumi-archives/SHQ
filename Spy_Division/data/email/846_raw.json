The art should complement the stories or they can stand alone \nbut=\r\n must have a &quot;point&quot; to it---the author may explain in a \nparagraph &quot;why&quot; t=\r\nhey created the art. I know that all art is up to \nthe viewer to interpret.=\r\n..but if you photograph a drop of blood on a \nsheet of rice paper most peop=\r\nle would be clueless of what you are \ngetting at.\n\nI&#39;m inspired by this ide=\r\na because a friend and I outlined a hot yuri \nstory that is 100% original a=\r\nnd I think very fascinating. We would \nnever have an audience because it do=\r\nesn&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; in a universe. I also \ncompleted and now improving a twincest s=\r\ntory (the twincest part was \nsuggested, I was trying to submit it somewhere=\r\n), and I think it&#39;s \nreadable (after I improve it).\n\nI want to call this Im=\r\nagine 1800s Azia Anthology (I-1800s-A)\n\nBy explaining the title I hope to c=\r\nonvey the essence of the \npublication and why it would be a strong and succ=\r\nessful (maybe even \nPROFITABLE venture).\n\nI am not anti-fandom, but I am pr=\r\no-original. Absolutely no universe \nderived stuff. Period.\nThe reason why i=\r\ns because I want to sell this anthology folks. \nAdapting your fanfic involv=\r\ning lets say a hitokiri with an x shaped \nscar on his cheek, changing his n=\r\name and his hair color is just still \nripping off the original and easily r=\r\necognizable.\n\nBesides I really dislike how people snark about this and that=\r\n being \nOOC, or not accurate enough for the canon.\n\nSETTING\nThe reason why =\r\nthe title is (I-1800s-A) is because we don&#39;t need to \nmake all the stories =\r\nJapan centric. The characters can be any \nnationality. The Japanese travell=\r\ned abroad so the story can take \nplace in Europe, Africa and the United Sta=\r\ntes and other countries \nlike Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Siam. \n\nI=\r\n spelled &quot;Azia&quot; because I want to take fantasy-history. For example \nin the=\r\n Russo-Japanese war what if there was a super weapon being used \nby the Rus=\r\nsians or Japanese developed by a scientist? (Alternate \nUniverse) OR WHAT I=\r\nF THE QUEEN OF KOREA WAS NOT KILLED BY THE MEIJI \nGOV and there was an atte=\r\nmpt to invade Hokkaido by the Koreans using \na small fleet led by radicals?=\r\n SEe what I mean? Infinite possbilities.\n\nERA\n1800-1912 (end of the Meiji E=\r\nra, however you can make the story set \nin modern times and flash back to t=\r\nhe 1800s---most of the content \nhowever should be 1800s) If you enter the S=\r\nhowa Era just a bit that&#39;s \nfine but don&#39;t go overboard. If you want to do =\r\na time travel for a \nsamurai pre-1800s and put him in the Meiji Era that&#39;s =\r\nfine but please \ndo your homework. Japanese culture did change over time as=\r\n did the \nrole of the samurai.\n\nCONTENT/GENRE\nThere is so much in history t=\r\no inspire your fiction. However, there \nis no genre limit. I&#39;ll take histor=\r\nical fiction/fantasy, horror (oh \nman I luv horror), gothic, romance, comed=\r\ny, steampunk, fantasy and \nYES EROTICA (m/m, f/f, m/f and any combination. =\r\nNO underage kids, \nrape to arouse or entertain and bestiality, rape as char=\r\nacter history \nis ok, no scatalogical stuff or necrophilia to arouse the re=\r\naders \neither---shape shifters ok).\n\nBecause I&#39;ll take erotica, each story =\r\nwill be proceeded by a page \nwith a rating and warning. \nBy selling this an=\r\nthology I hope to prevent underage folks from \ngetting their hands on it an=\r\nyways. As for historical fiction there \ncan be varying degrees of accuracy =\r\nbut if you want to mention the \nname of the Prime Minister for a certain ye=\r\nar, please be sure you \nhave the right guy named in your text. If you are a=\r\n mega-history-\nresearcher type yes...yes you can include footnotes and bibl=\r\niography. \nReally GOOD edu-tainment is awesome but you need a plot and grea=\r\nt \ncharacters too.\n\nPOETRY\nI love poetry. I hate one word poems though. Tha=\r\nt&#39;s not a poem.\nPoems can be accompanied with art if you like.\n\nARTISTIC FR=\r\nEEDOM\nNo &quot;happily ever after&quot; required.\nIf you want to write horror and gor=\r\ne...go right ahead but there needs \nto be a motivation for all things.\nIf y=\r\nou write sexy stuff it better be ~HOT~\n\nART\nEach story gets a cover which t=\r\nhe writer can design herself/himself \nusing any medium as long as it is 100=\r\n% original. If you can&#39;t draw \nyour characters, fine with me, use symbols f=\r\nrom the story. Be \ncreative, look at professional book covers and see the v=\r\nariety of \nstyles. For example you can purchase photos from online vendors =\r\nand \nmanipulate the image etc. Just please don&#39;t grab a screencap from \nMib=\r\nugishiden, rip-off fanart from deviant art and call it your story \ncover. Y=\r\nou may work with an artist.\nYou can submit a graphic novel but please under=\r\nstand that pencil \nsketches will not look very good in print, nor will an e=\r\nffort to \nimitate the art style of another artist. If you don&#39;t \ndo &quot;manga&quot;=\r\n/&quot;anime&quot; style then don&#39;t force yourself. Be natural in \nyour art and let y=\r\nour own style emerge. Originality before mimickry. \nArt can be color or bla=\r\nck and white or as I said earlier, photos.\n\nGRAPHIC NOVEL\nIt&#39;s not always p=\r\nossible for an artist to complete 10 detailed pages \nof art or story, so I =\r\nwill even take a short story, some illustrated \npanels, and then the rest o=\r\nf the story. This allows the artist the \nfreedom to &quot;fuse&quot; more than one mo=\r\nde of story telling!\n\nLENGTH\nNo minimum wordcount, however the cap is at 30=\r\nK (Novella length). \nEach story must be complete because this is a one shot=\r\n anthology \ndeal...no series/(to be continued).\n\nQUALITY\nEach work must be =\r\ncomplete and nearly ready to publish. Dont&#39; turn in \na manuscript and then =\r\n2 days later turn in a different version \n(that&#39;s really confusing). Once i=\r\nt is edited it will be returned to \nthe author who must complete edits and =\r\nturn it back in ASAP. AFter I \nread it the first time...then you can propos=\r\ne changes in the LAST \nDRAFT if need be.\n\nThis is going to be high quality =\r\nstuff so please no glaring grammar \nerrors. If you write a fantasy and give=\r\n a chara a special name, be \nsure there is some consistency to your names a=\r\nnd the &quot;rules&quot; you \nestablish in the fantasy story.\n\nI&#39;m a pretty hardcore =\r\nperson (ok it&#39;s taking forever for me to \nrelaunch SHQ.com but believe me t=\r\nhere is a lengthy explanation for \nthat---and I lived on P&J sandwiches for=\r\n a month and it nearly killed \nme I had no energy to do much)----but I know=\r\n what I can manage and \nI&#39;m pretty driven to get things done.\n\nI don&#39;t like=\r\n flakes. Don&#39;t tell me &quot;I&#39;ll turn in my story tomorrow&quot; \nand then not turn =\r\nit in. I don&#39;t like that. I also check my email \ntwice a day atleast so you=\r\n will get a response from me unless I am on \nmy death bed or something is w=\r\nrong with my internet. In other words, \nI&#39;ll work just as hard as you will =\r\non this project.\n\nIf I read your story and say this or that part is confusi=\r\nng or needs \nimprovement don&#39;t take it personally. I&#39;ve been rejected so ma=\r\nny \ntimes for the same reasons and any weakness I see in your work is \nprob=\r\nably in my own as well. The goal is to make every page of this \nanthology a=\r\nwesome.\n\nWHAT&#39;S IN IT FOR YOU?\nFame. Fortune ofcourse!\nNo not really. You d=\r\no get a venue to showcase your talent.\nThis is what I want to do: If I get =\r\n10 stories, art etc and determine \nthe page count or word count I&#39;d like to=\r\n get it published by Lulu.com \n(now for my friends who are real professiona=\r\nl writers and artists you \nmust sympathize that it&#39;s a pain to get a major =\r\npublisher to accept \nanything). Submitting to a major e-pub means you can w=\r\nait weeks for \nthem to read it, reject it, and if its contracted you wait f=\r\norever to \nget your %.\n\nAs the anthology sells (translation, your mommy and=\r\n daddy buys one \ncopy) and the money comes in, it is split between all cont=\r\nributors. \nFine details of the % split between author and writer will be \nn=\r\negotiated once I figure out who is interested. We can even setup a \nchat an=\r\nd yell at each other and figure stuff out.\n\nSo you ask...how will this anth=\r\nology be promoted?\nWell...that&#39;s where you come in.\nI am the webmaster for =\r\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com (basically when \nthe site is done, I&#39;m actuall=\r\ny going to celebrate by doing some \nart/writing by focusing on this project=\r\n!). So yeah, I am DYING to see \na new take on the Shinsengumi! \n\nSo when th=\r\ne anthology is done, I put up a tiny link from SHQ to the \nLulu.com page se=\r\nlling the anthology. Those of you dev-art or \nfanfiction.net or adultfanfic=\r\ntion.net accounts should be pimping this \nanthology when it is done.\n\nIn ot=\r\nher words I-1800s-Azia is a &quot;cooperative&quot; where you put in the \ntime and wo=\r\nrk and maybe you may get enough money to buy some tea at \nstarbucks or some=\r\nthing.\n\nWhatever happens, you&#39;ll get an anthology in your hands you can be =\r\n\nproud of.\n\nDEADLINES\nPlease email me at secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com fo=\r\nr \nproposals/questions by August 1st\nIf no one is interested that&#39;s fine. \n=\r\nI got a whole bunch of ideas and I&#39;ll do this on my own (^_^). I have \nstuf=\r\nf which would be good on adultfanfiction.net but it&#39;s mixed in \nwith nerd s=\r\ntuff and people there don&#39;t like that. I can&#39;t fit on \nfanfiction.net becau=\r\nse my work is original so I&#39;m in artistic \npurgatory or something.\n\nLASTLY\n=\r\nI&#39;d even want this anthology on a CD because I would think it&#39;s cool \nif pe=\r\nople did audio stories or read their poetry but I don&#39;t think \nthat is poss=\r\nible. \n\n\n\n\n"
