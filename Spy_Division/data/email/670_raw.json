Here&#39;s yet another=\r\n \ntake on why Souji did what he did.\n\n&gt;&gt;Any comments on the above? Yes? No?=\r\n Anyone found the last part \nconfusing? It is supposed to be confusing: the=\r\n reader is supposed to \nbe as muddled as poor Souji.I would find other alte=\r\nrnatives to \nwriting such death scenes refreshing, so do send me ideas, or =\r\neven \nbetter, write them and publish on ff.net. I know Souji is supposedly =\r\n\nvery close to Toshi, but Toshi wasn&#39;t there when he died, period. The \nbig=\r\n question is why.\n\n&gt;&gt;Please review if you reading this, all 127 of you. The=\r\n number is \nquite constant,I realise. I think it is because of the small nu=\r\nmber \nof fics in PMK. Everyone reads everything, but there are so few \nrevi=\r\news!\n\n\n\nOkay, maybe now would be a good time for someone to give an \nexplan=\r\nation of the black cat.  That black cat showed up several times \nin Peacema=\r\nker (was it always the same one?) as well as a white one.   \nThe black cat =\r\nis given a brief mention in the new Hillsborough book \n(He wrote that Souji=\r\n tried twice to kill the cat, but was too weak, \nand Souji&#39;s last words wer=\r\ne &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;) And we saw \nSouji trying to get the cat in =\r\nThe Last Swordsman too. Is that it, or \nis there more to the cat story?\n\nI&#39;=\r\nm assuming that the question about Toshi is, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t spending \nSouji&#39;s la=\r\nst days with him be more important than continuing a losing \nbattle?&quot;  Hmm.=\r\n..  In our world of fanfic - Of course, Our Toshi would \nmove mountains to =\r\nbe with Our Souji.  But, in reality would Toshi \nwant to keep fighting for =\r\nwhat they set out to do five years \nearlier?  Would he be dishonoring his c=\r\nomrades who died during this \nyears long journey to Kyoto and back?  Would =\r\nSouji be fighting at his \nside if he wasn&#39;t sick? And, TB is contagious.  L=\r\nots of questions.  \nSounds like some good speculative fanfic here!  (Hint, =\r\nhint to all \nour writers.)\n\nI read all the PMK fics and don&#39;t review.  Guil=\r\nty as charged.  I \nappreciate all the talented writers sharing their work a=\r\nnd in the \nfuture will let &#39;em know!  \n\nThanks for the story Divertimento, =\r\nand yes, I am confused!\n\n--zhusanna \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
