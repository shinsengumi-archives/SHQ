After the fight, Suzu and Yoshida are walking up a long \nstairway and two women are walking down.  Yoshida steps aside to let \nthe women pass and Suzu says something like, &quot;You&#39;re so kind, \nmaster.&quot;  Then the white cat runs across their path.  \n\n                You are simply amazing. I didn&#39;t notice that at all.\n\nThe book is Shinsengumi: The Shogun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps by Romulus \nHillsborough.  ISBN 0804836272 \n\n             Thanks.\n\nI found that part of the book quite sad.  Hillsborough cited the \nwoman who was looking after Souji as the source of the information.  \nHillsborough wrote that three days before he died, Souji felt well \nenough to get out of bed, went out to the garden and tried to kill \nthe cat with his sword, but was too weak.  The next day he tried \nagain and failed again and was very distressed that he was unable to \nkill the cat.  Then the next day (the day he died) is when he \nsaid, &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;  So sad.  One of the best \nswordsmen in the Shinsengumi unable to beat his illness and being \ntormented by that cat.  That&#39;s why I wondered about why the cat kept \nshowing up in Peacemaker.  Didn&#39;t know if Souji had some history \nbefore with a cat...\n\n            Yep. What is his history with the cat? I think PMK introduced the black cat for that purpose. In the PMK universe, I am betting it has something to do with Sannan, Suzu and Tetsu. But the next book wouldn&#39;t be out for a looong time... \n\nHmm...1862.  Before they left for Kyoto.  Are you suggesting that he \ncontracted TB from someone we know?  \n\n \n\n          Um... That&#39;s a fantastic idea! It never occured to me! Will take note of that. But... haha... I was thinking maybe, just maybe, quite a number came down with the first attack the first time. Usually, such attacks are relatively mild and in young healthy individuals would present as little more than a worse than normal flu. After that, most would recover fully with the bacteria latent in the body, while for a select few... well.\n\n \n\n          Just my take on why only Souji got TB despite living in close quarters with other men.\n\nMany questions....\n\n\n          They are very intriguing ones...
