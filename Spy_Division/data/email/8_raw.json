Hey,\nit was the Revolution, for crying out loud! There _was_ blo=\r\nod flowing\nin the streets and secret trysts in inns and teahouses! Ehem...r=\r\night.\nDisclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not based on anything=\r\n.\nYou _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I will get the entire\nShin=\r\nsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan you mercilessly.\nThank you=\r\n.\n\nChapter 2\n\nKyoto\nGenji 1 (1864), June 20th\n\nAs Hiro found out, he and Yu=\r\nki hadn&#39;t landed far from the Yagi\nestate-- probably only about a couple bl=\r\nocks away. He was glad they\nwere that close, for Yuki&#39;s sake, as she didn&#39;t=\r\n seem too likely to be\nin a calm enough state to hike very far.\nHis first i=\r\nmpression at realizing where he was, was that the 1860s\ndidn&#39;t smell as goo=\r\nd as he&#39;d imagined. Despite the extreme cleanliness\nand cautious sanitation=\r\n common to any major Japanese city of those\ndays, there was still the smell=\r\n of dirt and mud in the air. The sky\nseemed bluer, though, and the visibili=\r\nty was excellent. He&#39;d read all\nabout it in his college textbooks, heard al=\r\nl about it from his\nfamily&#39;s stories, but he&#39;d never imagined it to be so=\r\n=85overpoweringly\nreal. He was there, in the textbooks, as history was bein=\r\ng written,\nwalking the streets with a troop of samurai. If the situation we=\r\nren&#39;t\nso grave, and the era not so bloody, he might actually have taken the=\r\n\ntime to better soak in the atmosphere.\n&quot;Here we are. Shinsengumi headquart=\r\ners,&quot; said the wolf-eyed man,\nindicating the gateway with a tilt of his hea=\r\nd. &quot;Please follow me.&quot;\nAs he led them through the gate, Hiro remembered the=\r\n force that had\nbrought them here, and felt a chill run down his spine. Gri=\r\ntting his\nteeth, he did his best to put the past behind him, and followed t=\r\nhe\nwolf-eyed man into the main courtyard.\n&quot;Welcome back, Saitou-san!&quot; calle=\r\nd a man who had just emerged from one\nof the rooms. He was about the same h=\r\neight as wolf-eyes-- Saitou-- but\nlooked much younger, with childlike featu=\r\nres, almost too young to be\nholding the katana in his left hand.\n&quot;No time f=\r\nor that, Okita-kun! Go get the doctor, and tell Hijikata-san\nthat I have bu=\r\nsiness with him.&quot; Okita nodded curtly, and dashed off,\nreturning momentaril=\r\ny with the Yagi family doctor and a couple of\nmaids, before dashing off in =\r\nthe other direction to find Hijikata.\n&quot;Clean this woman up and check her fo=\r\nr any injuries if you would,\nsensei.&quot; He nodded, and gestured for Hiro to l=\r\net go. &quot;It&#39;ll be\nalright,&quot; Saitou reassured him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. She&#39;s in goo=\r\nd hands.&quot;\nReluctantly-- very reluctantly-- Hiro let go of Yuki, who was pro=\r\nmptly\nled away by the doctor and maids.\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Saitou repeated, bri=\r\nnging Hiro back to full attention.\n&quot;Now let&#39;s go see Hijikata-san, and clea=\r\nr this business of Masuda&#39;s\npeople up.&quot;\n&quot;Y=85yes of course, Saitou-san.&quot; As=\r\n the mist cleared from his mind, Hiro\nput two and two together. Saitou=85a =\r\nleader in the Shinsengumi=85Saitou\nHajime! The legendary Shinsengumi third =\r\nunit captain! And Okita=85must\nbe Okita Souji, the first unit captain! And =\r\nHijikata=85Hiro shivered in\nmild horror at the name. Hijikata Toshizou Yosh=\r\nitoyo, the Shinsengumi\nvice-commander and &quot;demon&quot;. Originally the son of th=\r\ne farmer, he was\nadopted into a samurai family, and soon became an expert a=\r\nt\nswordsmanship. Known for his cold and cruel manner of leadership, he\nwas =\r\nfeared by all, friend and foe alike-- and yet, loyal to the last,\nhe fought=\r\n to the very end of the Bakumatsu period, finally dying of a\ngunshot wound =\r\nat the Battle of Matsumae Castle in Hokkaido. That day,\nhowever, lay some f=\r\nive years into the future.\nSaitou halted abruptly next to a sliding door, a=\r\nnd slid it open with\none hand, bowing. &quot;Hijikata-san. Sorry to keep you wai=\r\nting.&quot; He nodded\nto Hiro, and they entered together. &quot;Saitou-san. Have a se=\r\nat, please.\nYou as well,&quot; Hijikata said, motioning to Hiro, who sat along S=\r\naitou,\nfacing the vice-commander.\n&quot;Now, what did you do about those three i=\r\ndiots?&quot; asked the\nvice-commander abruptly. That&#39;s something the historians =\r\nwere right\nabout, thought Hiro. Hijikata&#39;s cold, cruel, calculating, and to=\r\n the\npoint=85\n&quot;We heard they were out drinking and causing trouble nearby. =\r\nHowever,\nwe hadn&#39;t counted on this man being there.&quot; Saitou pointed at Hiro=\r\n.\n&quot;Masuda and the others tried raping his wife, and he killed two of the\nme=\r\nn in retaliation. We got there just in time and managed to stop him\nfrom ki=\r\nlling Onoda.&quot;\nHijikata stroked his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Onoda will pay duly =\r\nfor his\ncrime=97he has violated the first rule of our code, by behaving in =\r\na\nmanner unbecoming a warrior.&quot; He turned his cold gaze toward Hiro.\n&quot;Now, =\r\ntell me who you are, and why, if you are indeed a samurai, you\nhave no swor=\r\nds.&quot;\nHiro studied Hijikata intently, while trying to come up with a\ncoheren=\r\nt, believable answer that wouldn&#39;t get him instantly killed.\nThe books were=\r\n right-- he really was tall, almost above average.\nUnlike his only survivin=\r\ng photograph, where his hair lay untied, down\nto chin length, it was tied u=\r\np in a neat topknot. His features were\nfirm and commanding, exuding a twofo=\r\nld aura of immaculacy and\ncoldness. His photograph showed him wearing a Wes=\r\ntern-style suit, but\nseeing him here, dressed in a wide-sleeved kimono and =\r\ncrisp, clean\ngray trousers was more real, more powerful, in a way.\nHe knew =\r\nwell that he couldn&#39;t say who he really was, especially\nbecause someone of =\r\nhis clan, no matter what their rank, wouldn&#39;t be\nwandering the streets of K=\r\nyoto in this era, especially not without a\nsizable escort. But he couldn&#39;t =\r\nthink of any other convincing alias.\nFinally, using the intricacies and see=\r\nmingly endless variations of\nJapanese names to his advantage, he decided to=\r\n tell the truth=85partly.\n&quot;I am Tokugawa Hirotada.&quot;\nHijikata&#39;s face visibly=\r\n became pale.\nHiro knew exactly what he was thinking: For members of the Sh=\r\ninsengumi\nto have broken the rules was bad, but for them to have done what =\r\nthey\ndid to a relative of the shogun might cost him his very head=85 \n&quot;Spel=\r\nled with different letters than that of the Shogun&#39;s name. As for\nmy swords=\r\n=85&quot; Hiro heard himself make up a story that even he partly\ndidn&#39;t believe:=\r\n he&#39;d been befriended by Masuda at a local teahouse,\nand had promptly begun=\r\n drinking with him. Somehow, Masuda had drugged\nHiro&#39;s drink, knocking him =\r\nunconscious, during which time he&#39;d stolen\nHiro&#39;s swords. Then Hiro had wok=\r\nen up in the street, seen Masuda and\ntwo other people trying to rape his wi=\r\nfe, who&#39;d come looking for him.\nSeeking to save his wife and defend his hon=\r\nor, Hiro had no choice but\nto kill Masuda and the other man, after which po=\r\nint Saitou had stopped\nhim. He also added that he demanded a new pair of sw=\r\nords in return for\nthe ones that Masuda had stolen.\n&quot;And,&quot; he added, rather=\r\n impulsively, &quot;I&#39;d like to join Shinsengumi.&quot;\nHijikata eyed him carefully f=\r\nor a moment, stroking his chin pensively\nagain. &quot;Tokugawa-san, I will grant=\r\n your request for a new pair of\nswords, as I am eager to make amends for th=\r\ne actions of these fools.\nHowever, to join Shinsengumi, you must pass an en=\r\ntrance exam, in which\nyou must engage in a mock duel with one of the upper-=\r\nranking members,\nsuch as myself, Saitou-san, or Okita-kun. Do you consider =\r\nyourself\nwilling to go through with it?&quot;\nHiro knew all about the Shinsengum=\r\ni&#39;s entrance exam-- how it involved\nfacing off in a practice duel with one =\r\nof the chief captains=97and that\nthough he didn&#39;t need to win to gain entra=\r\nnce, he would quite probably\nend up with broken bones. If successful, he al=\r\nso knew well that he ran\nthe risk of getting killed, especially in the tumu=\r\nltuous war and\ndefeat of the shogunate that loomed just over the horizon. H=\r\niro almost\npitied these men for not knowing what would happen to them=97tha=\r\nt Okita\nwould die in a hospital, a victim of tuberculosis at age 25, that\nH=\r\nijikata would die in battle in Hokkaido, and that Saitou would die of\nold a=\r\nge in the dawn of the 20th century, the victim of an\nalcohol-induced stomac=\r\nh ulcer. But despite all the history, the risks,\nthe names, dates, and plac=\r\nes involved, he guessed that he was probably\nin this time period to stay, a=\r\nnd that if he was to provide for his\nwife, he had to have a stable job and =\r\na place to live. Which the\nShinsengumi did offer its members=85\nThere was m=\r\nore to consider, as well. Assuming he survived the violent\nbloodletting of =\r\nthe Bakumatsu period, he had very little to no chance\nof getting anywhere i=\r\nn the imminent Meiji government which\nsubsequently arose=97since he wouldn&#39;=\r\nt be able to explain his origin,\nand since he had chosen to ally himself wi=\r\nth his ancestors&#39; collapsing\norder and government. But he had no choice. Sh=\r\ninsengumi was the only\nway to go. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, staring straight into Hij=\r\nikata&#39;s eyes, and\ndoing his best not to flinch. &quot;Yes, I am willing.&quot;\nHijika=\r\nta cleared his throat. After quietly thinking to himself for a\nmoment, he n=\r\nodded curtly. &quot;I see. Very good.&quot; He raised his tone.\n&quot;Okita-san?&quot;\nThe slid=\r\ning door glided open, and Okita bowed politely. &quot;Yes?&quot;\n&quot;Get this man a new =\r\npair of swords immediately. See to it that he also\ngets a bath and a decent=\r\n meal. At noon, he duels me.&quot; Okita nodded,\nlooking somewhat amused at Hiro=\r\n&#39;s shocked expression. Hijikata turned\nback to Hiro. &quot;Tokugawa-san, you&#39;re =\r\nfree to go.&quot;\nHiro bowed, all the way to the floor mats. &quot;Thank you, Hijikat=\r\na-sama.&quot;\n&quot;Come on,&quot; urged Okita, smiling. Hiro got up and followed, hearten=\r\ned\nby Okita&#39;s calm demeanor.\nHijikata closed his eyes until Hiro left, and =\r\nthen, when he was sure\nthat they were gone and fully out of earshot, turned=\r\n to Saitou. &quot;Do\nyou trust his story?&quot;\n&quot;Partly. Masuda definitely tried to r=\r\nape his wife, but the story about\nthe swords seemed made-up=85&quot;\n&quot;Hm.&quot; Hijik=\r\nata nodded. &quot;Still, whether he&#39;s lying or not, we lost two\npeople today. An=\r\nd from what you tell me about the way he fights,\ntaking him in is an accept=\r\nable risk. We need people who fight like that.&quot;\nHe paused a moment, thinkin=\r\ng about how Hiro had fought for his wife.\nHe&#39;d seen different people fight =\r\nfor different things, but had never\nheard of a man who fought for love. Not=\r\n like this=85&quot;And besides,&quot; he\nadded, &quot;once he swears the blood oath to uph=\r\nold the Shinsengumi code,\nwe&#39;ll see just how much a man of his word Tokugaw=\r\na-san is.&quot;\nSaitou nodded quietly. &quot;Agreed. That always does show who the mo=\r\nst\nloyal members are.&quot;\n&quot;If he does make it in, then I&#39;d like to start him o=\r\nff in your unit,\nand then maybe move him up to the 2nd unit. If he really p=\r\nroves\nhimself, I might consider putting him in the first unit=85but we&#39;ll s=\r\nee.&quot;\n&quot;By all means,&quot; said Saitou. &quot;I&#39;d definitely like to see him in action=\r\n\nagain-- against revolutionary samurai this time. We need that kind of\nener=\r\ngy on our side.&quot;\nHijikata allowed himself a small, tired sigh. &quot;Agreed.&quot;\n&quot;I=\r\n&#39;m also curious to see what the commander will think of him,&quot; added\nSaitou.=\r\n\n&quot;Kondou-san? We&#39;ll see. He isn&#39;t quick to commenting on skill until he\nsee=\r\ns it with his own eyes.&quot; Saitou nodded in agreement.\nHijikata rose to his f=\r\neet. &quot;Well then, if you&#39;ll excuse me,\nSaitou-san, I have to go prepare for =\r\na duel.&quot;\n\n\n\n"
