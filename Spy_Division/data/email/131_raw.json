Anything that will entertain me is my motto. Yes I know I&#39;m very egoistic *grins*\n&gt;\n&gt;So is that all so bad? Should I change? *cries and runs away*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nApart from a few folks nobody reads my stuff\n either so you&#39;re not alone there.\n\nAnd you are _absolutely_ correct in going with what\n you feel is right in a story.  It&#39;s your story you\n are free to tell it your way. Now when someone or \nideally more than one person points out the same \nthing that strikes them as &quot;wrong&quot; then you probably \nshould go back and try to see it from their side. \nIf the change they suggest or the flaw they find makes\n sense to you then go ahead and change it--but only\n if you want to.\n\nThe thing about writing is that you&#39;re always learning little ways to make it better so just because someone has written 100 stories to your 10 it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that what they say is _the way it has to be_. \n\nYou get that a lot in the romance writing field their way or no way.  \nYeah well my first book broke a whole mess of &quot;their rules&quot; but a \nmajor publisher still liked it enough to buy. Of course \nthey rejected all but one thing since then but such is \nlife in the big city I guess.\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\t\n\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n\n"
