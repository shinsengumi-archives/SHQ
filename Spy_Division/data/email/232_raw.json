Saitou specifically from his\nbrother-in-law...so my guess is the family was closer to the\n&quot;mother&#39;s&quot; side...we don&#39;t have any recorded stuff from the Yamaguchi\nfamily at all other than S.H. (basic stats on mom, dad, brother and\nsister).\n\nI will always wonder if hist. Tokio was a widow.  She married Fujita\nGoro in her early 30s which to me seems kind of late for the time\nperiod.Is it possible that her first husband died at Aizu?  Her\nprevious marriage status may have been cleaned up just as Saitou&#39;s\nfirst wife is not mentioned in the Fujita Family Documents (-but- on\n3-hajime.com Yasou is categorized as an important figure in his\nlife...this is the webmaster&#39;s organization system and his/her\n*opinion* that Yasou DID exist...the article includes his/her\nopinions)...we must remember the family documents were cleaned up and\ndecades past before stuff was written.\n\nEntering the realm of Japanese messageboard speculation...(these are\nnot my ideas)\n\n1) no record of &quot;lively&quot; love between hist. F.G.. + Tokio...***this is\nconnected somehow with Jiro Asada/o&#39;s novel Mibugishiden (Transmission\nMibu Loyal Retainers)*** but since the movie ends -way- before S.H. is\nmarried maybe the author was interviewed or something? (odd)\n\n2) however F.G. + Tokio walked to work together?  &lt;&lt;&lt; many boards will\nsay this (babelfish) is clear on this...but on 3-hajime.com it is\nbased on a VERY VAGUE comment from someone, a student if I recall\nright, at the school...but again it is repeated from other sites not\n3-hajime.com...this is a very weak piece of info because they lived\nwithin walking distance to the school it makes sense to me for them to\ngo to work at the same time\n\n3) why are there no photos of Tokio + F.G.?  \nThis is because I think everyone is so used to seeing Tokio + son (she\nlooks awefully good for her age by the way)....to posters no photo =\nno love\n\n[another thing to ponder since he did receive a medal the order of the\nblue paulownia why didn&#39;t they take the occasion and have a portrait\ntaken?]\n\n4)another interesting comment...Tokio has a face which &quot;conveys\nsweetness&quot; and thus they HAD to love each other\n\n***there are sooo many fanfics of HISTORICAL S.H. + Tokio it is\ndownright scary...I would assume their fanfic would be in the RK realm\nbut the books on him must be so compelling that they would spawn\nfanfic...geez\n\n***some boards understandably will put a warning and say...history\nonly no anime/manga but then there are threads about historical fanfic\n\n***this is a one line comment I found so I didn&#39;t bother to put it on\nwww.shinsengumimb.com...there is a novel/series of articles published\nin Fukushima/Aizu about Saitou this may be a case of historical\nfiction or something (sadly no link to magazine or anything provided)\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Sheridan\n&lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I think you can&#39;t go wrong if you approach her from a slightly\nhistorical perspective. Tokio was a woman of the 19th century probably\nin an arranged marriage who more than likely came to love her husband\nas she grew to know him.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\t\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n"
