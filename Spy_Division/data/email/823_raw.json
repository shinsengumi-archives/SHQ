Bavier it is spelled =\r\nwith the -dash-)\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/DBT.jpg\nwhoever wants =\r\nthis novel --just email me and I&#39;ll give you the links-- \nthis was at one p=\r\noint one of the longest novels in the WORLD and it \nmade the Shinsengumi no=\r\ntorious in the late Meiji Era (when atleast a \ncouple of the Shinsengumi we=\r\nre still very much alive).  But to \nunderstand the novel you have to read t=\r\nhe intro the author wrote---the \nauthor was also a huge nerd (school teache=\r\nr and also T.A.ed as well)  \nthe story was pedantic but also pure PULP FICT=\r\nION WITH SWORDS...it is \nstill one of the best novels I&#39;ve ever read--truly=\r\n spectacular.\n\nboth these covers are part of my novel (yes! it&#39;s almost don=\r\ne...just \npolishing some scenes now--I&#39;m so excited!  I know when the story=\r\n is \ngood and done when I want to write parodies of it)...\n\nONO SUZUE: A MA=\r\nN OF TALENT* IN THE MEIJI ERA\nhttp://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/OSBanner2=\r\n.jpg [thank you Anne Cain \nof http://www.dragonsdisciple for providing the =\r\ncharacter sketch)\n\nIt does feature Fujita Goro (fictionalized as Fujita Gor=\r\nou)---his \nprivate life is emphasized in chapter 4 although he enters the p=\r\nlot in \nbook one and appears in all 5 chapters.  Where there is Gorou, ther=\r\ne is \nTokio...sigh...she practically dragged the laptop away from me.\n\n*the=\r\n phrase Man of Talent (or men of talent) was a real phrase used in \nbooks p=\r\nublished during the Meiji Era to describe two &quot;generations&quot; of \nmen.  The o=\r\nlder generation being the all stars of the IMperialist camp \n(Inoue Kowashi=\r\n/Kouashi, Ito Hirobumi, Okubo Toshimichi, Mori Arinori \ninterestingly those=\r\n who were more &quot;samurai&quot; like Saigo Takamori or \nYamagata Aritomo was never=\r\n described as such)--it was applied to men \nwho had toured the west and had=\r\n a very strong literary side.  &quot;Men of \nTalent&quot; was also applied to those w=\r\nho were just teenagers during the \nBoshin War and later on studied abroad a=\r\nnd returned to Japan to \nmodernize the country---it was a label used for at=\r\nleast 2 Aizu samurai \nassociated the Fujita family.\n\nThe phrase is so commo=\r\nn that it stuck in my head and I wonder how it is \nwritten in JAPANESE.\n\nIn=\r\n any case I was devastated when a coworker flipped through a print \nout and=\r\n said &quot;oh this is like the Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;.  After I \nscratched her ey=\r\nes out (I hated that movie, it was good in the \nbeginning then got old) I r=\r\nealized that the title does sound too much \nlike that Matt Damon flick (tha=\r\nnk Buddha Jude Law was in it).\n\nI would like to think my little story, whic=\r\nh spans the Boshin War to \nthe the 1880s is going to be pretty different...=\r\n.yeah different.  \nHorror + history of science + a dash of dirty Meiji Poli=\r\ntics + yaoi and \nstraight sex =3D over 60,000 words although I am editing o=\r\nut and revising \nnow.\n\n\n"
