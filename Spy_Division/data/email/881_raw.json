Naughty little story if you like &#39;sizzling=\r\n&#39; \nsamurai romance. It is so naughty it is rated M17.  A little too hot \nan=\r\nd hard for people younger than that. \n\nSo please come and take a peek at ho=\r\nw the site is looking.  Mind you, \nall we have up is the home page, but you=\r\n also can find information \nlinks on the site as well.  Just thought I&#39;d sh=\r\nare this now in its \nearly stages, and if you have comments or suggestions,=\r\n by all means, \nshare your samurai thoughts with us.\n\nOkay dokey?\nArigatou =\r\ngosaimasu.\n\n\n"
