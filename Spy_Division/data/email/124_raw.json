But th=\r\ney feel, think and act differently from women. Culture indeed has a lot to =\r\ndo with it,but the most important differences are strictly biological. They=\r\n have a way to approach things that it&#39;s just... different.Not better, not =\r\nworse, merely different.\nIf it helps of some consolation, they are at loss =\r\nwith us too.\nPhil&#39;s advice about reading books or magazines made by men fro=\r\nm a masculine POV is an excellent suggestion. And certainly her choice of M=\r\nishima is very appropriate in this context.\nConcerning characterizations an=\r\nd what MissBehavin says of getting someone else&#39;s POV when you are in doubt=\r\n about it and how it fit in your story, she hits right in the nail. This is=\r\n also a very helpful tip, indeed. \nAs much as it was said about getting a t=\r\nhorough beta reader, and if you can get more than one at once, even better =\r\nbecause you can make cross references in many points, and have the percepti=\r\non of the general reader most of the times, which helps in clarify some poi=\r\nnts that while can be perfectly clear to you, might be more than obscure fo=\r\nr the reader. (remember: you know the plot beforehand, and all those little=\r\n details that might lay in the background, unseen for the common eye).\nAbou=\r\nt editing, each one has his or her method. Personally, I do a very little e=\r\nditing while writing. Then I simply let it rest. After at least a couple of=\r\n days, I go again through it, and while I read, make the first major change=\r\ns (repeated words, wrong wording, etc). Then, I let it rest again. I go thr=\r\nough it again, and then I sent it to my beta readers (who, btw, usually go =\r\nalong the whole process from the initial version of each scene, and make th=\r\ne suggestions while I&#39;m writing the first draft). When they return it, I do=\r\n the second serious &#39;cleaning&#39; , I revise all the extra suggestions, and di=\r\nscuss them with my beta. and if everything is ok, then I post. If not, I re=\r\n-write the parts in question, and re send to the beta. at the end of the da=\r\ny, I can tell you the chapter by heart, with every comma and question mark.=\r\n\nSomething I forgot, but phil&#39;s comment reminded me: as inspiration strikes=\r\n in the more whimsical ways and moments, when a scene comes to you, write i=\r\nt. No matter it will be part of chapter 22 and you have just started the pr=\r\nologue.Later, when the story progresses, you surely will have to do rewriti=\r\nng to make it fit, and  also, to write the (damn) bridges to unite these  l=\r\noose chunks you&#39;ve been writing. Did I mention that I HATE bridges, I am se=\r\nverely allergic to bridges and I abhor bridges? Well, now you know. Hehehe.=\r\n.. In brief, sometimes, those  so called bridges between scenes or chunks c=\r\nan be real PITA.\nTake care\nFiruze\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From:  =\r\n spiritus_saitou \n  To: SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com   \n  Sent: Saturda=\r\ny, April 24, 2004 12:43   AM\n  Subject: [SHQ_Spy_Division] Something I   fo=\r\nrgot to mention...\n  \n\nThe idea of being a woman writing a man&#39;s point of  =\r\n view...\n\nThe fact is, it isn&#39;t just men who seem like aliens... just   bei=\r\nng \nhuman is enough.  ;-D  Amazingly, men are human.    They generally have=\r\n \nthe same hopes & dreams, the same fears, the same   basic needs of \nbeing=\r\n loved and secure... it simply often gets expressed   differently, \npartly =\r\nbecause of biology and partly because of   culture.  They live \nwith enormo=\r\nus pressure to be what society says   they should be just \nlike women do. T=\r\nhat those expectations are different   is really \nirrelevent --- think in t=\r\nerms of the kinds of stresses, the   hurts, \nthe insults, the frustration, =\r\nthe wishing it could be otherwise   that \nyou as a woman encounter when you=\r\n try to do something that goes   \nagainst what is generally expected or ass=\r\numed about women   \nculturally.  If for some very rare reason you&#39;ve never =\r\nencountered   \nthat, think of what women who were (and are) fighting for wo=\r\nmen&#39;s   \nrights have gone through.  Men have faced the same prejudices and =\r\n  \npains.  To feel & need is *human*... to want love, have children,   the =\r\n\nneed to cry, et al. is all human.  Don&#39;t get too hung up on   specifics \no=\r\nf gender and try to concentrate on the universal that speaks to   the \ncond=\r\nition of being human.  After years of studying male bonding   and \nintergen=\r\nerational relationships (starting back in the &#39;70&#39;s with Kirk   \nand Spock =\r\nfrom Star Trek), honestly, there&#39;s precious little that   \nmakes us differe=\r\nnt.\n\nDo some research if you feel uneasy about how   to handle writing a \nm=\r\nan&#39;s perspective.  Read stories or novels that   center on men \ninteracting=\r\n that touches on emotions and expression. Another   source \nis men&#39;s magazi=\r\nnes, where issues are addressed. Films and   television \nshows that explore=\r\n men and their feelings abound.  I just   finished \nwatching the latest epi=\r\nsode of a BBC drama called &quot;Take Me,&quot;   which is \nwhat reminded me I&#39;d forg=\r\notten to touch on this subject.  In   the end, \nafter years of denying hims=\r\nelf any intimacy with his father, the   lead \ncharacter finally accepts how=\r\n much he loves his father... how much   \nthe man means to him... and finall=\r\ny reaches out and just holds him   \nclose, eventually listening in his head=\r\n to the music you get the   \nimpression his father always listened to and s=\r\nlow-dancing with him on   \nthe sidewalk.  It was so beautiful, so real, and=\r\n so   human.\n\nI&#39;ve always been touched at the stories of Hijikata being a  =\r\n demon \npublically and, privately, alone at night, crying.  My sense is   t=\r\nhat \nSaitou was the same way.  I can understand that... can relate to   it.=\r\n  \nBoth expressions are a survival tactic... a way of staying   sane... of =\r\n\nremaining in control.  By the same token, look at the   raging emotions \na=\r\nnd fits of crying in samurai movies that ignite at the   first sign of \ndis=\r\ntress.  Men, women... it&#39;s all the same.  Some   are stoic, some are \noverl=\r\ny emotional.  I wouldn&#39;t worry whether or   not you&#39;re trying to \nthink in =\r\nterms of a character being &quot;a man,&quot; but in   terms of that \ncharacter&#39;s per=\r\nsonality... are you staying true to *that* as   opposed \nto gender.\n\nAnd if=\r\n this doesn&#39;t touch at all what you were   getting at, \nsorry...  :-D  I ea=\r\nsily misunderstand intent behind   broad questions \n(no pun intended).\n\nphi=\r\nl (who doesn&#39;t think she   knows how to write about women after 30 \nyears o=\r\nf writing about men, though   admittedly, slash/yaoi opens whole \nnew cans =\r\nof worms...)\n\nP.S.    Try reading some Yukio Mishima.  He does a lot of del=\r\nving into \nmen&#39;s   psyches... sometimes to the point I want to scream &quot;just=\r\n get on \nwith the   story!&quot;  (Thinking of &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot; and &quot;Forb=\r\nidden \nColors,&quot;   which I&#39;m currently reading, but psychological exploratio=\r\nn \nseems to be one   of his hallmarks in all his fiction... and he&#39;s \nwriti=\r\nng from a Japanese   perspective, though again, it&#39;s actually   \nuniversal.=\r\n)\n\n\n\n\nSHQ - Shinsengumi   Headquarters\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/\n\n=\r\nComing   soon:  SHQ - The Website\nhttp://www.shinsengumihq.com/\n\nSHQ   Spy =\r\nOffice -- SHQ LiveJournal\nhttp://wwww.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office   \n\n\n=\r\n  \n---------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
