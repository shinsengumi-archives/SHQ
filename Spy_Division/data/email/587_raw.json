It is based on homosexual activity in the Shinsengumi but I don&#39;t think it is perverted at all.  The story line is really good but all of the mine characters like Kondo, Hijikata and others are really old which doesn&#39;t seem right seeing that they were in their early 30&#39;s at that time.  I would recommend it if you can take two men getting it on.\n \nHope this helps\nMegumi-san\n\nYuki-san &lt;aishiterukouji@...&gt; wrote:\nIs Gohatto worth buying?

Archiving\n&gt; doujinshi poses a bit of \n&gt; a problem in two ways--space limits in the\n&gt; photos/files section and also \n&gt; since doujinshi is a form of fanfiction  the\n&gt; author&#39;s permission would \n&gt; be needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can handle some screencaps in the &quot;photos&quot;\n&gt; section but again space is \n&gt; a concern although if you have something that is\n&gt; very unique and not \n&gt; readily available I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love to see it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prepare yourself if you watch Gohatto--everyone is\n&gt; an ancient old man or \n&gt; pudgy and unattractive except for Kano, Okita and\n&gt; Tadanobu Asano** whose \n&gt; character name I can never remember.\n&gt; \n&gt; **I&#39;m sure Sec will correct me if I got his real\n&gt; name wrong too ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Barbara Sheridan\n&gt; http://www.barbarasheridan.net\n&gt; The Blog-- http://barbarasheridan.blogspot.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nI Love Kouji\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
