Many of the members have acheived\n          legendary status for their skill, honor and devotion.

The main pairing is between\n          the young first captain, Okita Souji, and his vice-commander,\n          Hijikata Toshi, but practically all of the well-known members\n          have their own stories... and plenty of steamy love scenes\n          interspersed with the fighting and intrigue the Shinsengumi\n          were known for.\n\n          http://sanada.from-beneath-you.net/soshite/index.html\n\n\n\n-- \nBarbara Sheridan\nhttp://www.barbarasheridan.net\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
