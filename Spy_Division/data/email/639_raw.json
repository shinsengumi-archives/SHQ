Of course the main pull for me is the setting and \nthe Shinsengumi, even if I am out of the age group you mentioned... \nLOL! \n\nAs to whether it&#39;s ebook or not, my opinion on that when it comes to \nprice is ebooks should be cheaper than the paperback edition. Also \nwhat format would the ebook be? You can reach a lot of pocketpc/palm \nusers by making sure it&#39;s compatible with mobipocket or better yet \nMicrosoft Reader which I think has versions for both Desktop and \nPPC. However if it was available in my local store, then I&#39;d go out \nof my way to the brick and mortar store. It&#39;s nice to hold something \nsubstantial in my hand and not be bothered with opening the PC or \nreading it in a PDA. So if price isn&#39;t such a big difference and I \ncan get a hold of the paperback, I&#39;d get the paperback.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\n\n~Kizu\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, BarbaraSheridan \n&lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello everyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; Since the list has been pretty quiet I thought I&#39;d clog your \ninboxes \n&gt; with  a bit of a reader survey. I would love to hear from as many \nof you \n&gt; as possible--private email [bsher213(at)yahoo.com]may be best but \nhere \n&gt; might be fine if it&#39;s okay with Phil (?)\n&gt; \n&gt; The main question is--- Would you buy a novel set mainly in \nBakumatsu \n&gt; era Japan where the Shinsengumi appear as supporting characters?\n&gt; \n&gt; If yes, would it make a difference if the novel was geared for 16-\n22 yr \n&gt; old (highschool/college) audience as opposed to a more detailed \n&gt; &quot;serious&quot; historical novel?\n&gt; \n&gt; Would you buy such a novel in an ebook format or only the typical \n&gt; &quot;bookstore book&quot; format? What if it was a &quot;trade paperback&quot; which \n&gt; usually retail for about $10-$15?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a lot for your time.
