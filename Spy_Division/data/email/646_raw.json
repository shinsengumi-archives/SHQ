I would love to hear from as many \nof you \n&gt; as possible--private email [bsher213(at)yahoo.com]may be best but \nhere \n&gt; might be fine if it&#39;s okay with Phil (?)\n&gt; \n&gt; The main question is--- Would you buy a novel set mainly in \nBakumatsu \n&gt; era Japan where the Shinsengumi appear as supporting characters?\n&gt; \n&gt; If yes, would it make a difference if the novel was geared for 16-\n22 yr \n&gt; old (highschool/college) audience as opposed to a more detailed \n&gt; &quot;serious&quot; historical novel?\n&gt; \n&gt; Would you buy such a novel in an ebook format or only the typical \n&gt; &quot;bookstore book&quot; format? What if it was a &quot;trade paperback&quot; which \n&gt; usually retail for about $10-$15?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a lot for your time.
