I just thought about this after answering Tiffany&#39;s post on \nwriting...\n\nMany of you have been writing for a while and I know of at least one \nwho writes for a living, so I need your opinion.\n\nFirst let me establish that I hate creative writing in school, was \nmore of a math person. Now though, I write for enjoyment (primarily \nfor myself) and I write on whim. This leads to sometimes weird story \nlines in my chapters and no research whatsoever. Sounds real bad \nhuh? I try to be historically correct but sometimes my stories just \ndon&#39;t want it that way. I like alternate pairings. I like OOCness. I \nlike comedy (although am extremely bad at it). All of these appears \nin my writing. \n\nI never really think about my reader since only a chosen few would \nread my stories so I go with what I feel is right. Anything that \nwill entertain me is my motto. Yes I know I&#39;m very egoistic *grins*\n\nSo is that all so bad? Should I change? *cries and runs away*\n\n\n\n"
