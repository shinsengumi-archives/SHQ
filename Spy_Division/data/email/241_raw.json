The .jpg part got moved to the next line.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; http://www.hakubaikou.com/contributors/pechan/shinsenkenshin\n&gt;&gt; .jpg\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;Still won&#39;t work. Is this something you have to have a password or the like to enter? If so, I&#39;m not registered with them and that&#39;s the problem.\n\n\nHB&#39;s site does not allow direct linking to pictures.   The best way to go is through http://www.hakubaikou.com/contributors/pechan/fanart.html\n\nOr navigate from the top down, which is what HB prefers.\n\nRegarding the fanfic similarities - at some point fanfics begin to pull from the same sources of information.   Or one particular fanfic has such a tremendous weight or influence that subconsciously those ideas are incorporated into &quot;fanon .&quot; I think this is particularly problematic with fanfics that are written in this realm; where most of the authors are of a different culture and are reliant on websites and existing web-based knowledge.  I&#39;m sure if we were writing fanfics based in our own cultural sphere, the similarities would be less remarkable.   \n\nI&#39;ve seen a lot of confluence in a particular sect of fanfics lately and it is a bit perturbing... however, similarities are bound to occur, and one can only hope that no direct lifting of text or plot ideas does .    I have seen plagiarism at work however on ff.net and it has been blatant lifting of text.   It&#39;s rather irritating, but as we have no legal rights to our own fanfiction anyways, the best one can do is report it or leave -- as Angrybee stated -- a comment.   \n\nThe thing that bothers me more now is the overreliance on Internet research over other works.   I&#39;ve now discovered that a lot of pages are simply wrong in their translations or information.   It&#39;s very irritating to have to try to explain to someone who never uses the library that the internet isn&#39;t always completely factual.\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n"
