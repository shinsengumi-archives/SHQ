I love them! Would be great if you were selling them. \nI&#39;d l=\r\nove to have a Saitou one, but then again... He&#39;d get lonely so \nI&#39;d have to=\r\n get the entire group! LOL Wonderful!\n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secretarytocapt3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; So I&#39;m a day late...but=\r\n that&#39;s because I waited until the egg dye \nkits\n&gt; were on sale\n&gt; \n&gt; http:/=\r\n/1happyturtle.com/makoto/ShinsenEasterEggs.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; These Shinsen-Easter Eg=\r\ngs are actually actors in a student film \ncalled\n&gt; \n&gt; I-KE-DIE-YA\n&gt; \n&gt; whic=\r\nh is not yet complete because I&#39;m still constructing the set (my\n&gt; refriger=\r\nator)...as you can tell it is a low budget venture and the\n&gt; other actors a=\r\nre marshmellow peeps (which seem to be the favorite\n&gt; subject for many shor=\r\nt films).\n&gt; \n&gt; Wait?  Where&#39;s Okita?  Oh don&#39;t worry he&#39;ll be in the film t=\r\noo.\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Before projects =\r\nwhich take up to 3 days to complete I do various\n&gt; brainstorm collages in v=\r\nideo/audio format.  For I-KE-DIE-YA I did \nthe\n&gt; same thing \n&gt; \n&gt; [warning!=\r\n 17.6 mb of audio with no script]\n&gt; https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/we=\r\nb/DVDPROMOfinal2.mp3\n&gt; \n&gt; The film makers are students at the Aizu hangakko=\r\n (domain school)\n&gt; Nisshinkan (they are all 10 years old in 1864 so the mov=\r\nie will\n&gt; reflect their inexperience in movie making)...they have big plans=\r\n \nfor\n&gt; the movie and are planning a DVD release already---however they are=\r\n\n&gt; being monitored by Aizu&#39;s warrior women the Joushitai\n&gt; (http://www.shin=\r\nsengumihq.com/WB.htm). \n&gt; \n&gt; They make various obscure references to stuff =\r\nwhich will be cut out \nin\n&gt; the final version (just don&#39;t worry if it is al=\r\nl confusing).  So all\n&gt; of a sudden if someone talks about *Teruhime*--then=\r\n it is because \nthey\n&gt; are her otaku.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The discussion descended into =\r\na fanboy chatter fest which seems to\n&gt; parody every single fan discussion o=\r\nf multiple Shinsengumi universes\n&gt; including (RK and PMK). Like many &quot;serio=\r\nus&quot; fan discussions---it \ngets\n&gt; heated and nasty LOL!!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; *Incidenta=\r\nlly, Teruhime (Matsudaira Teruko) is -not- Matsudaira\n&gt; Katamori&#39;s wife---s=\r\nhe was his adoptive (older) sister. In the world \nof\n&gt; fiction it is fun to=\r\n have Katamori have a crush on her (after all \nthey\n&gt; aren&#39;t related by blo=\r\nod and she was beautiful).  Please direct\n&gt; questions on Teruhime to Hirota=\r\nda Tokugawa.\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt; I keep =\r\ntrying various methods to create a serious Shinsengumi film \nand\n&gt; I tried =\r\nto &quot;warm up&quot; by making a short Byakkotai vid (made with\n&gt; Windows Movie Mak=\r\ner--nothing fancy)\n&gt; \n&gt; there is a link to the .wmv file\n&gt; http://community=\r\n.livejournal.com/edo_meiji/18615.html#cutid1\n&gt; \n&gt; if you want to leave comm=\r\nents you may do so at the youtube.com page\n&gt; for the short vid\n&gt; http://www=\r\n.youtube.com/watch?v=3DY1IIo4o3beo\n&gt; \n&gt; Byakkotai Info\n&gt; http://www.shinsen=\r\ngumihq.com/byakkotaiinfo.htm\n&gt; http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
