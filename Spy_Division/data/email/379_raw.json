I also own all \n&gt; episodes/DVDs of each series and or movie. I am also interested in \n&gt; learning the history behind all the character whether they are in \n&gt; anime or not. For example, I am interested in learning more about \n&gt; Kawakami Gensai, the person for whom Kenshin Himura of Rurouni \n&gt; Kenshin was based upon.\n\n\nHey hey! Just wanted to say hi to you! It&#39;s a little quiet right now \nbut trust me it&#39;s only for now. Hope you drop by frequently and join \nthe yahoo SHQ mailing list.\n\n~wounds\n\n\n"
