Work at the same girls=92 school that his wife does, of cours=\r\ne.\n\n \n\nWhy did he end up there?  What does he do?  More curious still, what=\r\n happens when Saitou Hajime and a throng of teen-aged girls encounter each =\r\nother on a daily basis? \n\n \n\nThe only rule to this challenge is that a stor=\r\ny has to address the theme of the older, retired Saitou working at the girl=\r\ns=92 school that Tokio does --- something he did in real life. (Some of us =\r\nremember Tiffany telling us about him directing rickshaw traffic on rainy d=\r\nays and apparently one of his main duties was to do number-crunching.)  And=\r\n while the initial challenge was for it to be the personification of Saitou=\r\n in Rurouni Kenshin, it=92s open to any characterizations.  Information abo=\r\nut the historical circumstances should be available in the Files sections o=\r\nf miburo and/or SHQ, or ask specific questions to the SHQ ML.  Information =\r\nwill also eventually be available at the central SHQ website at http://www.=\r\nshinsengumihq.com/ as files and such get transferred over.\n\n \n\nThere is no =\r\ndeadline.  Upload stories as they=92re in progress or finished into the fol=\r\nder titled =93Saitou and the Girls=94 within the Story Archive folder under=\r\n Files on the SHQ Spy Division yahoo site, http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sh=\r\nq_spy_division/ .  If your story has several chapters, just create a new fo=\r\nlder for it with the story=92s title within the =93Saitou and the Girls=94 =\r\nfolder so all the parts stay together.  No limit on how many chapters it ca=\r\nn be.  Don=92t forget to include the header.\n\n \n\nAnd I=92d like to invite a=\r\nrtists to participate as well.  Stories aren=92t just told in words.  Manga=\r\n and doujinshi artists, you=92re challenged to participate as well.  Upload=\r\n your entries into the Photos section.\n\n \n\nWhether it=92s a written story o=\r\nr art form, don=92t forget to let us know it=92s available!  Either send a =\r\nmessage to the list or click on the notification button during the upload p=\r\nrocess.\n\n \n\nA copy of this challenge will be available in the Challenge fol=\r\nder.  I=92m also posting it up to the LJ.  If it generates any nibbles from=\r\n non-SHQSD members, I=92ll let you know.\n\n \n\nHave fun!\n\n \n\nphil (spiritus_s=\r\naitou@...) \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo=\r\n!
