I saw something on the main page about busine=\r\nss lists and files, and here again you mention group files, but I can&#39;t fin=\r\nd anything that says &quot;files&quot; or &quot;fanfic&quot; or &quot;fiction folder&quot; or anything of=\r\n the kind. While it&#39;s entirely possible that I&#39;m a) retarded or b) blind, I=\r\n find it very frustrating that this isn&#39;t more obvious when that&#39;s supposed=\r\n to be the major reason for the group. Or so the listing on Shinsengumi HQ =\r\nsaid.

When you post to the list, \n&gt; formatting will usually be los=\r\nt.  Saving your story or poem as an html \n&gt; document enables you to format =\r\na story the way you want and have it be \n&gt; seen that way. Just keep readabi=\r\nlity in mind when you get enthusiastic \n&gt; with color and fonts.  J  (In MSW=\r\nord, to save a document in html format, \n&gt; you can either choose the &quot;Save =\r\nas&quot; feature under File and choose &quot;web \n&gt; page&quot; in the drop down menu OR ag=\r\nain under File, click on &quot;Save as web \n&gt; document.&quot;  Those of us accustomed=\r\n to uploading stories on ff.net should \n&gt; be aware that uploading to the ya=\r\nhoo list site keeps formatting exactly \n&gt; as you save it, unlike ff.net whi=\r\nch puts lines in after returns.  It&#39;s \n&gt; been ages since I&#39;ve worked with W=\r\nordPerfect, so I don&#39;t know how it \n&gt; works, but I imagine it&#39;s similar.

I know it&#39;s a pain, bu=\r\nt it allows \n&gt; readers the choice of what they want to read and what they w=\r\nant to \n&gt; avoid, as well as quick access to author information, permission =\r\nto \n&gt; archive on the website, and a disclaimer to protect yourself.  Storie=\r\ns \n&gt; that are posted without the header will be deleted.  Forgetfulness \n&gt; =\r\nhappens --- don&#39;t take it personally.  Just repost it with the header.  \n&gt; =\r\n(Or just send a message that, ACK! you forgot the header and correct it \n&gt; =\r\non the upload in Files.) If the story contains multiple parts or \n&gt; chapter=\r\ns, you can either repost the header each time or at the very \n&gt; least repos=\r\nt the disclaimer.  If information should change (such as the \n&gt; story has s=\r\nuddenly jumped from PG to R), please repost a new header when \n&gt; you realiz=\r\ne information in the original header has changed.
