Hmm..\n\nHeisuke as far as I know was killed in the whole incident with Itou leaving \nShinsengumi (the one where Saitou was the spy that brought the Itou group \ndown). That&#39;d be...1866 or 67, I think. Can anyone confirm this?\n\nOut of curiosity, do you (or anyone out of the &quot;usual&quot; group of posters) \nhave any art to post in the group?
