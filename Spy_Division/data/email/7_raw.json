Out of a passion for their samurai\n=\r\nancestry, as well as a desire to live the history they&#39;d studied in\ncollege=\r\n, they had decided to establish themselves in Kyoto and pursue\na joint care=\r\ner in martial arts instruction and historical enacting.\nSince the night was=\r\n not too cold, they&#39;d decided to get into character\na bit--put on tradition=\r\nal garb and walk the streets of Mibu, one of\nthe historic districts, for aw=\r\nhile.\n &quot;Hiro-kun! Look! It&#39;s the Yagi estate!&quot;\nHiro glanced over in the dir=\r\nection that she was pointing. Sure enough,\nthere was the Yagi estate, which=\r\n had acquired quite a reputation\nduring the bloody Bakumatsu period in the =\r\n1860s, when the\nShinsengumi-- one of the shogunate&#39;s official police units =\r\nin\nKyoto--set up their headquarters there. Seeing the gate open, Hiro\nraise=\r\nd an eyebrow in curiosity. &quot;Isn&#39;t this after their open hours?\nWhy is the g=\r\nate open?&quot; Even though he wasn&#39;t sure, something at the\nextremities of his =\r\nsensory perception felt=85amiss. Then again, there\nwas always something wei=\r\nrd going on in Kyoto-- some commemoration,\ncelebration, or event that not e=\r\nveryone would hear about. Being a fan\nof the Shinsengumi, he couldn&#39;t resis=\r\nt the urge to find out what was\ngoing on.\n&quot;Want to check it out? At the ver=\r\ny least we&#39;ll give the caretakers a\ngood shock,&quot; he said with a smile. Yuki=\r\n nodded.\nAs they walked toward the gate of the Yagi mansion, the wind, whic=\r\nh\nhad just been a gentle breeze only moments before, began to pick up.\nClos=\r\ner to the estate now, they could see what looked like a fire\nburning in the=\r\n inner courtyard. Hiro opened his mouth to say something\nabout the fire, wh=\r\nen the wind&#39;s ferocity sharply increased, and the\nworld around seemed to da=\r\nrken.\nHiro didn&#39;t stop to think-- instincts honed during years of sword\ntra=\r\nining took over. Instinctively, he grabbed a hold of Yuki by the\nshoulders =\r\nand pulled her in quickly-- putting both arms around her and\nholding her as=\r\n close as he could.\n&quot;Hiro? What&#39;s going on?&quot; she barely managed to shout ov=\r\ner the wind.\n&quot;Hold me.&quot;\n&quot;What?&quot;\n&quot;Just hold me!&quot;\nThe wind shifted. Instead o=\r\nf blowing straight, it started twisting in\non itself, pushing the helpless =\r\ncouple around this way and that. A\nword flashed through Hiro&#39;s mind, a word=\r\n he didn&#39;t really believe and\ndidn&#39;t really like, but that seemed to be the=\r\n closest thing to this\nwind: kamikaze. Divine Tempest. Unable to consciousl=\r\ny stand up to the\nwind anymore, he closed his eyes and focused his entire b=\r\neing on the\none dearest to him, drawing courage from the gentle strength of=\r\n her\nembrace and the close warmth of her body. He felt her give a gentle\nsq=\r\nueeze, as if to say, I love you. Don&#39;t ever let go of me=85 \nThe wind, more=\r\n untamed now, began to whistle shrilly, like a flute in\na Noh drama. Unwitt=\r\ningly, Hiro opened his eyes and saw that he was no\nlonger on the ground, bu=\r\nt being spun through the air, faster and\nfaster and faster. The Yagi mansio=\r\nn wasn&#39;t really below, though. But\nwhat he heard next made him forget about=\r\n any of that.\nI, Tokugawa Hirotada, take you, Matsumae Yuki, to be my=85\nTh=\r\ne wedding. That was in June-- why could he hear his words from the\nceremony=\r\n?\nSenzowa daijidakedo, kami wo shinjiru! I honor my ancestors, but I\nbeliev=\r\ne in God!\nHis own voice, while arguing his new Christian faith with his fat=\r\nher.\nI&#39;m Tokugawa Hirotada. Pleased to meet you, Yuki-dono.\nThe day he&#39;d me=\r\nt Yuki=85\nTokugawa Hirotada, I pass this sword on to you, in honor of your\n=\r\ncoming of age.\nHis father again-- giving him one of the family swords, the =\r\none made\nby Yasutsugu XI, in honor of his coming of age ceremony.\nWe must e=\r\nndure the unendurable, bear the unbearable, and suffer the\nunsufferable=85\n=\r\nHearing his own voice, perhaps. But now Emperor Hirohito&#39;s voice?\nHijikata!=\r\n Go, now! Go to Shonai and get reinforcements!\nHijikata? Reinforcements fro=\r\nm Shonai? That could only be the voice of\nMatsudaira Katamori=85last lord o=\r\nf the Aizu domain in the 1860s, and\nsponsor of the Shinsengumi...\nThe Shins=\r\nengumi=85\nHiro opened his eyes, and found himself looking at the hilt of a\n=\r\nsword. Following the hilt downward, he saw a blue overcoat, with=85white\nmo=\r\nuntain-shaped triangles on the sleeves. Blue overcoat, white\nmountain-shape=\r\nd triangles on the sleeves. The uniform of the\nShinsengumi? But=85what woul=\r\nd another historical enactor be doing out\nthis=85early? With his senses slo=\r\nwly returning to him, he found that it\nwas light again, probably around daw=\r\nn. But=85where was he? And=85\n&quot;Oi! Masuda-kun! Look what we&#39;ve got here!&quot;\nT=\r\nhe man who was looking over Hiro got up.\n&quot;Yeah?&quot;\nTwo more men in Shinsengum=\r\ni uniform held a very tired and\nbattered-looking Yuki up by her arms.\n&quot;Ah, =\r\nso the flowers are blooming early this year? Don&#39;t worry, fellas,\nwe can en=\r\njoy their fragrance just as well.&quot; He rubbed his palms\ntogether nefariously=\r\n. &quot;We can each have a turn=85&quot;\nThe first of Yuki&#39;s screams suddenly snapped=\r\n Hiro&#39;s senses back into\nfull focus. Rolling himself up to his knees, he sa=\r\nw the three men, all\nin Shinsengumi uniform, trying to rip her kimono off. =\r\nHiro&#39;s right\nhand automatically went to his left hip, but then he remembere=\r\nd that\nhe was obviously not armed. But he had no choice=85he rose to his fe=\r\net.\nQuietly, he closed the distance between himself and Masuda=85finally\nco=\r\nming right behind him, he wrapped an arm around the man&#39;s neck and\njerked i=\r\nt sharply to the right. With his free hand, he grabbed the\nhilt of Masuda&#39;s=\r\n sword and yanked it out of the sheath. Masuda fell\nwith a yelp, startling =\r\nhis accomplices.\n&quot;M-Masuda-kun?!&quot;\nHiro stood over Masuda&#39;s corpse. Now arme=\r\nd and ready to fight, he\nraised the sword into a high guard stance.\n&quot;W-Who =\r\nthe heck are you?!&quot; they choked out in fear and alarm.\n&quot;You&#39;re about to die=\r\n, so knowing my name is useless to you.&quot;\n&quot;Bah! Just a wastrel ronin! Let&#39;s =\r\nget `im!&quot; The men threw Yuki down to\nthe ground. Drawing their swords they =\r\nlunged at Hiro, hoping to\novertake him by speed. He sideswept one man, yank=\r\ned him downward with\nhis free hand, and kicked him toward the other one. Th=\r\ne two of them\ninstantly went down with a thud, their swords clattering to t=\r\nhe ground\nloudly.\n&quot;Get up!&quot; Hiro snarled, kicking them mercilessly. &quot;Get up=\r\n!&quot;\nOne of them managed to grab his own sword, and tried to get up. He\nturne=\r\nd his gaze upward just in time to see Hiro&#39;s sword descend in a\nshimmering =\r\narc=85spattering the other man with his blood. The other\nthrew himself at H=\r\niro&#39;s feet, whimpering pitifully. &quot;Please! Please!\nDon&#39;t kill me! I didn&#39; m=\r\nean no harm! We was just out drinkin&#39;, that&#39;s\nall! Please!&quot;\nHiro couldn&#39;t h=\r\near him in his blind rage. He picked the man up by the\ncollar and held him =\r\noff the ground. Raising his sword, he readied to\nstab the man, just as--\n&quot;Y=\r\nou! Drop the sword!&quot;\nHe dropped the man instead, and spun on his heel, comi=\r\nng face to face\nwith another man in Shinsengumi uniform, with about a dozen=\r\n others\nbehind him, all armed-- all with swords, some also with spears and\n=\r\nhalberds.\n&quot;Drop the sword,&quot; repeated the man, obviously the leader in the g=\r\nroup.\nHe was of medium-height, firm build, and had a sharp, piercing gaze\nl=\r\nike that of a wolf.\n&quot;These...these men, whoever they are, were raping my wi=\r\nfe. You have no\nright to tell me to drop the sword! I will kill them!&quot;\n&quot;I k=\r\nnow who these men are,&quot; retorted the other man sharply. &quot;And I\nknow their r=\r\neputation. I happen to be their commander. Now drop the\nsword and let me de=\r\nal with them.&quot;\nHiro let the sword drop from his hand. He was pushed aside b=\r\ny the\nlarge group behind the wolf-eyed man, some of whom rushed forward to\n=\r\nbind the wrists of the survivor, while others checked to make sure\nthat the=\r\n other two were dead.\n&quot;What about your wife?&quot; asked the wolf-eyed man. &quot;For=\r\ngot about her so\nquickly?&quot;\nBlushing red with embarrassment and shame, he ru=\r\nshed over to Yuki, who\nwas sobbing uncontrollably and trying to cover herse=\r\nlf with the\ntattered remnants of her kimono. Gently, Hiro laid a hand on he=\r\nr\nshoulder. She looked up and suddenly threw her arms around him.\nClosing h=\r\nis own suddenly tear-filled eyes, he gently rocked her back\nand forth, tryi=\r\nng to calm her down.\n&quot;Come with me, both of you.&quot;\nIt was the wolf-eyed man =\r\nagain.\n&quot;Huh? Where?&quot;\n&quot;Don&#39;t you know where anything is? To the Shinsengumi =\r\nheadquarters at\nthe Yagi mansion! My superiors will need to hear about what=\r\n happened\nin order to deal properly with Onoda there.&quot; He gestured toward t=\r\nhe\nsurvivor.\nShinsengumi headquarters? But that would mean=85Hiro shook his=\r\n head in\ndisbelief. Divine Wind, indeed=85\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll have our doc=\r\ntor tend to any wounds you or your\nwife may have. It&#39;s idiots like Onoda an=\r\nd Masuda who give us the name\n`wolves&#39;. We&#39;re actually quite concerned with=\r\n the welfare of the\ncommon people in this city.&quot;\nGently helping Yuki to her=\r\n feet, Hiro followed the wolf-eyed man.\n\n**********\n\nJidai Monogatari-Chapt=\r\ner 1\nOWARI (end)\n\n**********\n\nThat&#39;s all for Chapter 1.
