Sleepy but funny can&#39;t \nsleep so here goes... Let&#39;s discuss about things you do, w/ regards \nto writing of course... This is in no particular order and if it&#39;s \nsounds kinda weird... It&#39;s 1:34 AM...\n\n1) While writing you... ????\na. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts \nare finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.\nb. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever\nc. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, \noops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.\n\n2) After writing you... ????\na. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important \nthan Proof-read!\nb. One quick read. I&#39;m confident enough in my work.\nc. Oh who needs to check? It&#39;s too late. I wrote and posted the \nthing already!\n\n3) When you get reviews you... ???\na. Oh that&#39;s nice. I&#39;ll check it in a bit. *feels good*\nb. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!\nc. Review... Well that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it. \n\n4) When you get a critique you... ???\na. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!\nb. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis \nand then correct if need be...\nc. What? You didn&#39;t like it. Oh! I&#39;ve got to fix that quick!\n\n5) When it comes to updates you... ???\na. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\nb. I&#39;ll update exactly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a \ndefined routine.\nc. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this \ngreat idea or if this writers block ever goes away.\n\n6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \nyou...\na. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written \nnow!\nb. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it&#39;s more convenient.\nc. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!\n\n7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\na. Post on every messageboard, yahoo group and even e-mail close \n(not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need to \nread ASAP or else!\nb. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement \nin a community where you are an active member or popular\nc. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your fic \nin the depths of ff.net.\n\nHere&#39;s mine...\n1. a\n2. c\n3. b\n4. b\n5. c\n6. c\n7. b\n\n\nMaybe I&#39;ll post some sort grading system and interpretation to the \nresults that you get. Right now though.. Well no way. Sleep has \ncome! YEY! It might be nice though to see your responses so that we \nknow a little bit more about each other. Maybe get a few laughs \ntoo. :O)\n\n~wounds\n\n\n\n"
