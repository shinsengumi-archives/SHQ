Hey,\n&gt; it was the Revolution, for crying out loud! There\n&gt; _was_ blood flowing\n&gt; in the streets and secret trysts in inns and\n&gt; teahouses! Ehem...right.\n&gt; Disclaimer: This story is entirely mine, and is not\n&gt; based on anything.\n&gt; You _may_ read it, but if you try to steal it, I\n&gt; will get the entire\n&gt; Shinsengumi to descend on your head and Aku Soku Zan\n&gt; you mercilessly.\n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chapter 2\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyoto\n&gt; Genji 1 (1864), June 20th\n&gt; \n&gt; As Hiro found out, he and Yuki hadn&#39;t landed far\n&gt; from the Yagi\n&gt; estate-- probably only about a couple blocks away.\n&gt; He was glad they\n&gt; were that close, for Yuki&#39;s sake, as she didn&#39;t seem\n&gt; too likely to be\n&gt; in a calm enough state to hike very far.\n&gt; His first impression at realizing where he was, was\n&gt; that the 1860s\n&gt; didn&#39;t smell as good as he&#39;d imagined. Despite the\n&gt; extreme cleanliness\n&gt; and cautious sanitation common to any major Japanese\n&gt; city of those\n&gt; days, there was still the smell of dirt and mud in\n&gt; the air. The sky\n&gt; seemed bluer, though, and the visibility was\n&gt; excellent. He&#39;d read all\n&gt; about it in his college textbooks, heard all about\n&gt; it from his\n&gt; family&#39;s stories, but he&#39;d never imagined it to be\n&gt; so�overpoweringly\n&gt; real. He was there, in the textbooks, as history was\n&gt; being written,\n&gt; walking the streets with a troop of samurai. If the\n&gt; situation weren&#39;t\n&gt; so grave, and the era not so bloody, he might\n&gt; actually have taken the\n&gt; time to better soak in the atmosphere.\n&gt; &quot;Here we are. Shinsengumi headquarters,&quot; said the\n&gt; wolf-eyed man,\n&gt; indicating the gateway with a tilt of his head.\n&gt; &quot;Please follow me.&quot;\n&gt; As he led them through the gate, Hiro remembered the\n&gt; force that had\n&gt; brought them here, and felt a chill run down his\n&gt; spine. Gritting his\n&gt; teeth, he did his best to put the past behind him,\n&gt; and followed the\n&gt; wolf-eyed man into the main courtyard.\n&gt; &quot;Welcome back, Saitou-san!&quot; called a man who had\n&gt; just emerged from one\n&gt; of the rooms. He was about the same height as\n&gt; wolf-eyes-- Saitou-- but\n&gt; looked much younger, with childlike features, almost\n&gt; too young to be\n&gt; holding the katana in his left hand.\n&gt; &quot;No time for that, Okita-kun! Go get the doctor, and\n&gt; tell Hijikata-san\n&gt; that I have business with him.&quot; Okita nodded curtly,\n&gt; and dashed off,\n&gt; returning momentarily with the Yagi family doctor\n&gt; and a couple of\n&gt; maids, before dashing off in the other direction to\n&gt; find Hijikata.\n&gt; &quot;Clean this woman up and check her for any injuries\n&gt; if you would,\n&gt; sensei.&quot; He nodded, and gestured for Hiro to let go.\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;ll be\n&gt; alright,&quot; Saitou reassured him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. She&#39;s\n&gt; in good hands.&quot;\n&gt; Reluctantly-- very reluctantly-- Hiro let go of\n&gt; Yuki, who was promptly\n&gt; led away by the doctor and maids.\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Saitou repeated, bringing Hiro back\n&gt; to full attention.\n&gt; &quot;Now let&#39;s go see Hijikata-san, and clear this\n&gt; business of Masuda&#39;s\n&gt; people up.&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Y�yes of course, Saitou-san.&quot; As the mist cleared\n&gt; from his mind, Hiro\n&gt; put two and two together. Saitou�a leader in the\n&gt; Shinsengumi�Saitou\n&gt; Hajime! The legendary Shinsengumi third unit\n&gt; captain! And Okita�must\n&gt; be Okita Souji, the first unit captain! And\n&gt; Hijikata�Hiro shivered in\n&gt; mild horror at the name. Hijikata Toshizou\n&gt; Yoshitoyo, the Shinsengumi\n&gt; vice-commander and &quot;demon&quot;. Originally the son of\n&gt; the farmer, he was\n&gt; adopted into a samurai family, and soon became an\n&gt; expert at\n&gt; swordsmanship. Known for his cold and cruel manner\n&gt; of leadership, he\n&gt; was feared by all, friend and foe alike-- and yet,\n&gt; loyal to the last,\n&gt; he fought to the very end of the Bakumatsu period,\n&gt; finally dying of a\n&gt; gunshot wound at the Battle of Matsumae Castle in\n&gt; Hokkaido. That day,\n&gt; however, lay some five years into the future.\n&gt; Saitou halted abruptly next to a sliding door, and\n&gt; slid it open with\n&gt; one hand, bowing. &quot;Hijikata-san. Sorry to keep you\n&gt; waiting.&quot; He nodded\n&gt; to Hiro, and they entered together. &quot;Saitou-san.\n&gt; Have a seat, please.\n&gt; You as well,&quot; Hijikata said, motioning to Hiro, who\n&gt; sat along Saitou,\n&gt; facing the vice-commander.\n&gt; &quot;Now, what did you do about those three idiots?&quot;\n&gt; asked the\n&gt; vice-commander abruptly. That&#39;s something the\n&gt; historians were right\n&gt; about, thought Hiro. Hijikata&#39;s cold, cruel,\n&gt; calculating, and to the\n&gt; point�\n&gt; &quot;We heard they were out drinking and causing trouble\n&gt; nearby. However,\n&gt; we hadn&#39;t counted on this man being there.&quot; Saitou\n&gt; pointed at Hiro.\n&gt; &quot;Masuda and the others tried raping his wife, and he\n&gt; killed two of the\n&gt; men in retaliation. We got there just in time and\n&gt; managed to stop him\n&gt; from killing Onoda.&quot;\n&gt; Hijikata stroked his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Onoda will\n&gt; pay duly for his\n&gt; crime�he has violated the first rule of our code, by\n&gt; behaving in a\n&gt; manner unbecoming a warrior.&quot; He turned his cold\n&gt; gaze toward Hiro.\n&gt; &quot;Now, tell me who you are, and why, if you are\n&gt; indeed a samurai, you\n&gt; have no swords.&quot;\n&gt; Hiro studied Hijikata intently, while trying to come\n&gt; up with a\n&gt; coherent, believable answer that wouldn&#39;t get him\n&gt; instantly killed.\n&gt; The books were right-- he really was tall, almost\n&gt; above average.\n&gt; Unlike his only surviving photograph, where his hair\n&gt; lay untied, down\n&gt; to chin length, it was tied up in a neat topknot.\n&gt; His features were\n&gt; firm and commanding, exuding a twofold aura of\n&gt; immaculacy and\n&gt; coldness. His photograph showed him wearing a\n&gt; Western-style suit, but\n&gt; seeing him here, dressed in a wide-sleeved kimono\n&gt; and crisp, clean\n&gt; gray trousers was more real, more powerful, in a\n&gt; way.\n&gt; He knew well that he couldn&#39;t say who he really was,\n&gt; especially\n&gt; because someone of his clan, no matter what their\n&gt; rank, wouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; wandering the streets of Kyoto in this era,\n&gt; especially not without a\n&gt; sizable escort. But he couldn&#39;t think of any other\n&gt; convincing alias.\n&gt; Finally, using the intricacies and seemingly endless\n&gt; variations of\n&gt; Japanese names to his advantage, he decided to tell\n&gt; the truth�partly.\n&gt; &quot;I am Tokugawa Hirotada.&quot;\n&gt; Hijikata&#39;s face visibly became pale.\n&gt; Hiro knew exactly what he was thinking: For members\n&gt; of the Shinsengumi\n&gt; to have broken the rules was bad, but for them to\n&gt; have done what they\n&gt; did to a relative of the shogun might cost him his\n&gt; very head� \n&gt; &quot;Spelled with different letters than that of the\n&gt; Shogun&#39;s name. As for\n&gt; my swords�&quot; Hiro heard himself make up a story that\n&gt; even he partly\n&gt; didn&#39;t believe: he&#39;d been befriended by Masuda at a\n&gt; local teahouse,\n&gt; and had promptly begun drinking with him. Somehow,\n&gt; Masuda had drugged\n&gt; Hiro&#39;s drink, knocking him unconscious, during which\n&gt; time he&#39;d stolen\n&gt; Hiro&#39;s swords. Then Hiro had woken up in the street,\n&gt; seen Masuda and\n&gt; two other people trying to rape his wife, who&#39;d come\n&gt; looking \n=== message truncated ===\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
