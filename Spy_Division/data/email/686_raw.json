TB s=\r\ntill kills tens \nof thousands of people each year.  People knew way, way be=\r\nfore the \n20th century how very infectious it was.  The first modern \ndescr=\r\niption was published in the 1540&#39;s, but it was also described by \nHippocrat=\r\nes.  That pesky little Mycobacterium genus is fairly young \n(about 15000 ye=\r\nars) and researchers think that its evolution \nparallels our switch from hu=\r\nnters to farmers.  Mummies dating to \n3400BCE have been found with it.  In =\r\nthe 1700&#39;s, just about everyone \nin Europe was probably infected.  In gener=\r\nal, there are three stages: \nfirst is the infection and tubercle formation,=\r\n but there are very few \nsymptoms and it is often dismissed as a mild cold =\r\n(just like in the \nNHK drama).  The second stage is a dormant stage, that c=\r\nan last from \nweeks to a life time.  As long as the host remains healthy th=\r\ney may \nnever show any symptoms.  The third stage is the one we are familia=\r\nr \nwith, the tubercles open and the bacteria spread throughout the \nbody.  =\r\nIn the pulmonary form, sputum and sometimes blood are coughed \nup.  This is=\r\n also a means of transmission.  Prior to the 1940&#39;s \n(development of vaccin=\r\nes and anitbiotics; mostly done in Europe) the \nmost effective &#39;treatment&#39; =\r\nwas to forestall the 3rd stage and to \nprevent the spread.  Sanitoriums pro=\r\nvided people with quiet, \nnutritious food (very similar to the orders of th=\r\nat wonderfully \ncranky doctor in the NHK drama), clean conditions, and were=\r\n a type of \nquarantine.  \nProbably a good number of the folks in the Shinse=\r\nngumi (and in Kyoto \nand Edo and any other large city) had an infection, bu=\r\nt only poor \nSoji is described as having the final stage of the pulmonary f=\r\norm.  \nWho knows when and where he got it?  But I can certainly imagine the=\r\n \nliving quarters at Mibu and stress levels leading up the raid on \nIkeda a=\r\ns being factors causing him to move to that third stage.   \nGiven how commo=\r\nn it was/is I am a little surprised that more men are \nnot listed as having=\r\n it.  But there are several other ailments that \nare actually TB that are o=\r\nften misdiagnosed, so maybe others did have \nit.  And it is much more tragi=\r\nc in some one so young, which makes a \nmuch better story, eh?\n\nThese sites =\r\nhave other interesting historical tidbits \nhttp://www.lung.ca/tb/main.html\n=\r\nhttp://www.jantb.com/historytb2.html\n\n\n\n\n"
