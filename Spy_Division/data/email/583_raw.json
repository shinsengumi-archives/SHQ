Since I don&#39;t know much \nabout this place, I must say sorry if I did anything wrong. ^^ Let me \nintroduce myself first- - I&#39;m  from Thailand, The name I use on the internet \nis `Giffy&#39;.  I&#39;m a fan girl ( consequently yaoi fan by nature ). I have known \nabout shinsengumi (actually some characters like saitou and okita )  from \nRK but truly fallen in love with them I&#39;ve read PMK. The most beloved \ncharacter of mine is okita souji-sama. However, I do adore them all. ^__^ \nI&#39;m looking forward to watching the movie `Gohatto&#39; too.\n\nI have questions to ask you. First, is it O.K. if I upload some files like screen \ncapture or doujinshi onto the group. Second, If I scan the doujinshi I \npurchased without permission from their respectable doujinshika just to \nshare with you guys, will there be anyone who sue me? O_o  ( I have none of \nPMK doujinshi yet, but I&#39;m sure I will have some soon.)\n\nSee you on SHQ message board ^o^\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
