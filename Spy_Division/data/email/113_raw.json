This might have been the road our boys took when they first \ncame to Kyoto. Also, this may be helpful to those who write fanfics \n(at least the RK ones, where there is a lot of coming and going \nbetween the two cities) which is why I&#39;m posting it here. This is \nfrom a book called Reader&#39;s Digest Everyday Life Through the Ages \n(1992) ISBN# 0-276-42035-7 (Be forewarned there are only four pages \nin the whole book on Japan.)\n\n&quot;Grains and goods made by craftsmen were carried from place to place \non a network of roads which included the Eastern Sea Road. This \nhighway, 300 miles (480 km) long, connected Kyoto and Edo, and at the \ntime it was probably the world&#39;s busiest road. A constant traffic of \nmerchants, government officials, pilgrims, priests and doctors \ntravelled along it.\n\n&quot;Most people travelled by horse or on foot, and it took 20 to 30 days \nfor pedestrians to complete the journey. The few wheeled vehicles \nwere used to carry very heavy loads. There were incessant stops at \ncheckpoints where the agents of the shogun kept a watchful eye on \ntravellers. Their main concern was to give the shogun advance warning \nof powerful local lords on the move with large bodies of armed men.&quot;\n\n\n"
