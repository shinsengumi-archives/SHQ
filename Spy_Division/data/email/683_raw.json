TB remained a problem in East Asia for decades post-revolution as well.   TB is pretty much infectious only at certain points where a person is actively coughing.... and I don&#39;t recall reading of other Shinsengumi folks with active TB (indicated by coughing and productive, often bloody sputum)?  My guess is that Okita picked this up elsewhere  and much earlier and that it was latent for a time.   Given the extreme conditions and fatigue he encountered while active in the Shinsengumi, it&#39;s possible that the TB eventually overcame his bodies attempts to manage it.  Poor diet could be a contributing factor. (THe Japanese were prone to beri beri, scurvy and other nutritional illnesses.)\n\n\n&gt;Has anyone watched Shura No Toki?  They do a different take on Souji \n&gt;and the black cat.  As well as a different take on a lot of other \n&gt;things too...\n\nYes. I rather like Souji&#39;s TB storyline here (Have gallery of screencaps up at http://red-bird.org/Gallery/shura ).  It&#39;s one of the most generous anime in terms of dealing with all of the various shifting factions as well. \n\n&gt;On a related note - in one of the early episodes of the NHK \n&gt;Shinsengumi series a mention is made of people who were lost to \n&gt;&quot;the epidemic.&quot;  Anyone know what that epidemic was?\n\nDo you know which episode and which year specifically?   NHK in the beginning does a few time shifts back and forth from the sighting of Perry&#39;s ships to the year leading up to the transferrence to Kyoto.  There were outbreaks reported worldwide of various diseases, and they vary region by region.  My guess, however is that likely we are dealing with smallpox.\n\npp 128-9, &quot;The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History&quot; by Donald R. Hopkins writes:\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860, vaccination clinics were started in Japan and these sites also served as meeting places for students and teachers of Western science...  \n\nUnlike earlier Western counterparts, Komei did not help lead his subjects into the vaccination era, an error that cost him his life... ... Emperor Komei died of smallpox on 13 February 1867...  Mutsuhito took the throne name of Meiji in 1868 ... This did not signal the end of smallpox in Japan. Dudgeon (1871) records that barely a year later, a fierce epidemic raged along the entire eastern coast of China... the following winter, the epidemic got even worse, spilling over into Japan, where there were more severe outbreaks.\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nred-bird.org  | s-girl.deviantart.com \n\n\n\n\n\n"
