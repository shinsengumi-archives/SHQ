While there is certain legitimacy to this, I think the management has managed to put many of us at the defensive and having second thoughts after the NC 17 ban. I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t help to having second thoughts about their real motives... Maybe the advertisement they have really don&#39;t cover the costs, I don&#39;t know, but the way they worded this little thing sounded... mmmm I don&#39;t know...\nI wonder if the response to the reviewers can be considered as violation of the said TOS... At this rate we should be having a copy of the TOS at hand, including all the clarifications like this one &gt;.&lt;\n\n&lt;I have some stuff on Media Miner but it&#39;s such a PITA for me. It never \nseems to work right and changing a password is a major adventure. \nAdultff.net is even more of a pain because you have to jump through \nmultiple hoops to get anything to upload properly.&gt;\n\nhehe, I&#39;ve heard a lot of people complaining about Media Miner. Honestly, I never had problems with it, problems which I did have with FF net (( like messing up format and changing the order of chapters &gt;.&lt;)\nI had also my share of trouble with Adultfanfiction. I have just registered to anime-fiction (never heard of them before... Thanks for the tip), and I suppose I&#39;ll be uploading soon... \nFiruze\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Barbara Sheridan \n  To: SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 2004 3:27 PM\n  Subject: [SHQ_Spy_Division] Re: FF Net New Rules\n\n\n  Firuze wrote:\n\n  I think I might as well rant a bit, and while I&#39;m at it, give a warning to my fellow authors...

Next time, what? Is  just me or I detect a more and more repressive trend here? I mean, I don&#39;t write such kind of things in the Author&#39;s notes, but they have to control EVERYTHING we decide to express?&gt;&gt;\n\n\n  I agree that the earlier NC 17 purge was unfair but I&#39;m wondering if \n  this and the other recent thing about getting rid of poetry--certain \n  poetry---whatever is more a way of trying to save space/bandwidth.
