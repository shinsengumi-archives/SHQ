That&#39;s a really interesting take on Mary Sues. It&#39;s \n&gt; kind of interesting that since this is now out in the open, the \n&gt; reasons you said above is primarily the reason I don&#39;t dare write a \n&gt; Tokio x Saitou story. When do does one overstep the boundaries? A \n&gt; lot of people seems to like this kind of portrait of Tokio but \n&gt; personally, I don&#39;t. \n\nI should probably say that, just because a story is written with Tokio\nas a swordswoman, or with many powerful traits, I don&#39;t automatically\nlabel it a Mary Sue.  I&#39;ve seen a couple of -great- stories featuring\nTokio as a swordswoman, even as a very strong swordswoman.  But, they\nare very rare.  For the most part, I see this as a continuing trend to\nsomehow turn Battousai into a woman (which is also sometimes done very\nwell, but which is also rare) by proxy of Tokio.\n\nAngrybee.\n\n\n\n\n"
