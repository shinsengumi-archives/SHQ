Hey... So this is your gift ne? :O)\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure about the laws about this but do you think I can use it \n&gt; on my desktop at work? Can I use it after the contest (or earlier if \n&gt; possible)...\n&gt; \n&gt; Last month my pic was all the real faces of the members of the \n&gt; Shinsengumi and people including my boss kept stopping by asking who \n&gt; they were... Then I&#39;d go on a long explanation.. Basically giving \n&gt; them a history lesson. The good thing about it is that they seem to \n&gt; appreciate the lesson...\n&gt; \n&gt; This pic could make a good conversational piece about the SHQ group \n&gt; too... Let me know! ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;tnamwong@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I submitted fanart to the contest Angrybee informed us about\n&gt; &gt; Pic\n&gt; &gt; http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/PMKSH1.jpg\n&gt; &gt; Title: Saitou Hajime:Bored as Usual\n&gt; &gt; Media: overhead projecter marker\n&gt; &gt; Note I made him left-handed just because I think historical Saitou \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; left handed.  The mon/kamon in the background is historical Fujita\n&gt; &gt; Goro&#39;s family crest (nine bamboo leaves).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think his head is a bit big...and he looks like he used the \n&gt; entire\n&gt; &gt; can of hairspray...but its not like I can white it out or anything.\n\n\n"
