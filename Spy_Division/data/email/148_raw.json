Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever\n\nI generally sit down and write the scene out in my head as it occurs. \nI tend to think like a film person, so it&#39;s important for me to sit \ncontinuously and type quickly.   But I also try to get up once in a \nwhile. ^_^  Although I have been known to not eat or go to the \nbathroom if I&#39;m in the midst of something really interesting.\n\n\n&gt; 2) After writing you... ????\n\nGenerally I read it once before posting, then post it, and then read \nit again and fix it.  For some reason, I can&#39;t pick things up on one \ngo.\n\n3) When you get reviews you... ???\n\n b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!\nI love them.  Even the &quot;U R So MEAN U MUst continue PLZ&quot; reviews \n*grin*\n\n\n 4) When you get a critique you... ???\n b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis \n and then correct if need be...\npeople who point out typos are great. I love em. People who point out \ninconsistencies also are great.  I hate mistakes and that other \npeople will be reading them... so I love people who are giving me \nhelpful reviews.\n\n\n5) When it comes to updates you... ???\na. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!\nb. I&#39;ll update exactly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a \n defined routine.\n\na and b.\nI believe in finishing the big stories. Smaller ones can go on a \nschedule or be intermittent. I often use the ff.net tracking \nstatistics to also decide how to proceed.  ONe story I wrote was \ngetting usually 100-200 reads within 3 days per chapter, so I decided \nto go ahead and keep whipping out the updates.  But some of the other \nones have been getting read more slowly, so those aren&#39;t quite as \nurgent.  \n\n6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. \n you...\n a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written \nnow!\n\nBut sometimes I tell other people the idea and get them \nto write it ^_^ .  \n\n 7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...\n b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement \nin a community where you are an active member or popular \n\n\n"
