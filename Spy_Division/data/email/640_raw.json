Thank you to Phil, Barb, M and Sec for their input and \nencouragement in this project. I had Safety write up a little \nsomething, a more formal introduction to the Fic site (see below)\n\nhttp://www.shinsengumifics.com/\n\nCourtesy of Safety:\n\nAfter some hard work we&#39;re pleased to announce that Shinsengumifics \nis now active and ready to go!\n \nShinsengumifics.com is an original and fan fiction achive in the \nmodel of other archive sites such as fanfiction.net where authors \ncan upload and edit stories but unlike ff.net it allows for more \nthan just Rurouni Kenshin and Peacemaker Kurogane-based stories.  \nAny Shensengumi universe - RK to the NHK drama, Kaze Hikaru to pure \nhistorical - is open for all authors to unleash their creativity and \ntell some great stories about the Shinsengumi.  \n \nSo come by, register and add your stories!  Or come by and read and \noffer comments/encouragement to other fic writers - like ff.net \nthere is a capacity to submit and recieve reviews but unlike ff.net \nyou may add images (limited).  We look forward to seeing you there.\n\n--------\n\nTry it out. Since it&#39;s still new, Safety and I would really like to \nhear your suggestions and/or comments, just send them to \nadmin@... Oh and while I&#39;m at it, I might as well \nlet you know of my fansite on Saitou but you probably already \nstumbled upon it one way or the other: http://www.hajimenokizu.com/ \na smorgasborg of everything with a doujinshi gallery (a highly work \nin progress page). Now off to contact those listed in the DB and \nother related sites.\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n~Kizu\n\n\n\n"
