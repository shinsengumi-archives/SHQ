Theirs was a very unique relationship, not the \nfluffy =\r\nkind or the shy type. It was a nice breath of fresh air in my \nopinion. It =\r\nwas funny how they understood each other and showed it \nin not so -normal- =\r\nways. I mean who says she doesn&#39;t know what will \nhappen to her after she d=\r\nies? And her knight in shining armor comes \nalong and says join me. LOL! Wh=\r\nile I re-watched that I got \ngoosebumps.\n\nOh Sec... Saitou was there overhe=\r\naring the conversation. I&#39;m not \nsure if it&#39;s just me but... I have this na=\r\ngging feeling that SK was \nsaying that not only for Oume but for Saitou to =\r\nhear it (hopefully \nto fulfil that wish)? Wasn&#39;t it at that point that SK a=\r\nlready knew \nhe would be dying soon, which is why he was so open to Oume ab=\r\nout \nit? LOL! \n\n--- In SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com, &quot;secretary&quot; \n&lt;secr=\r\netarytocapt3@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the most fascinating pair in NHK&#39;s SH=\r\nINSENGUMI!\n&gt; was by far Serizawa and Oume.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wasn&#39;t it romantic when she=\r\n asked where she would be buried?\n&gt; The Wild Duck said &quot;join me in my grave=\r\n&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; That was sweet!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, maybe not.\n&gt; \n&gt; But still I think they wer=\r\ne very dynamic (sort of like Shishio and \nYume).\n&gt; \n&gt; rated PG\n&gt; http://1ha=\r\nppyturtle.com/temporary/Serizawafanart.jpg\n&gt; [click to see full size]\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nKizu captured that very scene in her music vid\n&gt; http://www.hajimenokizu.co=\r\nm/misc.htm\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
