According to Chief Kondou Isami &quot;We are most \nhonored to have been chosen as Defenders of Kyoto and we wish the \ncitizens to know that they can come to us any time of the day or night \nto seek help. It has been a memorable year and we thank our neighbors \nfor accepting us with open arms.&quot;\n\nOn an unrelated note Chief Kondou is asking for references for local \nwindow repair and graffiti removal services. Project bids currently \nbeing accepted at Shinsengumi headquarters, Mibu.\n\n# # # # # # # #\n\nOther news:\n\nA conservation minded citizen who chooses to remain anonymous has \nreported to the Times/Dispatch that while traveling some time back he \nwitnessed a group of young thugs slicing down trees for no apparent \nreason other than their own twisted sense of amusement. The worst \noffender appeared to be a young lad of no more than fourteen summers who \ngleefully sliced through trunk after trunk with his katana.\n\nWhen the citizen tried to speak with the male adult who appeared to be \nthe boy&#39;s guardian, he was greeted with a rude bout of obviously feigned \ncoughing. Taking the hint the concerned citizen continued on his \ntravels. He planned to return to that area soon on business and had \nhoped to take the matter up with local officials but has decided to \npostpone his trip due to the recent onset of an unexpected  respiratory \nailment.\n\n(Note from the editor-in-chief) Rest assured dear citizens that we of \nthe Shinsengumi will not tolerate such lack of disregard for the natural \nbeauty of our local flora and fauna in this Han. (Anyone attempting to \ndeface public property will be dealt with accordingly.)\n\n# # # # # # # # # #\n\nPubic Service Bulletin:\n\nRunaway child report:\n\n The missing child ran away from home approximately six months ago \nfollowing an argument with his adoptive father, a potter from the Edo \narea. The boy&#39;s name is Himura  Shinta sometimes called &quot;Kenni&quot; He is of \nslightly below average height and build with reddish brown hair and a \ngenerally bad attitude. He was last reported in this general vicinity in \nthe company of a band of older men. His father reports that he is rather \nimmature for his age and that he believes these &quot;older men&quot; may have \ncoerced his son into following them for purposes of an obscene nature. \nAnonymous information on this child accepted care of this newspaper.\n\n# # # # # # # # #\n\nLost & Found:\n\nLost kitten.
