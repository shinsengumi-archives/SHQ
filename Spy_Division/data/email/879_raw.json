Simply, \nit is a time great=\r\n shifts and destruction.  For instance, at the end of \nChina&#39;s Han dynasty,=\r\n the country experienced an upheaval and three \nmen swore an oath of loyalt=\r\ny to one another amongst peach blossoms \nscattering in the wind.&quot;\n\nThe capt=\r\nain turned away and mumbled, &quot;What happened to those \nwarrior brothers Hiji=\r\nkata?&quot;\n\nHijikata flipped open a lighter and watched the still flame.  He wo=\r\nndered \nif there is truth to the statement that the center of the fire is a=\r\nctually \ncool...and peaceful.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n&quot;Is any of =\r\nthis necessary?&quot;  Matsudaira Katsumori pushed his slightly \ntinted glasses =\r\nup his nose as his assistants hovered near him carrying \nhis briefcase and =\r\neven his tested meals.  He has never traveled as a \ncommoner in a city he h=\r\nas sworn to protect.  The daimyo of A-han \nlooked at the unmarked vehicle w=\r\nith disdain and he could sense that his \nown security would be insulted by =\r\nthe innovation of having  Shinsengumi \nprovide additional protection.\n\nSait=\r\nou bowed and placed his hand on the luxury vehicle caressing the \nblack hid=\r\ne, &quot;under the outer body are additional layers of armor which \ncan withstan=\r\nd even explosives,&quot;  he walked alongside the car he plans to \nchauffeur, &quot;r=\r\nesilient bullet proof glass, run-flat tires...&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me guess the rocket l=\r\nauncher emerges from the sun-roof?&quot;  \nYamagawa, one of Matsudaira&#39;s aides c=\r\noughed.  &quot;Will there be room for \nany of us?  Where are our vehicles?&quot;  Yam=\r\nagawa pointed to himself and \nhis fellow guards.\n\n&quot;My goal is to escort Mat=\r\nsudaira-sama undetected.  An entourage would \nonly blow our cover.&quot;  The Sh=\r\ninsengumi captain smiled, &quot;As for the \nrocket launcer,&quot; he opened the back =\r\ndoor for the daimyo, &quot;We can \nalways put in a special request at the Temple=\r\n of Light Hoko-in.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will not use a vehicle made by foreigners.&quot;\n\nSaitou=\r\n nearly prostrated himself, &quot;Your eyes cannot be deceived.  Hoko-\nin engine=\r\ners have atleast altered the exterior to look like a Japanese car \nand adde=\r\nd more security improvements.  The vehicle was smuggled into \nour country p=\r\niece by piece at the insistence of the government after the \nunfortunate...=\r\n.&quot;\n\nMatsudaira held up his hand, &quot;Yes I recall the assassination of the \nof=\r\nficial.  His entourage should not have stopped.&quot;\n\n&quot;We will keep moving rega=\r\nrdless of the circumstances my lord,&quot;  Saitou \nhumbly replied.\n\nKatsumori s=\r\ntretched his legs in the roomy interior, &quot;I have business with \nthe Imperia=\r\nl Officials.  There is no time to waste,&quot; he looked back at his \nworried A-=\r\nhan  attendants as the vehicle left the garage.\n\n--------------------------=\r\n-----\n\nHijikata did not notice that Okita had fallen into a deep sleep, but=\r\n he \ncontinued the story.  &quot;One by one the brothers of the Peach Garden Pac=\r\nt \ndied pathetically until finally their ideals became a memory as the era =\r\n\ncontinued on without them.&quot;\n\nHe reached over and picked up his PDA to moni=\r\ntor Saitou and \nMatsudaira&#39;s whereabouts.  \n\n&quot;My favorite warrior brother w=\r\nas Guan Yu, but he was the first to die.&quot;  \nHe glanced at Okita&#39;s back and =\r\ngrinned.\n\nThe Lieutenant knew that Shinsengumi headquarters was full of dev=\r\nices \nrecording his every move, every word to ensure his loyalty.  What&#39;s t=\r\no \nsay Hijikata did not have someone watching A-han?\n\n---------------------=\r\n----------\n\nAn elderly cafe owner opened the cash register and shook before=\r\n the \nmen sporting light jackets with  infamous Shinsengumi badges, &quot;Sirs, =\r\nI \ndon&#39;t have cash, my wife must&#39;ve taken it all the bank already.&quot;  He tri=\r\ned \nto back away but strong hands held his collar.\n\n&quot;Your cafe has been ide=\r\nntified as a business which disseminates anti-\ngovernment propaganda via th=\r\ne internet,&quot;  Niimi Nishiki swiped a laptop \nfrom a small round table sendi=\r\nng it crashing to the floor.  He told his \nminion to release the old man an=\r\nd he stepped in closer and brushed \naside his jacket to display his gun, &quot;E=\r\nven if your woman has taken the \nmoney perhaps you have something else to o=\r\nffer us?&quot;\n\nNiimi turned to a young waitress who ran into the store from the=\r\n \nsupplies room.  She screamed as a Shinsengumi grabbed her wrist and \ntwis=\r\nted her arm after she activated a silent alarm under the counter.\n\n--------=\r\n-----------------------\n\n&quot;Hm?&quot;  Saitou knew the protocol for answering mess=\r\nages on the radio \nbut whoever called him should know he had an assignment =\r\ntonight.  He \nglanced in the rear view mirror.  Matsudaira was obsessively =\r\nreviewing \nhis schedule on his laptop.  No wonder few people placed faith i=\r\nn \nKatsumori&#39;s leadership skills.  The daimyo looked more like a CEO of a \n=\r\nmajor dot com corporation than a warrior.\n\nThe captain adjusted the hands f=\r\nree device as he maneuvered the car \nthrough the Kyoto evening traffic, &quot;Bu=\r\nsy.&quot;\n\nThe dispatcher went silent and Hijikata&#39;s voice grabbed Saitou&#39;s \natt=\r\nention, &quot;Just drive past the Himeya and see what&#39;s going on.  I sent \nNiimi=\r\n to investigate but the owner must have set off the alarm alerting \nthe Kyo=\r\nto Metropolitan Police.  I don&#39;t want them to arrest one of our \nmen. I sen=\r\nt back up but you are closest right now.&quot; \n\nSaitou pushed the 517 hp biturb=\r\no V12 engine and weaved out of the \nlane which had become a parking lot by =\r\ndriving on the opposite side of \nthe road.\n\n&quot;Shortcut?&quot;  Katsumori closed t=\r\nhe computer and looked out at the blurry \ncityscape.\n\nSaitou put both hands=\r\n on the steering wheel, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; \n\n-------------------------------\n\nHijik=\r\nata closed his eyes.  Niimi was a mistake.  The fucker must be \ntaking adva=\r\nntage of his authority and in the process ruining the \nShinsengumi&#39;s reputa=\r\ntion.  He needed to be dealt with and hopefully \nSaitou would not have to t=\r\nake any action and leave Katsumori \nunguarded.  Harada had better get there=\r\n before the KMPD which would \nbe more than happy to have reason to fight a =\r\nShinsengumi.  He opened \none eye when he felt a cold hand on his shoulder.\n=\r\n\n&quot;Hijikata, I won&#39;t forgive you if something happens to anyone at the \nHime=\r\nya.  You&#39;ve become truly heartless to harass honest hardworking \npeople in =\r\nthis city.&quot;  Okita had that look in his eyes.  Few people have \nseen the us=\r\nually serene eyes full of fire outside the dojo or off the field.\n\n&quot;My hear=\r\nt beats for this city.  If a few must suffer or die to save the \nmany then =\r\nso be it.  This is not a war fought with weapons, but with \nideas Okita.  I=\r\nf businesses are unwittingly aiding and abetting the enemy \nthey will be sh=\r\nut down.&quot;\n\nOkita turned away and began to dress.  He picked up his weapon s=\r\nlowly \nfrom the nightstand and left the Lieutenant&#39;s quarters.\n\n\n"
