            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-323303062\">Awhile ago, Tiffany asked this question, which I find so intriguing I think <br/>\nI&#39;ll answer it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyone want to share how weird it is to try to think as someone of the<br/>\n&gt;opposite gender? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It _is_ weird. It started out that way, anyway...for example-- in &quot;Jidai <br/>\nMonogatari&quot;, my main character was not always Hiro-- in previous drafts, it <br/>\nused to be Yuki. I think that writing and thinking so much as a character of <br/>\nthe opposite gender actually helped me in the long run-- it helped me become <br/>\nmore balanced as an individual. In a way, I&#39;ve always been unlike other guys <br/>\n(I dislike watching sports on TV, I&#39;m generally more open and sensitive, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot afraid to cry openly), but this sort of helped me define that. Writing <br/>\nas Yuki opened me up to a new range of emotions and perception-- in a way, <br/>\nwhen I wrote as her, it turned things upside down.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd something else (sort of related)-- much as it looks like a skirt (but <br/>\nisn&#39;t), I&#39;m not afraid to wear a hakama, or Japanese clothing, in public <br/>\nanymore. Like Tom Cruise&#39;s character said in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;-- &quot;I know <br/>\nwhy you&#39;re mad-- they make you wear a dress!&quot; lol! I&#39;m beyond caring whether <br/>\nit looks like a skirt-- in my mind, this is one way that I pay tribute to <br/>\nthe culture and era that I&#39;m studying. Of course I don&#39;t wear them all the <br/>\ntime, but I regularly put them on. As with writing from the POV of the <br/>\nopposite gender, wearing clothing of a different culture opens your eyes and <br/>\nhelps you look at things from a different angle-- like tying your hakama <br/>\nstrings tight so that you don&#39;t trip all over yourself as you climb stairs! <br/>\nlol<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s all for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
