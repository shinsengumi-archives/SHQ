Also, please excuse me for not <br/>\nhaving introduced myself earlier, but work has been very busy. <br/>\nTiffany aka secretarytocapt3 has been kind enough to invite me to <br/>\njoin, and frankly, I am amazed by this group, as well as the SHQ. I <br/>\ndo most of my research in Japanese, so I am sorry to say that I did <br/>\nnot know about this site until she directed me (my loss), so my <br/>\ngratitude to Tiffany. <br/>\nAnd to my embarrassment, she has already promoted my work for me, <br/>\nand I didn&#39;t realise it until today. Oh dear. Well, she says that I <br/>\nhave some readers here, so hello to everyone, and also, why have you <br/>\nnot told me about this place before?! <br/>\nSo, as she already posted the link, I guess, some of you might know <br/>\na bit about me. But just to summarise what you&#39;ll find in the <br/>\nAuthor&#39;s notes and such, I&#39;m Japanese, I am quite obsessed with <br/>\nSaitou, I work for NHK in DC, and I just wanted to say thank you <br/>\nvery much for this wonderful place and letting me join. <br/>\nI can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll be a very active member as the drudgery of <br/>\nwork continues through the weekend for the media, but I really do <br/>\nenjoy people enjoying the Shinsengumi, so I look forward to reading <br/>\nall the messages. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes to all for a lovely weekend, <br/>\n<br/>\nMio (or misaki-toyodome)</div>",
