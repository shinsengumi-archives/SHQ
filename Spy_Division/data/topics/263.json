            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-571605017\">Here&#39;s my answers, sorry I had to add a few to the original choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nClaudia<br/>\n who if she EVER gets over her writers block and actually POSTS to FFN would <br/>\nhave the pen name CEEGEE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) While writing you... ????   I have to add a D. answer, none of the above. <br/>\nCall me old fashioned but I actually WRITE a fic out with pencil and spiral <br/>\nnote pad BEFORE I put it into my computer.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) After writing you... ???? Another D. answer here, once it&#39;s in my computer <br/>\nI send it to my beta reader, I do the proofreading before I put it in my <br/>\ncomputer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>\nb. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick! Finally an <br/>\nanswer I don&#39;t have to add to the quiz!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>\nb. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis <br/>\nand then correct if need be...  Two listed answers in a row!! We&#39;re on a roll <br/>\nhere!<br/>\n<br/>\n5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>\nc. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this <br/>\ngreat idea or if this writers block ever goes away. Unless it&#39;s a one shot, <br/>\nI&#39;ve had the worst case of writers block in history for over two years!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>\nyou...<br/>\nc. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain! Blasted a fore mentioned writers block is <br/>\nmanifested in not getting enough of any ONE fic to actually write so much as <br/>\na chapter!<br/>\n<br/>\n7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you... D. Once I get <br/>\nit back from my beta I post it to whichever group it&#39;s fandom would make it <br/>\nappropriate for, I&#39;ve YET to post anything to FFN. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
