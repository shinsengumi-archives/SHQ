            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-520118618\">&quot;by the early 20th century (1907) Americans had a very good<br/>\nunderstanding of how infectious TB was&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTB has got to be one of the most deadly and prevalent diseases ever. <br/>\nSome people call it the 5,000 year old epidemic.  TB still kills tens <br/>\nof thousands of people each year.  People knew way, way before the <br/>\n20th century how very infectious it was.  The first modern <br/>\ndescription was published in the 1540&#39;s, but it was also described by <br/>\nHippocrates.  That pesky little Mycobacterium genus is fairly young <br/>\n(about 15000 years) and researchers think that its evolution <br/>\nparallels our switch from hunters to farmers.  Mummies dating to <br/>\n3400BCE have been found with it.  In the 1700&#39;s, just about everyone <br/>\nin Europe was probably infected.  In general, there are three stages: <br/>\nfirst is the infection and tubercle formation, but there are very few <br/>\nsymptoms and it is often dismissed as a mild cold (just like in the <br/>\nNHK drama).  The second stage is a dormant stage, that can last from <br/>\nweeks to a life time.  As long as the host remains healthy they may <br/>\nnever show any symptoms.  The third stage is the one we are familiar <br/>\nwith, the tubercles open and the bacteria spread throughout the <br/>\nbody.  In the pulmonary form, sputum and sometimes blood are coughed <br/>\nup.  This is also a means of transmission.  Prior to the 1940&#39;s <br/>\n(development of vaccines and anitbiotics; mostly done in Europe) the <br/>\nmost effective &#39;treatment&#39; was to forestall the 3rd stage and to <br/>\nprevent the spread.  Sanitoriums provided people with quiet, <br/>\nnutritious food (very similar to the orders of that wonderfully <br/>\ncranky doctor in the NHK drama), clean conditions, and were a type of <br/>\nquarantine.  <br/>\nProbably a good number of the folks in the Shinsengumi (and in Kyoto <br/>\nand Edo and any other large city) had an infection, but only poor <br/>\nSoji is described as having the final stage of the pulmonary form.  <br/>\nWho knows when and where he got it?  But I can certainly imagine the <br/>\nliving quarters at Mibu and stress levels leading up the raid on <br/>\nIkeda as being factors causing him to move to that third stage.   <br/>\nGiven how common it was/is I am a little surprised that more men are <br/>\nnot listed as having it.  But there are several other ailments that <br/>\nare actually TB that are often misdiagnosed, so maybe others did have <br/>\nit.  And it is much more tragic in some one so young, which makes a <br/>\nmuch better story, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nThese sites have other interesting historical tidbits <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lung.ca/tb/main.html\">http://www.lung.ca/tb/main.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jantb.com/historytb2.html\">http://www.jantb.com/historytb2.html</a></div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1921115654\">TB was fairly rampant in these days, but the course of TB depends much on individual immunity (which is also influenced by lifestyle and diet).  TB remained a problem in East Asia for decades post-revolution as well.   TB is pretty much infectious only at certain points where a person is actively coughing.... and I don&#39;t recall reading of other Shinsengumi folks with active TB (indicated by coughing and productive, often bloody sputum)?  My guess is that Okita picked this up elsewhere  and much earlier and that it was latent for a time.   Given the extreme conditions and fatigue he encountered while active in the Shinsengumi, it&#39;s possible that the TB eventually overcame his bodies attempts to manage it.  Poor diet could be a contributing factor. (THe Japanese were prone to beri beri, scurvy and other nutritional illnesses.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Has anyone watched Shura No Toki?

I rather like Souji&#39;s TB storyline here (Have gallery of screencaps up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://red-bird.org/Gallery/shura\">http://red-bird.org/Gallery/shura</a> ).

NHK in the beginning does a few time shifts back and forth from the sighting of Perry&#39;s ships to the year leading up to the transferrence to Kyoto.  There were outbreaks reported worldwide of various diseases, and they vary region by region.  My guess, however is that likely we are dealing with smallpox.<br/>\n<br/>\npp 128-9, &quot;The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History&quot; by Donald R.

Emperor Komei died of smallpox on 13 February 1867...  Mutsuhito took the throne name of Meiji in 1868 ... This did not signal the end of smallpox in Japan. Dudgeon (1871) records that barely a year later, a fierce epidemic raged along the entire eastern coast of China... the following winter, the epidemic got even worse, spilling over into Japan, where there were more severe outbreaks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nred-bird.org  | s-girl.deviantart.com</div>",

The next day he tried <br/>\nagain and failed again and was very distressed that he was unable to <br/>\nkill the cat.  Then the next day (the day he died) is when he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;  So sad.  One of the best <br/>\nswordsmen in the Shinsengumi unable to beat his illness and being <br/>\ntormented by that cat.  That&#39;s why I wondered about why the cat kept <br/>\nshowing up in Peacemaker.  Didn&#39;t know if Souji had some history <br/>\nbefore with a cat...<br/>\n<br/>\n            Yep. What is his history with the cat? I think PMK introduced the black cat for that purpose. In the PMK universe, I am betting it has something to do with Sannan, Suzu and Tetsu. But the next book wouldn&#39;t be out for a looong time... <br/>\n<br/>\nHmm...1862.  Before they left for Kyoto.  Are you suggesting that he <br/>\ncontracted TB from someone we know?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n          Um... That&#39;s a fantastic idea! It never occured to me! Will take note of that. But... haha... I was thinking maybe, just maybe, quite a number came down with the first attack the first time. Usually, such attacks are relatively mild and in young healthy individuals would present as little more than a worse than normal flu. After that, most would recover fully with the bacteria latent in the body, while for a select few... well.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n          Just my take on why only Souji got TB despite living in close quarters with other men.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany questions....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          They are very intriguing ones...

I never noticed. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe black cat is given a brief mention in the new Hillsborough book <br/>\n(He wrote that Souji tried twice to kill the cat, but was too weak, <br/>\nand Souji&#39;s last words were &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;) And we saw Souji trying to get the cat in The Last Swordsman too.

But, from my pov and in my stories, there will never be any niggling doubt as to which is more important to Hijikata. Fighting a losing battle? I think Souji would be more miserable if Hijikata just gave up without a fight: he never does things in halves. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHmm...  In our world of fanfic - Of course, Our Toshi would move mountains to be with Our Souji. But, in reality would Toshi want to keep fighting for what they set out to do five years earlier?  Would he be dishonoring his comrades who died during this years long journey to Kyoto and back?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWould Souji be fighting at his side if he wasn&#39;t sick? And, TB is contagious.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n           No question on the first statement. He would definitely go on fighting. TB is contagious. But there is another side to this strange disease. My hypothesis is that Souji had probably contracted it much earlier than we thought. I would put it somewhere around... 1862. No evidence, just gut feeling here for the fanfic world. And not everyone dies of TB. *Hint hint* Souji may not have been the only one with the illness... but he is the only one whose illness lay dormant a few years only to flare up like a dragonhead.

Anyone found the last part <br/>\n </span></blockquote>confusing? It is supposed to be confusing: the reader is supposed to <br/>\nbe as muddled as poor Souji.I would find other alternatives to <br/>\nwriting such death scenes refreshing, so do send me ideas, or even <br/>\nbetter, write them and publish on ff.net. I know Souji is supposedly <br/>\nvery close to Toshi, but Toshi wasn&#39;t there when he died, period. The <br/>\nbig question is why.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Please review if you reading this, all 127 of you. The number is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>quite constant,I realise. I think it is because of the small number <br/>\nof fics in PMK. Everyone reads everything, but there are so few <br/>\nreviews!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, maybe now would be a good time for someone to give an <br/>\nexplanation of the black cat.  That black cat showed up several times <br/>\nin Peacemaker (was it always the same one?) as well as a white one.   <br/>\nThe black cat is given a brief mention in the new Hillsborough book <br/>\n(He wrote that Souji tried twice to kill the cat, but was too weak, <br/>\nand Souji&#39;s last words were &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;) And we saw <br/>\nSouji trying to get the cat in The Last Swordsman too. Is that it, or <br/>\nis there more to the cat story?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming that the question about Toshi is, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t spending <br/>\nSouji&#39;s last days with him be more important than continuing a losing <br/>\nbattle?&quot;  Hmm...  In our world of fanfic - Of course, Our Toshi would <br/>\nmove mountains to be with Our Souji.  But, in reality would Toshi <br/>\nwant to keep fighting for what they set out to do five years <br/>\nearlier?  Would he be dishonoring his comrades who died during this <br/>\nyears long journey to Kyoto and back?  Would Souji be fighting at his <br/>\nside if he wasn&#39;t sick? And, TB is contagious.  Lots of questions.  <br/>\nSounds like some good speculative fanfic here!  (Hint, hint to all <br/>\nour writers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI read all the PMK fics and don&#39;t review.  Guilty as charged.  I <br/>\nappreciate all the talented writers sharing their work and in the <br/>\nfuture will let &#39;em know!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the story Divertimento, and yes, I am confused!<br/>\n<br/>\n--zhusanna</div>",
