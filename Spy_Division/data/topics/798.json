We<br/>\nunderstand how you got confused because he looks like<br/>\na girl, but he is a boy. Feel free to consult with us<br/>\non any Japanese-comic articles you do in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nDarla, 14<br/>\nAntonia, 12 <br/>\nKaitlyn, 12 <br/>\nNew York <br/>\n<br/>\nI go back to that issue (although I check the major<br/>\narticles when the magazine comes out, I rarely get a<br/>\nchance to go through it cover to cover), and for sure,<br/>\nthere it is on page 40, with the caption &quot;Well, hello<br/>\nboys!&quot; And in the background are the Shinsengumi, of<br/>\nwhich Saitou is recognizable. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to laugh. Hello boys indeed! Though, and I may<br/>\nbe accused of condescension, I was just as surprised<br/>\nthat girls so young were actually reading The<br/>\nEconomist. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes and hope everyone is having a good day, <br/>\n<br/>\nMio. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n___________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWin a BlackBerry device from O2 with Yahoo!.
