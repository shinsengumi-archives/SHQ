For example, in &quot;Akizuki Teijiro...&quot; many of<br/>\nus would not know the meanings of the words so Hirotada Tokugawa gave<br/>\na brief explanation.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/art.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/art.htm</a><br/>\nNew Kondou Isami fanart by Hirotada<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/fanficFriendofaFriend.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/fanficFriendofaFriend.htm</a><br/>\nOLD fanfic w/ new  cover<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned this fic before when it was uploaded to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumifics.com\">http://www.shinsengumifics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I found more interesting historical information well after I<br/>\ncompleted the fic which may sort of buttress the fictional scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to say about this fic --- all I know is that<br/>\nhopefully historical Fujita Goro was unaware of the details<br/>\nsurrounding the fight for Kondou&#39;s life. <br/>\n<br/>\nSatsuma was more inclined to save Kondou while Tosa wanted Kondou<br/>\nexecuted based on their belief that the Shinsengumi had murdered Ryoma<br/>\nSakamoto. The strongest voice came from Tosa man Tani Tateki. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I will explain how historically Fujita Goro was always &quot;one spot&quot;<br/>\naway from Tani Tateki the man who really pushed for the death penalty<br/>\nfor Kondou Isami.<br/>\n<br/>\nso here is a diagram (ignore the names in the [middle], just notice<br/>\nhow Fujita Goro is &quot;close&quot; to *Tani).  The relationships are<br/>\nespecially strong in the years right after Fujita Goro retired from<br/>\nthe Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept.<br/>\n<br/>\n#1 [VERY VERY strong connection]<br/>\nFujita Goro (friends w/) Yamakawa Hiroshi (friends w/) Tani Tateki<br/>\n<br/>\n****this is also discussed by Japanese fans, it is well known that<br/>\nFujita Goro spent alot of time at Hiroshi&#39;s house and Tani ALSO was at<br/>\nHiroshi&#39;s home too!<br/>\n<br/>\n****the basis of the fic is based on this strongest connection<br/>\n<br/>\n#2 [weak connection]<br/>\nFujita Goro (friends w/) Takamine Hideo (opposition in career w/) Tani<br/>\nTateki<br/>\n<br/>\n#3 [weakest connection]<br/>\nFujita Goro (employee of) Jigoro Kano (friends w/) Tani Tateki<br/>\n<br/>\nthe diagram implies a LINEAR relationship however I should also add<br/>\nthat Yamakawa Hiroshi (+) Takamine Hideo and (+) Jigoro Kano all<br/>\ninteracted on a professional and personal level extensively as well<br/>\nhowever it is NOT CLEAR if Tani&#39;s memoirs (WHICH CLEARLY STATED HIS<br/>\nINVOLVEMENT WITH KONDOU&#39;s DEATH) was published during Fujita Goro&#39;s<br/>\nlifetime or not OR if the peole in the [middle] such as Yamakawa<br/>\nHiroshi or Takamine Hideo (BOTH OF WHOM KNEW FUJITA GORO was formerly<br/>\na member of the Shinsengumi) read Tani&#39;s own writings. So if the<br/>\npeople in the [middle] knew then surely they would never let Tani and<br/>\nFujita Goro interact even if Mr. Fujita was completely oblivious to<br/>\nTani&#39;s past...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I researched these interaction by examining the educational network<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t help feeling that somehow there is cruel irony involved. (T_T)<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n***coming soon, fanart for Tokio&#39;s page<br/>\n***Yamaguchi Yukiko by Hirotada Tokugawa (niece of Fujita Goro, and<br/>\nstudent at &quot;Tokio&#39;s School&quot;) ok it was not technically &quot;Tokio&#39;s<br/>\nschool&quot; but we&#39;ll call it that to keep things simple<br/>\n<br/>\nTokio + Yamamoto Yaeko (Joushitai) Fanart (housed on the Bakumatsu/Edo<br/>\nArt page)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/edoart.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/edoart.htm</a><br/>\n*I mentioned this on the edojidai mailing list but I guess maybe some<br/>\npeople here want to see Tokio fanart too</div>",
