All mine. HAHAHAHAA<br/>\n<br/>\nAizu Castle<br/>\nApril, Heisei 17 (2005)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe white walls of Aizu Castle rose majestically over the<br/>\nferroconcrete city skyline, lost in their own age-old mystery. A wind<br/>\nblew from the northeast, and all was peaceful, with the air awash in<br/>\nthe scent of spring. In the cemeteries, the ghosts of the men and<br/>\nwomen of old Aizu kept watch over the spirit of the new Aizu. In the<br/>\nfields where life once lay dying, the tall grass was truly &quot;all that<br/>\nremained of warriors&#39; dreams.&quot;<br/>\nPausing on the bridge over the castle moat, Tokugawa Hirotada gazed<br/>\nquietly at the sloping eaves of the tower. The fishlike talismans on<br/>\nthe very top of the highest roof seemed to stretch skyward in a quiet<br/>\nprayer for peaceful rest.<br/>\n&quot;TragicÂ…&quot; he murmured. &quot;Tragic indeed.&quot;<br/>\nHiro felt an urge to stay there, to contemplate the deep sadness of<br/>\nthe castle tower, to let its mystery seep into his soul, but he had a<br/>\njob to do. Tugging smartly at his haori overcoat, he resumed his brisk<br/>\nstride across the bridge, soon passing through the gate and into the<br/>\ninner circle. Directly below the slope of the tower&#39;s stone base sat a<br/>\nshallow pit, with several men and women in dusty clothing digging and<br/>\nbrushing away at the rich brown soil. One of them caught his eye, and<br/>\nhe waved.<br/>\n\t&quot;Hi, Yuki!&quot;<br/>\n\tA short, energetic woman in the deepest part of the pit waved back,<br/>\nbrushing her long bangs away from her eyes.<br/>\n\t&quot;Hi! Be with you in a minute!&quot; Exchanging a short word with the<br/>\nsupervisor, she picked up her cloth shoulderbag and clambered out of<br/>\nthe pit to join him. Exchanging a quiet kiss, they left the inner<br/>\ncircle of the castle, hand in hand.<br/>\n****</div>",
