I had Safety write up a little <br/>\nsomething, a more formal introduction to the Fic site (see below)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumifics.com/\">http://www.shinsengumifics.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCourtesy of Safety:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter some hard work we&#39;re pleased to announce that Shinsengumifics <br/>\nis now active and ready to go!<br/>\n <br/>\nShinsengumifics.com is an original and fan fiction achive in the <br/>\nmodel of other archive sites such as fanfiction.net where authors <br/>\ncan upload and edit stories but unlike ff.net it allows for more <br/>\nthan just Rurouni Kenshin and Peacemaker Kurogane-based stories.  <br/>\nAny Shensengumi universe - RK to the NHK drama, Kaze Hikaru to pure <br/>\nhistorical - is open for all authors to unleash their creativity and <br/>\ntell some great stories about the Shinsengumi.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo come by, register and add your stories!  Or come by and read and <br/>\noffer comments/encouragement to other fic writers - like ff.net <br/>\nthere is a capacity to submit and recieve reviews but unlike ff.net <br/>\nyou may add images (limited).  We look forward to seeing you there.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------<br/>\n<br/>\nTry it out. Since it&#39;s still new, Safety and I would really like to <br/>\nhear your suggestions and/or comments, just send them to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:admin@...\">admin@...</a>. Oh and while I&#39;m at it, I might as well <br/>\nlet you know of my fansite on Saitou but you probably already <br/>\nstumbled upon it one way or the other: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hajimenokizu.com/\">http://www.hajimenokizu.com/</a> <br/>\na smorgasborg of everything with a doujinshi gallery (a highly work <br/>\nin progress page). Now off to contact those listed in the DB and <br/>\nother related sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kizu</div>",
