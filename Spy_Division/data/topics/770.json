However, we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t finish enough of the story to make a new installment of the <br/>\nShinsengumi radio talk show.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo pretend that this is a message on the Shinsengumi answering <br/>\nmachine...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/takedawhining.mp3\">http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/takedawhining.mp3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nnow Takeda turned to speak to a &quot;sensei&quot; who may be...Itou<br/>\n***films such as Gohatto and the story which inspired it are all <br/>\nbased on rumors that Takeda was a homosexual however, we honestly do <br/>\nnot know if that was the case.

And he also <br/>\ntook the lead!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the two kids who made the film are huge fans of all <br/>\nShinsengumi universes. Their design for Nagakura was probably <br/>\ninspired by Peacemaker Kurogane&#39;s Nagakura who has a band-aid on his <br/>\nnose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe creators of the movie really admire Nagakura who took their call <br/>\non the Shinsengumi radio show &quot;Kyokuchou Hour&quot; (episodes can be <br/>\nfound here <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm)\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso information we have on Ikedaya is based on Nagakura&#39;s account <br/>\nso it is funny to have an &quot;exaggerated&quot; account by the captain of <br/>\nthe second squad.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Kikue Mugen<br/>\n&quot;You know, I&#39;m motivated now to create something<br/>\nlike that&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you do!

Many of us have seen the Matrix flying kick <br/>\nparodied over and over again...it is very easy to replicate...in <br/>\nfact one of the jellies (Choshu baddie) is supposed to be suspended <br/>\nin mid-air while trying to attack Kondou. The digital camera would <br/>\nthen rotate around the suspended jelly (and thread airbrushed out <br/>\nlater)...however the tripod for my camera was not stable (kept <br/>\nsagging) and the images came out all a bit crooked so I tossed those <br/>\nfiles. I had planned to have Kondou jump up and slice his attacker <br/>\nand do a slow motion of the jelly sliding out of its container (as a <br/>\nstand in for blood and guts)...I still wish I could do this scene <br/>\nhowever, Kondou is now part of my tuna salad (he is just a boiled <br/>\negg you know).</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1571581245\">So I&#39;m a day late...but that&#39;s because I waited until the egg dye kits<br/>\nwere on sale<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/ShinsenEasterEggs.jpg\">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/ShinsenEasterEggs.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThese Shinsen-Easter Eggs are actually actors in a student film called<br/>\n<br/>\nI-KE-DIE-YA<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich is not yet complete because I&#39;m still constructing the set (my<br/>\nrefrigerator)...as you can tell it is a low budget venture and the<br/>\nother actors are marshmellow peeps (which seem to be the favorite<br/>\nsubject for many short films).<br/>\n<br/>\nWait?  Where&#39;s Okita?  Oh don&#39;t worry he&#39;ll be in the film too.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBefore projects which take up to 3 days to complete I do various<br/>\nbrainstorm collages in video/audio format.  For I-KE-DIE-YA I did the<br/>\nsame thing <br/>\n<br/>\n[warning! 17.6 mb of audio with no script]<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/DVDPROMOfinal2.mp3\">https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/tnamwong/web/DVDPROMOfinal2.mp3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe film makers are students at the Aizu hangakko (domain school)<br/>\nNisshinkan (they are all 10 years old in 1864 so the movie will<br/>\nreflect their inexperience in movie making)...they have big plans for<br/>\nthe movie and are planning a DVD release already---however they are<br/>\nbeing monitored by Aizu&#39;s warrior women the Joushitai<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/WB.htm)\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/WB.htm)</a>. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey make various obscure references to stuff which will be cut out in<br/>\nthe final version (just don&#39;t worry if it is all confusing).  So all<br/>\nof a sudden if someone talks about *Teruhime*--then it is because they<br/>\nare her otaku.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion descended into a fanboy chatter fest which seems to<br/>\nparody every single fan discussion of multiple Shinsengumi universes<br/>\nincluding (RK and PMK). Like many &quot;serious&quot; fan discussions---it gets<br/>\nheated and nasty LOL!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n*Incidentally, Teruhime (Matsudaira Teruko) is -not- Matsudaira<br/>\nKatamori&#39;s wife---she was his adoptive (older) sister. In the world of<br/>\nfiction it is fun to have Katamori have a crush on her (after all they<br/>\naren&#39;t related by blood and she was beautiful).  Please direct<br/>\nquestions on Teruhime to Hirotada Tokugawa.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nI keep trying various methods to create a serious Shinsengumi film and<br/>\nI tried to &quot;warm up&quot; by making a short Byakkotai vid (made with<br/>\nWindows Movie Maker--nothing fancy)<br/>\n<br/>\nthere is a link to the .wmv file<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://community.livejournal.com/edo_meiji/18615.html#cutid1\">http://community.livejournal.com/edo_meiji/18615.html#cutid1</a><br/>\n<br/>\nif you want to leave comments you may do so at the youtube.com page<br/>\nfor the short vid<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1IIo4o3beo\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1IIo4o3beo</a><br/>\n<br/>\nByakkotai Info<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotaiinfo.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotaiinfo.htm</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/byakkotai.htm</a></div>",
