While I found out some<br/>\n&gt;interesting bits of info such as the real Saito and Yamagata and<br/>\n&gt;even Katsura, the others were depressing (no Kenshin!). a friend<br/>\n&gt;even helped me pst my requests for info but all I got were more of<br/>\n&gt;the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That is, until someone mailed me the info I was looking for. No<br/>\n&gt;matter how much I wrote back, he/she never answered. Here is the<br/>\n&gt;summary of what he/she sent me:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hitokiri Batt�-sai - the legendary warrior of Choshu did exist. His<br/>\n&gt;name and true identity was unknown even today except for the fact<br/>\n&gt;that he was called THE Batt�-sai (yep, that&#39;s how the sender said it<br/>\n&gt;should be spelled). He was one of the best warriors unfortunately he<br/>\n&gt;did not reach the customary cult status since no one even knew where<br/>\n&gt;he was buried. There are a few rumors here and there butno<br/>\n&gt;substantial proof. He started as an assassin but became a warrior<br/>\n&gt;after the death of his wife (whom he did not accidentaly kill but<br/>\n&gt;rather died of other circumstances). He became one of the bodyguards<br/>\n&gt;of Kido Tadayoshi known then as Katsura Kogoro. He was never<br/>\n&gt;defeated but he was also not much known probably because of the fact<br/>\n&gt;that only Katsura knew his real identity. After Meiji took over the<br/>\n&gt;government, he offered his sword in a shrine (unnamed) to a person<br/>\n&gt;who gave him another sword in return: the Shin Uchi (Sakabatou were<br/>\n&gt;pretty much in use as an alternative weapon but Batt�-sai used it as<br/>\n&gt;self-defense. Arai Shatku was rumored to be that person but it is<br/>\n&gt;also unconfirmed. We all knew Kawakami Gensai was caught and<br/>\n&gt;executed but we do not know why. Batt�-sai was the reason he fell<br/>\n&gt;(unfortunately again, the sender did not tell me how Batt�-sai<br/>\n&gt;helped). Another note, after the edict forbidding the wearing of<br/>\n&gt;swords Batt�-sai carried his in a sort of bag the way Yahiko does in<br/>\n&gt;Seisouhen. That way, he both did not break the law, and did not<br/>\n&gt;provoke the government soldiers. He settled down and faded into<br/>\n&gt;anonymity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Makoto Shishio - here&#39;s the case: Watsuki said that Himura&#39;s real<br/>\n&gt;life model was Kawakami Gensai. Correction, Kawakami Gensai is more<br/>\n&gt;like Makoto Shishio in the story. They were both isolationists, they<br/>\n&gt;were both unbeaten assassins from Choshu, they were both executed<br/>\n&gt;after the restoration and they fight pretty much the same way.<br/>\n&gt;Makoto Shishio was not and never will be Batt�-sai&#39;s successor. For<br/>\n&gt;one, there are not only one Hitokiri or assassin of Choshu, there<br/>\n&gt;are literally dozens of them. Kawakami Gensai was using Furanui<br/>\n&gt;style Ken-jutsu and not Batt�-juttsu.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu - was a style of Kenjuttsu that originated ryt<br/>\n&gt;after the Battle of Sekigahara. Batt�-sai was reportedly the last<br/>\n&gt;master. The style persists but goes by another name today. The style<br/>\n&gt;was not pure anymore and Hiko of the OVA was telling the truth when<br/>\n&gt;he said that Mitsurugi Ryu ends with him although in real life, it<br/>\n&gt;was Batt�-sai who said those words.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Kagetai - while I doubt that it was Hajime Saito really formed<br/>\n&gt;an assassination/espionage group, towards the end of the<br/>\n&gt;Shinsengumi&#39;s life, Hijikata&#39;s tactics became dirtier, resorting to<br/>\n&gt;assassinations and bribery and even threats. The group was formed in<br/>\n&gt;order to accomplish certain missions that were not approved by the<br/>\n&gt;powers that be (Kondou or Matsudaira or whoever else). They were a<br/>\n&gt;band of mercenaries and/or ronin. And they never exceeded 20. Their<br/>\n&gt;actual name is unkown.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s it. And while there are other info included, I think these<br/>\n&gt;are the things others may be interested, whether you believe them or<br/>\n&gt;not. I am also interested on info about Bakufu Hitokiri. I am<br/>\n&gt;writing a book about Batt�-sai based on what I found out. And maybe<br/>\n&gt;I can borrow some characters from your wonderful group. Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>",
