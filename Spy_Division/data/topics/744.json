Granted, I&#39;m no pro either, but I try <br/>\nmy best. So all I can share is some art, I hope that&#39;s OK.<br/>\nI just uploaded an Okita painting I finished yesterday, but I dunno <br/>\nif I put it under the right folder (it&#39;s in Single Originals, I <br/>\nthink; if it needs to be moved, I hope I didn&#39;t cause too much <br/>\ntrouble ^^;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also added a recent piece of RK fanart. Granted, it&#39;s not <br/>\nshinsengumi, but it does include Saito (my fave character from that <br/>\nseries, yeah); I added it cos I&#39;m pretty proud of the piece, and I <br/>\nwon&#39;t be producing any more related art, as I will now start a Harry <br/>\nPotter piece, which will probably take as long as this one took <br/>\n(couple of weeks, I guess?), and only one art contributed felt too <br/>\nlittle.
