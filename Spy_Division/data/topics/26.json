The address is <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office/\">http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office/</a> .  You don&#39;t have to be <br/>\nan LJ user or a member of the community to look at the site in <br/>\ngeneral... you just can&#39;t read any of the posts (except for my LJ-<br/>\nuser guinea pig, Masayoshi, who&#39;s already a member).  If you can, <br/>\nplease contact me ASAP.  And by posts I don&#39;t necessarily mean the <br/>\nmain entries.  If you see an entry, try getting to the good stuff <br/>\nwhen you click on the link to get what hides behind the lj-cut.  If <br/>\nyou can read either of the stories that are posted there, let me know <br/>\nASAP.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore details about what&#39;s going on, including guidelines and help, <br/>\nare in the document I&#39;ll be uploading into List Business on the LJ <br/>\nCommunity after I post this.  I&#39;m sure a notification will be sent to <br/>\nthe list announcing it&#39;s been uploaded.  Please be sure to read this <br/>\ndocument before you start sending stories up to the LJ.  Please??? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, you&#39;ll get notification that the Main guidelines have been re-<br/>\nuploaded.  In working with archiving, it became necessary to add a <br/>\nline to the header to create key words that will search for stories.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s EXTREMELY limited, but better than nothing.  For now, we&#39;re <br/>\nlimited to 5 key words that use only 40 characters and I&#39;m making <br/>\ncertain demands on them. I want a pen-name, the source material, and <br/>\nthe rating.  For the other two, I&#39;d like to see either the <br/>\nShinsengumi as a whole or a specific member who&#39;s most prominent in <br/>\nthe story for one of the key words and lastly, an indication of genre <br/>\nso people looking for action, romance, angst, yaoi, whatever, can <br/>\nfind things by that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Masayoshi for helping me and for sending me the makoto <br/>\nflag.  I&#39;m going to bed!  I hope...<br/>\n<br/>\npachi</div>",
