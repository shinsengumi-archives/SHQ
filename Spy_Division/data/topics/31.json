One is the one-shot Eiyu, the other being the full text of the completed Fast Carriage on a Runaway Road.  If it still insists on bothering you with a notification, I&#39;m sorry.  If this works (which it appears it will and help get stories transfered to the SHQ website quicker), then I&#39;m freeing up the LJ for general consumption starting tonight.<br/>\n <br/>\nphil<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
