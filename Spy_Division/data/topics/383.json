Light dust falling <br/>\nfrom a dark sky.  I walk and feel it fall on my head, the tingle of <br/>\ncold on my skin and scalp.  The flakes are large and slow.  They <br/>\ngather on the heavy sack I carry over my shoulder  They cling to <br/>\ntrees and ground and cloth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhen I was young, I loved the snow.  I would wait all autumn <br/>\njust for the first falls to come, so that I could go out and play in <br/>\nit.  I would toss it above my head and run with all the exuberance of <br/>\nyouth.  My feet and hands would be numb from hours in it, my mother <br/>\nwould chide me for not coming when called, saying my sniffles and <br/>\nsneezes where what I deserved for not obeying her.  My grandmother <br/>\nwould just shake her head, a slight smile on her face.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tSometimes at night I would sit outside with my grandmother <br/>\nunder the awnings and watch the flakes swirl in the garden.  White <br/>\nclusters to replace the white cherry blossoms.  We would sip our tea, <br/>\nand maybe nibble some little snack she had made.  But we would never <br/>\ntalk.  We would just watch.  One night, I asked her where the snow <br/>\ncame from.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Where does the snow come from Hayasuke?  That is a very old <br/>\nquestion indeed.  I asked my father the same question when I was your <br/>\nage.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Did he know?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Oh yes dear.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;What did he tell you?!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tExcitement and anticipation filled my voice.  The mystery was <br/>\nabout to be solved.  Calmly my grandmother took another sip of tea.  <br/>\nNo hurry.  I felt as if I would burst from containing my eagerness.  <br/>\nShe spoke softly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;One night, after a great snowfall, we were walking home and <br/>\nI asked him your question.  He looked thoughtful for a second, and <br/>\nthen he told me to look in the sky and tell me what I saw.  I looked <br/>\nup and saw nothing but the stars.  I didn&#39;t understand.  He was <br/>\npatient with me, as parents can be with children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tShe took another sip of her tea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;&#39;The stars Yoki, don&#39;t you see&#39;, he said to me.  The stars <br/>\nare fires in the sky, and the snow is their ashes falling to earth.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI was puzzled.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;But grandmother, if the stars are fire, and the snows ash, <br/>\nthen why is it cold?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tShe smiled.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Another question that I asked.  Because you see dear, the <br/>\nstars aren&#39;t like regular fire that we have.  Their special.  The <br/>\nstars are cold fire.  And the snow is their cold ashes.  Cold ashes, <br/>\nfrom cold fire.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tShe stood up with the tea tray and went inside, leaving me to <br/>\nlook at the snow falling to the earth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJust cold ashes from a cold fire, falling on the cold earth.  <br/>\nCold...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSnow melts so easily in blood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe memory is startling the way it appears.  Last year was <br/>\nit?  Two?  In the streets of Kyoto.  He had to be barely half my age, <br/>\nyet he had run at me with his blade.  Ran at me in the snow.  Without <br/>\nthought, I cut him down and watched him bleed.  Watched as the <br/>\nsteaming red blood melted the snow.  The life left his eyes and <br/>\nbecame cold.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCold world.  The cold world of a dead mans eyes.  Blood in <br/>\nthe snow.  Ashes of a cold fire.  Dead mans eyes.  Bloody snow.  Cold <br/>\nfire.  Dead...  Bloody...  Cold...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI shake myself from the trance with a start.  So vivid the <br/>\nvisions, the memories.  Where am I?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn front of an inn.  It&#39;s small and looks empty.  Yet light <br/>\ncomes from within.  Not totally empty.  I walk up too the door and <br/>\ncall out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Hello?  I want a room for the night!  Anyone around?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI hear movement from within.  Slow and lazy.  An older man <br/>\nopens the door, holding a lantern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;My, my, my.  What are you doing out in this weather son?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Walking.&quot;  I shuffle my feet impatiently.  &quot;Might I come <br/>\nin?  It&#39;s cold out here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe steps aside to let me pass.  I slip off my shoes and move <br/>\ninto the main chamber.  A fires going in the pit, a pot simmering <br/>\nover it, cushions gathered around.  No one else here it seems.  I <br/>\ngently lower my sack.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Its rather late son.  You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m a night owl; <br/>\notherwise I might not have heard you.  Want a room you said?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;A room and a hot meal if I can get it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;What do you think the pot is?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;How much?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe names his price.  I pay it, not caring to haggle.  A wave <br/>\nof hunger has come over me.  He serves me my food, the rice still <br/>\nhot.  I eat in silence with the old man.  He keeps stealing looks at <br/>\nme though.  I pretend not to notice.  He pours us tea after we <br/>\nfinish, sitting around the fire.  He clears his throat to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;So friend, where do you come from?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI stare into the fire as I answer his question, watching the <br/>\nflames dance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Kyoto.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Kyoto?!  My, but you&#39;ve walked quite a ways then haven&#39;t <br/>\nyou?&quot;  I shrug.  He falls silent, staring into the flames with me <br/>\nbefore he speaks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;You fought there?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI nod my head in response.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;What was it like?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy voice is a whisper.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Hell.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe are quiet for a very long time after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n                            * * * *<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI ate breakfast with the old man in the morning before <br/>\nstarting out.  The snow has stopped but the sky is still gray.  The <br/>\npath is growing slightly steeper now.  Entering the mountains.  I <br/>\nremember my last words with the old man.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Where are you planning on going?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI point up the road I&#39;ve been walking.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Where ever this path takes me I guess.  I really don&#39;t care.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHis expression twisted into one of fear.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;You mustn&#39;t go that way.  That way leads only to death.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;That mountain is cursed with death.  It&#39;s said that so much <br/>\nblood has been shed there, the streams run red.  What evil it truly <br/>\nis up there, I can&#39;t tell you not, no one knows.  The only people <br/>\nthat live up there are crazy or cursed or both.  You mustn&#39;t go that <br/>\nway.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI loop up the road which he tells me to avoid.  It stretch&#39;s <br/>\noff into the dead forest that covers the mountain.  Dark and <br/>\nuninviting.  Perhaps the old man is right, there&#39;s a branching path <br/>\nthat leads away in another direction.  I could take it and avoid <br/>\nwhatever superstition he&#39;s feeding me.  Or at least a hard uphill <br/>\nwalk.  But still...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI turn and smile for the first time in days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Sorry old man, I&#39;ll keep going this way.  I&#39;ve never been <br/>\none too take the easy way in life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith that I started walking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Thanks for the food and the company!&quot;  <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI wave over my shoulder, not looking back.  He calls out <br/>\nafter me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;You&#39;ll be sorry, trust me!  You shouldn&#39;t go that way!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe falls silent.  I continue walking, not looking back.  Then <br/>\nI hear him faintly behind me again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;May the gods watch over you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGods.  What gods in this cold world are there, but cold <br/>\nstatues?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI continue walking.</div>",
