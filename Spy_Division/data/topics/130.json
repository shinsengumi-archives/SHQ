To me, it&#39;s really as simple as that.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really like that quote, MissB!<br/>\n <br/>\nIt has always been my understanding that in fanfiction in particular (or maybe I should just say &quot;amateur&quot; fiction), it was all about writing what you wanted to write or maybe experiment with and then you *SHARED* it with others. Differences in opinion became *DISCUSSION* that could lead in all kinds of directions, among them rewrites of a story or entirely new stories.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor me, *bad* writing is constant grammar and spelling errors (with leeway given to the non-native English writer, but not carte blanche), pure rewrites of scenes from the source material that doesn&#39;t add anything, characters WILDLY OOC (Saitou as a flaming queen, constantly worrying about his nails, every little speck on his uniform, exaggerated swishing... a character someone like Nathan Lane might play --- sorry, I can&#39;t buy it... well, maybe if it&#39;s an outrageous parody or somesuch), and a refusal on the part of an author to learn from past mistakes (talking about simple rules of writing, like how to use paragraphs, appropriate punctuation, verb tenses) when I know in reason such things have been pointed out to them.  I *want* to know about anything a reader thinks is wrong with a story of mine... I may not agree with them, it may be an issue of style for me (for instance, I was taught to write complex sentences that were interspersed with short ones, which some readers don&#39;t<br/>\n like...&lt;shrug&gt;... others do like it), or a suggestion may do something to the story I don&#39;t want (maybe the thing I get the most comments about is my habit of very brief, minimal introductions... the person making the comment tends to want all the facts up front when what I&#39;m trying to do is set a mood or plant an idea that will become clear in the story proper... I don&#39;t want the facts known from the first, either because it will spoil a surprise or minimalize something I want a character to experience... it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been thinking about whether or not to stop doing... knowing me, I probably won&#39;t, but rather look at ways at trying to make it more successful).  BUT, I appreciate the interaction with a reader.  What they disagree with tells me a lot and I do give what is said a lot of thought, but ultimately, I write for myself in hopes that someone else will enjoy the interlude.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd don&#39;t go by lack of comments as a sign that no one is reading or enjoying what you&#39;re writing.  Most people just consume (or may be like me, who can&#39;t read while they&#39;re writing... I now have a list of stories about as long as I am tall that I want/need to read when writer&#39;s block sets in for a long, cold winter spell).  If you had access to a hit count on a story, you&#39;d be amazed.  (Adultfanfic.net has a hit count and I think ff.net does as well with paid accounts.)<br/>\n <br/>\nYou write what *YOU* want to write.  Otherwise, where&#39;s the cream filling?  (sorry... I forget we&#39;re international and you may not be familiar with Twinkies or Twinkies commercials...)<br/>\n <br/>\nphil (feeling surprisingly okay tonight...)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2125735061\">Okay... I just thought about this after answering Tiffany&#39;s post on <br/>\nwriting...<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of you have been writing for a while and I know of at least one <br/>\nwho writes for a living, so I need your opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst let me establish that I hate creative writing in school, was <br/>\nmore of a math person. Now though, I write for enjoyment (primarily <br/>\nfor myself) and I write on whim. This leads to sometimes weird story <br/>\nlines in my chapters and no research whatsoever. Sounds real bad <br/>\nhuh? I try to be historically correct but sometimes my stories just <br/>\ndon&#39;t want it that way. I like alternate pairings. I like OOCness. I <br/>\nlike comedy (although am extremely bad at it). All of these appears <br/>\nin my writing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never really think about my reader since only a chosen few would <br/>\nread my stories so I go with what I feel is right. Anything that <br/>\nwill entertain me is my motto. Yes I know I&#39;m very egoistic *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is that all so bad? Should I change? *cries and runs away*</div>",
