Do <br/>\nyou think I should have a separate rating for each yaoi and not group <br/>\nthem?<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso another issue I&#39;m having is the characters... Basically since I <br/>\nwant it to be a Shinsengumi site, the most popular (or at least I <br/>\nthink they&#39;re popular) miburo members are there and I grouped all the <br/>\nRK characters together in &quot;other RK&quot;. There is no specifics as to <br/>\nKenshin, Kauro, Sano, Aoshi etc... I was thinking of adding <br/>\na &quot;Harada&quot;/&quot;Sanosuke&quot; but someone commented that it was probably not <br/>\na good idea as they should not be confused. *sigh*<br/>\n <br/>\nSo basically if you wanted to find a SaitouxSano story or Saitou x <br/>\nmale for the matter you just have to settle for filtering for Saitou <br/>\nand Yaoi. Does anyone have any suggestions. There are a number of <br/>\nYaoi stories now on the site but it&#39;s fine if I have to go and change <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease take a look at how the site is presented in the details <br/>\nsection and the search/add functions...
