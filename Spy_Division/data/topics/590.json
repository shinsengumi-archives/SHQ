I happened to read the manga and see the anime episode <br/>\nconcerning the haiku at about the same time.  Hopefully, I will soon <br/>\nbe able to stop giggling madly whenever I see a french fry or a dill <br/>\npickle at the lunch table.  It is starting to make my co-workers a <br/>\nlittle nervous.<br/>\n  <br/>\n     So, in saner moments, what I am wondering:  was his haiku really <br/>\nall bad?<br/>\n<br/>\n      I remember studying the boys in baby blue in school, but there <br/>\nwas not mention of the haiku.  I have only seen the 1998 TV series and <br/>\nit was only mentioned in passing there.  I think Kondo&#39;s comment was <br/>\nsomething like &quot;....well you are improving...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n      I know very little about haiku, so any info. would be welcome.</div>",
