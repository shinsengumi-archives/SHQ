            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1611761369\">Hi Grace! <br/>\n<br/>\nA questionnaire is always a good idea I just love questionnaires! <br/>\nHere are my answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1) While writing you... ????<br/>\n&gt;a. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts <br/>\n&gt;are finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.<br/>\n&gt;b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever<br/>\n&gt;c. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, <br/>\n&gt;oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely (b). Strangely, I always find it easier to have new ideas <br/>\nwhile walking or doing anything else. You have no idea of how many <br/>\ntimes I leave the room, do something else, and then come back running <br/>\nto add my latest idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;2) After writing you... ????<br/>\n&gt;a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important <br/>\n&gt;than Proof-read!<br/>\n&gt;b. One quick read. I&#39;m confident enough in my work.<br/>\n&gt;c. Oh who needs to check? It&#39;s too late. I wrote and posted the <br/>\n&gt;thing already!&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely (a). After the first draft is written, I put the chapter <br/>\naside for a whole week. Then I come back and almost completely re-<br/>\nwrite it, and put the chapter aside for another week. And then Well, <br/>\nI think that you get a clear idea by now that this re-writing process <br/>\ncan be repeated many times before I&#39;m finally satisfied. Then the <br/>\nchapter goes to the beta-reading stage and when it comes back, there <br/>\nis generally another series of re-writes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>\n&gt;a. Oh that&#39;s nice. I&#39;ll check it in a bit. *feels good*<br/>\n&gt;b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!<br/>\n&gt;c. Review... Well that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(b) I&#39;m thrilled when I receive reviews and I have to read them right <br/>\naway. But when the review alerts follows a very harsh critic, then <br/>\nI&#39;m a bit anxious and hesitate before opening the review, although <br/>\nwhile actually reading it, I forget about my fears. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>\n&gt;a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!<br/>\n&gt;b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there&#39;s any basis <br/>\n&gt;and then correct if need be...<br/>\n&gt;c. What? You didn&#39;t like it. Oh! I&#39;ve got to fix that quick!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When the critique is justified, and when I&#39;m truly mistaken, I will <br/>\nacknowledge the fact and try to make the necessary changes. But <br/>\nunjustified or unfair critiques really morally affect me. After I <br/>\nreceive such a thing, it generally takes me days before writing <br/>\nanything again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>\n&gt;a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!<br/>\n&gt;b. I&#39;ll update exactly one week from now. There&#39;s got to be a <br/>\n&gt;defined routine.<br/>\n&gt;c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this <br/>\n&gt;great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(c) without any doubts. When was the last time I updated? Two months <br/>\nago?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>\n&gt;you...<br/>\n&gt;a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written <br/>\n&gt;now!<br/>\n&gt;b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it&#39;s more convenient.<br/>\n&gt;c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Generally (b) I have difficulties writing without have a very, very <br/>\nclear idea of the plot. I tried that the other week, but the re-<br/>\nwriting process is very painful. The fic is full of plot-holes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent... So you...<br/>\n&gt;a. Post on every message board, yahoo group and even e-mail close <br/>\n&gt;(not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need to <br/>\n&gt;read ASAP or else!<br/>\n&gt;b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement <br/>\n&gt;in a community where you are an active member or popular<br/>\n&gt;c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your fic <br/>\n&gt;in the depths of ff.net.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(c) I fear to annoy people by making such an announcement, so I just <br/>\nhope that miraculously people will notice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary-Ann (^-^)</div>",

I&#39;m always taking little breaks, but I also drink soda/water/tea and tend to chain smoke while I write.  There&#39;s also one more thing that tends to happen --- I usually have to stop here and there and do some research... either checking through notes or list messages, do some googling, or review a scene or episode... or I stop for a little refueling (inspiration) by searching for certain images (screencaps) looking for expressions or moods in a character (can we say &quot;excuse just to stare at RK Saitou&quot;?).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;2) After writing you... ????<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a.

Sometimes I desperately need to get something out of my system and I don&#39;t want to wait for fear I&#39;ll lose the momentum or the mood (or it just refuses to rest).  Sometimes it does me a lot of good to give myself a schedule because of the dysthymic disorder (though I&#39;m less successful at sticking to a schedule).  Most often I update as the mood strikes me... in other words, when I can write.  Finishing &quot;Fast Carriage&quot; was torture, and yesterday&#39;s chapter of &quot;Yasou&quot; went *VERY* slowly.  If I hadn&#39;t felt a deep need to get something out after Tiffany brought it up, it wouldn&#39;t have gotten done; consequently writing what was left of what I had started ages ago took hours of stops and starts.  (And why it went out even though I wasn&#39;t entirely happy with it... I *needed* to get it out.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you...<br/>\na.

Baka Brain!&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above.  I&#39;ve been known to get up in the wee hours of the morning just because I&#39;ve awakened with an idea, turned on the computer, and stared writing.  I also keep a notebook beside the futon (yes, I sleep on the floor on a futon) and will jot things down, usually snippets of dialogue.  The cats *HATE* it when I do this because it often ends up being a series of get up, turn on the light, scribble something, turn off the light, lay back down, get up, turn on the light... until I finally run out of ideas or decide to just get up permanently, turn on the computer and write (which they hate even more).  Every time a new story idea pops into my head (which is all the time), I sigh deeply with great agitation --- the last thing I need is a new story idea with so many stories already started or in fragments.  :-D<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;7) You published something, you think it&#39;s decent...

Though I tend not to email people privately and I don&#39;t tend to think of any of my writing in those terms (i.e. great).  I hope people will read it, but I don&#39;t expect them to.  I might be more inclined to email some people privately if ff.net didn&#39;t have the author alert feature (when it&#39;s working, that is), just to give them a heads-up.  Most of my stories end up on ff.net and a few select communities.

(Which reminds me, something else that would be interesting to read others comment on is how they feel about multiple stories in progress --- do they avoid it stringently or do they just let stories start as they come or ???
