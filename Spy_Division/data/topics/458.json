That description is all people have to go on when you upload there and don&#39;t post the story to the list itself.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd those with graphic skills, please be sure to load images to the Photos section and not in the Files.  Phoebe, your absolutely gorgeous drawing of the Shinsengumi has been moved to the Single Originals folder under Photos.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks!
