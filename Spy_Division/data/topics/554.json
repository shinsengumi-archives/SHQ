This one is a bit more historically accurate.<br/>\nComments, please!<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthor�s note: Second installment, much more historically accurate. Will <br/>\npost a list of the women of the Brigade soon.  Happy reading!<br/>\n<br/>\nKyoto<br/>\nSummer 1864<br/>\n<br/>\nThe door of the inn flew inward with a crash. The swirling dust and rain <br/>\nobscured the entrance for but a moment, before the waiting forms outside <br/>\nbecame visible. As the leader stepped inside, his white sleeve insignia with <br/>\nthe black letter �Ai� on it could plainly be seen by one and all. The <br/>\nshopkeeper�s face contorted. He shuddered in fear for a moment, noting the <br/>\nwaiting soldiers outside carrying spears and guns.<br/>\n<br/>\n�We�re being sear�� his words ended with the squish of steel through flesh.<br/>\n<br/>\n�I am Yamamoto Kakuma of Aizu-han!� the squad leader brandished his sword, <br/>\nstained with fresh blood, at the cowering commoners. �We come on official <br/>\nbusiness!� The others poured in, the stamping of their boots resounding <br/>\nthroughout the building as some  spread out to secure the ground floor while <br/>\nthe rest bounded up the stairs. There was a ghastly stillness for a moment, <br/>\nand then a bloody heap fell down the stairs. They were right�there were <br/>\nShishi here, just like the spy report had said. Just as Yamamoto started to <br/>\nturn, there was a blur of motion.<br/>\n<br/>\n�Choshu!!�<br/>\n<br/>\nHe began to turn, blade hissing outward in a flash of light, before a loud <br/>\ncrack resounded in the dead air�Yamamoto only saw the dead body just as his <br/>\neyes began to adjust. At the far side of the room, one of his men leaned <br/>\nback with the kick of his smoking rifle. The remaining men and women, most <br/>\nprobably employees, cowered in shock.<br/>\n<br/>\n�Resist and you will all pay the consequences! Cooperate and the law will be <br/>\nlenient!�<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unit from the upper floor pounded down the stairs, kicking along a <br/>\ncouple of bound and struggling men. Yamamoto nodded, and pointed to the <br/>\nothers on the floor. �You, you, and you, tie these people up and take them <br/>\nto Kurotani for questioning. You and you, board up the entrance and go <br/>\ninform the Kuwana troops at Nijo. And you�� he pointed at the young soldier <br/>\nwho�d been so quick to shoot. �With me. Now.� With a sharp cleaning whip to <br/>\nhis sword, he sheathed and turned to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe young soldier quickly fell in step next to Yamamoto as he emerged.<br/>\n<br/>\n�It stopped raining�� he shook his head. With his men in tow, he started on <br/>\nthe long road back to Aizu headquarters.<br/>\n<br/>\n�I did good, didn�t I?� asked the soldier with a slight cough. �Damn, it�s <br/>\nso hard to keep my voice low.�<br/>\n<br/>\n�Yae�� he whispered, keeping his own voice low. �Your technique is��<br/>\n<br/>\n�Clean?�<br/>\n<br/>\nYamamoto turned to his�sister, and proffered a hand towel from under his <br/>\nbreastplate. �I don�t know what to call it, but I guess�� She wiped her <br/>\nforehead and returned it to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n�You�re like the Murasaki Shikibu of gunnery.�<br/>\n<br/>\n�Does that mean I outdo you? Murasaki was better than her brother at <br/>\nwriting, you know��<br/>\n<br/>\n�Just shut up, Yae. People will stare.�<br/>\n<br/>\n�Haha�I�m better than you!�<br/>\n<br/>\n�Save it for the demonstration before Lord Katamori tomorrow.�<br/>\n<br/>\n�You�re on!�<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nGlossary and Notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n-han: suffix meaning �feudal domain�<br/>\n<br/>\n-Murasaki Shikibu was an 11th century poet and author of the world�s first <br/>\nnovel (The Tale of Genji), who outdid her brother in an age when women were <br/>\nsupposed to be very sparsely educated.</div>",
