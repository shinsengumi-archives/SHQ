Some of you may be asking what is so disturbing about it. Well, it&#39;s not the yaoi! It&#39;s Hijikata and Toudou! Hijikata looks NOTHING like himself. He has weird brown hair. (Think Saito&#39;s aku-detecting hair.) And Toudou likes like an evil Keebler&#39;s elf in that one pic of him in the &quot;characters&quot; section! Tell me that&#39;s not disturbing. The only saving grace is that Kondou actually looks pretty good for once...<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin</div>",
