            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1828257066\">Hi Barb,<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me it&#39;s a definite yes, but you know me already as not really <br/>\nadhering to what&#39;s in history, opting for something more <br/>\nromanticized... Of course the main pull for me is the setting and <br/>\nthe Shinsengumi, even if I am out of the age group you mentioned... <br/>\nLOL! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether it&#39;s ebook or not, my opinion on that when it comes to <br/>\nprice is ebooks should be cheaper than the paperback edition. Also <br/>\nwhat format would the ebook be? You can reach a lot of pocketpc/palm <br/>\nusers by making sure it&#39;s compatible with mobipocket or better yet <br/>\nMicrosoft Reader which I think has versions for both Desktop and <br/>\nPPC. However if it was available in my local store, then I&#39;d go out <br/>\nof my way to the brick and mortar store. It&#39;s nice to hold something <br/>\nsubstantial in my hand and not be bothered with opening the PC or <br/>\nreading it in a PDA. So if price isn&#39;t such a big difference and I <br/>\ncan get a hold of the paperback, I&#39;d get the paperback.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kizu<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com\">SHQ_Spy_Division@yahoogroups.com</a>, BarbaraSheridan <br/>\n&lt;bsher213@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello everyone!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since the list has been pretty quiet I thought I&#39;d clog your <br/>\n </span></blockquote>inboxes <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with  a bit of a reader survey.
