Well, we need more of both. I&#39;ve been chatting with <br/>\nBarb and I&#39;m going to attempt to come up with some humor stuff for <br/>\nour website. Those two posts seem like as good a place to start as <br/>\nany.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the other topics I&#39;m considering is some sort of Shinsengumi <br/>\nLife Lessons category. So yeah, I need input for that as well. If <br/>\nanyone has anything they want to contribute please post it to the <br/>\nlist or e-mail me ASAP. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n-MissBehavin (Digging herself deeper into the hole by taking on new <br/>\nprojects.)</div>",
