Even the abbreviation is attractive, S.O.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does it mean?  It means just what it says.  If you&#39;re into yaoi, <br/>\nyuri, or whatever gender samurai&#39;s get on one another for, S.O.S. <br/>\nwill definitely &#39;cover&#39; your desires for good samurai love and <br/>\nrelationship stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now the site is brand-new, however, you can get to the on-line <br/>\nGojou story that features pairs such as Saitou and Sano, Kenshin and <br/>\nAoshi, and others. Naughty little story if you like &#39;sizzling&#39; <br/>\nsamurai romance. It is so naughty it is rated M17.  A little too hot <br/>\nand hard for people younger than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo please come and take a peek at how the site is looking.  Mind you, <br/>\nall we have up is the home page, but you also can find information <br/>\nlinks on the site as well.  Just thought I&#39;d share this now in its <br/>\nearly stages, and if you have comments or suggestions, by all means, <br/>\nshare your samurai thoughts with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay dokey?<br/>\nArigatou gosaimasu.</div>",
