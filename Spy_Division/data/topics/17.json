            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1936720645\">Thanks to Barb mentioning something about keeping text and image <br/>\nfiles separate on the SHQ site, I realized I&#39;d made a fatal error... <br/>\nnothing new, I do it all the time.  I had image folders in the files <br/>\nsection and she&#39;s absolutely right about wanting to keep them <br/>\nindependent.  SOOOO...  In the photos section you will find various <br/>\nalbums all sitting clean and new and ready to take images.  Just so <br/>\nwe can find things, the albums are:<br/>\n<br/>\nDoujinshi scans --- images from doujinshi published by non-members <br/>\nyou find delightful or inspiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoujinshi Originals --- doujinshi created by members of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nManga Scans --- same as for doujinshi, but for manga.<br/>\n<br/>\nManga Originals --- manga created by members.<br/>\n<br/>\nIllustrations --- scans of illustrations or calligraphy from books<br/>\n<br/>\nScreencaps --- captures from the various anime, films, and other <br/>\nmoving picture formats.<br/>\n<br/>\nSingle Originals --- the one-shots of the art world, pictures created <br/>\nby members that are meant to stand alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I leaving out any other formats?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a group of images (posting up an original manga or <br/>\ndoujinshi, for instance, would be in several separate uploads), <br/>\ncreate an album within the album it belongs in, giving your album the <br/>\ntitle of the piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the next few days, the guidelines will change again... this time <br/>\noriented towards art.  For now, I&#39;m going to try to leave you guys <br/>\nalone, stop bugging you.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRK &#39;Jime, pachi, phil... take your pick</div>",
