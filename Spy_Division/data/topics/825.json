            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-252270049\">Hi everyone. Here&#39;s a sample of MIrror, Mirror the timetravel novel<br/>\nfeaturing members of the Shisnengumi. The book is due out in e-book format<br/>\nMay 12 and in a paperback version sometime in July...<br/>\n<br/>\n* * * *<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat in musty, dark storage room off the kitchens and wondered how much<br/>\ntime had passed since Hijikata had me placed in here to await Kaemon&#39;s<br/>\narrival. I glanced toward the tiny barred window at the far end of the shed<br/>\nbut couldn&#39;t really see the sky. It seemed that it was just beginning to<br/>\nlighten but then there had been a few large paper lanterns strung around the<br/>\ncompound so I wasn&#39;t quite sure about the light or its source.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to erase the image of Kaemon&#39;s furious expression from my mind. Why<br/>\ndid he blame me? It wasn&#39;t as if I planned to have all that stuff happen.<br/>\nOkay, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have gone busting through the Inamoto-ro but I&#39;d<br/>\nbeen scared. Those gorilla guys were after me and I didn&#39;t even want to<br/>\nthink about what their slimy little boss had planned for me back at his<br/>\nplace. It was obvious that he had me pegged for some new male prostitute or<br/>\nother, but once they found out I was a girl, there was no telling what they<br/>\nwould have done.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was I supposed to do? Let them take me or try to go politely in the<br/>\nbrothel and asked sweetly for Kaemon to come to the door and reason with the<br/>\ngorillas?<br/>\n<br/>\nLike that would have worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sighed and leaned back against a pile of rice sacks. I closed my eyes<br/>\nwhile sending silent farewells back to Uncle Jake, my mother and<br/>\ngrandparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagined the tombstone:<br/>\n<br/>\nHere Lies Emmi Maeda, Executed A Century Before She was Born<br/>\n<br/>\n** * * **<br/>\n<br/>\nThough Kaemon pretended to rest in the palanquin that took him from the<br/>\nImperial Palace to Mibu, he covertly peered across the carriage to his<br/>\ncompanion and personal retainer, Kishi Matsuyama, who had been conspicuously<br/>\nabsent during the incident at *Inamoto-ro*.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupposedly he&#39;d been so occupied with one of the new whores, Matsuyama<br/>\nhadn&#39;t realize he&#39;d returned unexpectedly with Aneko and was involved in the<br/>\ncommotion. That account did not agree with the one from off-duty Shinsengumi<br/>\ncaptain Kanryussai Takeda.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe palanquin stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My Lord,&quot; Matsuyama said. &quot;We&#39;ve arrived.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKae sat up and made a show of rubbing the sleep from his eyes then followed<br/>\nhis retainer out of the carriage. They entered the Shinsengumi compound<br/>\nwhere the chief officers and a few of the captains waited.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing an imperceptible nod of Kaemon&#39;s head, Toshizou Hijikata<br/>\ninstructed two of his men to escort Matsuyama away.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;M-my Lord-&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No one betrays me, Matsuyama, and lives. No one.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose softly spoken words chilled me to the bone as I was led past the man I<br/>\nrecognized as Kaemon&#39;s friend who&#39;d gotten us out of the brothel the night I<br/>\narrived.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw the man struggle only to be knocked to the ground and bound with rope<br/>\nthen dragged away to a darkened corner. Light glinted off a katana blade as<br/>\nit sliced through the air seconds after Kaemon&#39;s former friend cried out.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Your turn,&quot; Hijikata muttered as I was led past him and toward Chief<br/>\nKondou&#39;s quarters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gagged and raised my  bound hands to my mouth as my stomach churned.<br/>\n Kondou read the same list of charges that Hijikata had read while Kaemon<br/>\nstared at me with the same deadly expression that he&#39;d worn when condemning<br/>\nhis friend to death only moments ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~Chloe Michelle<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chloemichelle.com\">http://chloemichelle.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/emmi_kae\">http://www.myspace.com/emmi_kae</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chloe-michelle.livejournal.com/\">http://chloe-michelle.livejournal.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
