            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-906632452\">&quot;We are living in the Kali Yuga,&quot; Hijikata shifted under the thin black <br/>\nrayon blanket and looked towards Okita who laid next to him exhausted.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lieutenant,&quot; the young captain inhaled his lover&#39;s scent, &quot;what is a Kali <br/>\nYuga?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Endless years of evil.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkita&#39;s eyes moved down Hijikata&#39;s profile, studying the skin coated with <br/>\na mist of perspiration and the  strong neck and shoulders he had clung <br/>\nto only moments earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are many terms for it in different religions and histories.  Simply, <br/>\nit is a time great shifts and destruction.  For instance, at the end of <br/>\nChina&#39;s Han dynasty, the country experienced an upheaval and three <br/>\nmen swore an oath of loyalty to one another amongst peach blossoms <br/>\nscattering in the wind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe captain turned away and mumbled, &quot;What happened to those <br/>\nwarrior brothers Hijikata?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata flipped open a lighter and watched the still flame.  He wondered <br/>\nif there is truth to the statement that the center of the fire is actually <br/>\ncool...and peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Is any of this necessary?&quot;  Matsudaira Katsumori pushed his slightly <br/>\ntinted glasses up his nose as his assistants hovered near him carrying <br/>\nhis briefcase and even his tested meals.  He has never traveled as a <br/>\ncommoner in a city he has sworn to protect.  The daimyo of A-han <br/>\nlooked at the unmarked vehicle with disdain and he could sense that his <br/>\nown security would be insulted by the innovation of having  Shinsengumi <br/>\nprovide additional protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou bowed and placed his hand on the luxury vehicle caressing the <br/>\nblack hide, &quot;under the outer body are additional layers of armor which <br/>\ncan withstand even explosives,&quot;  he walked alongside the car he plans to <br/>\nchauffeur, &quot;resilient bullet proof glass, run-flat tires...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Let me guess the rocket launcher emerges from the sun-roof?&quot;  <br/>\nYamagawa, one of Matsudaira&#39;s aides coughed.  &quot;Will there be room for <br/>\nany of us?  Where are our vehicles?&quot;  Yamagawa pointed to himself and <br/>\nhis fellow guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My goal is to escort Matsudaira-sama undetected.  An entourage would <br/>\nonly blow our cover.&quot;  The Shinsengumi captain smiled, &quot;As for the <br/>\nrocket launcer,&quot; he opened the back door for the daimyo, &quot;We can <br/>\nalways put in a special request at the Temple of Light Hoko-in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I will not use a vehicle made by foreigners.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou nearly prostrated himself, &quot;Your eyes cannot be deceived.  Hoko-<br/>\nin engineers have atleast altered the exterior to look like a Japanese car <br/>\nand added more security improvements.  The vehicle was smuggled into <br/>\nour country piece by piece at the insistence of the government after the <br/>\nunfortunate....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMatsudaira held up his hand, &quot;Yes I recall the assassination of the <br/>\nofficial.  His entourage should not have stopped.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We will keep moving regardless of the circumstances my lord,&quot;  Saitou <br/>\nhumbly replied.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatsumori stretched his legs in the roomy interior, &quot;I have business with <br/>\nthe Imperial Officials.  There is no time to waste,&quot; he looked back at his <br/>\nworried A-han  attendants as the vehicle left the garage.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata did not notice that Okita had fallen into a deep sleep, but he <br/>\ncontinued the story.  &quot;One by one the brothers of the Peach Garden Pact <br/>\ndied pathetically until finally their ideals became a memory as the era <br/>\ncontinued on without them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe reached over and picked up his PDA to monitor Saitou and <br/>\nMatsudaira&#39;s whereabouts.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My favorite warrior brother was Guan Yu, but he was the first to die.&quot;  <br/>\nHe glanced at Okita&#39;s back and grinned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lieutenant knew that Shinsengumi headquarters was full of devices <br/>\nrecording his every move, every word to ensure his loyalty.  What&#39;s to <br/>\nsay Hijikata did not have someone watching A-han?<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAn elderly cafe owner opened the cash register and shook before the <br/>\nmen sporting light jackets with  infamous Shinsengumi badges, &quot;Sirs, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have cash, my wife must&#39;ve taken it all the bank already.&quot;  He tried <br/>\nto back away but strong hands held his collar.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Your cafe has been identified as a business which disseminates anti-<br/>\ngovernment propaganda via the internet,&quot;  Niimi Nishiki swiped a laptop <br/>\nfrom a small round table sending it crashing to the floor.  He told his <br/>\nminion to release the old man and he stepped in closer and brushed <br/>\naside his jacket to display his gun, &quot;Even if your woman has taken the <br/>\nmoney perhaps you have something else to offer us?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNiimi turned to a young waitress who ran into the store from the <br/>\nsupplies room.  She screamed as a Shinsengumi grabbed her wrist and <br/>\ntwisted her arm after she activated a silent alarm under the counter.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hm?&quot;  Saitou knew the protocol for answering messages on the radio <br/>\nbut whoever called him should know he had an assignment tonight.  He <br/>\nglanced in the rear view mirror.  Matsudaira was obsessively reviewing <br/>\nhis schedule on his laptop.  No wonder few people placed faith in <br/>\nKatsumori&#39;s leadership skills.  The daimyo looked more like a CEO of a <br/>\nmajor dot com corporation than a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe captain adjusted the hands free device as he maneuvered the car <br/>\nthrough the Kyoto evening traffic, &quot;Busy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dispatcher went silent and Hijikata&#39;s voice grabbed Saitou&#39;s <br/>\nattention, &quot;Just drive past the Himeya and see what&#39;s going on.  I sent <br/>\nNiimi to investigate but the owner must have set off the alarm alerting <br/>\nthe Kyoto Metropolitan Police.  I don&#39;t want them to arrest one of our <br/>\nmen. I sent back up but you are closest right now.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou pushed the 517 hp biturbo V12 engine and weaved out of the <br/>\nlane which had become a parking lot by driving on the opposite side of <br/>\nthe road.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Shortcut?&quot;  Katsumori closed the computer and looked out at the blurry <br/>\ncityscape.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaitou put both hands on the steering wheel, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata closed his eyes.  Niimi was a mistake.  The fucker must be <br/>\ntaking advantage of his authority and in the process ruining the <br/>\nShinsengumi&#39;s reputation.  He needed to be dealt with and hopefully <br/>\nSaitou would not have to take any action and leave Katsumori <br/>\nunguarded.  Harada had better get there before the KMPD which would <br/>\nbe more than happy to have reason to fight a Shinsengumi.  He opened <br/>\none eye when he felt a cold hand on his shoulder.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hijikata, I won&#39;t forgive you if something happens to anyone at the <br/>\nHimeya.  You&#39;ve become truly heartless to harass honest hardworking <br/>\npeople in this city.&quot;  Okita had that look in his eyes.  Few people have <br/>\nseen the usually serene eyes full of fire outside the dojo or off the field.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My heart beats for this city.  If a few must suffer or die to save the <br/>\nmany then so be it.  This is not a war fought with weapons, but with <br/>\nideas Okita.  If businesses are unwittingly aiding and abetting the enemy <br/>\nthey will be shut down.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkita turned away and began to dress.  He picked up his weapon slowly <br/>\nfrom the nightstand and left the Lieutenant&#39;s quarters.</div>",

(^_^)<br/>\nPart 3 is being polished right now.  Kyoto-Twilight (K-light) will really be <br/>\nsome major themes of Japanese history placed in a blender and <br/>\nelectrified---so it goes a bit beyond the Bakumatsu.  Many charas may <br/>\nhave to be combined.  For example, Hijikata and Kondou obviously have <br/>\nbeen made into one person and he has a bit of a Serizawa streak too.  <br/>\nBecause we want to share the story with the list the yaoi scenes can&#39;t be <br/>\nany more than innuendo.  The other creator may add touches of yuri in <br/>\nhis chapters too without anything graphic (^_^) .<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago I designed a template for Kyoto Twilight and once we <br/>\nwrite up some more chapters we&#39;ll archive it all at a site and place a link <br/>\nover at www.shinsengumihq.com<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, SHQ has a link to a yaoi site featuring Saitou and other <br/>\nShinsengumi  for <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kikue-mugen.com/\">http://kikue-mugen.com/</a>  (age verification necessary)<br/>\nthe site has archived a very very long fanfic called Gojou and an original <br/>\nnovel Gojou Hajime will be released later.</div>",

Do not let them plunder our sacred land, do not let<br/>\n&gt; them trample on our warrior&#39;s spirit! Only the brave can follow me<br/>\n&gt; into the glorious red sun!&quot; Although the image of Mitsujima was<br/>\n&gt; inanimate it had seemed as if molten lava was swirling in his eyes and<br/>\n&gt; his usually serene voice was now thick with rage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The police were barely able to keep the public at bay, when an HX-12<br/>\n&gt; Wasp, one of the newly developed, lithe hover-transport aircraft in<br/>\n&gt; the service of the Japanese Empire, landed in the clearing mid-street,<br/>\n&gt; behind the police lines. Its plain, serpentine gray fuselage bore the<br/>\n&gt; five-petaled hollyhock insignia of the shogun, and on the tail boom,<br/>\n&gt; where the service branch would be named, there was instead one word,<br/>\n&gt; which immediately drove the crowd into a frenzy:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shinsengumi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The rear ramp clattered to the pavement with a thud as the roar of the<br/>\n&gt; engines died down to a whine and then a whisper. Heavily armed men in<br/>\n&gt; gray Kamirion body armor rushed out, boots pounding the blackness of<br/>\n&gt; the pavement. From head to toe, they were the pinnacle perfection in<br/>\n&gt; urban warfare: Kawanishi AR-52 heavy assault rifles, frag and flash<br/>\n&gt; grenades, and Hosoya PP52 9 millimeter pistols with AP<br/>\n&gt; (armor-piercing) rounds. When twelve men had piled out of the craft,<br/>\n&gt; one more followed. Unlike the rest of them, whose faces were hidden<br/>\n&gt; behind visored masks, he only wore a cheek protector, one of the few<br/>\n&gt; hand-me-downs still present and in use from old samurai armor. His<br/>\n&gt; eyes were intense, and if one looked closely, they would be able to<br/>\n&gt; see wisps of dark hair poking out from under his tightly-laced helmet.<br/>\n&gt; He hefted an AR-52 with a scope the likes of which even the well-paid<br/>\n&gt; and supplied Kyoto Metro Police Department had never seen before.<br/>\n&gt; Wanting to seize the moment, Captain Onodera, the officer on duty,<br/>\n&gt; strode over to the man.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Lieutenant Colonel Hijikata Isamu?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The man turned to Onodera. His voice felt like it belonged in the<br/>\n&gt; depths of some ancient shrine. It was deep and more piercing than the<br/>\n&gt; highest-velocity cop-killer round.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Reporting as ordered.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Onodera shivered, then attempted to regain some form of composure.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Eager to see what Aizu&#39;s finest can do.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hijikata said nothing. Raising his gloved left hand, he swept it in a<br/>\n&gt; rapid, downward arc, and before Onodera had time to blink, the<br/>\n&gt; thirteen men were gone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Inside the estate, Mitsujima was already becoming more and more<br/>\nshrill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Where the hell is that damn Aizu Katsumori!&quot; Mitsujima referred, of<br/>\n&gt; course, to Matsudaira Katsumori, the young governor of Kyoto. A<br/>\n&gt; relative newcomer to the political scene, the young Lord Matsudaira<br/>\n&gt; had soon reestablished order in the murder-prone and disaster-rife<br/>\n&gt; Imperial District of Kyoto, and this had largely remained the case<br/>\n&gt; until Mitsujima&#39;s act of insanity. At his booted feet, Kinunoya<br/>\n&gt; Zen&#39;emon, the owner of the estate, cowered in terror. He had always<br/>\n&gt; been a careful man, and one to avoid the tangle of politics, but this<br/>\n&gt; was now his problem, in a very real and immediate sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If he doesn&#39;t show up IN PERSON in the next hour, you know damn well<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s going to happen, Kinunoya. And believe me...&quot; he lowered the<br/>\n&gt; muzzle of his rifle against the temple of Okatsu, Kinunoya&#39;s bound and<br/>\n&gt; gagged wife, &quot;It won&#39;t be pretty...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile, outside, two of Mitsujima&#39;s students paced beside the<br/>\n&gt; barred and barricaded gate. They were rather young and had been easily<br/>\n&gt; taken in by their idealistic teacher&#39;s dreams of a grand new order led<br/>\n&gt; directly by the emperor himself, but somehow they were conflicted<br/>\n&gt; about their teacher&#39;s course of action. Lazily, they chatted in hushed<br/>\n&gt; tones about girlfriends and literary genres, hardly noticing what was<br/>\n&gt; fast approaching from behind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hijikata and his men had quickly scaled the estate&#39;s outer walls and<br/>\n&gt; with camouflage on, were rapidly advancing through the rock garden.<br/>\n&gt; Over the secure neural intranet, Hijikata gave his orders, as quickly<br/>\n&gt; and quietly as though he were actually speaking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nakano, go left and take the rear. Set up with your grenades and make<br/>\n&gt; damn well sure no one gets through that exit alive, even if that<br/>\n&gt; includes you.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sir!&quot; On the heads-up readout generated by his ocular implants,<br/>\n&gt; Hijikata could see one blue light flash and then wink out in<br/>\n&gt; acknowledgement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hirata, you take right flank and get the side entrance. When you hear<br/>\n&gt; the signal, slash the throat of the bastard who&#39;s there, and from then<br/>\n&gt; on do like Nakano and be ready to blow the suckers to Jodo if you have<br/>\n&gt; to.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sir!&quot; One more light flashed and then winked off. Ten left, Hijikata<br/>\n&gt; went faster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Ioki, you&#39;re on left point; take your squad and provide overwatch at<br/>\n&gt; the main building. Tatsuno, you&#39;re on point with me, we&#39;ll take out<br/>\n&gt; these two chickens at the door and then head for the final push on the<br/>\n&gt; house together with Ioki&#39;s squad.&quot; Ten lights flashed and then winked<br/>\n&gt; out. &quot;Ready with Phase A now.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hijikata slung the rifle securely over his back, and tightened the<br/>\n&gt; strap. With practiced ease, he withdrew two slim, palm-length blades<br/>\n&gt; from his waist belt, which, though not connected to his camouflage,<br/>\n&gt; were still a very dim gray, barely visible in the shadows of the tall<br/>\n&gt; bamboo plants by the wall. He breathed in, then out. One final time,<br/>\n&gt; he checked his chronometer-- 1300 hours Japan Standard time-- then the<br/>\n&gt; weather. Gentle breeze, negligible speed. Still, he had to compensate.<br/>\n&gt; Barely, just barely, he shifted his aim, and as one of the two fools<br/>\n&gt; manning the gate bent over to tie his ill-fitting boots, Hijikata<br/>\n&gt; leapt out, flicking the blades out from between his fingers; one<br/>\n&gt; downward, severing the first man, the other one tearing, vertically,<br/>\n&gt; between the eyes of the other man, sending him backward in a gurgling<br/>\n&gt; mass of deadweight. Continuing the motion of his hand, he swept back<br/>\n&gt; to the pistol on his right hip, practically ripping it out of its<br/>\n&gt; holster as he moved to empty one, then two silenced shots, finishing<br/>\n&gt; off the chickens at the gate once and for all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hijikata had no need to see his men, he could feel them, both over the<br/>\n&gt; ocular implants, and also from years of experience with these raids.<br/>\n&gt; Reholstering the pistol, he grabbed his rifle. It was almost time. Two<br/>\n&gt; lights flashed on his heads-up display. Nakano and Hirata were ready.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The house was spacious, but through the scope on his rifle, Hijikata<br/>\n&gt; could see through it all; he could see all the dozen or so men inside<br/>\n&gt; the mansion, the four or so hostages; all of it was as plain as day to<br/>\n&gt; him. Much as he&#39;d want to take point himself, he had to stay outside<br/>\n&gt; and do what he was equipped for: make the final call and shot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;All exits secure. Squad Zero-One, prepare for frontal assault.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *********<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Inside, Mitsujima was fast losing the last vestiges of his patience.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;WHERE is Matsudaira Katsumori? What is taking him so long? Can he no<br/>\n&gt; longer come out of his office at Kurotani without the help of his<br/>\n&gt; concubines? Perhaps we should get a real man to run this city, not<br/>\n&gt; some snot-nosed aristocratic brat! Kinunoya, it&#39;s going to be YOUR<br/>\n&gt; head on a pike over your OWN door! And as long as I&#39;m at it, I might<br/>\n&gt; as well make the first underlining of my point-- starting with her!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; The dark muzzle of Mitsujima&#39;s rifle swept toward Okatsu.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s said that in times of immense stress, the human body and psyche<br/>\n&gt; cooperate in ways that cannot be predicted, even by the newest, most<br/>\n&gt; advanced biotech computers. And that&#39;s precisely what drove Kinunoya,<br/>\n&gt; in utter horror, to suddenly rise to his feet. At the same instant,<br/>\n&gt; the first muffled groans were heard, as Hijikata&#39;s men swept closer<br/>\n&gt; and closer to that last, innermost room. And then, without even<br/>\n&gt; thinking, before the rifle finished its arc, Kinunoya threw himself<br/>\n&gt; onto Mitsujima, which in turn threw Hijikata&#39;s carefully calculated<br/>\n&gt; surgical strike into disaster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back at the gate, Hijikata was still tensing at the scope of his<br/>\n&gt; rifle, waiting for a clear shot to take Mitsujima down. Hijikata could<br/>\n&gt; clearly make out Mitsujima&#39;s figure, distorted through the<br/>\n&gt; interference of the walls, but suddenly, one of the other figures rose<br/>\n&gt; up and leapt onto Mitsujima. By the look of it, it was none other than<br/>\n&gt; Kinunoya, the man that Hijikata was supposed to try to save.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Take the shot? Don&#39;t take the shot? For a split second, Hijikata&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; conscience about killing an innocent man conflicted with his lifetime<br/>\n&gt; drive to wipe out diseased, garbage-spouting scum like Mitsujima. But<br/>\n&gt; only for a moment. Any other man would&#39;ve hesitated longer, but he was<br/>\n&gt; not any other man. He was Lieutenant Colonel Hijikata Isamu, Commander<br/>\n&gt; of the Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi, and if taking out one<br/>\n&gt; innocent man was the price of victory, then so be it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With practiced ease, he primed his rifle, took one deep breath, and<br/>\nfired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *I&#39;m sorry, Kinunoya. May you live forever in Paradise*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *Mitsujima, may you be flayed alive for ten thousand kalpa in the land<br/>\n&gt; of the dead*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Inside, Mitsujima was struggling, trying to free himself of Kinunoya&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; crazed, frenzied scratching and clawing. He only felt a burning<br/>\n&gt; sensation on his left temple for a moment, and then the world went<br/>\n&gt; black...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okatsu screamed, and at that instant, the door flew off its hinges<br/>\n&gt; with a crash, and ten men in dark body armor burst into the room.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi Squad Zero-One! Surrender or be<br/>\n&gt; destroyed without mercy!&quot; Mitsujima&#39;s surviving students in the room,<br/>\n&gt; still shaken from watching their master fall in a bloody heap, seemed<br/>\n&gt; to slowly crumple, before retching the meager contents of their<br/>\n&gt; starving bowels violently onto the tatami mats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ioki directed a text transmission back to Hijikata, at the gate.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hostages secured minus one, sir.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hijikata received the transmission and then promptly decloaked. Even<br/>\n&gt; at this price, the mission was accomplished. He returned a<br/>\n&gt; transmission, this time to all units. &quot;Well done, team. Gather up the<br/>\n&gt; hostages and prisoners, and rally at the front gate.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Twelve lights blinked and then winked off. Mission accomplished.<br/>\n&gt; *****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Outside, Captain Onodera was still standing by the Wasp, stunned, when<br/>\n&gt; the front gate of the estate opened, and out came thirteen men, three<br/>\n&gt; former hostages, and five prisoners. Before he could ask any<br/>\n&gt; questions, Hijikata did the talking. Handing over the former hostages<br/>\n&gt; to Onodera&#39;s men, he gave a curt nod.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Mitsujima&#39;s dead. Kinunoya got in the way of my shot, and while<br/>\n&gt; unfortunate, his sacrifice ensured Mishima&#39;s demise. Get your men to<br/>\n&gt; clean up the place, Onodera. We&#39;re taking the survivors for<br/>\nquestioning.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The twelve men herded their prisoners into the Wasp just as<br/>\n&gt; efficiently as they had emerged from it. Hijikata bowed curtly once<br/>\n&gt; more, and then joined them within. The dull hum of the engines soon<br/>\n&gt; grew into a whine and then a roar, and Onodera had to cover his ears<br/>\n&gt; as the aircraft rose straight up into the air, before zooming off<br/>\n&gt; southward, no doubt toward the base at Mibu.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Are we ever up shit creek now...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

Mitsujima<br/>\nAtsuo, the famous outspoken, iconoclastic writer, had finally snapped:<br/>\narming himself and his handful of students, he had broken into the<br/>\nestate of a rich silk merchant, and was broadcasting a list of demands<br/>\nover the city-wide intranet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery hand held device, laptop, desktop was illuminated by the<br/>\nportrait of the bare chested muscular artist with a bandanna tied<br/>\naround his head. A large two story flat screen monitor outside the<br/>\nShimabara pleasure hotel drew curious crowds to the best-selling<br/>\nauthors. Mitsujima&#39;s still eyes gazed into the souls of his audience<br/>\nas he repeated over and over again, &quot;Where is the soul of Japan? Can<br/>\nwe let the American States and the other nations of the world treat us<br/>\nin such a way?

And then, without even<br/>\nthinking, before the rifle finished its arc, Kinunoya threw himself<br/>\nonto Mitsujima, which in turn threw Hijikata&#39;s carefully calculated<br/>\nsurgical strike into disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nBack at the gate, Hijikata was still tensing at the scope of his<br/>\nrifle, waiting for a clear shot to take Mitsujima down. Hijikata could<br/>\nclearly make out Mitsujima&#39;s figure, distorted through the<br/>\ninterference of the walls, but suddenly, one of the other figures rose<br/>\nup and leapt onto Mitsujima. By the look of it, it was none other than<br/>\nKinunoya, the man that Hijikata was supposed to try to save.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the shot? Don&#39;t take the shot? For a split second, Hijikata&#39;s<br/>\nconscience about killing an innocent man conflicted with his lifetime<br/>\ndrive to wipe out diseased, garbage-spouting scum like Mitsujima. But<br/>\nonly for a moment. Any other man would&#39;ve hesitated longer, but he was<br/>\nnot any other man. He was Lieutenant Colonel Hijikata Isamu, Commander<br/>\nof the Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi, and if taking out one<br/>\ninnocent man was the price of victory, then so be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith practiced ease, he primed his rifle, took one deep breath, and fired.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I&#39;m sorry, Kinunoya. May you live forever in Paradise*<br/>\n<br/>\n*Mitsujima, may you be flayed alive for ten thousand kalpa in the land<br/>\nof the dead*<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nInside, Mitsujima was struggling, trying to free himself of Kinunoya&#39;s<br/>\ncrazed, frenzied scratching and clawing. He only felt a burning<br/>\nsensation on his left temple for a moment, and then the world went<br/>\nblack...<br/>\n<br/>\nOkatsu screamed, and at that instant, the door flew off its hinges<br/>\nwith a crash, and ten men in dark body armor burst into the room.<br/>\n&quot;Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi Squad Zero-One! Surrender or be<br/>\ndestroyed without mercy!&quot; Mitsujima&#39;s surviving students in the room,<br/>\nstill shaken from watching their master fall in a bloody heap, seemed<br/>\nto slowly crumple, before retching the meager contents of their<br/>\nstarving bowels violently onto the tatami mats.<br/>\n<br/>\nIoki directed a text transmission back to Hijikata, at the gate.<br/>\n&quot;Hostages secured minus one, sir.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata received the transmission and then promptly decloaked. Even<br/>\nat this price, the mission was accomplished. He returned a<br/>\ntransmission, this time to all units. &quot;Well done, team. Gather up the<br/>\nhostages and prisoners, and rally at the front gate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTwelve lights blinked and then winked off. Mission accomplished.<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside, Captain Onodera was still standing by the Wasp, stunned, when<br/>\nthe front gate of the estate opened, and out came thirteen men, three<br/>\nformer hostages, and five prisoners. Before he could ask any<br/>\nquestions, Hijikata did the talking. Handing over the former hostages<br/>\nto Onodera&#39;s men, he gave a curt nod.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mitsujima&#39;s dead. Kinunoya got in the way of my shot, and while<br/>\nunfortunate, his sacrifice ensured Mishima&#39;s demise. Get your men to<br/>\nclean up the place, Onodera. We&#39;re taking the survivors for questioning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twelve men herded their prisoners into the Wasp just as<br/>\nefficiently as they had emerged from it. Hijikata bowed curtly once<br/>\nmore, and then joined them within. The dull hum of the engines soon<br/>\ngrew into a whine and then a roar, and Onodera had to cover his ears<br/>\nas the aircraft rose straight up into the air, before zooming off<br/>\nsouthward, no doubt toward the base at Mibu.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are we ever up shit creek now...&quot;</div>",
