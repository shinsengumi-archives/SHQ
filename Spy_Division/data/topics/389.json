But the fact that he&#39;s always smiling is <br/>\nkinda creepy...<br/>\n<br/>\nKondou: Even though I&#39;m not a big fan of yaoi I&#39;d have to say Soshite Haru <br/>\nno Tsuki has the coolest-looking version.

Heck, knowing <br/>\nhim, he probably is...<br/>\n<br/>\nHijikata Toshizou: NHK Version. But Shinsengumi Keppuroku&#39;s Hijikata is cool <br/>\ntoo, but only because it&#39;s the same actor who plays Inspector Aoyama in <br/>\n&quot;Hatchobori Seven&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNagakura Shinpachi: NHK version. I don&#39;t like the fact that the PMK version <br/>\nis a red-haired runt (there&#39;s no such thing as a red-haired Japanese), but <br/>\nthat version totally had the edge as far as humor, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nToudou Heisuke: NHK version!! He&#39;s so...lost! PMK version was good, but only <br/>\nbecause of the laugh factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatsudaira Katamori: NHK version -rules-.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoshimura Kanichirou: Mibugishiden version.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all, folks!<br/>\n<br/>\n--M.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>",
