It&#39;s just a one stop shop for finding <br/>\nwebsites, commercial releases and fan fiction/artwork. The test site <br/>\nis up <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geocities.com/mg_batt\">http://geocities.com/mg_batt</a> and will launch in <br/>\nwww.shinsengumidb.com. It will just be links/summaries, no archiving <br/>\nis done. For a user to view your work they will have to use the link <br/>\nand follow it either to your own website or at the archiving website <br/>\nlike ff.net.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I would like to merge the database here in the yahoo group and <br/>\ncopy over the entries to the website. I will be doing that <br/>\ntonight. . The summaries I will use whatever your have on your <br/>\nwebsite or ff.net. If you need something to be edited and for those <br/>\nwho do not want to be included, please drop me a line so I can <br/>\nremove/edit the entry. When the website is officially launched you <br/>\ncan also add entries.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those other stories that are not listed here in the database, I <br/>\nwill be sending out &quot;I want your permission&quot; e-mails... *wounds <br/>\ncrosses fingers and mutters &quot;I hope they say yes&quot;.*<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time... :O)<br/>\n<br/>\n~wounds<br/>\n<br/>\n---- To phil ----<br/>\n<br/>\nI got your e-mail. I will not be taking your entries in the group <br/>\ndatabase, until you are ready. So let me know because I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto miss out on those wonderful yaoi stories. :O)<br/>\n<br/>\nPhil, sec mentioned a link to the livejournal SHQ for the fanfic <br/>\nchallenges, can I go ahead and put the link on the website?</div>",
