The address is www.comtoon.com. Are you <br/>\nstaying in Thai now? I guess not because you want to buy them online <br/>\nright? For Mibugishiden I&#39;m sure the VCDs have already been distributed <br/>\nhere since I find the review of it. I will send you the review via e-mail. <br/>\nThough I haven&#39;t watched such movie yet, I know that the story is <br/>\nfocused well on Saito-san and likely to end in tragedy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the manga relating to Shinsengumi, I know the story `Sakamoto <br/>\nryoma&#39; but it contains only few chapters about Shinsengumi. I still don&#39;t <br/>\nfind Kaze Hikaru. For Peace maker Kurogane here `Bonkoch Comics&#39; has <br/>\nreleased the third volume already. You can buy it from comtoon. Hope <br/>\nthis can help and sorry for the delay.  ^_^ <br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;m far less fluent in the language than you, it took me quite long <br/>\nto finish this simple reply.  ^_^&#39; Is my English O.K. or not?<br/>\n<br/>\nGiffy</div>",

First, is it O.K. if I upload some files like screen <br/>\ncapture or doujinshi onto the group. Second, If I scan the doujinshi I <br/>\npurchased without permission from their respectable doujinshika just to <br/>\nshare with you guys, will there be anyone who sue me?
