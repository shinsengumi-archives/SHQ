No anime characters here...all real historical<br/>\npeople. I own this stuff! LOL No I don&#39;t...who DOES own these people? lol<br/>\nMajor Characters: &quot;Other&quot;-- Matsudaira Teruhime, Matsudaira Toshihime,<br/>\nNakano Takeko, Nakano Kouko<br/>\n<br/>\nAizu Joushigun<br/>\nDai-ichi: Yoake<br/>\nOne: Daybreak<br/>\n<br/>\nEdo<br/>\nAizu clan mansion<br/>\nKaei 1 (1848)<br/>\n<br/>\nToshiko, daughter of the Aizu lord Katataka, smiled as she held the<br/>\nwarm bundle in her arms, steadied by Teru, her newly adopted sister.<br/>\nTeru shook her head in amused disbelief. She didn&#39;t think that<br/>\nsuch...cuteness was possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Teru-nechan, isn&#39;t she cute?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA blush tinged Teru&#39;s cheeks. The baby that Toshi was holding was<br/>\ncute...her smile and her calm, happy demeanor warmed Teru&#39;s otherwise<br/>\ngently cynical heart. She was a newcomer to the Matsudaira family, and<br/>\nso far had only really been impressed by her adoptive sister&#39;s<br/>\ninnocence and her adoptive brother&#39;s sometimes annoying calm.<br/>\nExtending a finger, she raised a curious eyebrow when the baby took<br/>\nfirm hold of it and wouldn&#39;t let go easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n-So adorable...like a living doll...-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe turned to the slightly older woman who sat a discreet distance away.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s her name, Kouko-chan?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s Takeko, milady.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Nakano Takeko...-Teru mused quietly. -Sounds like she&#39;ll be...famous.<br/>\nOr something.- Takeko giggled and once again took ahold of Teru&#39;s<br/>\nextended finger.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;She&#39;s...adorable! And such a good grip...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re so blessed to have her, milady,&quot; Kouko bowed politely. &quot;I can<br/>\nsense she&#39;s bound for great things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mm...have you thought of naginata training, when the time is right?&quot;<br/>\nTeru winced. Takeko&#39;s grip was getting really hard. &quot;My teacher,<br/>\nAkaoka Taisuke, is very good at training women. I could put in a good<br/>\nword for you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thank you, milady.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You know, Toshi-chan,&quot; Teru gently touched the younger girl on the<br/>\nshoulder, &quot;I think you&#39;ll make a great mother someday...you just look<br/>\nso natural, holding Takeko-chan...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You think so?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You and Katamori-sama are destined for happy days, little<br/>\nsister...just like Takeko-chan here.&quot;</div>",
