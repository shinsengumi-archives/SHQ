            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1968085117\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like a detailed plot bunny for a story just download <br/>\nthis word document<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/FIREINKYOTO.doc\">http://1happyturtle.com/Hosting/FIREINKYOTO.doc</a><br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that Saitou in this story is original and not based on <br/>\nRK, PMK, NHK or Mibugishiden. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact I made the story &quot;inspired by&quot; the Shinsengumi so the name <br/>\nShinsengumi was changed to Ookami Gumi and Aizu-han is Ise-han <br/>\nbecause ofcourse this is a work of fiction and many situations were <br/>\ncompletely created.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really this plot bunny and will write it as original fic post <br/>\nto this mailing list so people know that you will officially adopt <br/>\nthe plot bunny--and *ofcourse* just adapt, delete it anyway your <br/>\nheart desires.  I marked certain parts as {climactic scene #1} or <br/>\n{sensual} etc because in doing so I am able to see the flow of the <br/>\nstory and see if it has something going on for the reader...that&#39;s <br/>\nhow I plan things.  Many script writers also do this as a way of <br/>\ninsuring that their work has something movie makers can work with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever people who are just curious are more than welcome to skim the <br/>\nplot.  I have a new story for every moment of the day involving <br/>\nSaitou---however most are comedies set when he is older (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have alot of ideas, but no time, or I don&#39;t want to waste time <br/>\nwriting like...a really really long story no one will read.  My prose <br/>\nis really for non-fiction.  To have someone write non-fiction write <br/>\nfiction is like having a swimmer who swims laps in a pool do <br/>\nunderwater ballet.  It&#39;s similar but not the same (^_^).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are alot of talented authors and artists here who can <br/>\nwrite great stories for fanfiction.net and get alot of reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you have nothing better to do over the summer give it a shot!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still giving away my novel for free here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://silapajarun.1happyturtle.com/\">http://silapajarun.1happyturtle.com/</a><br/>\njust contact the email on the site if you want it<br/>\nso far I got 2 one sentence reviews<br/>\nand three other people have asked to download the file, but I dunno <br/>\nif I&#39;ll ever hear from them again (LOL!)</div>",
