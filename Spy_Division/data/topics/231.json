            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-688140810\">Hello Everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started a new collaborative project called &quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis &quot;story&quot; will be a re-telling (summarization) of the Rurouni<br/>\nKenshin tale, episode by episode, in verse!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for guest authors (I actually hope to have about 50% of it<br/>\nwritten by others), and I was certainly hoping that the SHQ Spy<br/>\nDivision would have some interested parties, at the very least, for<br/>\nEpisodes 29-32, or other episodes where Saitou is a prominent figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your entry is selected, it will be posted under my username in the<br/>\n&quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot; story.  HOWEVER, -full- credit will be given to the<br/>\nauthor!  <br/>\n<br/>\nRules are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nSubmissions for episodes can be sent to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mindglue@...\">mindglue@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The email subject must include the episode number and title. We<br/>\nwill not accept submissions by review.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The author&#39;s email address, ff.net username, and URL of the<br/>\nauthor&#39;s profile must be in the email. These will be included in the<br/>\nchapter if your entry is picked to appear as a guest author in<br/>\n&quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Poems -must- be sent in .doc or .txt format.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) There is no guarantee that your poem will be used. Period.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Poems may be of any format, from serious to humorous, from haiku to<br/>\nDr. Seuss, sonnet to epic Homerian style. However, preference will be<br/>\ngiven to humorous poems, as I wish &quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot; to be, overall,<br/>\nlighthearted.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) At this time, we are only looking for poems summarizing episodes<br/>\nthrough the end of the Kyoto arc. Feel free to send any episode number<br/>\nup to episode 65 at any time. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\nThe first chapter of &quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot; can be found here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1848493\">http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1848493</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of you will consider submitting poems to become guest<br/>\npoets!<br/>\n<br/>\nAngrybee</div>",
