            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1117828732\">I&#39;ve started creating folders over in the Web Features and you can <br/>\nbegin loading them up.  Just keep a couple things in mind.  I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to keep it organized so see if an existing folder meets your <br/>\nneed (and don&#39;t forget there are folders within the main folders).  <br/>\nIf not, then do what you have to do.  I *might* move what you load up <br/>\ninto an existing folder I think it belongs in or create a whole new <br/>\nfolder.  Please don&#39;t take it personally.  It&#39;s just an attempt to <br/>\nkeep things findable.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhotos --- let&#39;s try to keep photographs (real images, not art) in <br/>\nthe photos section.  There&#39;s a folder in Files that will hold the art <br/>\nand scans and screencaps we post up for inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinks --- also has some general folders... take a look and see what <br/>\nyou can add to things, like your own webpages and archives and other <br/>\nfanfic & fanart sites you&#39;re aware of that would be related to the <br/>\nShinsengumi.  Let&#39;s try to keep factual information over on SHQ... <br/>\nthat&#39;s where it belongs... so we don&#39;t repeat too much info and back <br/>\nup BOTH sites&#39; files with the same stuff.  This is why I encourage <br/>\nmembers here to join SHQ so that they have access to historical <br/>\ninformation (or other info related to miburo, like anime, etc.)  This <br/>\nincludes history links... try to keep them on SHQ and focus on <br/>\nfiction and art here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t upload any stories to the files... at least not at this point.  <br/>\nI&#39;m looking at archiving stories authors give permission to be <br/>\narchived on a separate site that&#39;ll be linked to the SHQ site.  Also, <br/>\nwe&#39;re not ready for art yet.  I can understand how anxious you might <br/>\nbe, but we want to put our foot sure and steady from the outset.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds restrictive, I know.  I don&#39;t mean to sound that way.  I want <br/>\nyou to load things up to these sections without reservation... in <br/>\nfact I&#39;m counting on you guys to share information so we&#39;re all fat & <br/>\nsassy, but I want to work at keeping things organized.  The site&#39;s <br/>\nless than 24 hours old... there&#39;s still plenty of work to be done.  <br/>\nIn fact, the guidelines already need to be revised, but I expected <br/>\nthat once things got going.  Feel free to make comments or <br/>\nsuggestions to me, on the list or privately.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to those of you have joined already --- THANKS and welcome.  <br/>\nStart exercising those fingers and let&#39;s get some stories going.<br/>\n<br/>\npachi (who used to be phil, but lost the battle over Saitou to <br/>\nMissBehavin&#39; and had to settle for Nagakura Shinpachi)</div>",
