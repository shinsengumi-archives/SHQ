Over time these tales became popularized to the <br/>\npoint that it has become fact and I think logically in the minds of many it <br/>\nseems &quot;logical&quot; that men living in close quarters turned to each other <br/>\nespecially during those dry periods between their paychecks so to speak <br/>\nand they couldn&#39;t go to the red-light district.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn popular media it&#39;s accepted canon to have Hijikata and Okita pairing <br/>\nwhen there is little to suggest they were more than friends in history.  I <br/>\nthink it has alot to do with the issue that Okita as a TB patient has to <br/>\nbe &quot;perpetually weak/ill&quot; (even though that does not have to be the case <br/>\nas TB patients have cycles of illness and &quot;normal&quot; periods) and if he had <br/>\nan attractive older friend like Hijikata or even Kondou then it doesn&#39;t hurt <br/>\nto imagine them as lovers with the weakened Okita playing a female <br/>\nrole. Combine nanshoku with the tragedy of TB and you have a really <br/>\ncompelling love story where one dies alone yearning for his lover and <br/>\nhis comrades (below is a very old essay about Okita and TB).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe details from history which support nanshoku amongst the <br/>\nShinsengumi are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) There was one very attractive Shinsengumi foot soldier and we do <br/>\nhave his name who may have caused some fighting amongst the ranks <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Itou Kashitaro was described, historically, as being attractive to the <br/>\npoint he made men and women take notice when he was out and about <br/>\non his strolls although we don&#39;t know for sure Itou&#39;s sexual leanings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, why Shinsengumi and not - say - the 47 Ronin or <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Miyamoto Musashi?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>** I&#39;m sure that somewhere the 47 Ronin have been portrayed in yaoi <br/>\nmedia but I think because the group had 2 periods as retainers and then <br/>\nseparation before carrying out the plot, people are less likely to think of <br/>\nthem as practicing nanshoku.  I have never studied the 47 Ronin in detail.<br/>\nIn contrast the Shinsengumi&#39;s theme of &quot;togetherness&quot; comes across <br/>\nmore strongly and I think that is the reason they are so popular in yaoi <br/>\nmedia.<br/>\n<br/>\n** Miyamoto Musashi, historically, did have male partners.<br/>\n<br/>\nGOJOU HAJIME is an interesting work and while I can&#39;t say it was written <br/>\nfor -just- yaoi fangirls I think it&#39;ll give people alot of insight into what <br/>\nyaoi fans would like to read and why they find the &quot;emotional&quot; voice of <br/>\nthe characters so appealing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThe Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis and Okita Soujiro <br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It was a cough, apparently---a man&#39;s cougha cough devoid of any <br/>\nzest for life or love, which didn&#39;t come in spasms, but sounded as if <br/>\nsomeone were stirring feebly in a terrible mush of decomposing organic <br/>\nmaterial.&quot; (Mann 12)<br/>\n<br/>\n:: Edo Era :: Treatment :: Society :: Fiction :: Bibliography ::<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is a brief discussion on tuberculosis and its possible <br/>\neffects on both historical Okita and how the illness aided in the <br/>\ndevelopment of his fictional persona. Ofcourse, a physical condition does <br/>\nnot fully &quot;define&quot; a human being, so please do not view this exploration <br/>\nas an oversimplification of him as just TB patient when obviously he was <br/>\nso much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo understand the biology of TB please do not rely only on websites <br/>\nwhich often simplify the disease. Try to seek out medical texts, or <br/>\njournal articles written by people in the medical community and <br/>\ncompare what we know now to the information available in 19th century <br/>\nJapan to understand how Okita dealt with this illness. I am not a <br/>\nbacteriologist nor a doctor so I will only touch on the science aspect. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to Robert Koch&#39;s discovery of the tubercle bacillus, the cause of <br/>\ntuberculosis, was a universal mystery subject to superstition and intense <br/>\nfear. There are six different kinds of disease causing Mycobacteria. Type <br/>\nA was the variation found in Japan since prehistoric times. Before the <br/>\n1880s some scientists had theorized that the tubercle bacilli floated in <br/>\nthe air and infected people. The theory was very close to scientific fact <br/>\nbut was rejected by a majority of the scientific community at the time <br/>\nbecause few believed in the existence of &quot;bacteria&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Airborne particles [of tubercle bacilli] formed by the evaporation of <br/>\nminute respiratory droplets can carry several bacilliRespiratory <br/>\nfunctions as simple as coughing, sneezing, spitting, and singing produce <br/>\nsuch particlesin a closed room they disperse like tobacco smoke.&quot; <br/>\n(Johnston 27)<br/>\n<br/>\nExposure to the tubercle bacillus does not have to lead to infection. <br/>\nOther factors such as the host&#39;s environment, age (puberty and old age <br/>\nreduces the body&#39;s ability to resist infection), sex, nutrition, working <br/>\nconditions (exhaustion can initiate active tuberculosis or exacerbate the <br/>\ncondition) as well as extreme mental stress (the last factor has been <br/>\nobserved by modern clinicians but there has been no extensive <br/>\nexperimentation) can determine the possible onset of illness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJapan&#39;s experience with the white plague peaked between 1890-1950 <br/>\nand even the records between those years may not be accurate due to <br/>\nfrequent, at times, purposeful misdiagnosis to protect both the doctor <br/>\nand patient&#39;s reputation. Often, innocuous complex phrases like caseous <br/>\npneumonia or bronchial catarrh were used in place of the most <br/>\nominous &quot;consumption&quot; on paperwork. The stigma attached to <br/>\ntuberculosis will be further explored below.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdo Era [return to top]<br/>\nMany foreign doctors and visitors who entered Japan right before the <br/>\nRestoration noted the prevalence of tuberculosis.<br/>\n(this section will deal with what people believed and practiced back <br/>\nthen, not what is scientifically accurate today)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often read that Okita was a victim of pulmonary consumption so <br/>\nwhat did that mean in his lifetime? <br/>\n<br/>\nPulmonary consumption &quot;translates into Japanese as haibyo, or &#39;lung <br/>\ndisease&#39;&quot; (Johnston 418) or the modern medical term hai kekkaku. An <br/>\neven more common term was rosai (in Chinese, lao ji) (Johnston 43) <br/>\nwhich appeared in Japanese texts for many centuries. Ro means &quot;to <br/>\nconsume&quot; and sai means &quot;to hold a funeral ceremony&quot; because after <br/>\nsuffering from emaciation, fever, night sweats, violent coughing and <br/>\neven the external appearance of tubercles (kekkaku) the victim most <br/>\ncertainly died.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow was Okita treated? [return to top] <br/>\nVery likely his treatment was influenced by the techniques prescribed by <br/>\nManase Dosan (1507-1574). Manase used Chinese medical theories and <br/>\nthe Tokugawa sanctioned this medical approach. Aside from <br/>\npopularizing the term rosai, Manase standardized a four step diagnosis <br/>\n(summary from Johnston 44) procedure involving <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Visual observation, noting skin color, weight, weakness, condition of <br/>\nthe hair, sputum, feces, urine, and feces <br/>\n2) Auditory observation by listening to the sounds in the chest by <br/>\ntapping. <br/>\n3) Interrogation using conversation to collect information from the <br/>\npatient about appetite, waste elimination, emotions and what factors <br/>\ninduce the onset of illness<br/>\n4) Pulse diagnosis a sophisticated art &quot;that analyzed the strength, speed, <br/>\nlocations, and other aspects of the pulse to facilitate the identification of <br/>\na disease&quot; (Johnston 44)<br/>\n<br/>\nCommon treatment included moxibustion &quot;(a method of cauterizing <br/>\nspecific points on the body according to principles similar to those used <br/>\nin acupuncture)&quot; (Johnston 44), recommendations to eat a diet rich in <br/>\neggs, chickens (note that they are all proteins), and residence in a rural <br/>\narea (western doctors also recommended exposure to clean dry air). <br/>\nOne of the behavioral patterns noted by doctors of this era was that <br/>\nexcessive alcohol and sexual intercourse preceded illness thus they often <br/>\nprescribed patients to abstain from both. Interestingly, there is a rumor <br/>\nthat Okita was a &quot;clean child&quot; or celibate. It is mentioned in <br/>\nShinsengumi &quot;lore&quot; that Hijikata gave the captain of his first squad the <br/>\nmedicine he once peddled, the Ishida Sanyaku (I am not certain about <br/>\nthe spelling).<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, each symptom was treated because again, the cause had not <br/>\nbeen identified. The most fascinating and common medicine was opium <br/>\nin &quot;tea&quot; [Edit 5/19/2006] (This may be an an Asian form of poppy-head <br/>\ntea or a similar derivative) which was believed to help stabilize the <br/>\ndigestive system and prevent diarrhea (tuberculosis affected many parts <br/>\nof the body including the intestines). Note that there were extremely <br/>\nstrict laws against opium usage during the Tokugawa because the result <br/>\nof this drug&#39;s prevalent use in China and Opium War were well known to <br/>\nthe bakufu.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Edit 5/19/2006] &quot;There were no specific cures for tuberculosis, <br/>\npneumonia or bronchitis and opium helped to alleviate symptoms, <br/>\nsubduing coughing, expectoration and pain even if it could not touch the <br/>\nroot cause. Discharges of all sorts, too, were dealt with by the drung.Its <br/>\nuse in haemorrhage was well-known---&#39;of all the wonderful <br/>\ninfluences...exerted by opium, that by which it sustains the powers of <br/>\nlife...arrests the flow of blood, is the most extraordinary,&#39; commented a <br/>\nmedical journal in 1846.&quot; (Berridge 67 originally from &#39;Review of Dr <br/>\nGriffin&#39;s Medical and Physiological Problems, British and Foreign Medical <br/>\nReview, 221 (1846) pp. 105-107). Although the example is from western <br/>\nmedicine, a similar belief was found in the East. Remember, the British <br/>\nobtained opium from Asia and studied its many uses in that part of the <br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatsumoto Ryojun, physician to Tokugawa Yoshinobu, was close to <br/>\nKondou Isami so very likely he knew of the medical condition of <br/>\nmembers in the Shinsengumi such as Okita. After the Restoration, <br/>\nMatsumoto became an important figure in establishing medical <br/>\neducation. If you have information further establishing the relationship <br/>\nbetween this physician and Okita please contact shinsengumihq(a)<br/>\nyahoo.com. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Edit 5/19/2006] As mentioned earlier, opium was frequently used in the <br/>\ntreatment of TB. According to this website &quot;An anecdotal story about his <br/>\nunorthodox techniques-- he successfully treated Tokugawa Yoshinobu&#39;s <br/>\nstress condition by having him take opium (against government <br/>\nregulation) and sleep for a day.&quot; (translated by Hirotada Tokugawa).<br/>\n<br/>\n[Edit 5/19/2006] Matsumoto&#39;s connection to the Shinsengumi can be <br/>\nseen in the fact that Kondou Isami met the physician. Matsumoto also <br/>\nleft an account of his meeting with the Shinsengumi chief (See <br/>\nHillsborough Shinsengumi 104-105). Furthermore, after Kondou was <br/>\nshot by surviving members of the Itou Affair, he sought Matsumoto&#39;s <br/>\ncare in Osaka (Hillsborough Shinsengumi 140). Matsumoto&#39;s last <br/>\nconnection to the Shinsengumi is his involvement in composing a text for <br/>\nan important memorial to Kondou and Hijikata in Hino (Hillsborough <br/>\nShinsengumi 174, 181-182).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;According to an old proverb, the best treatment for tuberculosis <br/>\nwas opium and lies.&quot; (Rosenberg II)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did society treat sick people like Okita? [return to top] <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is highly likely that Okita&#39;s condition was kept secret as long as <br/>\npossible for practical reasons. The Shinsengumi lived and worked as a <br/>\nunit, a community, and this illness would affect their morale. There are <br/>\nalso cultural beliefs connected to pollution which should be taken into <br/>\nconsideration too. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsumption fell under the category of fuchi no yamai or incurable, <br/>\ndisfiguring disease. One of the symptoms of TB is hemoptysis or the <br/>\ncoughing up of blood, which related the illness to &quot;red impurities&quot; such <br/>\nas menstruation, child birth and so forth. Note that blood was one of <br/>\nmany liquids expelled by the patient, usually they would cough up the <br/>\ndecomposing cheeselike material which accumlulated in their lungs as <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more heavy term is gobyo or &quot;karmic disease&quot; which did not mean <br/>\nthat bad karma caused the disease but that it was inescapable like the <br/>\nfruition of past action. Karma does not always mean &quot;negative&quot; action. <br/>\nThe significance of this term is that there is nowhere to run or hide from <br/>\nthe inevitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarriage would have been almost impossible. Both male and female <br/>\npatients could start a tubercular family lineage or kekkaku ketto. There <br/>\nare numerous accounts of women divorced due to the sickness for fear <br/>\nthat it would be passed down to their children via breast milk. Men, <br/>\nunable to maintain their family line or women unable to marry or <br/>\nproduce children were generally marginalized by society.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictims were usually buried outside the village graveyard or separate <br/>\nfrom the official family grave for fear that the pollution would mark their <br/>\nblood line as a yamai make or diseased lineage. The belief that disease <br/>\ncould be inherited persisted well into the 20th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiction[return to top] <br/>\nHow come Okita is always smiling, childish and ummm girly?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all fictional portrayals show as cheery and upbeat but many do <br/>\nbecause maintaining a positive attitude was believed to be beneficial. <br/>\nThe following representative quotes are from a medical text however <br/>\nthey may be outdated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, writers and artists may have worked with these generalizations <br/>\nto &quot;build&quot; the character of Okita, which means that it may not accurately <br/>\nreflect on the historical person.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The belief that there is a specific `tuberculous personality&#39;<br/>\ncharacterized by undue cheerfulness (Spes Phthisica)and marked<br/>\nintellectual productivity has gained wide support.&quot; (Calden 275)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Tuberculous patients behave like deprived children.&quot; (Dunbar 226)<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the patient&#39;s dependence on others during their illness, the <br/>\nresearchers chose representative quotes from the 570 subjects they <br/>\nused. One said &quot;I feel like a baby again&quot; (Calden 288) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Let us assume that the patients have passed beyond the unavoidable <br/>\nbreaking-in period and have settled down to being ill and to being ill with <br/>\ntuberculosis. Afterwards a variety of mental changes may take place <br/>\nwhich time and again have puzzled observers. It has been said<br/>\nthat tuberculous patients are predominantly sensitive, neurotic, <br/>\ndepressed, optimistic, elated, euphoric, easily suggestible, whimsical, <br/>\nCHILDISH, selfish, self-centered, capriciousMost patients with <br/>\ntuberculosis are in a mood of mild overt or concealed depression and <br/>\nanxiety, which are normal and adequate reaction to indisious disease<br/>\nOffsprings of these reactions and defenses against them are defiance, <br/>\nULTRA-CHEERFULNESS.&quot; (Wittkower 164)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Much has been written on the subject of tuberculosis and genius[list <br/>\nof geniuses]. The truth of the matter seems to be that tuberculosis is a <br/>\ncommon disease, and therefore also occurs in men and women of <br/>\ngeniustuberculosis for a variety of reasons favors fantasy production<br/>\nand the dreaded limitation of their span of life stimulates their <br/>\nproductivity.&quot; (Wittkower 155-6)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an entire GENRE devoted to tuberculosis both in the West <br/>\nand Japan.<br/>\nUsually the illness is associated with young frail, beautiful women. <br/>\nInterestingly, many girls after their first menses WERE likely to get TB, <br/>\nespecially if they had a lower intake of protein (note many Japanese had <br/>\na vegetarian and fish diet that time). We know that the Shinsengumi <br/>\nwere the subject of folktales and even the novel Nakazato Kaizan&#39;s <br/>\nDAIBOSATSU-TOGE [the film SWORD OF DOOM] (although Okita was <br/>\nnot feminine or childlike in this work) it is easy to see how a doomed <br/>\nswordsman with TB all of sudden takes on female qualities which would <br/>\nsolidify him as a perpetually tragic figure in fiction. Most patients <br/>\nregardless of gender did experience exhaustion and thus if a masculine <br/>\nswordsman is constantly weak he gradually becomes more and more <br/>\nlike the gender associated with physical weakness.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Life means that form is retained even though matter is being <br/>\ntransformed.&quot; (Mann 262)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBibliography[return to top] <br/>\n<br/>\nBerridge, Virginia and Griffith Edwards.
