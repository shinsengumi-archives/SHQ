I suddenly got ready... :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is a LONG way from finished... needs some tweaking in various spots... no manga images yet (just received them a few minutes ago) and no PMK yet (going after permissions tomorrow)... and a couple of links need looking into.  It also hasn&#39;t been tested on Netscape yet as Netscape isn&#39;t loaded on my computer and I can&#39;t get to my husband&#39;s until he&#39;s finished blowing up things in his online game.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is my first time creating and loading a website, so it&#39;s very experimental.  The font size is smaller than I want it in some places... lots and lots more to learn.  I wanted to do something related to Saitou, so I chose to collect images.  I owe many thanks to Tiffany and Kevin for helping me today... especially Tiffany for giving me that little extra push over the side to do it.  Comments and complaints welcome.<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/spiritus_saitou\">http://www.geocities.com/spiritus_saitou</a><br/>\n <br/>\nphil (who&#39;s about decided RK Saitou deserves a site all his very own... ever try to pick &quot;just a few&quot; from among hundreds?  I should make it a revolving gallery...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
