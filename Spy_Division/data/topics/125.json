It ran mostly <br/>\nalong the Pacific coast and has been around since before they thought <br/>\nto keep track of history in Japan. It said there were 53 shukuba <br/>\nmachi along the route. These were posting stations were travelers <br/>\nrested and were controlled by the Bakufu. Remember, they did this to <br/>\nkeep track of potential threats to the Shogun. The road is mostly <br/>\ncovered by the Tokaido highway now, but you can still see parts of <br/>\nthe old road today and the Shinkansen line is supposed to run more or <br/>\nless alongside the old route.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently it was one of five Gokaido or main highways during the Edo <br/>\nperiod. The site listed one other route. The Nakasendo road was about <br/>\n500km or 310 miles long and had 67 shukuba machi. It began in <br/>\nNihonbashi in Edo and ended in Kyoto, cutting through the mountainous <br/>\ncentral region of Japan. Because it was a much harder way, it was <br/>\nless travelled than the Tokaido road.</div>",
