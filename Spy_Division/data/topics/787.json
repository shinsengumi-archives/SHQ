Purchasing manga/doujinshi and even scanning and <br/>\nhosting material will raise the costs of our site.  Therefore it is <br/>\na matter of lack of resources and time---*not interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, Hirotada Tokugawa contributed scans<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/getsumeiseiki.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/getsumeiseiki.htm</a><br/>\nwe posted them right away to this section<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm\">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthere are hundreds of Shinsengumi manga/doujinshi and as much as <br/>\nwe&#39;d like to we don&#39;t have the resources to highlight them all---so <br/>\nwe need your help to keep us informed<br/>\n<br/>\nanyone who wants to be a volunteer Shinsengumi pop-culture <br/>\ncorrespondence raise your hand!!!!  (^_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nwe are just a crossroad for many Shinsengumi fields whether it be <br/>\nhistory, fanart, fanfic or movies<br/>\nwe are 100% driven by volunteers</div>",
