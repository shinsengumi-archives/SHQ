Yes it will <br/>\n&gt; &gt; also depict the Fujita family and explain some stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The story is mainly about the Meiji Era however there will be scene <br/>\n&gt; &gt; which take place during the Bakumatsu.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The rating for this story is NC-17 due to the portrayals of various <br/>\n&gt; &gt; forms of sexuality.

It was not professionally edited, and ofcourse <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not a professional writer.

I know the website hasn&#39;t &quot;changed&quot; or been <br/>\n&gt; &gt; updated in months, but that is because updates would drive the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; programmer insane due to the database format we are implementing. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Once everything is done then updates will resume immediately.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can paypal the email contained in the story ($1, $1.50---I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; care)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; OR<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can paypal shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com and help support the <br/>\n&gt; site&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s totally voluntary because ofcourse I just gave the link to the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; story above (^_^)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; if you have comments, please email the author (email is in the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; header of every page)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
