Some of you may remember me as Gem-chan<br/>\nfrom over at RK Dreams. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I posted to .pdf articles over in the files section under<br/>\nwriting tips, Japanese terms and concepts. They are two articles I<br/>\nfound in my files in hard copy and then hunted down online. One is<br/>\ncalled Samurai Discontent and Social Mobility in the Late Tokugawa<br/>\nPeriod, the other, The Popularization of Samurai Values, A Sermon by<br/>\nHoshi Heishu. They&#39;re academic tomes, and slightly old ones at that,<br/>\nbut I find them to be interesting glimpses into the late Tokugawa<br/>\nperiod. They should have their copyright notices at the front of the<br/>\narticles, and as long as they are used for personal and non-commercial<br/>\nuse, then they are within the letter of the law. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll you nerds who read them, enjoy! :p<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gem-chan</div>",
