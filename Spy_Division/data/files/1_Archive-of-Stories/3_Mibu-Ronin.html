 I traveled for many days with little food or drink, slowly
my limbs grew weak, so weak that I needed to take a rest. 
I reflected back on why I started wandering, I began

came to pass in Kyoto. I'd traveled to Kyoto to joined the
Shinsengumi, because of my loyalty to the Shogunate, and
my dissaproaval of the Imperial government. When I arrived in 
Kyoto I was approached by Nagakura Shinpochi
