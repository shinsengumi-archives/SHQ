	It was a cold day in Edo but nowhere near as cold as my heart was.
 I was to journey to Kyoto from the capital Edo in search of work and to serve the Shogunate. 
I was stopped by a ronin who was sent back to serve the emperor. 
He asked me if I were in favor of the emperor, but I said sorry but no. 
He said ¡°unsheathed your sword now or die¡± I refused to fight him,
 he came towards me with his sword forward so I
 parried his attack off my draw and slashed threw his face and torso,
 then I flicked the blood off my blade and sheathed my sword.
 I was covered in my opponent¡¯s blood and it felt horrible,
 but I didn¡¯t show it. I flashed back when my friend Hanzo said
 "Keniji Yorimito don't travel to Kyoto there is nothing but violence
 and death.¡± But I knew it was the same everywhere so I kept walking
 down the dirt road, until I reached a small town. I went to the nearby restaurant for food, I told him that I was broke, but he told to pay him later. I ate warm miso soup and rice, with some sweetened tea. After 
the meal, I went to an open room. I was awakened by the sound of 
banging on the door. A group of samurai barged in with their swords drawn threatening for money. I quicky rose to my feet and said 

¡°you can not steal from this generous man, without me interfering.¡±
	One of the less smart ones attempted to attack me but dodged his thrust, which quickly became an horizontal slash, I ducked barley 
avoiding the blade, and thrusted my blade through his chest, he died 
instantly as I retrieved the rest of my sword from his chest. I left 
the blood on my blade and ran towards the next opponent who was frozen
 stiff, from the shock of his comrade¡¯s death, before he could attack my sword pierced his stomach, and I withdrew my blade from his abdomen, to slice through his neck separating his head from his body as he kneeled in 
pain. I glared at the other two, giving them a chance to leave,
 but I grew impatient because when one of them charged towards me
 and the other ran, I avoided the attacker, and ran towards
 the coward and used my sword to sever his arm off, leaving 
him there to bleed to death. Suddenly started think about my
 life as a child, when my parents were alive all the way to
 the fight I was involved in then. My face and hands were 
cold and I realized that the sword of the opponent I 
ignored was lodged through my shoulder. I saw a pool of 
blood and realized that I was dieing, I then knew how all 
my fallen opponents felt, cold. Before I died I looked at
 my blade and saw my reflection, my face was pale, I also
 noticed my enemy standing behind me crying with his sword raised,
 and than everything was black.
