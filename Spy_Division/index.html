<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The &quot;imaginary&quot; sister of <a href="../index.html">SHQ - Shinsengumi Headquarters</a>.  Here we collect information characters don&#39;t always tell about themselves - aka fanfiction & art.
</p><p>
This group was created to walk hand-in-hand with the more historical, discussion-oriented SHQ as a way to create adequate space for all the Shinsengumi fans&#39; needs and desires.  Members of this group are strongly encouraged to join SHQ for the depth and diversity of information about the Shinsengumi, the Tokugawa and Meiji periods, and Japanese terms frequently associated with the miburo and Revolutionary Japan.  SHQ is also a great place to have fun discussing the pop culture aspects as interest in the Shinsengumi grows.
</p><p>
Stories, poetry, art, manga, doujinshi, music -  whatever your artistic whims - are welcome.  The only hard-and-fast rule is that it must involve the Shinsengumi or individual members (like Saitou, Okita, Hijikata, et al).  Any source material is acceptable - Rurouni Kenshin (RK), PeaceMaker Kurogane (PMK), the NHK television drama, films (such as &quot;Mibugishiden&quot; or &quot;Gohatto&quot;), real history, or just your own imagination.  Hentai is also permissable.  Because fiction and art of an adult nature will be available on this list, you must be 16 years of age to join.
</p><p>
List guidelines are available in the List Business folder under Files in the Web Features.  Please take the time to look over the document as it includes guidelines for submission of fiction and art, as well as information about archives.
