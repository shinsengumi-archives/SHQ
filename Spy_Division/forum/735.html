by <i>iuiung</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-345808450">hi... i wanna ask you about shinsengumi artilery and gun policy. i <br/>
curious about it, did shinsengumi have it? because, i read an <br/>
information about weaponry used in shinsengumi, they also used some <br/>
mustekeers and some artilery. is that a fact or not?<br/>
and last, do you have any information about hijikata and his obsession <br/>
in shinsengumi. i think that hijikata had an important roles in <br/>
shinsengumi, beside that Kondo always gave him agreement of his <br/>
statements.<br/>
<br/>
thank you ^^</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144893520">Hello,  we are always happy to have questions and comments.<br/>
Alot of historical information can be searched here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ/</a><br/>
<br/>
This is what I can remember from <br/>
Author:Totman, Conrad D.<br/>
Title: 	The collapse of the Tokugawa bakufu, 1862-1868 / Conrad<br/>
Totman.Publisher: Honolulu : University Press of Hawaii, c1980.<br/>
<br/>
*while in Kyoto a group of the Shinsengumi did "abscond the use of<br/>
firearms"<br/>
<br/>
*during Toba and Fushimi many Shinsengumi did use PIKES (this is very<br/>
normal for that type of warfare)---the use of pikes was also effective<br/>
-------------------------------------------------<br/>
Nakazato, Kaizan, 1885-1944. : Dai-bosatsu Toge :<br/>
Great Bodhisattva Pass / Tokyo : Shunjusha, 1929<br/>
Includes a translation of Book 1-3 and synopses of Book 4-18.<br/>
translated by C.S. Bavier<br/>
<br/>
*this is a NOVEL---however the author -did- research the Shinsengumi<br/>
and in the reflection of the main character, as he rampaged in the<br/>
red-light quarters he heard the Shinsengumi shout "get the gun" to<br/>
shoot him! Thus, it is not strange for the Shinsengumi to have guns<br/>
-------------------------------------------------<br/>
The Shinsengumi retrained, regrouped and reorganized [after]<br/>
Toba-Fushimi this is where they would have used guns even more.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the Aizu fighting force, the Shinsegumi would have also had<br/>
access to guns.<br/>
<br/>
Try looking in <br/>
Hillsborough, Romulus. Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps<br/>
Tuttle Publishing ISBN: 0804836272<br/>
for more info<br/>
-------------------------------------------------<br/>
From the paintings of Shinsengumi member Nakajima Nobori<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Nakajimabio.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/Nakajimabio.htm</a><br/>
and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NN.html">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/portraits/NN.html</a><br/>
you will see some of the men with guns---not [all] were Shinsengumi<br/>
but clearly it shows that they did use mechanized weapons<br/>
-------------------------------------------------<br/>
Hijikata was the vice chief and personal friend of Kondo Isami (Isamu)<br/>
so yes he was very important.  To learn more about him please visit<br/>

Houjutsu Shihan Gashira (Teachers of Artillery):<br/>
Kiyohara Kiyoshi, Abe Juurou<br/>
<br/>
Those who are familiar with the chain of command in Shinsengumi will recall <br/>
that Abe Juurou was one of the gochou (corporals/second in command of an <br/>
individual unit).<br/>
<br/>
Also, SPOILER ALERT!!<br/>
