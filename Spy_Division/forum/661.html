<h3>Give me Music Recommendations...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617750773">I collect all kinds of music from folk music, ethnic, movie<br/>
soundtracks, all kinds, including gangsta rap, R&B, metal, trance etc<br/>
but for a while now I have been looking for tracks which &quot;could be&quot;<br/>
Shinsengumi songs.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t necessary for the lyrics to mentions samurai, swords, honor<br/>
etc etc etc because I am creating a Shinsengumi alternate universe<br/>
anyways where they exist in our era.<br/>

For example<br/>

if Nagakura + Harada were going clubbing...this would be their track<br/>

***this song has been used in car commercials I believe<br/>
<br/>
what do I do with this music?  I just shove them on my cheapo mp3<br/>
player and listen to them while I wander aimlessly in my school&#39;s<br/>
library---or when I have to do alot of typing (beats listening to<br/>
either left or right wing political talk radio)<br/>
<br/>
so Please email me off-list by clicking the &quot;email&quot; button at the top<br/>
or secretarytocapt3(a)hotmail.com<br/>
[OR] if you have this really great list you&#39;d like to share you can<br/>
just post here on the mailing list<br/>
<br/>
you can give the song name, CD and just one or two words why you think<br/>
it may fit a shinsengumi theme---I work near a used CD store so it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be too hard for me to find the song you mention<br/>
<br/>
note: I already some more obvious OST like &quot;Last SAmurai (Hans zimmer)<br/>
or Mibugishiden (Joe Hisaishi)---a sample track is available at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426113841">Well, a few things come to mind, but they are a bit off the beaten track.<br/>
 <br/>
1) The Oaf-Big Wreck from In Loving Memory-No real person or theme here, it would just be a great tune to choreograph a fight to.<br/>
 <br/>
2) Two tunes performed by Carlos Nunez.  The versions I have are from the album Almas de Fisterra.  First is &#39;Un Galicien Libre a Paris&#39;; it is a very positive sounding tune that would be good for any Shinsengumi member who is always very upbeat, i.e. any version of Soji or the NHK and PMK versions of Harada.  The second tune is called &#39;A Noite Pecha&#39;, it is a little darker and would do for any member who is more mysterious or introspective.  Any Saito in any universe.<br/>
 <br/>
3) Sky becomes Blue by Jin Hashimoto is another positive tune, suitable for the sunnier members.  It has already been used as a theme for one of the Kamen Rider series....actually I think it was the one with Jo Odagiri in it.<br/>
 <br/>
4) Sake in the Jar-This is a interesting spin on the Irish/Scottish folk song &#39;Whiskey in the Jar&#39; by Akiko Yano and the Chieftains from the album Tears of Stone.  Might be good for those members who get themselves into trouble over women (or anything else) on a regular basis.  Might be good for the comedian trio of PMK and the NHK Hijikata in the early episodes.<br/>
 <br/>
5) The Blood is Strong by Gordie Sampson.  Not sure what album this is from, my recording is from a music festival purchase.  It is a declaration of a will to survive that might be suitable for the Ichimura brothers of PMK.<br/>
 <br/>
6) Marco Polo by Loreena McKennitt from the album Book of Secrets.  Not sure why but this makes me think of the scene in Shinsengumi! (NHK) when they ambush the corrupt Osaka official (cannot think of his name at the moment).  The action is interspersed with scenes of Oyuki dancing for Kondo.<br/>
 <br/>
7) Boy Inside the Man by Tom Cochrane from Victory Day.  I have almost finished watching the NHK series and in the last few episodes there seems to be a lot of reminiscing and navel gazing and that is what this song is sort of about.  Might also be used for some of the introspection at the end of the Kepporoku series too.  Would love to see a video from that series!<br/>
 <br/>
8) Any of the movements for the cello by JS Bach as played by Yo Yo Ma.   <br/>
  <br/>
Not sure how legal it is, but if any of these peak your curiosity I may be able to send a copy to you.<br/>

I&#39;ve had this itch to make a music video for a while now with this <br/>
song... Sort of a PMK plus RK Shinsen crossover AMV... I just think the <br/>
song is perfect!<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you want to hear it.<br/>
