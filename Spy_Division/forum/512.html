<h3>Aoi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117567777">Under Photos>Single Originals is my entry into the Moeyoken Fanart <br/>
contest-- Tokugawa Yoshinobu's daughter, Aoi. Note-- she's wearing a <br/>
velvet choker around her neck, with a silver pendant in the center <br/>
bearing the Tokugawa crest.<br/>
<br/>
Revised information:<br/>
<br/>
Name: Tokugawa Aoi (also Aoi-hime)<br/>
Age: 22<br/>
Primary martial schooling: Edo-ha Yagyu Shinkage Ryu<br/>
Weapons trained in: Katana/wakizashi, tanto, naginata, Smith & Wesson <br/>
revolver, and kunai.<br/>
Weapons carried: tanto in obi knot, (sometimes) revolver in large <br/>
sleeves, and kunai...in certain places ;)<br/>
Character: Aristocratic-- deliciously, seductively arrogant. Enjoys <br/>
the attention she gets from wearing her kimono top loose. Often has <br/>
Matsudaira and Kondou's daughters over for visits, tea ceremony, etc. <br/>
When she trains in martial arts without a teacher (except with the <br/>
revolver), she trains in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
