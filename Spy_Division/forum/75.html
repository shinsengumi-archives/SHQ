<br/>
The Wolf�s retired from the police force.  What�s a Wolf to do?  Work at the same girls� school that his wife does, of course.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Why did he end up there?  What does he do?  More curious still, what happens when Saitou Hajime and a throng of teen-aged girls encounter each other on a daily basis? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The only rule to this challenge is that a story has to address the theme of the older, retired Saitou working at the girls� school that Tokio does --- something he did in real life. (Some of us remember Tiffany telling us about him directing rickshaw traffic on rainy days and apparently one of his main duties was to do number-crunching.)  And while the initial challenge was for it to be the personification of Saitou in Rurouni Kenshin, it�s open to any characterizations.  Information about the historical circumstances should be available in the Files sections of miburo and/or SHQ, or ask specific questions to the SHQ ML.  Information will also eventually be available at the central SHQ website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/</a> as files and such get transferred over.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is no deadline.  Upload stories as they�re in progress or finished into the folder titled �Saitou and the Girls� within the Story Archive folder under Files on the SHQ Spy Division yahoo site, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq_spy_division/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq_spy_division/</a> .  If your story has several chapters, just create a new folder for it with the story�s title within the �Saitou and the Girls� folder so all the parts stay together.  No limit on how many chapters it can be.  Don�t forget to include the header.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And I�d like to invite artists to participate as well.  Stories aren�t just told in words.  Manga and doujinshi artists, you�re challenged to participate as well.  Upload your entries into the Photos section.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Whether it�s a written story or art form, don�t forget to let us know it�s available!  Either send a message to the list or click on the notification button during the upload process.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A copy of this challenge will be available in the Challenge folder.  I�m also posting it up to the LJ.  If it generates any nibbles from non-SHQSD members, I�ll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
