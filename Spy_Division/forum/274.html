<h3>Shinsengumi - the fan musical</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-987131803">Okay, so it&#39;s an excuse to send another test message through, but still a valid question.  Do we have any musical people here among us?  Anyone written any songs related to the Shinsengumi?  I have someone over on my Cult of Hephaestion list who, with a partner, composed an entire musical based on Alexander the Great and was having it performed off-Broadway.  I don&#39;t know... somehow I just can&#39;t envision Saitou singing a solo or the entire Shinsengumi breaking into a dance against the Ishin Shishi a la West Side Story...<br/>

Shinsengumi. :) I guess the most famous song is &quot;Aa<br/>
Shinsengumi&quot;, sung by Mihachi Michiya :)<br/>

<br/>
I started writing a song for Jidai Monogatari, called &quot;Shirayuki&quot; <br/>
(snow-white), from Yuki&#39;s POV, thinking about Hiro and the <br/>
Shinsengumi. It got stuck after the first line, though...<br/>
