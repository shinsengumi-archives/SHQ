Stories, "Pagoda Springs Mega-Mall")...I shall post never before seen<br/>
pictures of Yamazaki Susumu's most valuable secret agent "Kame Ninja"<br/>
(humane/safe pet cosplay of the turtle seen here<br/>
http://www.1happyturtle.com)...this idea is based on the canine<br/>
cosplayers seen here http://www.0ad.jp/~asg/index.html and an AIM chat<br/>
where one of our members gave me an "idea" for his uniform...</div>

Description from the artist...<br/>
On the left is the front view - the collar is raised to protect our <br/>
dear wolf's neck and head from the chilly nights, and the bronze <br/>
shoulder guards will keep him from being harmed immediately if an <br/>
enemy attacks from behind<br/>
to chop at his shoulder, there is also a steel-plated armor covering <br/>
for the chest. The word for "makoto" is embossed so that the word <br/>
pops out (as shown in the side view). He can wear wheatever shirt <br/>
and pants over the plate, so<br/>
I didn't draw them. The swords are contained in a "dual shield" so <br/>
there would be less hassle when trying to tie both swords to the <br/>
waist. It is basically a sheath with two openings for two swords. <br/>
The back view - the word "makoto" is printed on the back in black. <br/>
Side view - here's a clearer<br/>
picture of the chest armor. Cloth is attached to the sides so that <br/>
it can be tied to his chest around the back. It is also lined with <br/>
soft cloth on the inside so that, at night, the cold steel would not <br/>
touch our hero's chest (and abs) and make him shiver. The shape is <br/>
curved to fit over a chest, so<br/>
that it can be worn comfortably. There is also a difference in the <br/>
peak design - here, they are more in the form of ascending mountain <br/>
peaks, instead of a flat mountain range design.<br/>
<br/>
And that's it! ^^ Thanks so much~!!!<br/>
