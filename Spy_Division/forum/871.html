so essentially a normal sausage can be upgraded to &quot;shinsengumi<br/>
sausage&quot; because it was in the Shinsengumi refrigerator.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it&#39;s incredibly dangerous for anyone to accept a<br/>
suggestively shaped food item stored by the Shinsengumi XD<br/>

:: that is my yaoi moment for the day ::<br/>
<br/>
but anyways I love the Gintama chara design for Kondou...I wish the<br/>
show was a bit more well written in terms of the humor XD</div>
