<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090972573">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Since the list has been pretty quiet I thought I&#39;d clog your inboxes <br/>
with  a bit of a reader survey. I would love to hear from as many of you <br/>
as possible--private email [bsher213(at)yahoo.com]may be best but here <br/>
might be fine if it&#39;s okay with Phil (?)<br/>
<br/>
The main question is--- Would you buy a novel set mainly in Bakumatsu <br/>
era Japan where the Shinsengumi appear as supporting characters?<br/>
<br/>
If yes, would it make a difference if the novel was geared for 16-22 yr <br/>
old (highschool/college) audience as opposed to a more detailed <br/>
&quot;serious&quot; historical novel?<br/>
<br/>
Would you buy such a novel in an ebook format or only the typical <br/>
&quot;bookstore book&quot; format? What if it was a &quot;trade paperback&quot; which <br/>
usually retail for about $10-$15?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for your time. Again you can respond to bsher213(at)yahoo.com<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828257066">Hi Barb,<br/>
<br/>
For me it&#39;s a definite yes, but you know me already as not really <br/>
adhering to what&#39;s in history, opting for something more <br/>
romanticized... Of course the main pull for me is the setting and <br/>
the Shinsengumi, even if I am out of the age group you mentioned... <br/>
LOL! <br/>
<br/>
As to whether it&#39;s ebook or not, my opinion on that when it comes to <br/>
price is ebooks should be cheaper than the paperback edition. Also <br/>
what format would the ebook be? You can reach a lot of pocketpc/palm <br/>
users by making sure it&#39;s compatible with mobipocket or better yet <br/>
Microsoft Reader which I think has versions for both Desktop and <br/>
PPC. However if it was available in my local store, then I&#39;d go out <br/>
of my way to the brick and mortar store. It&#39;s nice to hold something <br/>
substantial in my hand and not be bothered with opening the PC or <br/>
reading it in a PDA. So if price isn&#39;t such a big difference and I <br/>
can get a hold of the paperback, I&#39;d get the paperback.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

<br/>
But, yes, I&#39;d almost definitely buy the book. I have no preference <br/>
whether or not it is geared for a certain audience, as long as the <br/>
story is interesting and well-written. As for the format, I <br/>
personally prefer an actual book over ebooks (mostly so I can bring <br/>
it everywhere to read, lol)<br/>
