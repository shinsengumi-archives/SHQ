Yasou<br/>
Introduction<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
She was lovely beautiful in her simplicity soothing to his tortured <br/>
spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Koshima approached the young woman he had followed to the field of <br/>
June wildflowers, amused by how her lashes fluttered against her <br/>
cheeks as she cast her eyes downward in flirtatious propriety.  The <br/>
corners of her mouth tipped gently upward in a smile that on any <br/>
other woman he would&#39;ve taken for coyness.  Reds and golds sparkled <br/>
in her brown hair as dappled sunlight penetrated beyond the treetop <br/>
canopy.<br/>
<br/>
When he was close enough to touch her, she lifted her face and looked <br/>
directly into his eyes.  Her voice was soft and inviting.  &quot;My lord &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shirou,&quot; he corrected her, giving her the gift of his name as he <br/>
crouched down before her.<br/>
<br/>
She smiled at the touch of his fingertips on her lips.  &quot;Naname.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Had he been any other man, Saitou would&#39;ve whistled.  As he was not <br/>
any other man, Saitou walked the wide street towards home in complete <br/>
silence and bland decorum.  Commissioner Kawaji wasn&#39;t the only one <br/>
who never knew what was going on inside the Wolf&#39;s head.  Saitou <br/>
intended to keep it that way.<br/>
<br/>
His workday was officially over.  It wasn&#39;t as though government <br/>
lackeys and underworld thugs weren&#39;t plotting away for their own <br/>
selfish gain on any given street in any town in Japan, but right now <br/>
he couldn&#39;t be bothered too much about it.  They&#39;d still be there <br/>
when he was ready to stop living the dream life of an ordinary police <br/>
inspector.<br/>
<br/>
Two months strapped to a Tokyo desk he couldn&#39;t have been happier.<br/>
<br/>
Not as happy, however, as about what he knew awaited him at the end <br/>
of this journey.  Something new something fresh and alive and as <br/>
vibrant as the flowers spilling over planters and hedge rows in the <br/>
welcoming warmth of late spring.  Something that made Saitou feel <br/>
reborn and young again.  Something unexpected in the form of a young <br/>
man by the name of Sagara Sanosuke.<br/>
<br/>
The thought was more appetizing than anticipating his next bowl of <br/>
plain, hot soba.<br/>
<br/>
Saitou let a part of his mind wander a phenomenon rarely indulged.  <br/>
He could picture Sanosuke waiting for him, checking and rechecking <br/>
the clock every five minutes as he listened for the familiar steps up <br/>
the short walkway to the front of the house.  The impact of the <br/>
strong body as he welcomed Saitou home --- his way of congratulating <br/>
the cop for making it through to the end of another day still alive --<br/>
- quickly becoming a routine neither would ever tire of; a perfect <br/>
touch to define the end of one part of the day and herald the start <br/>
of another.<br/>
<br/>
It would wake Saitou up and rekindle the fire in dulled senses, <br/>
preparing him for the night to come.<br/>
<br/>
As he stepped off the street and onto the walk, Saitou mentally <br/>
braced himself to withstand the strength behind Sanosuke&#39;s exuberant <br/>
greeting and unconsciously cursed the politicians and yakuza who <br/>
insisted on always untying the leash that kept him behind a desk.<br/>
<br/>

Yasou = wildflowers<br/>
<br/>
Koshima Shirou was the real name of Sagara Souzou.  Naname was Sano&#39;s <br/>
mother&#39;s name in the manga.  You have to know where this is leading.  <br/>
And the fact I can&#39;t leave Sagara alone.</div>
