<div id="ygrps-yiv-103493195">Haku/Charlene was tragically killed in a car accident this past January.  The contest website links to the blog set up by  Charlene's business partner and good friend from school (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cwsun.sunrainproductions.com/)">http://cwsun.sunrainproductions.com/)</a>.  There are more formal mechanisms to leave notes and there is a link to a formal scholarship program being established in her honor.  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the contest, this contest is being put together by some longtime fans and participants in Haku's annual art contest.  As many of you know, Haku kept it up even after the fandom slowly began to drift off.     She had wanted to keep it going as long as people would enter and was very interested in the progress of the many young artists who had participated in contests year after year.  This was something she really enjoyed doing for the fandom, and she would pay for the prizes out of pocket.  She had a big heart and a big fangirl love for Kenshin. <br/>
<br/>
 I'm no longer on the various lists (like the old SASSE and other fangirl yahoo group lists) or the old livejournal groups. If any of you would be kind enough to post the info in those fora, that would be appreciated.   <br/>
