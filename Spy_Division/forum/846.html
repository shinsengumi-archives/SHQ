----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
This project is especially for the Shinsengumi fan who believes <br/>
he/she can write a really GOOD story with Okita as a vampire but was <br/>
too afraid because there is no venue for "out there stories...<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recently purchased some sugar for the kitchen and 2 liters of <br/>
rootbeer and the end result is a mental hurricane you will read below.<br/>
<br/>
Hardcore writers/authors/poets come here...<br/>
<br/>
As a member of fandom I read fanfic etc. However, I find myself being <br/>
unable to expand into other universes unless I took alot of time to <br/>
consume that professionally made universe. For instance, I can't read <br/>
or understand Gintama fanfic cuz I've seen under 1 hour of it on <br/>
youtube.<br/>
<br/>
So I wonder, if anyone out there would be interested in producing an <br/>
anthology of 100% original fiction, poetry, containing hand <br/>
drawn/crafted art, digital art, photographed 3D art etc, graphic <br/>
novel. The art should complement the stories or they can stand alone <br/>
but must have a "point" to it---the author may explain in a <br/>
paragraph "why" they created the art. I know that all art is up to <br/>
the viewer to interpret...but if you photograph a drop of blood on a <br/>
sheet of rice paper most people would be clueless of what you are <br/>
getting at.<br/>
<br/>
I'm inspired by this idea because a friend and I outlined a hot yuri <br/>
story that is 100% original and I think very fascinating. We would <br/>
never have an audience because it doesn't "fit" in a universe. I also <br/>
completed and now improving a twincest story (the twincest part was <br/>
suggested, I was trying to submit it somewhere), and I think it's <br/>
readable (after I improve it).<br/>
<br/>
I want to call this Imagine 1800s Azia Anthology (I-1800s-A)<br/>
<br/>
By explaining the title I hope to convey the essence of the <br/>
publication and why it would be a strong and successful (maybe even <br/>
PROFITABLE venture).<br/>
<br/>
I am not anti-fandom, but I am pro-original. Absolutely no universe <br/>
derived stuff. Period.<br/>
The reason why is because I want to sell this anthology folks. <br/>
Adapting your fanfic involving lets say a hitokiri with an x shaped <br/>
scar on his cheek, changing his name and his hair color is just still <br/>
ripping off the original and easily recognizable.<br/>
<br/>
Besides I really dislike how people snark about this and that being <br/>
OOC, or not accurate enough for the canon.<br/>
<br/>
SETTING<br/>
The reason why the title is (I-1800s-A) is because we don't need to <br/>
make all the stories Japan centric. The characters can be any <br/>
nationality. The Japanese travelled abroad so the story can take <br/>
place in Europe, Africa and the United States and other countries <br/>
like Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Siam. <br/>
<br/>
I spelled "Azia" because I want to take fantasy-history. For example <br/>
in the Russo-Japanese war what if there was a super weapon being used <br/>
by the Russians or Japanese developed by a scientist? (Alternate <br/>
Universe) OR WHAT IF THE QUEEN OF KOREA WAS NOT KILLED BY THE MEIJI <br/>
GOV and there was an attempt to invade Hokkaido by the Koreans using <br/>
a small fleet led by radicals? SEe what I mean? Infinite possbilities.<br/>
<br/>
ERA<br/>
1800-1912 (end of the Meiji Era, however you can make the story set <br/>
in modern times and flash back to the 1800s---most of the content <br/>
however should be 1800s) If you enter the Showa Era just a bit that's <br/>
fine but don't go overboard. If you want to do a time travel for a <br/>
samurai pre-1800s and put him in the Meiji Era that's fine but please <br/>
do your homework. Japanese culture did change over time as did the <br/>
role of the samurai.<br/>
<br/>
CONTENT/GENRE<br/>
There is so much in history to inspire your fiction. However, there <br/>
is no genre limit. I'll take historical fiction/fantasy, horror (oh <br/>
man I luv horror), gothic, romance, comedy, steampunk, fantasy and <br/>
YES EROTICA (m/m, f/f, m/f and any combination. NO underage kids, <br/>
rape to arouse or entertain and bestiality, rape as character history <br/>
is ok, no scatalogical stuff or necrophilia to arouse the readers <br/>
either---shape shifters ok).<br/>
<br/>
Because I'll take erotica, each story will be proceeded by a page <br/>
with a rating and warning. <br/>
By selling this anthology I hope to prevent underage folks from <br/>
getting their hands on it anyways. As for historical fiction there <br/>
can be varying degrees of accuracy but if you want to mention the <br/>
name of the Prime Minister for a certain year, please be sure you <br/>
have the right guy named in your text. If you are a mega-history-<br/>
researcher type yes...yes you can include footnotes and bibliography. <br/>
Really GOOD edu-tainment is awesome but you need a plot and great <br/>
characters too.<br/>
<br/>
POETRY<br/>
I love poetry. I hate one word poems though. That's not a poem.<br/>
Poems can be accompanied with art if you like.<br/>
<br/>
ARTISTIC FREEDOM<br/>
No "happily ever after" required.<br/>
If you want to write horror and gore...go right ahead but there needs <br/>
to be a motivation for all things.<br/>
If you write sexy stuff it better be ~HOT~<br/>
<br/>
ART<br/>
Each story gets a cover which the writer can design herself/himself <br/>
using any medium as long as it is 100% original. If you can't draw <br/>
your characters, fine with me, use symbols from the story. Be <br/>
creative, look at professional book covers and see the variety of <br/>
styles. For example you can purchase photos from online vendors and <br/>
manipulate the image etc. Just please don't grab a screencap from <br/>
Mibugishiden, rip-off fanart from deviant art and call it your story <br/>
cover. You may work with an artist.<br/>
You can submit a graphic novel but please understand that pencil <br/>
sketches will not look very good in print, nor will an effort to <br/>
imitate the art style of another artist. If you don't <br/>
do "manga"/"anime" style then don't force yourself. Be natural in <br/>
your art and let your own style emerge. Originality before mimickry. <br/>
Art can be color or black and white or as I said earlier, photos.<br/>
<br/>
GRAPHIC NOVEL<br/>
It's not always possible for an artist to complete 10 detailed pages <br/>
of art or story, so I will even take a short story, some illustrated <br/>
panels, and then the rest of the story. This allows the artist the <br/>
freedom to "fuse" more than one mode of story telling!<br/>
<br/>
LENGTH<br/>
No minimum wordcount, however the cap is at 30K (Novella length). <br/>
Each story must be complete because this is a one shot anthology <br/>
deal...no series/(to be continued).<br/>
<br/>
QUALITY<br/>
Each work must be complete and nearly ready to publish. Dont' turn in <br/>
a manuscript and then 2 days later turn in a different version <br/>
(that's really confusing). Once it is edited it will be returned to <br/>
the author who must complete edits and turn it back in ASAP. AFter I <br/>
read it the first time...then you can propose changes in the LAST <br/>
DRAFT if need be.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be high quality stuff so please no glaring grammar <br/>
errors. If you write a fantasy and give a chara a special name, be <br/>
sure there is some consistency to your names and the "rules" you <br/>
establish in the fantasy story.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a pretty hardcore person (ok it's taking forever for me to <br/>
relaunch SHQ.com but believe me there is a lengthy explanation for <br/>
that---and I lived on P&J sandwiches for a month and it nearly killed <br/>
me I had no energy to do much)----but I know what I can manage and <br/>
I'm pretty driven to get things done.<br/>
<br/>
I don't like flakes. Don't tell me "I'll turn in my story tomorrow" <br/>
and then not turn it in. I don't like that. I also check my email <br/>
twice a day atleast so you will get a response from me unless I am on <br/>
my death bed or something is wrong with my internet. In other words, <br/>
I'll work just as hard as you will on this project.<br/>
<br/>
If I read your story and say this or that part is confusing or needs <br/>
improvement don't take it personally. I've been rejected so many <br/>
times for the same reasons and any weakness I see in your work is <br/>
probably in my own as well. The goal is to make every page of this <br/>
anthology awesome.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?<br/>
Fame. Fortune ofcourse!<br/>
No not really. You do get a venue to showcase your talent.<br/>
This is what I want to do: If I get 10 stories, art etc and determine <br/>
the page count or word count I'd like to get it published by Lulu.com <br/>
(now for my friends who are real professional writers and artists you <br/>
must sympathize that it's a pain to get a major publisher to accept <br/>
anything). Submitting to a major e-pub means you can wait weeks for <br/>
them to read it, reject it, and if its contracted you wait forever to <br/>
get your %.<br/>
<br/>
As the anthology sells (translation, your mommy and daddy buys one <br/>
copy) and the money comes in, it is split between all contributors. <br/>
Fine details of the % split between author and writer will be <br/>
negotiated once I figure out who is interested. We can even setup a <br/>
chat and yell at each other and figure stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
So you ask...how will this anthology be promoted?<br/>
Well...that's where you come in.<br/>
I am the webmaster for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a> (basically when <br/>
the site is done, I'm actually going to celebrate by doing some <br/>
art/writing by focusing on this project!). So yeah, I am DYING to see <br/>
a new take on the Shinsengumi! <br/>
<br/>
So when the anthology is done, I put up a tiny link from SHQ to the <br/>
Lulu.com page selling the anthology. Those of you dev-art or <br/>
fanfiction.net or adultfanfiction.net accounts should be pimping this <br/>
anthology when it is done.<br/>
<br/>
In other words I-1800s-Azia is a "cooperative" where you put in the <br/>
time and work and maybe you may get enough money to buy some tea at <br/>
starbucks or something.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever happens, you'll get an anthology in your hands you can be <br/>
proud of.<br/>
<br/>
DEADLINES<br/>
Please email me at secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com for <br/>
proposals/questions by August 1st<br/>
If no one is interested that's fine. <br/>
I got a whole bunch of ideas and I'll do this on my own (^_^). I have <br/>
stuff which would be good on adultfanfiction.net but it's mixed in <br/>
with nerd stuff and people there don't like that. I can't fit on <br/>
fanfiction.net because my work is original so I'm in artistic <br/>
purgatory or something.<br/>
<br/>
LASTLY<br/>
I'd even want this anthology on a CD because I would think it's cool <br/>
if people did audio stories or read their poetry but I don't think <br/>
that is possible.</div>
