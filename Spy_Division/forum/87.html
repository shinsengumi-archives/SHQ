<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448719659">There may be a few problems with the messageboard...if so just email me <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:secretarytocapt3@...">secretarytocapt3@...</a> and I will get to them Saturday<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can VIEW the messageboard<br/>
however you must register at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ezboard.com/">http://www.ezboard.com/</a> to POST<br/>
My rules are: <br/>
1) you must be atleast 18 just because recommendations for yaoi<br/>
stories may be posted<br/>
2) to please be respectful and abstain from the use of profanity<br/>
3) whenever possible include a link to wherever you got your info...if<br/>
you can&#39;t remember then it should go in the &quot;folktales&quot; section which<br/>
will house rumors<br/>
4) strict adherence to the code of bushido<br/>
<br/>
 Personal Icon to 10x10 px <br/>
You have to upload your own icon and type in the URL exactly in your<br/>
profiles<br/>
Please do not steal other people&#39;s bandwidth...you can get an account<br/>
at www.geocities.com to host images<br/>
<br/>
 Limit Personal Photo to 60x60 px I believe this will appear only on<br/>
your profile page<br/>
<br/>
I can also designate ranks for you such as Daimyo, Chief, Captain,<br/>
Secretary, Accountant, Fundoshi Washer, Historian, Kenjutsu Teacher,<br/>
Jiujutsu Teacher, Harada&#39;s girl etc.  You&#39;ll just have to register<br/>
then send me a personal message or email me at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:secretarytocapt3@...">secretarytocapt3@...</a><br/>

How to post a new topic<br/>
1. To post a new topic, click on the New Topic button (may vary<br/>
depending on the community).<br/>
2. Once you have clicked the New Topic button it will take you to a<br/>
page where you enter your message and subject title. When you are<br/>
finished, you can choose to preview your topic by checking the preview<br/>
box next to the Add Post button<br/>
<br/>
How to edit a post<br/>
Only the original author, administrator or moderator can edit a post<br/>
on a community. <br/>
1. To edit a message, click on the Edit link or image (usually a<br/>
checkmark).<br/>
2. Once you have clicked the Edit link it will take you to a page<br/>
where you can edit the message. You can choose to preview your reply<br/>
by checking the preview box next to the Edit Message button.<br/>
<br/>
How to Bold Text Within a Post<br/>
Sometimes you&#39;ll want to emphasize a word or phrase within a post.<br/>
Making the text bold is often a great way to do this.<br/>
&lt;strong&gt; this is bold text &lt;/strong&gt;<br/>
Result: this is bold text<br/>
<br/>
How to Create a Link That Opens in a New Window<br/>
Linking somewhere else will take them away from a post. Adding the<br/>
target=&quot;_blank&quot; parameter will open a new window so that they never leave.<br/>
&lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ezboard.com/&quot;">http://www.ezboard.com/&quot;</a>  target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt; this link will<br/>
pop-up a new window&lt;/a&gt;<br/>
 Result: this link will pop-up a new window<br/>
[if you notice on all the links at the top of the messageboard...I<br/>
made it so that a new page will be opened for everyone&#39;s convenience]<br/>
<br/>
How to Add an Image to Your Post<br/>
Perhaps one of the most popular tags used within posts.<br/>
&lt;img src=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ezboard.com/image/csc_goldcommunity.gif&quot;">http://www.ezboard.com/image/csc_goldcommunity.gif&quot;</a>&gt;</div>
