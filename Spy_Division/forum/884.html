<h3>Wonderful Saito and Soji  Original Art</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126116480">I'm so happy to see original art featuring the Shinsengumi---this will<br/>
really blow you away.  Often when you see poser art the people are so<br/>
stiff and plastic looking but I'm always amazed by how Kikue can make<br/>
her characters' skin and eyes look incredibly soft!<br/>
<br/>
Look at this image and ladies you can admit that you want to smooth<br/>
your hands over these two.<br/>

the site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai-on-samurai.com">http://samurai-on-samurai.com</a> (www.kikue-mugen.com/) is not<br/>
yet complete.  Samurai-on-samurai SOS will also be publishing an<br/>
original novel, GOJOU HAJIME, in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Yaoi fans are probably familiar with SaiSa (Saito and Sano based on<br/>
the RK fanfics) however Gojou Hajime is about many other romantic<br/>
pairings within the Shinsengumi.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298100949">Dear All Members,<br/>
<br/>
Please exercise common courtesy on this list and provide constructive<br/>
for art, fiction or multi-media shared by fellow members here.  I do<br/>
now realize that "l17842" is a Shinsengumi fan and perhaps yaoi<br/>
material maybe offensive to this individual.  The image shared in my<br/>
post was completely rated-G.  From now on, on the subject line I will<br/>
type [Yaoi] so that people who dislike this sort of material can avoid<br/>
the message entirely.  So I do take responsibility for my post and<br/>
suggest anyone else who wishes to share the art/fiction/multimedia to<br/>
continue to post  here without any worries given they provide the<br/>
appropriate warning.<br/>
<br/>
Ofcourse, this list is for -all- genres, not just yaoi.  <br/>
Any Shinsengumi fan would know though, that yaoi has long since been<br/>
part of the fandom for many, many years and it started in Japan.  So<br/>
if you dislike it---just avoid it.  No need to be mean about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

To some of us, this disgusting is a good disgusting. Relax, no one's <br/>
mad at you for having an opinion. But this is a forum for intelligent <br/>
discussion and not the, "oh ewwwww disgusting," and leave it at that. <br/>
Least you can do is tell us why.  Or maybe, tell us why you were <br/>
offended.  You know, be civil about it, or els the poor artist may be <br/>
traumatized from this whole issue of disgust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344220181">Shinsengumi fan coming out of lurkdom here to just give my two cents worth..<br/>
While I admit yaoi is not normally my taste I do accept it as part of the genre and the subject matter certianly does NOT reflect on the talent of the artist. I happened to think the artwork itself was wonderful, certianly anything beyond *my* skill. While I was there I checked out some of the other artwork there and each one seemed better than the last.<br/>
A few years ago a creative writing teacher consoled me in a similiar situation with some advice;think of it as ice cream. There are hundreds of different varieties of ice cream and the only flavor that almost everyone can agree on they like in general is vanilla---and only because its pretty bland. Bland=Boring. <br/>
<br/>
To the artist; I saved your site to my favorites and am really looking forward to seeing more of your work and of others posted on this list. Never be bland, dear. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80713477">Oh many, many hugs to you! I'm far from being 'bland'. It goes <br/>
against my nature... Thank you for your wonderful words of <br/>
encouragement, because whether people are bland, or not bland we're <br/>
all wonderful in our own little/ big ways.  People are fascinating <br/>
creatures, that's why I write about them and draw them too.<br/>
<br/>
You made me smile... Thanks! :D<br/>
