<h3>Need a BIG favor... website test</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404372899">I'm sending this to both groups in order to rope in the most guinea pigs.  :-D<br/>
 <br/>
I've spent the last two days learning (or trying to learn) how to create a framed webpage.  The RK Saitou shrine is the grand experiment.  To put it mildly, it's been a bitch.  My resource books tell me to do one thing, I do it, and something completely different happens, so I'm left staring at html code trying to find the discrepancy.  I've about decided that a story about Saitou in an American high school would make delicious reading right about now.  :-D<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, the front page is back up with active links to two pages --- I Don't Know Where You Got Your Sense of Humor and the registry (the home button on those two pages simply opens the front page in the content window... something else I've got to figure out --- how to get it to open it in a full screen again... I have some ideas after all I just went through to figure out the following -->).  I've just spent the last 3 hours trying to figure out WHY oh WHY it was opening up a new window when I clicked on the link in the navigation bar I created when I followed instructions implicitly... it would've helped if they had told me which of the three html documents I needed to edit in the first place... gads, how much do I have to figure out for myself?  There's one more thing I need to do to the buttons on the navigation bar --- a text box giving the title of the page linked --- but that can wait until later.<br/>
 <br/>
The favor I need is for people to access the site and see if it works for them, then get in touch with me and let me know "yes, it worked" or "no, it wouldn't even load/loaded but doesn't work".  In both cases, could you tell me what browser you have?  If Netscape causes major problems, then I'm probably going to have to create a non-frames site as well.  You can contact me via the registry (there's a private option if you prefer), responding to this message, or writing to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:spiritus_saitou@...">spiritus_saitou@...</a> .<br/>
 <br/>
Many, MANY thanks in advance.  The site is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/philalexandrostoo">http://www.geocities.com/philalexandrostoo</a> .<br/>
