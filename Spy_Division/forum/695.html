<br/>
The song is featured background music in many SHinsengumi or general<br/>
Bakumatsu films<br/>
but I can&#39;t recall if NHK Shinsengumi used it.  I know in the film<br/>
BYAKKOTAI (the first half was about the Shinsengumi) Ryoma is treated<br/>
to an ee ja na kai parade before he his murdered.<br/>
<br/>
[note: that is not my hand, ok the person can afford an IPOD but not<br/>
nail clippers---geez]<br/>

Possible Shinsengumi Costumes for Halloween Patrol<br/>

<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu:  he can&#39;t decide what to wear, for a change he may go<br/>
as a Buddhist nun<br/>
<br/>
Shimada Kai:  A Geisha on steroids<br/>
<br/>

something to consider...<br/>
if Gilbert and Sullivan, being the closet Loyalists that they are,<br/>
wrote THE MIKADO<br/>
<br/>
how come<br/>
<br/>
no one has written an operetta called THE TYCOON (common 19th century<br/>
label for shogun)</div>

As far as I know (and I could definitely be wrong), this was more of an (*gasp*) Ishin/Imperialist thing.  It&#39;s featured at the beginning of the film &quot;Akage&quot; (&quot;Red Lion&quot;), along with the shower of talismen and lots of dancing to highlight the change hoped for with the tide turning in favor of the Imperialists, to the point I fast-forward.  It gets irritating really fast.  No doubt it would&#39;ve been high on the list on Sagara Souzou&#39;s IPod.  ^_^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428298156">Yes, the proliferation of this subversive mp3 started a whole new<br/>
division in the Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
the dreaded copyright Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s why I called it the Bakumatsu Ipod and not new selection group ipod<br/>
<br/>
the Ishin such as SAigo were experts at other methods of warfare such<br/>
as inciting riots etc etc we have details of Saigo encouraging rice<br/>
riots in Edo or just riots in general---it makes perfect sense that an<br/>
already unhappy populus at the bottom loved this movement<br/>
<br/>
this is also connected to the whole world renewal group yonaoshi in<br/>
Aizu as well<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**gigglesnort**  Or, say, sending a certain idealistic loyalist in to burn out targeted merchants, harrass bakufu police, shoot into villas of shogunal allies, set the castle on fire... ?  That would be Saigou&#39;s doing, too. Hey, they had to shake the Big Boy&#39;s hold on Edo & Japan and free the long-time oppressed somehow.  :-P<br/>
 <br/>
Sec knows I love her and I know Sagara-san doesn&#39;t belong here, but I couldn&#39;t resist.  Mea culpa.  I shall cease and desist and return to my corner.<br/>
