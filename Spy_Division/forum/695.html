<div id="ygrps-yiv-748969162">The latest craze amongst townspeople and peasants<br/>

Bakumatsu IPOD with only 1 track!!!!<br/>

<br/>
The song is featured background music in many SHinsengumi or general<br/>
Bakumatsu films<br/>
but I can't recall if NHK Shinsengumi used it.  I know in the film<br/>
BYAKKOTAI (the first half was about the Shinsengumi) Ryoma is treated<br/>
to an ee ja na kai parade before he his murdered.<br/>
<br/>
[note: that is not my hand, ok the person can afford an IPOD but not<br/>
nail clippers---geez]<br/>

Possible Shinsengumi Costumes for Halloween Patrol<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata: Wolf<br/>
OKita:  LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD<br/>
<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu:  he can't decide what to wear, for a change he may go<br/>
as a Buddhist nun<br/>
<br/>
Shimada Kai:  A Geisha on steroids<br/>
<br/>
Saitou:  A modern art painting<br/>

something to consider...<br/>
if Gilbert and Sullivan, being the closet Loyalists that they are,<br/>
wrote THE MIKADO<br/>
<br/>
how come<br/>
<br/>
no one has written an operetta called THE TYCOON (common 19th century<br/>
label for shogun)</div>

As far as I know (and I could definitely be wrong), this was more of an (*gasp*) Ishin/Imperialist thing.  It's featured at the beginning of the film "Akage" ("Red Lion"), along with the shower of talismen and lots of dancing to highlight the change hoped for with the tide turning in favor of the Imperialists, to the point I fast-forward.  It gets irritating really fast.  No doubt it would've been high on the list on Sagara Souzou's IPod.  ^_^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428298156">Yes, the proliferation of this subversive mp3 started a whole new<br/>
division in the Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
the dreaded copyright Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
that's why I called it the Bakumatsu Ipod and not new selection group ipod<br/>
<br/>
the Ishin such as SAigo were experts at other methods of warfare such<br/>
as inciting riots etc etc we have details of Saigo encouraging rice<br/>
riots in Edo or just riots in general---it makes perfect sense that an<br/>
already unhappy populus at the bottom loved this movement<br/>
<br/>
this is also connected to the whole world renewal group yonaoshi in<br/>
Aizu as well<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**gigglesnort**  Or, say, sending a certain idealistic loyalist in to burn out targeted merchants, harrass bakufu police, shoot into villas of shogunal allies, set the castle on fire... ?  That would be Saigou's doing, too. Hey, they had to shake the Big Boy's hold on Edo & Japan and free the long-time oppressed somehow.  :-P<br/>
 <br/>
Sec knows I love her and I know Sagara-san doesn't belong here, but I couldn't resist.  Mea culpa.  I shall cease and desist and return to my corner.<br/>
