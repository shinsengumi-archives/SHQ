   <br/>
  Just wanna ask,,,,<br/>
   <br/>
  I read some books of Shinsengumi, and surfed in some of Shinsengumi websites.<br/>
   <br/>
  Most of it told me that Shinsengumi is a really strict squad with strict rules.<br/>
   <br/>
  It says that They have 5 basic rules,<br/>
  ( don't need to mention it coz know you guyz already know )<br/>
   <br/>
  But my history sensei, ( he is a professor in one of popular university in Japan ), told me that all of those rules is fiction ( there is no prove about it ) and it was ( maybe ) written by novelist .<br/>
   <br/>
  Could anybody give me some explanation about it ? <br/>
   <br/>
  Thankz ......<br/>
   <br/>
  Rei<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309649641">For those curious, Kikuchi's discussion of the "Kyokuchu Gohatto" appears in <br/>
its own chapter, from pp. 50-52 of "Shinsengumi Hyakuichi no Nazo" (Tokyo: <br/>
Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 1993, republished in 2000).<br/>

The "Kyokuchu Gohatto" (roughly meaning "Unit Prohibitions")-- the 5 rules-- <br/>
are quoted by many people. Kikuchi Akira-sensei, in his groundbreaking <br/>
analytical work "Shinsengumi Hyakuichi no Nazo," states, based on evidence <br/>
he has gathered, that the name "Kyokuchu Gohatto" and the articles <br/>
themselves, were a creation of the novelist Shimozawa Kan. Shimozawa Kan did <br/>
speak to some former Shinsengumi, as well as to Yamakawa Kenjiro, the Aizu <br/>
retainer devoted to historical preservation, who was a friend of Saitou <br/>
Hajime (Fujita Goro)....but the rules themselves appear to have been <br/>
Shimozawa's exercise of creative license.<br/>
<br/>
You said your teacher was a professor at a popular university in <br/>
Japan....could he by any chance be the same Kikuchi Akira?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have Oishi's "Shinsengui: Saigo no Bushi no Jitsuzo". I must say <br/>
though, it really makes a lot more sense when you put it next to Sasaki <br/>
Suguru's "Boshin Sensou" and Hoshi Ryoichi's "Bakumatsu no Aizu-han," but as <br/>
far as Oishi's work itself, I'll write something up for you soon.<br/>
