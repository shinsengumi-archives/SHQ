<h3>SH Meets SH Fiction Challenge Modifications</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-806817112">The guidelines for the &quot;SH Meets SH&quot; fiction challenge have been <br/>
modified somewhat because of changes to the list and Masayoshi&#39;s <br/>
wonderful idea of &quot;what if Holmes went to Japan instead?&quot; The new <br/>
document has been uploaded into the Challenges & Contests folder <br/>
under Files.  Also in the &quot;SH Meets SH&quot; folder you&#39;ll find incredible <br/>
notes on the Jack the Ripper murders, generously provided by <br/>
MissBehavin&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who come to us from lists other than miburo, check <br/>
it out!<br/>

I help reformat stories for an archive site (not SHQ!) that&#39;s been <br/>
lost... so much for returning to my own writing)</div>
