<h3>SH Meets SH Fiction Challenge Modifications</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-806817112">The guidelines for the "SH Meets SH" fiction challenge have been <br/>
modified somewhat because of changes to the list and Masayoshi's <br/>
wonderful idea of "what if Holmes went to Japan instead?" The new <br/>
document has been uploaded into the Challenges & Contests folder <br/>
under Files.  Also in the "SH Meets SH" folder you'll find incredible <br/>
notes on the Jack the Ripper murders, generously provided by <br/>
MissBehavin'.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who come to us from lists other than miburo, check <br/>
it out!<br/>

I help reformat stories for an archive site (not SHQ!) that's been <br/>
lost... so much for returning to my own writing)</div>
