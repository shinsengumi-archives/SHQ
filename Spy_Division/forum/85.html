<h3>phil&#39;s playing around again</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402309653">I&#39;ve been meaning to learn html for some time, but knew that it was pointless to even approach it until I was really ready.  I suddenly got ready... :-)<br/>
 <br/>
It is a LONG way from finished... needs some tweaking in various spots... no manga images yet (just received them a few minutes ago) and no PMK yet (going after permissions tomorrow)... and a couple of links need looking into.  It also hasn&#39;t been tested on Netscape yet as Netscape isn&#39;t loaded on my computer and I can&#39;t get to my husband&#39;s until he&#39;s finished blowing up things in his online game.<br/>
 <br/>
This is my first time creating and loading a website, so it&#39;s very experimental.  The font size is smaller than I want it in some places... lots and lots more to learn.  I wanted to do something related to Saitou, so I chose to collect images.  I owe many thanks to Tiffany and Kevin for helping me today... especially Tiffany for giving me that little extra push over the side to do it.  Comments and complaints welcome.<br/>

phil (who&#39;s about decided RK Saitou deserves a site all his very own... ever try to pick &quot;just a few&quot; from among hundreds?  I should make it a revolving gallery...)<br/>
