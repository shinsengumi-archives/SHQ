<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-335793222">Thank you Barb(^_^)<br/>
I wrote the story because I always wondered how children "think".  <br/>
From interacting with my niece it is clear that children at that age <br/>
are very intelligent and have outstanding memories even when they are <br/>
only 2 years old....when they turn 4 they generally become *evil*.<br/>
<br/>
[correction to the story] I was writing it on the bus and must've <br/>
scribbled Feb 1 instead of Feb 9...Fujita Minoru was actually born <br/>
Feb 9 (oops, sorry)<br/>

2nd entry has been submitted for the Fanart Contest<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumimb.com">http://www.shinsengumimb.com</a> look under "fanart"<br/>
<br/>
from all the Instant Messages and emails I've been receiving I think <br/>
we will have considerably MORE submissions than the uniform contest <br/>
(which means that Moeyoken is actually a GOOD commercial idea)...the <br/>
prize, the Shinsengumi tenugui has arrived today and it is AWESOME!!!!<br/>
<br/>
If I DO get MANY submissions I may add minor prizes (so don't worry).<br/>

<br/>
just another thought<br/>
the other reason why I wrote this story is difference of 1 month <br/>
between the birth of MInoru, the grandson, and the death of Motoko <br/>
the granddaughter...so the household was pretty stressed out<br/>
<br/>
*I clearly read on a board that Tsutomu continued to live in Bunkyo <br/>
in close proximity to his parents once he married Midori...he moves <br/>
away a couple of decades down the line probably after Tokio died<br/>
I can't imagine him leaving his mother alone for the 5 years after <br/>
F.G. died<br/>
<br/>
*after Midori graduated from Tokio's school she was a teacher...some <br/>
translations say science teacher, but again it is nifty, so it would <br/>
make sense if she found employment at the school or nearby <br/>
institution <br/>
<br/>
I did keep double checking on the Japanese sites Motoko was born Sept <br/>
28 and Fujita Goro died on Sept 28  it is a coincidence of numbers<br/>
**there are very old Chinese beliefs regarding death/birthday <br/>
date "clashes"...this may be related to why once a person dies their <br/>
deathday and not birthday is celebrated...nonetheless they are linked<br/>
<br/>
although I don't check my horoscope everyday I think it is great fun <br/>
to compare horoscopes between characters and form their personalities<br/>
Motoko, year of the rooster (2005=year of the rooster) and Fujita <br/>
Goro, year of the Dragon combination is interesting.  Roosters are <br/>
more outgoing and would be more attracted to quiet and reserved <br/>
Dragons.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526531731">I always spot typos AFTER I upload stuff.<br/>
Regarding Itou's jacket...I meant to simply say "black silk" I typed<br/>
"black crepe" or something<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the fic after reading that Tommy had at one point took the<br/>
hand of a young lady, drew her close and kissed her (^_^)...Tommy was<br/>
17-18 he sure was BOLD...so the fic does not have that historical<br/>
episode...but I think Hijikata would've done the same thing too (^_^)</div>

<h3>New Fic: The Manju</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-363651658">New fic. Randomness. Hope you all enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
--M.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
M�s guide to the Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
(Author�s note: Written on a stomach full of Chinese Food, altogether too <br/>
much caffeine, and horrible pre-going to Japan jitters)<br/>
<br/>
(Author's 2nd note: Inspired by Waiting for Godot, appropriately read at 2 <br/>
AM)<br/>
<br/>
(Star Wars Opening Theme (as played by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra) plays as <br/>
a palanquin passes through a snowy street)<br/>
<br/>
M: 1860. Yes, just another date in history. Today is the day that tairo Ii <br/>
Naosuke heads to Edo Castle for another rousing session of rooting out the <br/>
extremists infecting our government today. In just a few minutes� time�<br/>
<br/>
(shrouded figures run past)<br/>
<br/>
Shrouded figures: SONNO JOI!!<br/>
<br/>
M: Right! (pulls down backdrop to reveal a chalkboard). Some would say that <br/>
this has nothing to do with the Shinsengumi. Or does it? Do manju�those oh <br/>
so delectable pounded rice cakes�have anything to do with it? Or how big one <br/>
can open their mouth?<br/>
<br/>
(thinks)<br/>
<br/>
M: MITOCHONDRIA!!<br/>
<br/>
(enter Sec)<br/>
<br/>
Sec: M, where�s that timeline?<br/>
<br/>
M: Working on it!! (Hides compromising photos of Aizu Women�s Brigade)<br/>
<br/>
Sec: �The Effect of Hotter-than-Wasabi Bikini-clad Naginata Masters on <br/>
Japan�s Bakumatsu Period.� HAHAHAHAAAA�.some research, eh?<br/>
<br/>
M: Not much better than your �Fundoshi: A History��<br/>
<br/>
Sec: Oww�.well met�<br/>
<br/>
M: But we�re here to explain the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
Sec: And what manju has to do with all of it.<br/>
<br/>
M: But manju does have to do with it! And big mouths, too!<br/>
<br/>
Sec: Nowadays even die-cast cars have to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
M: But I�ll �newly select� Teruhime any day�*sparkle sparkle*<br/>
<br/>
Sec: (pulls out paper fan and whacks M) The Shinsengumi!!<br/>
<br/>
M: RIGHT! The Shinsengumi!<br/>
<br/>
Sec: But the manju!<br/>
<br/>
M: What about the manju?<br/>
<br/>
Sec: That�s your line!<br/>
<br/>
M: My line?<br/>
<br/>
(enter Barb)<br/>
<br/>
Barb: I just got some manju on Ebay!! Oh wait�it�s a manju-patterned haori.<br/>
<br/>
M: Not bad, not bad�<br/>
<br/>
Sec: But the fundoshiiiiii�.<br/>
<br/>
M: Can we get back to the topic at hand?<br/>
<br/>
Sec: Yeah, I feel like we�re waiting for Godot.<br/>
<br/>
M: No, we�re waiting for Kon-do.<br/>
<br/>
Barb: LOL<br/>
<br/>
M: (Writes �Shinsengumi to ha nani ka?� on the board) So, back to our topic. <br/>
What is the Shinsengumi?<br/>
<br/>
Sec: (looks up from Barb�s Satou Koichi fundoshi desktop) Huh? You say <br/>
something?<br/>
<br/>
M: But the manju!!<br/>
<br/>
Barb: Oh�hey, look at what I got today! (tosses M a big Tennen Rishin Ryu <br/>
bokken. M falls over)<br/>
<br/>
Sec: You okay?<br/>
<br/>
M: M�.manju�Ooh�I like it. Just the right weight for bashing in slow <br/>
computers.<br/>
<br/>
(Enter MissB)<br/>
<br/>
MissB: Why are you guys going on about the size of Kondou�s mouth and <br/>
th�oooooo fundoshi�..<br/>
<br/>
M: Manju, anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Sec: I don�t see any.<br/>
<br/>
(Manju rain down from the ceiling)<br/>
<br/>
Barb: Isn�t that supposed to be manna?<br/>
<br/>
MissB: But we�re in Japan, after all.<br/>
<br/>
(enter Phil in Sekihoutai uniform)<br/>
<br/>
Phil: (catches manju in midair) Ooh, manju.<br/>
<br/>
(M gets up) M: But the Shinsengumi!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else: KOICHI SATO!!! (all run offstage)<br/>
<br/>
M: &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;.<br/>
<br/>
(Fundoshi start flying wildly from offstage)<br/>
<br/>
M: And now for something completely different.<br/>
<br/>
OWARI!! (The end)</div>
