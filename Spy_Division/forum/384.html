<h3>Anniversary serving as a reminder -- SH Meets SH</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215185034">Today is the anniversary of the "Double Event" in the Jack the Ripper murder case, when two women, Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes, were murdered in short succession in the late night of September 29/early morning of September 30, 1888.  <br/>
 <br/>
A reminder to the writers among us (and maybe a heads-up to all the new members who have joined us & might be interested in joining in), the deadline for the "SH Meets SH" challenge is little more than a month away... on November 8.  Information on the challenge guidelines and notes about the Ripper case can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/files/Challenges%20and%20Contests/SH%20Meets%20SH/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/files/Challenges%20and%20Contests/SH%20Meets%20SH/</a> .  If you're needing information on Sherlock Holmes, a Google search will turn up lots of interesting and informative sites.<br/>
 <br/>
REMEMBER:  Do not post the story to the list or upload it into the Files.  Send *completed* stories to me, preferably as attachment(s).  On November 9, the anniversary of the last credited murder, I will upload the submissions in Archive of Stories (in Files) in a folder named "SH Meets SH".  This is not a contest... just a fun challenge.  Also, please provide the header information so people can be warned of things they may be sensitive to (I know that sounds kind of funny given the nature of the idea, but you have to know that anything *I* write will be SaitouxSano yaoi inspired, so... headers, please.)<br/>
 <br/>
The game is afoot... and almost finished.  Please don't make me the only one to have a story in the folder, okay?  :-D<br/>
