<h3>opinion of anime-fanfiction.net</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191653666">*SIGH* why oh why does the dreaded ff.net have to have the easiest <br/>
upload system to work with that actually works 99% of the time?<br/>
<br/>
I just tried uploading one of my DBZ fics to anime-fanfiction.net and it <br/>
came out with some html code stuff showing and the spacing was screwed <br/>
when I previewed it. I was going to see if it was screwy after being <br/>
officially added but there wasn't even a button to click to add it just <br/>
to "Preview"<br/>
<br/>
Shelgirl I noticed your name listed----how do you work this site?<br/>
<br/>
*considers that it is yet another plot by the minions of the evil Goldfish*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856119009">goodness.  I was like the first person to post there...  I think I had to copy and paste everything in and haven't put anything more up there because it woudl be a lot of work.<br/>
<br/>
But there should be a set of forums up there and the maintainer was very responsive... you could try poking around there and see waht works.</div>

I've been thinking of putting up a database driven website but my <br/>
PHP/SQL knowledge is poor so it might be a while before I can do <br/>
that. Hopefully by July... <br/>
<br/>
Oh well... I just don't like the new rules on fanfiction.net so I'm <br/>
putting this up.. *sighs*<br/>

I think filemaker pro can go online too..Please everyone keep updating<br/>

have no idea how long it takes for me to search the Title, then the<br/>
summary and then realize ff.net server is "busy"...the author alert<br/>
feature is great on ff.net but I need to find stories/authors to begin<br/>
with!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957366139">Hi there Tiffany... I'm not sure if you got my e-mail about this, <br/>
but in case not I was wondering if you and I were thinking of the <br/>
same thing? What kind of database driven website did you have in <br/>
mind and what kind of info do you want it to output? Just wondering, <br/>
since I'm still pretty open to ideas and would really like to start <br/>
an online server since I have this computer lying idly at home.<br/>

<h3>Tiffany Re: Grace: Database Driven site</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646108262">Grace, you know what...besides ezboard's technical difficulties for<br/>
shinsengumimb.com my yahoo domain account stopped forwarding email to<br/>
my account (sometimes there was a 48 hour delay!) so I had to switch<br/>
to the hotmail address so I may not have gotten your email at all.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think it would be cool if we could gather all Shinsengumi<br/>
fanfic writers on the SHQ site (like you build your site and just ask<br/>
Barbara to put a link on the site) or something...if you have the time<br/>
and stuff you can use the "Database" info...everything is on a<br/>
spreadsheet and you can import info easily onto a database you design.<br/>
 So hopefully if people read a fanfic on ff.net then just cut and<br/>
paste the info on the Database...it shouldn't be hard to track down<br/>
the writers and ask their permission to be included on a database<br/>
since most are here:)<br/>
<br/>
Some writers are sooooo shy...if I didn't do the writer alert thing on<br/>
ff.net I would miss most stories...then there are really young writers<br/>
who don't even know we exist.</div>

<h3>Fanfic  & Art on SHQ website</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348617436">Just to let everyone know, if you have a Shinsengumi related fic  that <br/>
you read and loved to death or wrote yourself and are  especially fond <br/>
of let me know or send it to me..<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows April-san would you remind her that she promised to get <br/>
me a copy of Team Spirits after she made some changes she was <br/>
considering? I LOVE that fic and I want to share it with the world!<br/>
<br/>
And hey it would be sooo cool if you visually artistic folk would care <br/>
to sketch something to illustrate any of the fics we already have up or <br/>
for ones that you care to submit or recommend.<br/>

<br/>
Are you going to make his eyes amber (just highlight a bit)...and moon<br/>
yellow?<br/>
<br/>
Your first draft had more details on the eyes...it's all about those eyes<br/>
