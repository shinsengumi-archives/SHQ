<h3>[Parody] Real Samurai of Genius</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770770166">It's one of these commercials:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHNt9rXSsTM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHNt9rXSsTM</a><br/>
which has a narrator and singer alternating--the singer's words are in<br/>
(parenthesis).<br/>

<br/>
Sake light presents: Real samurai of genius<br/>
<br/>
(real samurai of genius)<br/>
<br/>
Today we salute you Serizawa Kamo<br/>
<br/>
(Mr. I solve all my problems with violence)<br/>
<br/>
You invent new ways to use an iron fans and won't take any sh*t from<br/>
sumo wrestlers<br/>
<br/>
(He has anger management issues)<br/>
<br/>
Only a man named 'Wild Duck' like Serizawa would dare to go fishing in<br/>
a temple pond<br/>
<br/>
(those stupid koi deserve to die)<br/>
<br/>
Some may ask, is Serizawa-sensei a suitable leader for a group of<br/>
warriors?<br/>
<br/>
(everyone listens to a man who uses a cannon in the city)<br/>
<br/>
It takes episodes of insanity to do what you do Serizawa Kamo, but it<br/>
takes more guts to do it and think you'll get away with it.  So down a<br/>
bottle of sake, mighty chief of heavy artillery---this one's for you.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632706702">Wow... I feel like I haven't been here for so long... actually I haven't.  But after all the finals and hectic year, if feels good to read through all these 500+ messages I have and then find this lil gem.   I loves it!   I'm surprised no one else had said anything about it.   This really made my day.<br/>
