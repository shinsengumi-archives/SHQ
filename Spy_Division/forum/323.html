<h3>Site banners & linking</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242313266">It&#39;s beginning to feel like the good ol&#39; days of exchanging baseball cards or Olympic pins or any of the other things we humans exchange in friendship & promotion (wonder what I can trade for a Saitou book card...).  In the internet age, it&#39;s getting to be site banners.<br/>
 <br/>
Uploaded into the Photos Section of the list site (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq_spy_division)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shq_spy_division)</a> is a new album called &quot;Site Banners.&quot;  In it are the banners being used for the various information points of SHQ --- the main website, the messageboard, the database, and this list.  Also within it, there is an album called &quot;Member Sites.&quot;  I started the ball rolling by uploading the banners for my four (ALWAYS in progress) sites.  (Sagara Souzou makes it in because it&#39;s not just about him, but also the Sekihoutai... he may be becoming increasingly suspicious by the day to me, but we can&#39;t leave out the wiley coyote of the Shinsengumi wolves, Suzuki Mikisaburou.)  In the description of each banner is the URL for that site.<br/>
 <br/>
The idea is to give those of you out there the availability of linking to the SHQ sites and other members&#39; sites and use the banners on your own site.  The fact that the banners and URLs are *there* is permission for you to use them (and we strongly encourage it).  In the case of members&#39; sites, if a friend who isn&#39;t a member of SHQ wants to use it on their site, please have them contact the member for permission.<br/>
 <br/>
For those of you who already have sites or are currently building a site, consider uploading a banner for other members to use.  Just be sure to include the URL in the description so we know what to link it to. And remember, by making it available, you&#39;re giving permission to members to use it.<br/>
 <br/>
So, start loading those photo editor programs and start designing one (or two) for your site and let&#39;s spread the good word!<br/>
