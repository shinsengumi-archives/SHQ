<h3>LJ Community and Documents Uploaded</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194770441">The LJ community, SHQ Spy Office, is up and running.  The address is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office/">http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office/</a> .  You don't have to be <br/>
an LJ user or a member of the community to look at the site in <br/>
general... you just can't read any of the posts (except for my LJ-<br/>
user guinea pig, Masayoshi, who's already a member).  If you can, <br/>
please contact me ASAP.  And by posts I don't necessarily mean the <br/>
main entries.  If you see an entry, try getting to the good stuff <br/>
when you click on the link to get what hides behind the lj-cut.  If <br/>
you can read either of the stories that are posted there, let me know <br/>
ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
More details about what's going on, including guidelines and help, <br/>
are in the document I'll be uploading into List Business on the LJ <br/>
Community after I post this.  I'm sure a notification will be sent to <br/>
the list announcing it's been uploaded.  Please be sure to read this <br/>
document before you start sending stories up to the LJ.  Please??? :-)<br/>
<br/>
And, you'll get notification that the Main guidelines have been re-<br/>
uploaded.  In working with archiving, it became necessary to add a <br/>
line to the header to create key words that will search for stories.  <br/>
It's EXTREMELY limited, but better than nothing.  For now, we're <br/>
limited to 5 key words that use only 40 characters and I'm making <br/>
certain demands on them. I want a pen-name, the source material, and <br/>
the rating.  For the other two, I'd like to see either the <br/>
Shinsengumi as a whole or a specific member who's most prominent in <br/>
the story for one of the key words and lastly, an indication of genre <br/>
so people looking for action, romance, angst, yaoi, whatever, can <br/>
find things by that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Masayoshi for helping me and for sending me the makoto <br/>
flag.  I'm going to bed!  I hope...<br/>
