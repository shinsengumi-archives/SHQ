<div id="ygrps-yiv-914752581">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to find out what happened to Kondo&#39;s daughter & <br/>
Hijikata or Okita children if they had any.  I&#39;ve look online but can&#39;t <br/>
find anything.  Do you know?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240835680">Kondo&#39;s first adopted son, Shuuhei, died in the war, I think. His 2nd <br/>
adopted son-- his nephew by blood, Yuugoro-- married Kondou&#39;s &quot;real&quot; <br/>
daughter Tama. The current descendant of the Miyagawa/Kondo line is Miyagawa <br/>
Toyoji, descended from Kondo&#39;s brother Miyagawa Otogoro. Hijikata had no <br/>
children (they say, but it&#39;s not known for sure), but descendants of his <br/>
siblings survive. I believe the same goes for Okita.<br/>
