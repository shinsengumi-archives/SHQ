<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122269758">I wanted to follow up with the RKRC stuff<br/>
and 	<br/>
Murasaki Umeboshi&#39;s &quot;Bird in Hand&quot; was nominated for an award<br/>
but upon visiting the RKRC site it just says voting will start soon.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think Murasaki (from skimming her fanfic profile) read Wright&#39;s<br/>
article on Female Combatants in Japan...and the notion of foreigners<br/>
entering Aizu is very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Murasaki Umeboshi &quot;rape by foreigners&quot;<br/>

<br/>
what Prof. Wright had in her article is &quot;Aizu&#39;s inhabitants<br/>
deliberately chose death for themselves and their kin to prevent<br/>
capture by foreigners, that is primarily wetern Japan-derived army of<br/>
the new imperial government.&quot; (Wright 405)<br/>
<br/>
Wright footnoted &quot;domainal ethnicity&quot; this is connected with the true<br/>
state of matters that many domains were unique enough (culturally and<br/>
to some degree linguistically) and let&#39;s say if Aizu invaded<br/>
Satsuma---Satsuma would also consider Aizu to be foreigners as well.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I hope to have time to read this fic in the near future<br/>
but now I have many many things to do and I&#39;m not done with another<br/>
story I&#39;m reading.</div>
