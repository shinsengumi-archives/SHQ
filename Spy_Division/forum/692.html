 </span></blockquote>Ah, yes.  Souji's mysterious "I couldn't get to sleep.  There's <br/>
something that's been weighing on my mind."  And then a minute later <br/>
Toshi saying "He was with me in my room until late."  That was my <br/>
first thought too - what were they doing that was now weighing on <br/>
Souji's mind?...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fic.  It fills in that mysterious gap in a fun way!  I <br/>
especially liked the bit "unless the rest of the first unit was <br/>
waiting just down the hall."  I'm glad Toshi's thinking they would be <br/>
so loyal to their captain.<br/>
<br/>
And, a thanks to everyone who provided all the info and links during <br/>
the TB discussion.  I have a much better understanding now.</div>
