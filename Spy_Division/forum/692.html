<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309966154"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;What brought about this fic? Well... remember episode 16-17 <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;where ...the unforgettable Kichisaburou appeared in the Okita <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;impersonator arc? Yes, yes, that&#39;s it. I vividly remember Toshi <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;saying something to this effect: &quot;Souji? It can&#39;t be. He was in my <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;room until late last night.&quot; And then there were the naughty <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;thoughts: what were they doing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The fic is set in episode 17: just before the scene with Tetsu and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Souji enjoying the view of the night sky.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, yes.  Souji&#39;s mysterious &quot;I couldn&#39;t get to sleep.  There&#39;s <br/>
something that&#39;s been weighing on my mind.&quot;  And then a minute later <br/>
Toshi saying &quot;He was with me in my room until late.&quot;  That was my <br/>
first thought too - what were they doing that was now weighing on <br/>
Souji&#39;s mind?...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fic.  It fills in that mysterious gap in a fun way!  I <br/>
especially liked the bit &quot;unless the rest of the first unit was <br/>
waiting just down the hall.&quot;  I&#39;m glad Toshi&#39;s thinking they would be <br/>
so loyal to their captain.<br/>
<br/>
And, a thanks to everyone who provided all the info and links during <br/>
the TB discussion.  I have a much better understanding now.</div>
