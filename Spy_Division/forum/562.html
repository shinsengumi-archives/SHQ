Thread title " 1860 Tokugawa Ambassadors to the USA"<br/>
at http://www.shinsenbumimb.com" under the Shinsengumi History forum<br/>
<br/>
the trip is AMAZING...<br/>
Tommy was an adorable teenager...come on American women were chanting<br/>
Tommee Tommee to get his attention he was treated like a rock<br/>
star...he was so outgoing! and loved by all who met him<br/>
<br/>
this is fascinating history!!!<br/>
cultural interaction at its best ~ I loved the comments made by the<br/>
Japanese<br/>
<br/>
now the fictional possibilities<br/>
<br/>
what if in 1860...a group of wannabee samurai from Tama decide to <br/>
kidnap the official ambassadors and go in their place?<br/>
<br/>
roughly 77 Japanese were part of the envoy...perfect number for the <br/>
ENTIRE Shinsengumi...*mess*up*history and include Itou/Takeda and his<br/>
minions<br/>
<br/>
the group did ALOT of shopping rode a train, saw a firefighting<br/>
demonstration, went to formal dinners, stayed at the luxurious<br/>
Metropoliton Hotel, visited central parks....and shook hands with<br/>
countless Americans and really enjoyed ICE CREAM<br/>
<br/>
the success of the mission in terms of cultural exchange is not<br/>
debated..but their real mission was an attempt to revise the earlier<br/>
unfair treaties<br/>
<br/>
AMerican ladies were attracted to the young and lively "Tommy"...what<br/>
would happen if they saw HIJIKATA??????<br/>
<br/>
How would Itou take to western fashion, the formal dinners, ballroom<br/>
dancing?<br/>
<br/>
I imagine Kondou may want a tailor made suit + skull on the back<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't Nakajima Nobori love Central Park and flower vendors?<br/>
<br/>
Shimada Kai and ice cream...<br/>
<br/>
Saitou Hajime and spaghetti (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
the ambassadors saw military/navy demonstrations which Takeda may have<br/>
liked...</div>
