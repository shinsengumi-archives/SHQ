<h3>good, bad, indifferent?</h3>
by <i>chickhasstick</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-225769019">Since all us new folks seem to be in question asking mode I will <br/>
join in.  I happened to read the manga and see the anime episode <br/>
concerning the haiku at about the same time.  Hopefully, I will soon <br/>
be able to stop giggling madly whenever I see a french fry or a dill <br/>
pickle at the lunch table.  It is starting to make my co-workers a <br/>
little nervous.<br/>
  <br/>
     So, in saner moments, what I am wondering:  was his haiku really <br/>
all bad?<br/>
<br/>
      I remember studying the boys in baby blue in school, but there <br/>
was not mention of the haiku.  I have only seen the 1998 TV series and <br/>
it was only mentioned in passing there.  I think Kondo's comment was <br/>
something like "....well you are improving..."<br/>
<br/>
      I know very little about haiku, so any info. would be welcome.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449852745">Hijikata's haiku? They're actually pretty good. I don't have any on hand <br/>
now, but I remember being impressed when I read them awhile ago. Oh wait! <br/>
Come to think of it, the title for "Kaze Hikaru" comes from a Hijikata haiku <br/>
which I can't remember all of, but the part I remember is "Kaze <br/>
hikaru/makoto no hata ni/...." ("The wind shines/upon the flag of <br/>
makoto/...")<br/>
