<h3>Umm, I&#39;m new here ^^&#39;</h3>
by <i>iamgiffy2003</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-626460524">I'm new here and I'd really love to join you guys. Since I don't know much <br/>
about this place, I must say sorry if I did anything wrong. ^^ Let me <br/>
introduce myself first- - I'm  from Thailand, The name I use on the internet <br/>
is `Giffy'.  I'm a fan girl ( consequently yaoi fan by nature ). I have known <br/>
about shinsengumi (actually some characters like saitou and okita )  from <br/>
RK but truly fallen in love with them I've read PMK. The most beloved <br/>
character of mine is okita souji-sama. However, I do adore them all. ^__^ <br/>
I'm looking forward to watching the movie `Gohatto' too.<br/>
<br/>
I have questions to ask you. First, is it O.K. if I upload some files like screen <br/>
capture or doujinshi onto the group. Second, If I scan the doujinshi I <br/>
purchased without permission from their respectable doujinshika just to <br/>
share with you guys, will there be anyone who sue me? O_o  ( I have none of <br/>
PMK doujinshi yet, but I'm sure I will have some soon.)<br/>
<br/>
See you on SHQ message board ^o^</div>

I am Thai-American and I am fluent in the language.  I was born in L.A.<br/>
<br/>
As for doujinshi the moderators here will answer your questions---we do have <br/>
yaoi fans here.<br/>
<br/>
If you can give me the webaddresses of Thai online bookstores which sell <br/>
Shinsengumi manga I would really appreciate it.  I can translate from Thai <br/>
to English very well and I would love to share some scanlations to our <br/>
little group.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the later volumes of Kaze Hikaru, Burai, Peacemaker Kurogane.<br/>
I have access to a great scanner at school so if I get the manga it would be <br/>
pretty easy for me.<br/>
<br/>
Also I strongly believe that the novel Mibugishiden (which became the movie <br/>
When the Last Sword is Drawn) is in Thai because as you know there is a HUGE <br/>
market for martial arts novels in Thailand.  If you don't already know, <br/>
Mibugishiden is about...SAITOU HAJIME!  (^_^).  I'm not sure if Thailand has <br/>
purchased Mibugishiden yet for VCD distribution.<br/>

<h3>Welcome GIffy & policy on doujinshi/screencaps etc</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-995431531">Hello Giffy and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I'm filling in as "list mom"  and I've checked with the group's founder <br/>
affectionately known to us as Phil .  Archiving doujinshi poses a bit of <br/>
a problem in two ways--space limits in the photos/files section and also <br/>
since doujinshi is a form of fanfiction  the author's permission would <br/>
be needed.<br/>
<br/>
We can handle some screencaps in the "photos" section but again space is <br/>
a concern although if you have something that is very unique and not <br/>
readily available I'm sure we'd all love to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Prepare yourself if you watch Gohatto--everyone is an ancient old man or <br/>
pudgy and unattractive except for Kano, Okita and Tadanobu Asano** whose <br/>
character name I can never remember.<br/>
<br/>
**I'm sure Sec will correct me if I got his real name wrong too ^_^<br/>

I have it and I thought it was pretty good.  It is based on homosexual activity in the Shinsengumi but I don't think it is perverted at all.  The story line is really good but all of the mine characters like Kondo, Hijikata and others are really old which doesn't seem right seeing that they were in their early 30's at that time.  I would recommend it if you can take two men getting it on.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

it first..<br/>
 I bought it used but then I'll buy anything, even the Kunoichi Deadly <br/>
Mirage.( Hey, it wasn't all that bad despite what Sec thinks. After all <br/>
it featured a good looking Okita is nothing else)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nice to meet you,  Tiffany-san!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I do know one place that sells manga online in Thai but I don't <br/>
know where to find novels. The address is www.comtoon.com. Are you <br/>
staying in Thai now? I guess not because you want to buy them online <br/>
right? For Mibugishiden I'm sure the VCDs have already been distributed <br/>
here since I find the review of it. I will send you the review via e-mail. <br/>
Though I haven't watched such movie yet, I know that the story is <br/>
focused well on Saito-san and likely to end in tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
For the manga relating to Shinsengumi, I know the story `Sakamoto <br/>
ryoma' but it contains only few chapters about Shinsengumi. I still don't <br/>
find Kaze Hikaru. For Peace maker Kurogane here `Bonkoch Comics' has <br/>
released the third volume already. You can buy it from comtoon. Hope <br/>
this can help and sorry for the delay.  ^_^ <br/>
<br/>
Since I'm far less fluent in the language than you, it took me quite long <br/>
to finish this simple reply.  ^_^' Is my English O.K. or not?<br/>
