<h3>Umm, I&#39;m new here ^^&#39;</h3>
by <i>iamgiffy2003</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-626460524">I&#39;m new here and I&#39;d really love to join you guys. Since I don&#39;t know much <br/>
about this place, I must say sorry if I did anything wrong. ^^ Let me <br/>
introduce myself first- - I&#39;m  from Thailand, The name I use on the internet <br/>
is `Giffy&#39;.  I&#39;m a fan girl ( consequently yaoi fan by nature ). I have known <br/>
about shinsengumi (actually some characters like saitou and okita )  from <br/>
RK but truly fallen in love with them I&#39;ve read PMK. The most beloved <br/>
character of mine is okita souji-sama. However, I do adore them all. ^__^ <br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to watching the movie `Gohatto&#39; too.<br/>
<br/>
I have questions to ask you. First, is it O.K. if I upload some files like screen <br/>
capture or doujinshi onto the group. Second, If I scan the doujinshi I <br/>
purchased without permission from their respectable doujinshika just to <br/>
share with you guys, will there be anyone who sue me? O_o  ( I have none of <br/>
PMK doujinshi yet, but I&#39;m sure I will have some soon.)<br/>
<br/>
See you on SHQ message board ^o^</div>

I am Thai-American and I am fluent in the language.  I was born in L.A.<br/>
<br/>
As for doujinshi the moderators here will answer your questions---we do have <br/>
yaoi fans here.<br/>
<br/>
If you can give me the webaddresses of Thai online bookstores which sell <br/>
Shinsengumi manga I would really appreciate it.  I can translate from Thai <br/>
to English very well and I would love to share some scanlations to our <br/>
little group.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the later volumes of Kaze Hikaru, Burai, Peacemaker Kurogane.<br/>
I have access to a great scanner at school so if I get the manga it would be <br/>
pretty easy for me.<br/>
<br/>
Also I strongly believe that the novel Mibugishiden (which became the movie <br/>
When the Last Sword is Drawn) is in Thai because as you know there is a HUGE <br/>
market for martial arts novels in Thailand.  If you don&#39;t already know, <br/>
Mibugishiden is about...SAITOU HAJIME!  (^_^).  I&#39;m not sure if Thailand has <br/>
purchased Mibugishiden yet for VCD distribution.<br/>

<h3>Welcome GIffy & policy on doujinshi/screencaps etc</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-995431531">Hello Giffy and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m filling in as &quot;list mom&quot;  and I&#39;ve checked with the group&#39;s founder <br/>
affectionately known to us as Phil .  Archiving doujinshi poses a bit of <br/>
a problem in two ways--space limits in the photos/files section and also <br/>
since doujinshi is a form of fanfiction  the author&#39;s permission would <br/>
be needed.<br/>
<br/>
We can handle some screencaps in the &quot;photos&quot; section but again space is <br/>
a concern although if you have something that is very unique and not <br/>
readily available I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Prepare yourself if you watch Gohatto--everyone is an ancient old man or <br/>
pudgy and unattractive except for Kano, Okita and Tadanobu Asano** whose <br/>
character name I can never remember.<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;m sure Sec will correct me if I got his real name wrong too ^_^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136548965">Konnichiwa Yuki-san,<br/>
I have it and I thought it was pretty good.  It is based on homosexual activity in the Shinsengumi but I don&#39;t think it is perverted at all.  The story line is really good but all of the mine characters like Kondo, Hijikata and others are really old which doesn&#39;t seem right seeing that they were in their early 30&#39;s at that time.  I would recommend it if you can take two men getting it on.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

<br/>
Well, I do know one place that sells manga online in Thai but I don&#39;t <br/>
know where to find novels. The address is www.comtoon.com. Are you <br/>
staying in Thai now? I guess not because you want to buy them online <br/>
right? For Mibugishiden I&#39;m sure the VCDs have already been distributed <br/>
here since I find the review of it. I will send you the review via e-mail. <br/>
Though I haven&#39;t watched such movie yet, I know that the story is <br/>
focused well on Saito-san and likely to end in tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
For the manga relating to Shinsengumi, I know the story `Sakamoto <br/>
ryoma&#39; but it contains only few chapters about Shinsengumi. I still don&#39;t <br/>
find Kaze Hikaru. For Peace maker Kurogane here `Bonkoch Comics&#39; has <br/>
released the third volume already. You can buy it from comtoon. Hope <br/>
this can help and sorry for the delay.  ^_^ <br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m far less fluent in the language than you, it took me quite long <br/>
to finish this simple reply.  ^_^&#39; Is my English O.K. or not?<br/>
