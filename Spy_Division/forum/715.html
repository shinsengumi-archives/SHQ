<h3>Serizawa Kamo fanart rated: PG</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028995263">I think the most fascinating pair in NHK&#39;s SHINSENGUMI!<br/>
was by far Serizawa and Oume.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t it romantic when she asked where she would be buried?<br/>
The Wild Duck said &quot;join me in my grave&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That was sweet!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
But still I think they were very dynamic (sort of like Shishio and Yume).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312660909">I definitely agree. Theirs was a very unique relationship, not the <br/>
fluffy kind or the shy type. It was a nice breath of fresh air in my <br/>
opinion. It was funny how they understood each other and showed it <br/>
in not so -normal- ways. I mean who says she doesn&#39;t know what will <br/>
happen to her after she dies? And her knight in shining armor comes <br/>
along and says join me. LOL! While I re-watched that I got <br/>
goosebumps.<br/>
<br/>
Oh Sec... Saitou was there overhearing the conversation. I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if it&#39;s just me but... I have this nagging feeling that SK was <br/>
saying that not only for Oume but for Saitou to hear it (hopefully <br/>
to fulfil that wish)? Wasn&#39;t it at that point that SK already knew <br/>
he would be dying soon, which is why he was so open to Oume about <br/>
it? LOL! <br/>

things that happen in shows/manga/anime, etc., you should provide a <br/>
spoiler warning for those who haven&#39;t seen or read it yet.  I, for <br/>

Itou&#39;s arrival in Kyoto.  ^_^<br/>

when it gets to be this early in the morning, one should sleep so <br/>
she remembers things like these. ^__~<br/>
