<h3>Low on Cash?  But still want Shinsengumi STuff?</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-417005297">Have you found yourself surfing the web to <br/>
look at Shinsengumi "stuff" only to realize that<br/>
shipping from Japan is way to expensive---or the<br/>
selection on Ebay to limited for your<br/>
refined Shinsengumi fan tastes?<br/>
<br/>
well you can make your own!<br/>
<br/>
Behold...in only 5 minutes you can add that special <br/>
"Shinsengumi" touch to any household appliance!<br/>

<br/>
I thought of it because the new "look" for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a><br/>
is called "Kyoto Nightlife" and the idea of lanterns makes one think<br/>
of the Gion Festival at the old capital and ofcourse that summer<br/>
during which the Raid on Ikedaya took place</div>

of my car, and totally amazed a pizza  boy who was from Japan and a big <br/>
Shinsengumi fan!  XD<br/>

<h3>Shameless Plug: The Courtship of Lady Tokio</h3>
by <i>purplealienmio</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-96920407">I wonder how many people on this list actual read this<br/>
story but anyhow.... <br/>
<br/>
Chapter 27 is up. Finally. And it was a nightmare. I'm<br/>
expecting brutal criticism, more from the Shinsengumi<br/>
fans than the RK fans (who don't seem all that too<br/>
keen on the Shinsengumi history stuff) and especially<br/>
from Itou fans. <br/>
<br/>
I apologize in advance for any mangling of characters<br/>
and defamation. I have been fortunate that nobody has<br/>
ever seen fit to flame me, but in a masochistic way,<br/>
I'm kinda curious as to what it would feel like, so<br/>
I'm inviting all comments, criticisms as well as<br/>
flames. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, <br/>
<br/>
Mio, who should probably crawl under a metaphorical<br/>
rock. <br/>

<h3>Kenshin vs the Shinsengumi as featured in The Economist</h3>
by <i>purplealienmio</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-506916855">Dear People who I hope will forgive me if this is<br/>
old-hat news, <br/>
<br/>
Having had a relatively work-free afternoon, I decided<br/>
to skim over the recent issues of The Economist. <br/>
<br/>
Imagine my surprise when I see this letter featured in<br/>
the latest issue (September 23rd to 29th), page 18: <br/>
<br/>
Sir - <br/>
We are Japanese comic fans who want you to kow that<br/>
you made a mistake and we are embarrassed for you<br/>
("Kick-ass maidents", September 2nd) The picture you<br/>
showed in your article is not of a woman but is our<br/>
favourite male ass-kicker, Kenshin Himura. We<br/>
understand how you got confused because he looks like<br/>
a girl, but he is a boy. Feel free to consult with us<br/>
on any Japanese-comic articles you do in the future. <br/>
<br/>
Darla, 14<br/>
Antonia, 12 <br/>
Kaitlyn, 12 <br/>
New York <br/>
<br/>
I go back to that issue (although I check the major<br/>
articles when the magazine comes out, I rarely get a<br/>
chance to go through it cover to cover), and for sure,<br/>
there it is on page 40, with the caption "Well, hello<br/>
boys!" And in the background are the Shinsengumi, of<br/>
which Saitou is recognizable. <br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh. Hello boys indeed! Though, and I may<br/>
be accused of condescension, I was just as surprised<br/>
that girls so young were actually reading The<br/>
Economist. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes and hope everyone is having a good day, <br/>
<br/>
Mio. <br/>
<br/>
