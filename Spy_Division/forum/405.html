<h3>Aizu Women&#39;s House Rules</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-212645351">We are familiar with Aizu-han's house code which was geared towards<br/>
men (see Teruko Craig's Remembering Aizu: The Testament of Shiba Goro<br/>
-page 4- ISBN 0824821300).<br/>
Now, from studying the Shinsengumi and many related topics we have<br/>
learned of many strong women of that time period (such as the women of<br/>
Aizu).    <br/>
Even in the world of fiction we have Megumi from Rurouni Kenshin is a<br/>
rare anime/manga character who is an older, attractive, intelligent<br/>
and independent woman.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of rules would a woman from Aizu, Tokio,  impose on her<br/>
household (especially on her husband should he step out of line).<br/>

Rules for the Women of Aizu <br/>
From a sacred scroll given to the women of the Takagi family now<br/>
presented to the future Fujita Midori.<br/>
(Revised by the matriarch of the Fujita family)<br/>
<br/>
1)  Should he come home late for dinner (even 1 minute late) you may<br/>
start shredding his fundoshi (1 for every 5 minutes he is late). If<br/>
you feel that the loss of his precious undergarments may result in an<br/>
irreversible mental break down,  soak his uniform with the latest<br/>
popular women's perfume.<br/>
2)  Should you ask a simple question and he DARES to reply by stating<br/>
"it is classified information" or otherwise ignores your respectful<br/>
requests replace the matcha powder in his green tea with a generous<br/>
amount of wasabi.  If he prefers coffee replace java with soy sauce.<br/>
3)  If your beloved decides to smoke indoors just because it is<br/>
raining or snowing outdoors, sew adorable bunny ears on his police hat.<br/>
4)  If he decides to bring home another mouth to feed without warning,<br/>
"accidently" leave his sword collection on the curb.<br/>
5) Should he turn down a nice safe desk job in the police force for<br/>
dangerous spy missions threaten him with the possibility of a nice<br/>
desk job in a school filled with shallow immature constantly<br/>
giggling/peppy girls.  If you even catch your usually loyal man making<br/>
a pass towards any one of students, mention to the principal that your<br/>
husband enjoys directing rickshaws in the rain, without an umbrella.<br/>
6) If he makes you iron out the teeth marks on his gloves tell him<br/>
that you would be more than happy to co-author the upcoming "tell all"<br/>
novel currently being serialized in a newspaper by one of his old pals.<br/>
7) If he forgets to promptly deposit his paycheck at the bank in your<br/>
account reveal your secret identity as the Hijikata Toshizo Fangirl's<br/>
Club president.</div>
