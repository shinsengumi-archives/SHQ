<div id="ygrps-yiv-89410466">there is a famous death peom that goes along the lines " to make <br/>
intresting an other wise boring world." <br/>
<br/>
Well it kind of goes that way. I was wondering if anyone knew how it <br/>
went. I'm pretty sure it's Takasugi Shinsaku's death poem</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040807733">Takasugi Shinsaku's death poem:<br/>
<br/>
(in Japanese) "Omnoshiroki/ koto mo naki /yo wo omoshiroku"<br/>
<br/>
(my rendition of it in English) "To make interesting an otherwise <br/>
uninteresting world..."<br/>
<br/>
Death poems are supposed to be waka/tanka length, but this one is only haiku <br/>
length, signifying, as Watsuki Nobuhiro said in his description of Takasugi, <br/>
"Like his life, the poem has a beginning but no real end."<br/>
