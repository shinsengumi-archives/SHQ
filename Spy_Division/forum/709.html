<h3>RL Fujita Goro as a &quot;daddy&quot;</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-221071432">Babies always came across to me as just living blobs.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if RK Fujita Goro can be a "daddy".  How would he deal with<br/>
an infant?<br/>
<br/>
This idea was based on a conversation I had with a SHQ member---and so<br/>
I realized that we lack tender father figures in pop culture.<br/>
<br/>
There is a story behind this scene:<br/>
<br/>
Tokio, a tired and bored woman....<br/>
<br/>
Tokio "Goro you will have to watch the boys while I bathe--I just<br/>
bought this wonderful sea salt and I need to relax"<br/>
<br/>
F.G. "Woman, child rearing is YOUR job not mine."<br/>
<br/>
Tokio "will you have me tie Tsutomu to a pole and hang baby TSuyoshi<br/>
from the ceiling as I sit in a hot bath?"<br/>
<br/>
F.G. ::sigh::<br/>
<br/>
Tokio dumps the boys on her husband...she returns to the bedroom and<br/>
just hears<br/>
<br/>
"ZZzzzzzzzz"<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122701744">Yup! Very nice fanwork indeed Sec. :) Now do it again! How about <br/>
Tsutomu and his daddy practicing Kendo? Or Fujita-san running around <br/>
waving the infamous stick? Hehehehe!<br/>
<br/>
And just like Phil, I too shall see Saitou's "roughness" on Kenshin <br/>
as a mask on his wants, an almost burning need to be with someone... <br/>
Of course, there's fluff for the gals (*cough* any gal) in my little <br/>
perfect AU world of wolfie-kun. <-- sap sap sap<br/>

In other fanart news, I'm working on probably the first Sendai-related <br/>
Boshin War fanart-- a drawing of Sendai senior councilor Tadaki Tosa, who, <br/>
as far as I can tell, gave Hijikata and the guys permission to board <br/>
Enomoto's ships at Sabusawa Island in Matsushima Bay (off the coast of <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-438754458">I'm not so sure about that. I guess I'm just speaking in RK Saitou's <br/>
case since during the height of RK Fandom, everyone thought it was <br/>
so cool that he was a married and a dad. This can be seen via the <br/>
sites that stress this point eventhough RK itself never showed his <br/>
personal life or family life. I myself, touted that when I fangirl <br/>
over the guy even if I'm more of an alt pair fan than anything else. <br/>
<br/>
Although we can take Kondou's role in anime... He's quite the nice <br/>
old man in PMK. I don't recall if they even mentioned he was a dad <br/>
and was married (probably not). But in that case it this statement <br/>
might apply, it certainly applies to the doujinshi anthologies <br/>
involving him that I've come across... But not in NHK. Certainly I <br/>
love his portrayal there especially with his family life. <br/>
<br/>
So I think it's a case by case basis. Just IMHO tho.<br/>
