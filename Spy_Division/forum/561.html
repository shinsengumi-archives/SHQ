<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584449182">All right you writers and rp-ers I've badgered a good many of you to <br/>
take those writing talents into original fiction and here's the prefect <br/>
starting point to get published and earn some actual $$<br/>
<br/>
Journal of American Martial Arts is a quarterly magazine covering "all <br/>
historical and cultural aspects" of Asian martial arts. They want <br/>
fiction (1,000 to 10,000 words) presenting a "mature, well-rounded view" <br/>
and dealing with adventure, historical, humorous and slice-of-life topics.<br/>

Erie PA 16502<br/>
<br/>
They pay $50 to $500 on publication for first time and reprint rights.<br/>
<br/>
Special aside to our intrepid Sec---You can probably propose an article <br/>
or series  of articles on the "career track changes" of the former <br/>
Edo-era samurai what with all the cool Meiji info you've been digging up.<br/>
