<h3>If there...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-137845219">If there was a Shinsengumi movie in America, which movie company <br/>
should make it?  I'd suggest the guys who did the Last Samurai.  <br/>
Wasn't it Warner Bros.?<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to send this Shinsengumi movie suggestion to any of the <br/>
companies by email or something...<br/>
<br/>
Well, there's probably other studios, too.  Maybe the guys who <br/>
handled Lord of the Rings?  Anyone who's good at HISTORICAL research <br/>
should do it... although it might be kind of complicated to... <br/>
because most of the actors, it would just make more sense if they <br/>
were Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug* Just wanna see what anyone else thought.  Maybe I'm <br/>
daydreaming all over again.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640908317">I like your idea!!! Will be really great!!! The japanese culture is so amazing....everybody (from around the world!!) should know about Shinsengumiï¿½s history!! All this "japanese wave" is so exciting.....The Last Samurai is just the begining of a new "japanese era" in Hollywood!....<br/>

<h3>Re: If there...</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030963758">I advocate a movie on the women of Aizu and ofcourse a definite <br/>
Shinsengumi tie in...Often we see "strong" women in Hollywood but <br/>
they are usually eye candy for men....what we do know from history <br/>
is that women like Nakano Takeko was a serious martial artist, <br/>
literate and indeed beautiful...so LAST SAMURAI missed its golden <br/>
opportunity to portray Satsuma samurai women (who are shown in many <br/>
paintings)...now in Last Samurai disc 2 Tom Cruise claimed to have <br/>
done som reading...if so how did they miss Satsuma's samurai women?</div>
