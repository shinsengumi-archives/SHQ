<h3>Saitou Hajime Fanart</h3>
by <i>genkigeeks</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792501463">My latest drawing, a tribute to Saito Hajime. This digital painting<br/>
was based on a black-and-white manga-style drawing of Saito at the<br/>
back of a doujinshi called Spark! (sadly, I don't know who the artist<br/>
was). Even though it was simply a stark monochrome image, I was<br/>
captivated. I just had to paint my own version of it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The next drawing I'm working on is of Saitou in his Shinsengumi<br/>
uniform (as he's seen in Rurouni Kenshin). I'm also thinking of making<br/>
Souji Okita (Peacemaker Kurogane) art. ^_^<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time! I hope you enjoy my work!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121499404">Wow ~ this is really good. I am a huge fan of Sait√¥ Hajime. The <br/>
coloring and details of the picture are phenomenal. You are very <br/>
good at digital painting. <br/>
<br/>
He looks so lost in thought.  He has a very far-away and reflective <br/>
pose to him.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing and I look forward to your next picture.<br/>
<br/>
Pugsley!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682631045">Just a note to say, I squealed like only obsessive<br/>
geeks can over their objects of obsession! It's<br/>
gorgeous! I love the atmosphere it conveys and the<br/>
expression on his face. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, <br/>
<br/>
Mio. (who's wondering who'll take fanart requests.) <br/>
(To any of those who are interested, the next chapter<br/>
of The Courtship of Lady Tokio is almost done, but due<br/>
to a family emergency, I'm back in Japan for a week.<br/>
Is anyone interested?) <br/>
