<h3>HELP!</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-240092977">Are there any HTML savvy folk out there? Apparently some how, some way I <br/>
have offended the Great Cyber Gods of the Universe and they're playing <br/>
fast and loose with the SHQ website as it relates to Internet Explorer.<br/>
<br/>
I used the same web page program to do the SHQ site as I used on my <br/>
author web site and that works fine with both Netscape and IE but the <br/>
SHQ site is getting totally screwed especially the fiction main menu <br/>
and  subdivisions--they will not work anymore with IE and I swear I <br/>
didn't do anything to the files.<br/>
<br/>
If you are someone or know someone who might be able to give me a much <br/>
needed clue or 12 on fixing this problem please contact me offlist<br/>
