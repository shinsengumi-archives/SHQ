<h3>Gallery Online....</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776961284"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shinsengumihq.com/CMS/index.php?%28Makoto%29:Gallery">http://shinsengumihq.com/CMS/index.php?%28Makoto%29:Gallery</a><br/>
<br/>
I wanted a really awesome gallery (but likely our server won't be <br/>
happy with another format for just images) but this was the fastest <br/>
solution...simply create thumbnails and resize images.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to send us anything *original* or fanart related <br/>
(manga, comic strip, parodies, sculptures, digital art)...anything as <br/>
long as it's not "adult" related (e.g. art which shows blatant <br/>
sexuality)...(we are not averse to yaoi/yuri however this gallery is <br/>
for public viewing and we have to be sure we aren't exposing kids to <br/>
mature material).<br/>
<br/>
Artists who have their own dev-art gallery can also drop us a line <br/>
and we'll link to your image on dev-art so people can leave you <br/>
messages and you get more traffic.  I did this for S-girl's <br/>
Shinsengumi art (if you visit her gallery you will find more Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin fanart too <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://s-girl.deviantart.com/)">http://s-girl.deviantart.com/)</a><br/>
<br/>
I know that in the 2nd paragraph I said that the SHQ gallery has to <br/>
be somewhat rated-G...but I'm actually tempted to start drawing more <br/>
adult stuff too which I'll post in the future (yuri/yaoi...and maybe <br/>
even straight stuff).<br/>
<br/>
I'm into shinsengumi x shinsengumi<br/>
Aizu Joshitai x Joshitai (women's samurai brigade)<br/>
<br/>
that sort of stuff (not -hentai- but pervy enough)... XD</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901811341">I think if you did have a separate gallery with a 'key' to enter, that<br/>
would solve the conflict between the rated-G images and the rated-R<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I THOUGHT I was going to have an RK Saitou for the gallery, but he is<br/>
looking more & more  like Elvis instead *frowns*.  I'm trying! :D<br/>
