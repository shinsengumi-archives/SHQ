<h3>Doujinshi Cover as Fanart</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-199445648">I was over at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hajimenokizu.com">http://www.hajimenokizu.com</a><br/>
.wait. you&#39;ve never BEEN TO HNK?  well go and check it out <br/>
The charm of doujinshi is the many renditions of your favorite<br/>
characters from all different &quot;universes&quot;<br/>
<br/>
so I was thinking...<br/>
what if fans made up their own doujinshi?---maybe not an ENTIRE<br/>
doujinshi but just the cover...<br/>
<br/>
THE FOURTH NAME<br/>
covers the bio of Saitou between the time he dropped the name<br/>
Yamaguchi Jiro to when he starts using Fujita Goro<br/>
the fourth name is ***Ichinohe Denpachi so the story is post Aizu<br/>
defeat to when he gets married and uses the name Fujita<br/>
<br/>
just to make this a doujinshi for women ofcourse there will be YASO<br/>
and Tokio....you know to make things &quot;interesting&quot; (look if Japanese<br/>
artists can pair up Saitou with Hiko then I can do anything)<br/>
<br/>
please use your imagination pretend it is all colorful and glossy and<br/>
real professional<br/>
I dislike facial hair on guys---but since this is Saitou as a prisoner<br/>
of war in perpetual kinshin---then he&#39;s got to have a beard <br/>
warning: Saitou is a &quot;pretty boy&quot; (^_^)<br/>

<br/>
note:  I was reading some posts in Japanese Aizu fandom and finally<br/>
someone came up with a wacky idea &quot;Takagi Goro/Morinusuke as Byakkotai<br/>
Ninja&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Takagi MOrinusuke was Tokio&#39;s younger brother (age 14/15 in 1868 so<br/>
technically he was a bit too young to be in the Byakkotai)<br/>
he was just a messenger and scout during the siege...but he -can- be a<br/>
ninja in camouflage---I drew him in the top box</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368597800">Great going Sec! Ooh Don&#39;t like facial hair? But eh he looks so <br/>
so Yummy!  Looks like a cross of Jo and the bangs is RK Saitou?<br/>
<br/>
Now How about this suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the cover actually- do a full blown doujinshi? It would <br/>
be so fun to see the three in there, perhaps not the so &quot;serious&quot; <br/>
story line but more gag like Hmmm Morinosuke throwing ninja stars <br/>
at Inoue-san to stay away from his sis while he&#39;s still having women <br/>
issues LOL! And what do we do about T-sensei? Hmmm maybe have him <br/>
have a secret crush on Yaso and he&#39;ll teach her about his ideas on <br/>
modernizing Japan&#39;s educational system Oh maybe not, Yaso might <br/>
ummm not react well to it. But it will keep her distracted enough <br/>
while the wolf gets distracted as well with Tokio *snicker*<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh it won&#39;t fit this VERY COOL COVER! Oh well serious drama then. <br/>
PUH-LEASE? ^__^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482633671">Well ok only JO looks good with some facial hair (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
The men (young and old) were all sent to Inawashiro temporarily.<br/>
Teens were then sent to Edo (Tokyo)<br/>
Adults like SAitou Hajime (Ichinohe Denpachi) were sent to many other<br/>
places including Tokyo but in the case of SAitou, Takada and then<br/>
finally Aomori (in the north).<br/>
Teens like the other characters I drew -stayed- in Edo/Tokyo and<br/>
attended school while living in prison camps there.<br/>
<br/>
From history, we know that *Joushitai member Yamamoto Yae remembered<br/>
Takagi Goro/ MOrinusuke (Tokio&#39;s brother)....so I see him having an<br/>
eternal crush on her.<br/>
<br/>
As for the others *Takamine Hideo, *Yamakawa Kenjiro and *Numazawa<br/>
Shichiro they are all TERUHIME&#39;s OTAKU.  Takagi Tokio was the<br/>
assistant to Aizu&#39;s princess Teru.<br/>
<br/>
[but] if these teenagers and Saitou [did] meet...it would be at<br/>
INawashiro......<br/>
<br/>
[Yamakawa Kenjiro] &quot;I&#39;m going to escape!&quot;<br/>
[Numazawa Shichiro] &quot;yeah I&#39;ll go with you---and we&#39;ll kill any guard<br/>
who tries to stop us!&quot;<br/>
[Takamine Hideo] &quot;this sounds like a really -bad- idea&quot;<br/>
[Takagi Goro/MOrinusuke] &quot;Shut up HIdeo----here guys let me draw a<br/>
map&quot; ::draws map in the dirt with a twig::<br/>
<br/>
*Saitou/Ichinohe Denpachi*  ::walks by::  &quot;NOne of you are<br/>
leaving---you&#39;ll just get your punk-@sses killed!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kenjiro/Shichiro/Hideo/Goro (*_*) &quot;Yessir&quot;  ::they all sulk::<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
**explanations**<br/>
<br/>
[footnote:  Sorry, sorry I mentioned alot of names not related to the<br/>
Shinsengumi---it is kizu&#39;s fault! ::LOL:: This is why I just mentioned<br/>
Takagi Goro/MOrinusuke (everyone knows TAKAGI Tokio from Kenshin).  <br/>
Every single one of those people are connected to the Fujita family<br/>
during the Meiji <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/AizuBeyond1868.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
not &quot;connected&quot; like meet once a year--but real close---in the case of<br/>
Numazawa Shichiro ---he ADOPTED Goro and Tokio&#39;s third son<br/>
<br/>
What is *Joushitai you ask?...<br/>

This artist generally focuses more on the Ishin, but the above link goes to a number of oekaki works on the Shinsengumi. If you are diligent in poking around...<br/>

You&#39;ll find some PMK renditions of Souji, Yamazaki and Sakamoto above<br/>

Very clean style. *envies*<br/>
