 </span></blockquote>Hello everybody, <br/>
<br/>
Please excuse me if I&#39;m imposing necessarily on your inbox <br/>
capacities, but having never belonged to a mailing group before, I&#39;m <br/>
not very sure about the etiquette. Also, please excuse me for not <br/>
having introduced myself earlier, but work has been very busy. <br/>
Tiffany aka secretarytocapt3 has been kind enough to invite me to <br/>
join, and frankly, I am amazed by this group, as well as the SHQ. I <br/>
do most of my research in Japanese, so I am sorry to say that I did <br/>
not know about this site until she directed me (my loss), so my <br/>
gratitude to Tiffany. <br/>
And to my embarrassment, she has already promoted my work for me, <br/>
and I didn&#39;t realise it until today. Oh dear. Well, she says that I <br/>
have some readers here, so hello to everyone, and also, why have you <br/>
not told me about this place before?! <br/>
So, as she already posted the link, I guess, some of you might know <br/>
a bit about me. But just to summarise what you&#39;ll find in the <br/>
Author&#39;s notes and such, I&#39;m Japanese, I am quite obsessed with <br/>
Saitou, I work for NHK in DC, and I just wanted to say thank you <br/>
very much for this wonderful place and letting me join. <br/>
I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll be a very active member as the drudgery of <br/>
work continues through the weekend for the media, but I really do <br/>
enjoy people enjoying the Shinsengumi, so I look forward to reading <br/>
all the messages. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to all for a lovely weekend, <br/>
<br/>
Mio (or misaki-toyodome)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625879346">Youkoso irasshaimashita! Glad to have you here. I&#39;m the one from this group <br/>
who found your story...and I was simply blown away by it. I&#39;m in college and <br/>
working on a Bakumatsu and Aizu-centered honors thesis, so I keep my eyes <br/>
out for things like this. Your work is truly spectacular.<br/>
