<div id="ygrps-yiv-935487487">I find that playing around on photoshop is way faster than drawing stuff<br/>
so I made pretend fantasy book covers.<br/>

FUJITA GORO THE MAN WITH FIVE NAMES<br/>

DAI-BOSATSU TOGE (sometimes spelled daibosatsu---on the copy I have by <br/>
C.S. Bavier it is spelled with the -dash-)<br/>

whoever wants this novel --just email me and I'll give you the links-- <br/>
this was at one point one of the longest novels in the WORLD and it <br/>
made the Shinsengumi notorious in the late Meiji Era (when atleast a <br/>
couple of the Shinsengumi were still very much alive).  But to <br/>
understand the novel you have to read the intro the author wrote---the <br/>
author was also a huge nerd (school teacher and also T.A.ed as well)  <br/>
the story was pedantic but also pure PULP FICTION WITH SWORDS...it is <br/>
still one of the best novels I've ever read--truly spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
both these covers are part of my novel (yes! it's almost done...just <br/>
polishing some scenes now--I'm so excited!  I know when the story is <br/>
good and done when I want to write parodies of it)...<br/>
<br/>
ONO SUZUE: A MAN OF TALENT* IN THE MEIJI ERA<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/OSBanner2.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/OSBanner2.jpg</a> [thank you Anne Cain <br/>
of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dragonsdisciple">http://www.dragonsdisciple</a> for providing the character sketch)<br/>
<br/>
It does feature Fujita Goro (fictionalized as Fujita Gorou)---his <br/>
private life is emphasized in chapter 4 although he enters the plot in <br/>
book one and appears in all 5 chapters.  Where there is Gorou, there is <br/>
Tokio...sigh...she practically dragged the laptop away from me.<br/>
<br/>
*the phrase Man of Talent (or men of talent) was a real phrase used in <br/>
books published during the Meiji Era to describe two "generations" of <br/>
men.  The older generation being the all stars of the IMperialist camp <br/>
(Inoue Kowashi/Kouashi, Ito Hirobumi, Okubo Toshimichi, Mori Arinori <br/>
interestingly those who were more "samurai" like Saigo Takamori or <br/>
Yamagata Aritomo was never described as such)--it was applied to men <br/>
who had toured the west and had a very strong literary side.  "Men of <br/>
Talent" was also applied to those who were just teenagers during the <br/>
Boshin War and later on studied abroad and returned to Japan to <br/>
modernize the country---it was a label used for atleast 2 Aizu samurai <br/>
associated the Fujita family.<br/>
<br/>
The phrase is so common that it stuck in my head and I wonder how it is <br/>
written in JAPANESE.<br/>
<br/>
In any case I was devastated when a coworker flipped through a print <br/>
out and said "oh this is like the Talented Mr. Ripley".  After I <br/>
scratched her eyes out (I hated that movie, it was good in the <br/>
beginning then got old) I realized that the title does sound too much <br/>
like that Matt Damon flick (thank Buddha Jude Law was in it).<br/>
<br/>
I would like to think my little story, which spans the Boshin War to <br/>
the the 1880s is going to be pretty different....yeah different.  <br/>
Horror + history of science + a dash of dirty Meiji Politics + yaoi and <br/>
straight sex = over 60,000 words although I am editing out and revising <br/>
now.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866497871">*gasp* You know I love the Ono and Fujita covers, but the one for DBT<br/>
is great! The colors (black and red) are so bold and just perfect.<br/>
