<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369753055">(Ah, yes, as for the calendar, I needed a break!  There was soo many <br/>
dates and it takes a while to convert to PDF files!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways...<br/>
<br/>
Please, PLEASE does anyone know the ISBN number for Shiba <br/>
Ryoutarou&#39;s &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot;? I&#39;ve been looking for &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; and such, <br/>
but all I come across is Kidou Shinsengumi Moeyo Ken, which barely <br/>
has to do with Shinsengumi except for the father-daughter <br/>
relationships -.-;;;<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate it so much!  Too bad SasugaBooks doesn&#39;t have it, I&#39;m <br/>
surprised, in a way, &#39;cause they&#39;ve got about a bajizillion <br/>
Shinsengumi books there.  (That&#39;s where I got Keppuroku from!...even <br/>
though I can barely read Keppuroku my kanji is so bad -.-;;;)<br/>

DVD...<br/>
<br/>
The book is divided into two volumes, with the<br/>
follwing ISBN:<br/>
<br/>
ISBN: 410115208X  (first volume)<br/>
ISBN: 4101152098  (last volume)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! ^^<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132392569">Yep, the book is what I was looking for.  Thank you so much!  I <br/>
should have a better time finding it.  As soon as my Japanese gets <br/>
better, I guess I can start translating it (as well as Keppuroku). <br/>
^^ I really appreciate it!  This was the last way I could think of <br/>
for finding it apart from actually searching for it in Japanese o.o</div>
