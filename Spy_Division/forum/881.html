<br/>
Catchy name, isn't it? Even the abbreviation is attractive, S.O.S.<br/>
<br/>
What does it mean?  It means just what it says.  If you're into yaoi, <br/>
yuri, or whatever gender samurai's get on one another for, S.O.S. <br/>
will definitely 'cover' your desires for good samurai love and <br/>
relationship stories.<br/>
<br/>
Right now the site is brand-new, however, you can get to the on-line <br/>
Gojou story that features pairs such as Saitou and Sano, Kenshin and <br/>
Aoshi, and others. Naughty little story if you like 'sizzling' <br/>
samurai romance. It is so naughty it is rated M17.  A little too hot <br/>
and hard for people younger than that. <br/>
<br/>
So please come and take a peek at how the site is looking.  Mind you, <br/>
all we have up is the home page, but you also can find information <br/>
links on the site as well.  Just thought I'd share this now in its <br/>
early stages, and if you have comments or suggestions, by all means, <br/>
share your samurai thoughts with us.<br/>
<br/>
Okay dokey?<br/>
