<h3>Writing</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007498619">First of all, I heartily apologize for not using quotes from previous <br/>
messages or addressing all the issues.  I have a brain chemistry <br/>
disorder called dysthymic disorder that occasionally reminds me it&#39;s <br/>
still there and causes something similar to a &quot;brain storm&quot; (uh, as <br/>
opposed to the productive &quot;brainstorming&quot;).  Storm clouds are <br/>
brewing... I&#39;m recognizing all the symptoms of an &quot;episode&quot; coming <br/>
on, so I&#39;m not thinking very straight and I may seem AWOL for a while <br/>
after this.  I&#39;ll be reading posts, just not participating (except if <br/>
something administrative should arise).  As I told Barb in a private <br/>
email, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how quickly I snap out of it since <br/>
I don&#39;t have nearly the number of stresses and things to worry about <br/>
that I&#39;ve had in the past.  Unfortunately meds don&#39;t prevent or cure <br/>
the episodes... it&#39;s always just a matter of riding out the storm.  <br/>
blah blah blah<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, Yahoo has straightened out my account... finally.<br/>
<br/>
Tiffany, I am the most undisciplined writer imaginable... or close to <br/>
it, anyway.  An idea strikes me --- a mood, a phrase, a picture, <br/>
sometimes an event in my life... anything can inspire the idea.  I <br/>
open up a new MSWord document and just start writing.  Sometimes the <br/>
story completely evolves on its own; other times I end up writing <br/>
bits and pieces as scenes or dialogue come, then either bridge them <br/>
or keep them around for use later in other stories.  The one thing I <br/>
never do is ignore the urge to write... even if I sit bolt upright at <br/>
2 a.m. with something that needs to get out.  It may or may not come <br/>
to a realized story, but so often those stray fragments have come <br/>
into play perfectly in other stories.  If I hadn&#39;t written them down, <br/>
they would&#39;ve been lost.<br/>
<br/>
About LJ --- you can still use it as a private journal.  You don&#39;t <br/>
have to make your entries public.  I&#39;ve started using mine to track <br/>
dates of things happening with this disorder.  No one else can read <br/>
them.  As I&#39;m online more than off, it&#39;s handy to have available.  <br/>
Easier than keeping a physical journal or carrying around a <br/>
laptop.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally a story has had to be mapped out to a certain degree.  <br/>
The unfinished &quot;Oujougiwa no Seizonsha&quot; relies on the timing of the <br/>
withdrawal symptoms of opium.  Where chapters begin and end are marks <br/>
of time when one set of symptoms end and another set begin.  (That is <br/>
remains unfinished has to do with the depressing nature of the story, <br/>
which I haven&#39;t been in a frame of mind to deal with.) &quot;Kitaku&quot; began <br/>
to go astray, but the idea was (and still is) to have two stories <br/>
running concurrently (present and past) that (hopefully) complement <br/>
and explain each other. What happens beyond those markers and/or <br/>
limitations is completely open to chance.  (BTW, I see structure as <br/>
limitation, which isn&#39;t a bad thing... I&#39;m simply more creative <br/>
without the structure.)<br/>
<br/>
Part of my problem with trying to structure or outline a story is <br/>
that I deal with two characters who don&#39;t behave.  RK Saitou & Sano <br/>
are friggin&#39; mind gamers --- they take my perfectly laid plans and <br/>
before I know it, I&#39;m so far away from my original intentions that <br/>
the story has gone in an unexpected direction.  Obviously, they don&#39;t <br/>
do that literally... it&#39;s still all in my head, but be forewarned <br/>
that characters can take on a voice of their own.  Only you & your <br/>
personal style can dictate how much freedom you give them to take a <br/>
story in any given direction.  I stopped trying to fight it because I <br/>
found myself blocking if I tried to force them into a container I <br/>
wanted them in.  Your subconscious is very powerful, unhindered as it <br/>
is by rules and structure.  Sometimes it pays to let it out for a <br/>
run... even if you rope them in later.<br/>
<br/>
Where do chapters end?  Like MissB (I think) said, they end when they <br/>
end.  More often than not I just have a sense that it wants to end at <br/>
a certain point.  The mood or the activity is complete or reached a <br/>
stage where it&#39;s time to take a breather, or it&#39;s the perfect place <br/>
for a cliffhanger.<br/>
<br/>
I also took the time before I ever started writing to learn something <br/>
about the background --- about Saitou, the Shinsengumi, the bakumatsu <br/>
and Restoration, etc.  I really couldn&#39;t write RK fanfic until I had <br/>
some basic foundation, which you already have.  I started watching RK <br/>
just over a year ago and didn&#39;t start writing (RK fanfic, that is)<br/>
until December.  Now, as I write and come upon something that I feel <br/>
I need to know more about, I stop and do some research.  (Or more <br/>
like, in my case, if the writing bug is biting hard, I just move <br/>
beyond that point and keep writing, altering as necessary once I do <br/>
get information I want.)  There&#39;s no way of knowing it all --- it&#39;s <br/>
like waiting to have a baby until you can afford it --- you&#39;ll never <br/>
get the story written or conceive the child!  ;-)  One thing I warn <br/>
you about though in writing about this time period (or any historical <br/>
setting) is the problem of new and changing information.  It will <br/>
drive you *crazy*!  Just when things are falling into place, <br/>
*someone* (like secretarytocapt3???) runs into new info that blows <br/>
everything out of the water.  Be flexible or be firm... there&#39;s no in <br/>
between.  Either be willing to rewrite or stick to a specific history <br/>
no matter what new info comes around.  Personally, I&#39;m beginning to <br/>
favor the latter with a disclaimer that new info is constantly being <br/>
discovered or that there are several versions of the history.<br/>
<br/>
Editing --- I majorly edit as I write, which is supposed to be the <br/>
wrong thing to do in creative writing, but I can&#39;t stop doing it.  <br/>
When a chapter is finished, I read it over immediately and do more <br/>
editing.  Then I take a little time away from it to clear my mind and <br/>
return to read it over again, making only minor grammar or spelling <br/>
corrections, maybe something more major that hits me over the head <br/>
right then and there.  Then I go back over it again, watching purely <br/>
for finer grammar points, like overused words, pronoun usage, etc.  <br/>
Some people read it aloud to check for flow and understanding, but as <br/>
I&#39;m someone who cannot bear to be read to, it&#39;s been pointless.  I&#39;m <br/>
also someone who needs to experience immediate accomplishment <br/>
(because of the focus & concentration problems I have with the <br/>
disorder), so once I&#39;m satisfied, out it goes into the ether.  If you <br/>
have someone who has the time and the skill to beta, go for it.  <br/>
Until a few weeks ago, although there have been plenty of people <br/>
willing to read over stuff & have given me encouragement, I&#39;ve never <br/>
really felt I had access to a beta-reader. Most people I know & trust <br/>
simply don&#39;t have the time. I now have someone who is starting to <br/>
work with me and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how much she can help <br/>
me improve.  Other than that, I&#39;ve relied on feedback from readers in <br/>
general (when I can get it).<br/>
<br/>
It all comes down to everyone has their way of doing things. <br/>
Hopefully with many of us giving you some insight into how we <br/>
approach it, you&#39;ll find things that work for you. My advice is to be <br/>
open to experimentation, to many false starts, to play and &quot;verbal <br/>
doodling.&quot;  Don&#39;t be shy about sharing with someone and be open to <br/>
what they&#39;re telling you, good and bad. If you&#39;re new to fiction <br/>
writing, give yourself some exercises in order to find your voice, <br/>
your style.  And start out with something short at first.  Don&#39;t <br/>
assign yourself to writing a novel straight out of the gate. :-) You <br/>
already have the research capabilities.  Time to find the verbal <br/>
artist!  :-D  Just be sure to have fun along the way.  May the muses <br/>
be kind to you!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342814929">PHIL LIVES!!! The evil babelfish didn&#39;t get her after all!!! I was worried!!!<br/>
<br/>
As to how I go about doing stories, I get a basic idea and then I brood on it <br/>
for a bit until I get a very general outline. I plot out the main points, but <br/>
I leave myself plenty of room to add new ideas or change things as different <br/>
(more like improved) ideas strike me. I&#39;ve recently began writing this outline <br/>
down so I can remember them, because I have too many stories going as it is. <br/>
Then I sit down with pen and paper and write out a rough draft of my chapter. <br/>
After I&#39;m satisfied that all the details for that part of the story have been <br/>
addressed, I sit down and type out a final version. But that&#39;s just a habit I <br/>
got into because of one teacher. It was something that worked for me, so I <br/>
stuck with it. <br/>
<br/>
And I completely agree with Phil about sticking to the history established in <br/>
the story, regardless of new info that might come along. Unless it can easily <br/>
be worked in, I just go ahead with the background I laid out. To Hazard a <br/>
Guest is a perfect example of this. When I first read that Saito &quot;assassinated&quot; <br/>
Itou, I couldn&#39;t find anything more on the subject, despite a very thorough <br/>
search. I assumed that he killed the man himself, so I began the fic with him <br/>
&quot;assassinating&quot; Itou. Well, now we know that he merely got the goods on the guy <br/>
and the rest of the Shinsengumi were involved. I can&#39;t go back and change the <br/>
whole story now, so I&#39;m just sticking it out. (BTW, Phil that was Barb that <br/>
said a chapter was over when it&#39;s over.) <br/>
<br/>
With me, it seems like the characters will take care of themselves if I just <br/>
let them. (Saito is a PITA who likes to do things his own way, even in MY <br/>
head.) If I&#39;m really unsure about their reactions to a situation, I&#39;ll have a chat <br/>
with Barb and get her opinion on the matter. Sometimes getting a new <br/>
perspective on your idea, etc. helps. The most important thing to me, however, is just <br/>
to do whatever feels right for the story. So if it really feels right for <br/>
Saito to cry, etc at a given point, regardless of whether others think I&#39;ve made <br/>
him OOC, I&#39;ll do it.  It generally works out though.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, everyone has to find their own way of doing things and there is no <br/>
such thing as right or wrong, as long as you can tell a story that people <br/>
enjoy. And if someone tries to give you a hard time for it and tell you that <br/>
you&#39;re doing it wrong, just tell them that you don&#39;t ask Picasso to paint like <br/>
Monet.  <br/>

<h3>Re: Writing</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783727783">I completely agree with you there...<br/>
<br/>
Sticking to what the history of the story is... I&#39;ve had that itch <br/>
when I first wrote Leaving Edo. In chapter 2 I found out about the <br/>
mystery woman and it was so hard to stop myself from twisting the <br/>
story to reflect this. I even thought of cancelling the whole thing <br/>
and writing something more historically accurate. Oh well that <br/>
didn&#39;t happen... Hijikata, Okita, Saitou and Midori has &quot;grown&quot; on <br/>
me now that I won&#39;t even consider such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you too about having OOCness. I do it A LOT. Sometimes <br/>
though I wonder when is the OOC too overboard? I rely on my readers <br/>
to let me know. I remember there was that girl reviewer in Watashi <br/>
no Itachi, she creamed me for doing that to Aoshi. I thought about <br/>
it and decided it wouldn&#39;t hurt the story to bring him closer to IC. <br/>
I was just going overboard with him... Now with Saitou-sama in <br/>
leaving Edo, I thought he&#39;s definitely OOC got to fix and <br/>
MissBehavin told me it&#39;s okay... See I love readers...<br/>
<br/>
MissBehavin - Ummm... I need another chapter on To Hazard a Guest... <br/>
