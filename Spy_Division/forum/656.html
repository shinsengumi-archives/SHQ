<h3>Oops!  One got stuck!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578425889">My apologies to haggert2002 for the long delay in getting their post <br/>
out.  The list is set to moderate first posts for new members in order <br/>
to keep unwanted spam off the list and out of people&#39;s inboxes. I <br/>
usually get a notification when there&#39;s a new message for moderation, <br/>
but this one slipped through somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to remind the author, however, to please provide a header <br/>
based on the template in our guidelines for submitting fiction to the <br/>
list (this can be found in the Files section of the group homesite <br/>
under &quot;List Business&quot; at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/files">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SHQ_Spy_Division/files</a> .)   This is to <br/>
protect both the author and the reader.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and again, sorry for the horrible delay!<br/>
