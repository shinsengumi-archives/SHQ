Those are supposed to be the female offspring of Kondo, OKita and <br/>
Hijikata....now the problem is what about the rest of the Shinsengumi?<br/>
HOw would their daughters look like?<br/>
<br/>
::secretarytocapt3 imagining:::<br/>
Shimada Kai's daughter = always wearing sweats, very athletic tall <br/>
and full bodied<br/>
<br/>
Itou's girl = evil manipulative sexy vixen who enjoys tormenting the <br/>
other Shinsengumi daughters<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura's daugher = annoying loud mouth gal who has a persecution <br/>
complex and cannot take orders.  Any well meaning criticism results <br/>
in extremely defensive behaviour.  Very rebellious girl who ends up <br/>
in kinshin all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Nakajima Nobori's daugher = very quiet, has pet plants and loves to <br/>
draw ofcourse.  If someone accidently kills any of her green <br/>
friends...she unleashes a temper you don't even want to imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Saitou's daughter....<br/>
<br/>
submit your designs for Moeyoken-ish characters!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Incidentally, I wanted to point out that the guy on the upper right is Ryunosuke Sakamoto, and the woman under the orange haired girl (the our left of Yuko Kondo who is the girl with pink hair) is supposedly Oryo - as in Ryoma's Oryo.   Toshi Hijikata is the girl in the dress on the bottom left, and Kaoru Okita the girl on the lower right.  <br/>
<br/>
(This is still... IMHO one of the weirdest anime out there. Steampunk Shinsengumi with steampowered cars?  argh.  The only interesting part of this show is the appearance of Soujiro Okita who bears an uncanny resemblance to the Okita from PMK.  <br/>
Goes off to gouge out eyes.)<br/>

Yeah I know it's a weird anime...I wish that game designers and anime <br/>
people would put a little more effort into their work even if the <br/>
show is geared for kids</div>
