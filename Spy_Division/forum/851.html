<h3>Is it possible to do fanart for a universe one created?</h3>

<br/>
Fujita Gorou (yes the name is spelled a bit wrong on purpose) as <br/>
depicted in my novel here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
yes he has a moustache in part of the story (cuz it takes place in <br/>
the 1880s)...also in the novel you see him later on in a different <br/>
way.  He also has some grey hair too. He is supposed to look rugged <br/>
and all that but I was in a hurry last night and did a quick sketch.  <br/>
His narrative is heightened in chapter 4.  Fujita&#39;s interest in this <br/>
case is also explained in chapter 4, he is not only fascinated with <br/>
the case just &quot;because&quot; it&#39;s a mystery, it deals with his early much <br/>
more impoverished days in Tokyo after immigrating back from the north.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to read my new super improved draft of Chapter 1<br/>
(really is the last draft, now with more m x m action and a new <br/>
scene) just let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still waiting for one more publisher to reject it and then I&#39;ll <br/>
put it on createspace for cheap or something.  The monies will be <br/>
used to pay for my internet bill and my domains XD<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s a decent story, except it really has no market at this time<br/>
<br/>
the advantage to self-publishing is that I truly want to KEEP THE <br/>
FOOTNOTES.  The footnotes are really general, there are even major <br/>
arcs in the narrative which are all 100% accurate and that stuff is <br/>
explained in the videos at the novel&#39;s webpage (yes the vids are me <br/>
going on and on about stuff---but it&#39;s the Meiji Era which is much <br/>
more fascinating than the sanitized version you get in your standard <br/>
book on the era).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-930330191">Love the picture.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a market out there somewhere for this and other things near<br/>
and dear to our twisted little hearts-- it&#39;s just a matter of finding it<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I do like the CreatSpace idea  though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496992631">Honestly? In my truthful opinion, this little drawing of Fujita-sama <br/>
is the BEST one I&#39;ve ever seen.  I&#39;m not kidding around here.  I&#39;m an <br/>
older person and I love the older version of Fujita-sama. I can <br/>
relate to the picture without feeling like I&#39;m some sort of pervert <br/>
looking at a young man with lust twinkling in my eyes *hee hee*.  You <br/>
did one heck of a job with this portrayal.<br/>
