<div id="ygrps-yiv-967506424">The story below has been updated with another page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/parody2/parody3.htm">http://1happyturtle.com/parody2/parody3.htm</a><br/>
[this second page contains a modified version of the TMPD's<br/>
mascot...so unless you know with 100% accuracy that the TMPD would<br/>
send over their most hottest officers to arrest me for messing with<br/>
their beloved mascot please don't pass on this story to the "public").<br/>
*and* someone asked me for an explanation for the Shinsengumi-Japan's<br/>
license plates so I did explain the abbreviations right beneath the<br/>
photo of the cars<br/>
