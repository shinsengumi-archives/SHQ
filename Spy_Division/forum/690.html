[ What brought about this fic? Well remember episode 16-17 where the unforgettable Kichisaburou appeared in the Okita Impersonator arc? Yes, yes, thats it. I vividly remember Toshi saying something to this effect: Souji? It cant be. He was in my room until late at night. And then there were the naughty thoughts: what were they doing? ]<br/>
<br/>
*snicker* You did the episode justice. Thank god for people like you.<br/>
