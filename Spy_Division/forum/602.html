<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712104537">Bakumatsu in general? I'd have to say Matsudaira Katamori-- and his <br/>
appearance in http://zikuubokujou.vivian.jp, the only art fansite to him I <br/>
know of.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Shinsengumi goes, I like "Soshite Haru no Tsuki"'s Kondou and <br/>
"Kaze Hikaru"'s Okita. Nagakura in "Rurouni Kenshin" (seen briefly, no <br/>
dialogue) looks cool, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*Nods head wildly* What Phil said yep! ^_^ RK Saitou is certainly at  in <br/>
the top tier of the favorite list and I'm sure he inspired all of us  in <br/>
some way or other and i know it's the reason I became so interested in <br/>
learning more about the real man and his cohorts.<br/>
<br/>
Itou/Tanihara...there are not enough words, but I know the phrase "Sonno <br/>
Joi" never sounded so good before he said it.<br/>
<br/>
I also like NHK Takeda and Okita.<br/>
<br/>
_Love_ PMK Yamanami and also like the NHK version<br/>
<br/>
PMK Yamazaki also the best the ones from NHK and Gohatto/Taboo are _just <br/>
Wrong_<br/>
<br/>
I think Jo Odagiri in NHK was an excellent Saitou and I like Koichi <br/>
Sato's  nasty tempered version in Mibu Gishi Den (which was close to the <br/>
RK version imho)<br/>
<br/>
Koichi scored the _absolute best_ Serizawa in NHK<br/>
<br/>
and #1 Okita has to be Mibu Gishi Den too and that Nagakura was very <br/>
cool but so under used :(.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632061167">In Japan, RK Saitou has actually been attributed to<br/>
the growing interest in Shinsengumi these last few<br/>
years, and I must say, I agree. <br/>
<br/>
And I don't think I could be anymore obvious in my<br/>
Saitou adoration, especially the RK version, but with<br/>
a very very soft spot for Odagiri Joe's character, as<br/>
well as the funny-faced persona from Kaze Hikaru. <br/>

smack of heresy in this forum, but he really is interesting and what <br/>
he accomplished was rather remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
In fiction....I have not seen all of the NHK version yet so these may <br/>
change.  Yamazaki and Hijikata in the TV Asahi are my favs.  Yamazaki <br/>
is just too cool, I love how he scoops up swords in the inn under the <br/>
pretense of moving them out of the way.  No way this guy would let<br/>
any kunoichi get the best of him!  As for Hijikata...also very cool.  <br/>
Always in control and usually calm, but every once in a while you get <br/>
to see why Okita called him the 'most hot blooded of all'.<br/>

I like Saitou (Jo Odagiri) too....so misterious.......cute!!!!!! <br/>
This is so curious �cause most of people didn�t choose Isami or Hijikata (they�re "obvious options").....<br/>
Anyway....it�s really hard to pick only 1 charac.....I love all of them!!! Isami (Shingo) Hijikata (Kouji), Okita (Tatsuya), Okou/Miyuki (Yuuka).......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037629391">I'll just say I love Harada the most as he seems , in a good number of incarnations, a pretty benevolent guy who was entirely himself the whole time.  <br/>
<br/>
But as the NHK drama is most fresh in my mind -- I rather like Kondou and Yamanami.  I was particularly floored by Yamanami's slyness at a critical juncture for the Roshigumi (*cough* Serizawa), but also the circumstances and decisions that led up to his willing seppuku in the NHK version.   <br/>
<br/>
As for Kondou, he changed substantially over the course of the 49 episodes and it was very clear he was the reason for so many people of various backgrounds and subtly different feelings and even subtly different ideologies to come together; and it's something I appreciate.   <br/>

Well I haven't watched NHK Shinsengumi but I really want to, though <br/>
in Turkey it's hard to find those.<br/>
<br/>
But from RK and PMK, my fav chars are...<br/>
<br/>
Okita Souji (Soushi, Soujirou..Hm). Because he is so cute, and his <br/>
story is so sad. Who would deserve a death at his 25? And all of his <br/>
actions, jokes, the optimistic life..And all..you know what I mean :)<br/>
<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu . Mostly because he is hot on PMK..lol..<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata Toshizou, his real romantic personality hidden in his demon <br/>
self. The poems? They are just my favourite..lol..<br/>
<br/>
And from what I have read about NHK, Okita-Hide was so cute..<br/>
<br/>
And..The comedy trio..My fav.<br/>
Shinpachi, Heisuke and Sano!<br/>
I found out most of the info about Shinpachi and Sano but can someone <br/>

Shinsengumi (the one where Saitou was the spy that brought the Itou group <br/>
down). That'd be...1866 or 67, I think. Can anyone confirm this?<br/>

Out of curiosity, do you (or anyone out of the "usual" group of posters) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250979928">yes indeed kochira koso. If I am not mistaken,saito killed them all. being, after all, the<br/>
shinsengumi spy that hijikata sama sent in to deal with them. I believe he lured them in by<br/>
pretending to be a lush and not adverse to stealing sake to the endearment of the group.<br/>
<br/>
But if you want to be all technical, in the beginning, it was the forced seppuku of the defected<br/>
vice chief sannan or  Yamanami Seisuke. after he attempted to leave the group, hijikata sent okita<br/>
sama to "be his second". The forced seppuku proablye came as no surprise to him in the<br/>
end.hijikata wrote the rules of the shinsengumi,but he hardly objected at the time., but  Toudou<br/>
Heisuke  i am sure, felt more betrayed.since he was one of the originals with okita, yamanami,<br/>
hijikata and koundo; before they were even  called the shinsengumi.<br/>
the other saw it as a power grab demonstrated by their lecherous deeds.<br/>
