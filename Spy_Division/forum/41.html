<h3>Unfinished stories in the archive</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-39729637">The unfinished tales I posted about yesterday are now available in <br/>
the Fiction folder under Files.  You&#39;ll notice that they are <br/>
individual folders rather than files.<br/>
<br/>
In discussing possibilites regarding the archive on the <br/>
shinsengumihq.com site, it may be that only finished stories will be <br/>
archived there.  Unfinished stories would remain available here for <br/>
reading (and hopefully encouraging authors to finish them... always a <br/>
treat to both author and reader!)  When you&#39;re posting a story in <br/>
progess, create a folder in the Fiction folder with an indication in <br/>
the descripton field that it&#39;s not finished (unfinished, incomplete, <br/>
work in progress, in progess... just something to let us know it&#39;s <br/>
not a completed story) and keep the chapters/parts within it.  It&#39;s <br/>
easier for readers to access and alerts website archive maintainers <br/>
that it&#39;s an unfinished story.  When the story *is* complete, you can <br/>
either upload it in one file (like I did with &quot;Fast Carriage&quot;) or go <br/>
in and edit the description of the folder to change it from <br/>
unfinished to (yeah!) FINISHED.<br/>
<br/>
I posted up what I had completed so far in one big file for each <br/>
story.  If I ever get to write again, you&#39;ll see individual chapters <br/>
go up for &quot;Yasou,&quot; since they&#39;ll be uploaded as I write.<br/>
<br/>
Please bear with me as I try to keep things easy to access <br/>
(especially as newcomers arrive) and easier for Barb and others to <br/>
transfer to the website archive.  I know it&#39;s a lot to take in all at <br/>
once, but once you start doing it, it&#39;s a snap.  I&#39;m putting my stuff <br/>
up not because I want to reap hordes of praise, but because I know I <br/>
have the author&#39;s permission (I hope), it&#39;s a learning exercise for <br/>
me, and it can provide examples of what can be done with our limited <br/>
resources here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159619995">I got sucked into reading over &quot;Oujougiwa no Seizonsha&quot; when I finished uploading it and wanted to see if things were still working right.  Decided I really missed working on that story, so I&#39;m going to try tonight.  Gotta keep Sano warm.  :-)  At least staying busy is keeping new story ideas from sprouting up.  That&#39;s a first.<br/>
 <br/>
Are we going to get new chapters of &quot;Jidai...&quot; tonight, Masayoshi, or do we have to wait?  <br/>
