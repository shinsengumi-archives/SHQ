Historical Fujita Tokio was a busy woman.  <br/>
Besides her own career she was also a promoter for Yasuda Bank. <br/>
This happens to be a page about the bank's branch in Aizu however we<br/>
do not know if Tokio was affiliated with particular branch (she was<br/>
likely associated with the Tokyo bank)<br/>
