<h3>Grandpa Nagakura is in the Simpsons!!!!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535962052">1) this wasn&#39;t my idea<br/>
2) this person has contributed to the fanart page on SHQ.com and I <br/>
know she is just playing around<br/>
3) the problem is she uses historical Nagakura&#39;s pic so I&#39;m not going <br/>
to post on SHQ.com I sort of don&#39;t want to offend Japanese fans or <br/>
others out there<br/>
4) it IS hilarious (but I have really bad taste when it comes to humor)<br/>
<br/>
check it out  (she didn&#39;t sign it)  X-D<br/>

I LAUGHED UNTIL I CRIED WHEN I SAW IT---I&#39;m a fan of the TV show<br/>
and lately I&#39;ve been scribbling various movie reviews &quot;Grandpa <br/>
Nagakura&quot; may want to give---I want to turn into a short vid but it is <br/>
such a tedious process<br/>
<br/>
