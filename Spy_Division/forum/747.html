<h3>Grandpa Nagakura is in the Simpsons!!!!</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535962052">1) this wasn't my idea<br/>
2) this person has contributed to the fanart page on SHQ.com and I <br/>
know she is just playing around<br/>
3) the problem is she uses historical Nagakura's pic so I'm not going <br/>
to post on SHQ.com I sort of don't want to offend Japanese fans or <br/>
others out there<br/>
4) it IS hilarious (but I have really bad taste when it comes to humor)<br/>
<br/>
check it out  (she didn't sign it)  X-D<br/>

I LAUGHED UNTIL I CRIED WHEN I SAW IT---I'm a fan of the TV show<br/>
and lately I've been scribbling various movie reviews "Grandpa <br/>
Nagakura" may want to give---I want to turn into a short vid but it is <br/>
such a tedious process<br/>
<br/>
ALOT of updates at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumi.com">http://www.shinsengumi.com</a> click on 2006<br/>

Hirotada's Tokugawa fascinating examination of the Shinsengumi's <br/>
friend has also been added to <br/>
