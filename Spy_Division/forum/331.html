<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016462608">The SHQ Spy Division group, my impression is, here we discuss fan <br/>
work (fic/art) right? Now I've been wondering where to post whether <br/>
here or the SHQ group about works that are non-fan... I'm just a <br/>
little confused so if someone can please help me out. Guess I just <br/>
want to stop thinking each time I post. Thanks.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471801027">:-D  Uh... it would fit both, but I think the reality may be that it's more appropriate to the main discussion list.  Opinions?  Do you guys want to hear about pro works on this list?  (I know most of us are on both lists, but not everyone is... )  Maybe it's enough to say in the link for the database that links to professional works of fiction and art are included on the database?<br/>
