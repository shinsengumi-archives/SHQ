<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990640077">The release of a new doujinshi has been announced on an RK yaoi <br/>

you're squeamish.  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77747860">Whoa! That looks like some "interesting" stuff.  I didn't check out the <br/>
link tot he publisher yet but I am safe in assuming this is an English <br/>
language thing?  <br/>
<br/>
Personally I'm quite intrigued by that cover art as it's sort of keeping <br/>
in line with my current fanfic on ff.net that takes a really different <br/>
look at the Saiitou/Sano thing.  I think I'd title the picture  "Tokio's <br/>
Revenge"<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536505019">Awesome. Thanks for sharing.<br/>
I love the SAISA pairing. ^-^<br/>
Oddly enough though, I never knew this site existed, despite of my fanatic <br/>
searching on the net. Hmm...But I'm super giddy you shared this link with <br/>
moi. Thankya!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887246411">Yup it's definitely in English. Actually I think they re-arranged <br/>
their site, which is really a disadvantage to us since now I don't <br/>
see the sample pages or the online doujinshi that they used to do.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... From what Spiritus_Saitou said it's now for June? Hmm... The <br/>
pushed it back? In the e-mail they sent me it was May. Well either <br/>
way if you want to see a couple of sample pages (non-explicit, <br/>
frankly a little bland - probably because they didn't know if I was <br/>
18+) e-mail me and I will forward their e-mail to me.<br/>
<br/>
I love doujinshi... I'm sure this is old news but for those who do <br/>
not know and is interested in Japanese doujinshi's go to <br/>
aestheticism.com, doujinshiplanet.com and dojindomei.com. They have <br/>
both yaoi and non-yaoi.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716149007">Hm, you know what I just realized? I've already read this doujinshi online. <br/>

It's got the same title, and the same plot as described in that other site. <br/>
Though I'm not entirely sure if it's the same thing since the cover arts are <br/>
different. Maybe it's a sequel, since I remember seeing the webmistress of <br/>
Bishounen Sanctuary talk about a sequel to Black Point.<br/>
