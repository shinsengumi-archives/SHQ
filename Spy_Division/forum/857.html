It was like dangling a baby seal in front of a great white shark.<br/>

Mrs. G is really really really hard to impress.<br/>

What is neato is that it is compared to the <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dragonsdisciple.com">http://www.dragonsdisciple.com</a> series which is generating alot of buzz <br/>
in the e-book biz.<br/>

on the entire novel)<br/>
<br/>
The entire novel (100K words) was truly written for the fan of the <br/>
Bakumatsu and Meiji Era and it was researched to give that authentic <br/>
touch.  Only book 1 is up for sale right now.   <br/>
<br/>
Books 2-5 will cost a mere $3.00 because Book 2 is a bit <br/>
more &quot;literary&quot; and has a taboo e-pubs will not touch but the rest will <br/>
fulfill your mxm, mxf and mxmxf needs and thrilling plot requirements.<br/>
(the last 4 books is being edited by me T_T)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll be surprised by what is completely -true- in this story.  In <br/>
other words I wrote it for everyone here <br/>

<br/>
There is -no- way to place this story anywhere in the e-pub world.<br/>
<br/>
I put alot of thought into the character of Fujita Goro (I spelled <br/>
GOrou in the story) and he is an interesting figure throughout the <br/>
novel and he&#39;ll surprise you.<br/>
<br/>
Where does your $1.25 go? The quarter is Lulu&#39;s fee.<br/>

<br/>
XD<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, some of the weird research I do is unfortunately not <br/>
free (T_T).  Like for example I had to send alot of material to Japan <br/>
this week and my communication may or may not answer some questions I <br/>
have.  Serious we all know stuff FROM Japan was pricey, but sending <br/>
material TO Japan is costly as well.  It was a frivolous cost but it <br/>
was a path I had to pursue (the usual shot in the dark) any researcher <br/>
would have to take.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in the future we can all team up and write the mega-awesome <br/>
Shinsengumi yaoi story and use it as a small fundraiser for SHQ? Like <br/>
edit it to DEATH, and sell it for a $1???</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274380249">The review sounded good to me, though I&#39;m terrible about giving or <br/>
reading reviews.  I know some authors thrive on the stuff, but I&#39;m <br/>
not an author, nor a writer, for that matter.  But I read your review <br/>
since it was on the thread and I just happen to love your rabbit <br/>
story.  In fact I bought it from lulu earlier this morning and look <br/>
forward to the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with the review... That story deserves to be picked <br/>
up by a publisher that can do it right by exposure!<br/>
