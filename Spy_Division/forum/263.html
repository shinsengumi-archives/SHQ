<div id="ygrps-yiv-571605017">Here's my answers, sorry I had to add a few to the original choices. <br/>
<br/>
Claudia<br/>
 who if she EVER gets over her writers block and actually POSTS to FFN would <br/>
have the pen name CEEGEE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) While writing you... ????   I have to add a D. answer, none of the above. <br/>
Call me old fashioned but I actually WRITE a fic out with pencil and spiral <br/>
note pad BEFORE I put it into my computer.<br/>
<br/>
2) After writing you... ???? Another D. answer here, once it's in my computer <br/>
I send it to my beta reader, I do the proofreading before I put it in my <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>
b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick! Finally an <br/>
answer I don't have to add to the quiz!!!!<br/>
<br/>
4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>
b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there's any basis <br/>
and then correct if need be...  Two listed answers in a row!! We're on a roll <br/>
here!<br/>
<br/>
5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>
c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this <br/>
great idea or if this writers block ever goes away. Unless it's a one shot, <br/>
I've had the worst case of writers block in history for over two years!!!<br/>
<br/>
6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>
you...<br/>
c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain! Blasted a fore mentioned writers block is <br/>
manifested in not getting enough of any ONE fic to actually write so much as <br/>
a chapter!<br/>
<br/>
7) You published something, you think it's decent... So you... D. Once I get <br/>
it back from my beta I post it to whichever group it's fandom would make it <br/>
appropriate for, I've YET to post anything to FFN. <br/>
