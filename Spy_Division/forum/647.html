<h3>Harada&#39;s Pudding (a product review)</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399474300">The following product review is rated G---unless ofcourse you have a<br/>
really sick mind<br/>
It isn't [really] a Shinsengumi foodstuff --- but pretty darn close (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
During the great Shinsengumi craze of 2003-2004 many restaurants<br/>
changed their menus to address the demand for Hijikata, Kondou and<br/>
Okita noodles, curry over rice, bento meals and even Nakajima Nobori<br/>
milkshakes.  Some companies even advertise their sake with cherub like<br/>
caricatures of our heroes!   Few fine eating establishments<br/>
acknowledged the captain of the 10th squad.<br/>
<br/>
Historical Harada very likely died right after the battle at Ueno Hill<br/>
in Edo혰but some say he fled to China where he may have emerged to<br/>
assist Japanese troops during the Sino-Japanese War or was it the<br/>
Russo-Japanese War?혰whatever혰because I now have a third theory to what<br/>
happened to our dear Harada.<br/>
<br/>
He opened a dairy farm.  <br/>
His descendants to this day make calcium and iron rich pudding.  Below<br/>
is a picture of an unopened container, and an image of Harada's<br/>
pudding carefully extracted and inverted on a tasteful little bowl.  I<br/>
understand that in our health conscious society it is necessary to<br/>
offer more nutritious alternatives---so included an apple and orange.<br/>

I came across Harada's pudding on my quest to stock up on shrimp<br/>
chips, which by the way taste great with tuna sandwiches.<br/>

<br/>
After purchasing Harada's pudding for a mere $1.99 I inspected the<br/>
professional packaging and was immediately disappointed by the lack of<br/>
a cute small eating implement which frequently accompanies many<br/>
Japanese snacks.  After removing the pudding I noticed the 6 petal<br/>
flower design.  I briefly contemplated what flowers are equipped with<br/>
six petals and abandoned those thoughts to consider the product name<br/>
itself "custard pudding".  Unfortunately it is not pudding---it is<br/>
FLAN custard.  How can we trust a company which tries to combine 2<br/>
kinds of food into one?  Although the package touts its rich calcium<br/>
and iron the nutrition facts lists 17% saturated fat and a shocking<br/>
15g of sugar.  The most scary ingredients are "locust bean gum" (which<br/>
appears TWICE)  and "sweetened egg yolk".  No wonder there is 15 g of<br/>
sugar in this snack혰they sweeten the ingredients even before they make<br/>
the product.  I was also warned that Harada's pudding was made in a<br/>
factory which uses soybeans.  <br/>
To this day I have never experienced cardiac arrest due to ingesting<br/>
soybeans so I disregarded the ominous warning and proceeded to enjoy<br/>
Harada's creamy snack which can be finished in about 3 spoonfuls.  The<br/>
texture of flan was perfect and I made sure to check for locust<br/>
abdomens or wings.  My initial grade for this product is a strong B<br/>
but I have to drop the grade to B- because after consuming all 3 cups<br/>
my tongue was coated with a greasy waxy substance which was removed<br/>
only after imbibing the contents of a 3 inch bottle of Shirakiku sweet<br/>
yogurt drink (made in Korea).<br/>
<br/>
The review above has been forwarded to Harada Dairies Corporation in<br/>
Niigata Japan along with a note requesting a clarification of the<br/>
mysterious LOCUST BEAN GUM ingredient.</div>
