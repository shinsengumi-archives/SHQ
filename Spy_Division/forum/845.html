<h3>Calling all Moviemakers</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924756000">Hello,<br/>
I think I need to devote 2-4 days of my time to just fixing some <br/>
things and the new SHQ will launch (a test site is currently being <br/>
hosted on a different server).  But I just need to set aside those <br/>
days either for the 4th of July or push it to next week because I <br/>
have to work and makeup hours due to the midweek holiday.  But in any <br/>
case the site will unfortunately look different from the artistic <br/>
design we have now...but it's the only and most fastest solution we <br/>
can think of.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted the new look to feature a nice film on the front page to <br/>
make the site look lively.  Rather than an animated music video like <br/>
the dozens of those already on youtube I was wondering if any fan <br/>
would like to make their own unique creation to submit.  The film <br/>
would link to the Makoto Film Dojo where we store alot of multimedia <br/>
material.<br/>
<br/>
An independent animated or live action film doesn't have to be 5-10 <br/>
minutes long---it can be as little as 1 minute long and need not have <br/>
an extensive epic story.  It can be an expression of a poem or <br/>
feeling.  You can take just a paragraph out of history and try to <br/>
visually capture it.<br/>
<br/>
Or illustrate your own fanfic or songfic and scan the panels and <br/>
create a film (this is like drawing your own 1-2 page manga and then <br/>
scanning it in pieces)<br/>
<br/>
if you are a photographer you can take pics of thematic centerpieces <br/>
and work them into drawings or combine with music<br/>
<br/>
in other words you don't need a budget or even a cast to create a <br/>
good film...just your imagination! (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
Many people are afraid they need a fancy camera, studio or high end <br/>
computers so I'd like to dispel that notion by listing some vids <br/>
below which use a variety of techniques to create original movies.<br/>
<br/>
[none of the vids have anything to do with Japan...but I am listing <br/>
them to demonstrate that low budget can still be artistically <br/>
effective---you will notice that some vids utilize minimal movement, <br/>
but their goal is to be original]<br/>

<br/>
Anyways this is almost the middle of summer already and anyone who <br/>
would like to put in some time for art may want to give this project <br/>
a try...what I can guarantee is that when it's on SHQ...someone or <br/>
rather alot of people will see it and it makes the work very <br/>
gratifying.  <br/>
<br/>
You can also upload the film to youtube and email us the link so we <br/>
can embed it on the site...or give us the original file to host as a <br/>
backup.</div>
