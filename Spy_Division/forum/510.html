<div id="ygrps-yiv-129842311">Update on my entry in the Moeyoken fanart contest:<br/>
<br/>
Name: Tokugawa Aoi (Yoshinobu&#39;s daughter)<br/>
Also known as: Aoi-hime<br/>
Age: 22<br/>
Weapons: Katana/wakizashi, tanto, naginata, Smith & Wesson revolver,<br/>
and kunai (the thin kind that looks like a nail).<br/>
Carries: Tanto in obi knot, (sometimes) revolver in her large sleeves,<br/>
and kunai in...secret places. ;)<br/>
Character: Aristocratic. Deliciously, seductively arrogant. Like the<br/>
one girl in high school who was so incredibly beautiful yet utterly<br/>
unapproachable. Occasionally has Matsudaira and Kondou&#39;s daughters<br/>
over for sleepovers or tea ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
Will post when the scanner at school is repaired.<br/>
