Chapter 1<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto<br/>
Heisei 16 (2004), July 6th<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Governments may come and go, but Kyoto is eternally `the Capital&#39;,&quot;<br/>
said Tokugawa Hirotada with a smile.<br/>
&quot;Heian-kyothe Peaceful Capital,&quot; added his wife, Yuki.<br/>
The two of them were new to Kyoto. Out of a passion for their samurai<br/>
ancestry, as well as a desire to live the history they&#39;d studied in<br/>
college, they had decided to establish themselves in Kyoto and pursue<br/>
a joint career in martial arts instruction and historical enacting.<br/>
Since the night was not too cold, they&#39;d decided to get into character<br/>
a bit--put on traditional garb and walk the streets of Mibu, one of<br/>
the historic districts, for awhile.<br/>
 &quot;Hiro-kun! Look! It&#39;s the Yagi estate!&quot;<br/>
Hiro glanced over in the direction that she was pointing. Sure enough,<br/>
there was the Yagi estate, which had acquired quite a reputation<br/>
during the bloody Bakumatsu period in the 1860s, when the<br/>
Shinsengumi-- one of the shogunate&#39;s official police units in<br/>
Kyoto--set up their headquarters there. Seeing the gate open, Hiro<br/>
raised an eyebrow in curiosity. &quot;Isn&#39;t this after their open hours?<br/>
Why is the gate open?&quot; Even though he wasn&#39;t sure, something at the<br/>
extremities of his sensory perception feltamiss. Then again, there<br/>
was always something weird going on in Kyoto-- some commemoration,<br/>
celebration, or event that not everyone would hear about. Being a fan<br/>
of the Shinsengumi, he couldn&#39;t resist the urge to find out what was<br/>
going on.<br/>
&quot;Want to check it out? At the very least we&#39;ll give the caretakers a<br/>
good shock,&quot; he said with a smile. Yuki nodded.<br/>
As they walked toward the gate of the Yagi mansion, the wind, which<br/>
had just been a gentle breeze only moments before, began to pick up.<br/>
Closer to the estate now, they could see what looked like a fire<br/>
burning in the inner courtyard. Hiro opened his mouth to say something<br/>
about the fire, when the wind&#39;s ferocity sharply increased, and the<br/>
world around seemed to darken.<br/>
Hiro didn&#39;t stop to think-- instincts honed during years of sword<br/>
training took over. Instinctively, he grabbed a hold of Yuki by the<br/>
shoulders and pulled her in quickly-- putting both arms around her and<br/>
holding her as close as he could.<br/>
&quot;Hiro? What&#39;s going on?&quot; she barely managed to shout over the wind.<br/>
&quot;Hold me.&quot;<br/>
&quot;What?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Just hold me!&quot;<br/>
The wind shifted. Instead of blowing straight, it started twisting in<br/>
on itself, pushing the helpless couple around this way and that. A<br/>
word flashed through Hiro&#39;s mind, a word he didn&#39;t really believe and<br/>
didn&#39;t really like, but that seemed to be the closest thing to this<br/>
wind: kamikaze. Divine Tempest. Unable to consciously stand up to the<br/>
wind anymore, he closed his eyes and focused his entire being on the<br/>
one dearest to him, drawing courage from the gentle strength of her<br/>
embrace and the close warmth of her body. He felt her give a gentle<br/>
squeeze, as if to say, I love you. Don&#39;t ever let go of me <br/>
The wind, more untamed now, began to whistle shrilly, like a flute in<br/>
a Noh drama. Unwittingly, Hiro opened his eyes and saw that he was no<br/>
longer on the ground, but being spun through the air, faster and<br/>
faster and faster. The Yagi mansion wasn&#39;t really below, though. But<br/>
what he heard next made him forget about any of that.<br/>
I, Tokugawa Hirotada, take you, Matsumae Yuki, to be my<br/>
The wedding. That was in June-- why could he hear his words from the<br/>
ceremony?<br/>
Senzowa daijidakedo, kami wo shinjiru! I honor my ancestors, but I<br/>
believe in God!<br/>
His own voice, while arguing his new Christian faith with his father.<br/>
I&#39;m Tokugawa Hirotada. Pleased to meet you, Yuki-dono.<br/>
The day he&#39;d met Yuki<br/>
Tokugawa Hirotada, I pass this sword on to you, in honor of your<br/>
coming of age.<br/>
His father again-- giving him one of the family swords, the one made<br/>
by Yasutsugu XI, in honor of his coming of age ceremony.<br/>
We must endure the unendurable, bear the unbearable, and suffer the<br/>
unsufferable<br/>
Hearing his own voice, perhaps. But now Emperor Hirohito&#39;s voice?<br/>
Hijikata! Go, now! Go to Shonai and get reinforcements!<br/>
Hijikata? Reinforcements from Shonai? That could only be the voice of<br/>
Matsudaira Katamorilast lord of the Aizu domain in the 1860s, and<br/>
sponsor of the Shinsengumi...<br/>
The Shinsengumi<br/>
Hiro opened his eyes, and found himself looking at the hilt of a<br/>
sword. Following the hilt downward, he saw a blue overcoat, withwhite<br/>
mountain-shaped triangles on the sleeves. Blue overcoat, white<br/>
mountain-shaped triangles on the sleeves. The uniform of the<br/>
Shinsengumi? Butwhat would another historical enactor be doing out<br/>
thisearly? With his senses slowly returning to him, he found that it<br/>
was light again, probably around dawn. Butwhere was he? And<br/>
&quot;Oi! Masuda-kun! Look what we&#39;ve got here!&quot;<br/>
The man who was looking over Hiro got up.<br/>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br/>
Two more men in Shinsengumi uniform held a very tired and<br/>
battered-looking Yuki up by her arms.<br/>
&quot;Ah, so the flowers are blooming early this year? Don&#39;t worry, fellas,<br/>
we can enjoy their fragrance just as well.&quot; He rubbed his palms<br/>
together nefariously. &quot;We can each have a turn&quot;<br/>
The first of Yuki&#39;s screams suddenly snapped Hiro&#39;s senses back into<br/>
full focus. Rolling himself up to his knees, he saw the three men, all<br/>
in Shinsengumi uniform, trying to rip her kimono off. Hiro&#39;s right<br/>
hand automatically went to his left hip, but then he remembered that<br/>
he was obviously not armed. But he had no choicehe rose to his feet.<br/>
Quietly, he closed the distance between himself and Masudafinally<br/>
coming right behind him, he wrapped an arm around the man&#39;s neck and<br/>
jerked it sharply to the right. With his free hand, he grabbed the<br/>
hilt of Masuda&#39;s sword and yanked it out of the sheath. Masuda fell<br/>
with a yelp, startling his accomplices.<br/>
&quot;M-Masuda-kun?!&quot;<br/>
Hiro stood over Masuda&#39;s corpse. Now armed and ready to fight, he<br/>
raised the sword into a high guard stance.<br/>
&quot;W-Who the heck are you?!&quot; they choked out in fear and alarm.<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re about to die, so knowing my name is useless to you.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Bah! Just a wastrel ronin! Let&#39;s get `im!&quot; The men threw Yuki down to<br/>
the ground. Drawing their swords they lunged at Hiro, hoping to<br/>
overtake him by speed. He sideswept one man, yanked him downward with<br/>
his free hand, and kicked him toward the other one. The two of them<br/>
instantly went down with a thud, their swords clattering to the ground<br/>
loudly.<br/>
&quot;Get up!&quot; Hiro snarled, kicking them mercilessly. &quot;Get up!&quot;<br/>
One of them managed to grab his own sword, and tried to get up. He<br/>
turned his gaze upward just in time to see Hiro&#39;s sword descend in a<br/>
shimmering arcspattering the other man with his blood. The other<br/>
threw himself at Hiro&#39;s feet, whimpering pitifully. &quot;Please! Please!<br/>
Don&#39;t kill me! I didn&#39; mean no harm! We was just out drinkin&#39;, that&#39;s<br/>
all! Please!&quot;<br/>
Hiro couldn&#39;t hear him in his blind rage. He picked the man up by the<br/>
collar and held him off the ground. Raising his sword, he readied to<br/>
stab the man, just as--<br/>
&quot;You! Drop the sword!&quot;<br/>
He dropped the man instead, and spun on his heel, coming face to face<br/>
with another man in Shinsengumi uniform, with about a dozen others<br/>
behind him, all armed-- all with swords, some also with spears and<br/>
halberds.<br/>
&quot;Drop the sword,&quot; repeated the man, obviously the leader in the group.<br/>
He was of medium-height, firm build, and had a sharp, piercing gaze<br/>
like that of a wolf.<br/>
&quot;These...these men, whoever they are, were raping my wife. You have no<br/>
right to tell me to drop the sword! I will kill them!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I know who these men are,&quot; retorted the other man sharply. &quot;And I<br/>
know their reputation. I happen to be their commander. Now drop the<br/>
sword and let me deal with them.&quot;<br/>
Hiro let the sword drop from his hand. He was pushed aside by the<br/>
large group behind the wolf-eyed man, some of whom rushed forward to<br/>
bind the wrists of the survivor, while others checked to make sure<br/>
that the other two were dead.<br/>
&quot;What about your wife?&quot; asked the wolf-eyed man. &quot;Forgot about her so<br/>
quickly?&quot;<br/>
Blushing red with embarrassment and shame, he rushed over to Yuki, who<br/>
was sobbing uncontrollably and trying to cover herself with the<br/>
tattered remnants of her kimono. Gently, Hiro laid a hand on her<br/>
shoulder. She looked up and suddenly threw her arms around him.<br/>
Closing his own suddenly tear-filled eyes, he gently rocked her back<br/>
and forth, trying to calm her down.<br/>
&quot;Come with me, both of you.&quot;<br/>
It was the wolf-eyed man again.<br/>
&quot;Huh? Where?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t you know where anything is? To the Shinsengumi headquarters at<br/>
the Yagi mansion! My superiors will need to hear about what happened<br/>
in order to deal properly with Onoda there.&quot; He gestured toward the<br/>
survivor.<br/>
Shinsengumi headquarters? But that would meanHiro shook his head in<br/>
disbelief. Divine Wind, indeed<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll have our doctor tend to any wounds you or your<br/>
wife may have. It&#39;s idiots like Onoda and Masuda who give us the name<br/>
`wolves&#39;. We&#39;re actually quite concerned with the welfare of the<br/>
common people in this city.&quot;<br/>
Gently helping Yuki to her feet, Hiro followed the wolf-eyed man.<br/>

Chapter 2<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto<br/>
Genji 1 (1864), June 20th<br/>
<br/>
As Hiro found out, he and Yuki hadn&#39;t landed far from the Yagi<br/>
estate-- probably only about a couple blocks away. He was glad they<br/>
were that close, for Yuki&#39;s sake, as she didn&#39;t seem too likely to be<br/>
in a calm enough state to hike very far.<br/>
His first impression at realizing where he was, was that the 1860s<br/>
didn&#39;t smell as good as he&#39;d imagined. Despite the extreme cleanliness<br/>
and cautious sanitation common to any major Japanese city of those<br/>
days, there was still the smell of dirt and mud in the air. The sky<br/>
seemed bluer, though, and the visibility was excellent. He&#39;d read all<br/>
about it in his college textbooks, heard all about it from his<br/>
family&#39;s stories, but he&#39;d never imagined it to be sooverpoweringly<br/>
real. He was there, in the textbooks, as history was being written,<br/>
walking the streets with a troop of samurai. If the situation weren&#39;t<br/>
so grave, and the era not so bloody, he might actually have taken the<br/>
time to better soak in the atmosphere.<br/>
&quot;Here we are. Shinsengumi headquarters,&quot; said the wolf-eyed man,<br/>
indicating the gateway with a tilt of his head. &quot;Please follow me.&quot;<br/>
As he led them through the gate, Hiro remembered the force that had<br/>
brought them here, and felt a chill run down his spine. Gritting his<br/>
teeth, he did his best to put the past behind him, and followed the<br/>
wolf-eyed man into the main courtyard.<br/>
&quot;Welcome back, Saitou-san!&quot; called a man who had just emerged from one<br/>
of the rooms. He was about the same height as wolf-eyes-- Saitou-- but<br/>
looked much younger, with childlike features, almost too young to be<br/>
holding the katana in his left hand.<br/>
&quot;No time for that, Okita-kun! Go get the doctor, and tell Hijikata-san<br/>
that I have business with him.&quot; Okita nodded curtly, and dashed off,<br/>
returning momentarily with the Yagi family doctor and a couple of<br/>
maids, before dashing off in the other direction to find Hijikata.<br/>
&quot;Clean this woman up and check her for any injuries if you would,<br/>
sensei.&quot; He nodded, and gestured for Hiro to let go. &quot;It&#39;ll be<br/>
alright,&quot; Saitou reassured him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. She&#39;s in good hands.&quot;<br/>
Reluctantly-- very reluctantly-- Hiro let go of Yuki, who was promptly<br/>
led away by the doctor and maids.<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Saitou repeated, bringing Hiro back to full attention.<br/>
&quot;Now let&#39;s go see Hijikata-san, and clear this business of Masuda&#39;s<br/>
people up.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yyes of course, Saitou-san.&quot; As the mist cleared from his mind, Hiro<br/>
put two and two together. Saitoua leader in the ShinsengumiSaitou<br/>
Hajime! The legendary Shinsengumi third unit captain! And Okitamust<br/>
be Okita Souji, the first unit captain! And HijikataHiro shivered in<br/>
mild horror at the name. Hijikata Toshizou Yoshitoyo, the Shinsengumi<br/>
vice-commander and &quot;demon&quot;. Originally the son of the farmer, he was<br/>
adopted into a samurai family, and soon became an expert at<br/>
swordsmanship. Known for his cold and cruel manner of leadership, he<br/>
was feared by all, friend and foe alike-- and yet, loyal to the last,<br/>
he fought to the very end of the Bakumatsu period, finally dying of a<br/>
gunshot wound at the Battle of Matsumae Castle in Hokkaido. That day,<br/>
however, lay some five years into the future.<br/>
Saitou halted abruptly next to a sliding door, and slid it open with<br/>
one hand, bowing. &quot;Hijikata-san. Sorry to keep you waiting.&quot; He nodded<br/>
to Hiro, and they entered together. &quot;Saitou-san. Have a seat, please.<br/>
You as well,&quot; Hijikata said, motioning to Hiro, who sat along Saitou,<br/>
facing the vice-commander.<br/>
&quot;Now, what did you do about those three idiots?&quot; asked the<br/>
vice-commander abruptly. That&#39;s something the historians were right<br/>
about, thought Hiro. Hijikata&#39;s cold, cruel, calculating, and to the<br/>
point<br/>
&quot;We heard they were out drinking and causing trouble nearby. However,<br/>
we hadn&#39;t counted on this man being there.&quot; Saitou pointed at Hiro.<br/>
&quot;Masuda and the others tried raping his wife, and he killed two of the<br/>
men in retaliation. We got there just in time and managed to stop him<br/>
from killing Onoda.&quot;<br/>
Hijikata stroked his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Onoda will pay duly for his<br/>
crimehe has violated the first rule of our code, by behaving in a<br/>
manner unbecoming a warrior.&quot; He turned his cold gaze toward Hiro.<br/>
&quot;Now, tell me who you are, and why, if you are indeed a samurai, you<br/>
have no swords.&quot;<br/>
Hiro studied Hijikata intently, while trying to come up with a<br/>
coherent, believable answer that wouldn&#39;t get him instantly killed.<br/>
The books were right-- he really was tall, almost above average.<br/>
Unlike his only surviving photograph, where his hair lay untied, down<br/>
to chin length, it was tied up in a neat topknot. His features were<br/>
firm and commanding, exuding a twofold aura of immaculacy and<br/>
coldness. His photograph showed him wearing a Western-style suit, but<br/>
seeing him here, dressed in a wide-sleeved kimono and crisp, clean<br/>
gray trousers was more real, more powerful, in a way.<br/>
He knew well that he couldn&#39;t say who he really was, especially<br/>
because someone of his clan, no matter what their rank, wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
wandering the streets of Kyoto in this era, especially not without a<br/>
sizable escort. But he couldn&#39;t think of any other convincing alias.<br/>
Finally, using the intricacies and seemingly endless variations of<br/>
Japanese names to his advantage, he decided to tell the truthpartly.<br/>
&quot;I am Tokugawa Hirotada.&quot;<br/>
Hijikata&#39;s face visibly became pale.<br/>
Hiro knew exactly what he was thinking: For members of the Shinsengumi<br/>
to have broken the rules was bad, but for them to have done what they<br/>
did to a relative of the shogun might cost him his very head <br/>
&quot;Spelled with different letters than that of the Shogun&#39;s name. As for<br/>
my swords&quot; Hiro heard himself make up a story that even he partly<br/>
didn&#39;t believe: he&#39;d been befriended by Masuda at a local teahouse,<br/>
and had promptly begun drinking with him. Somehow, Masuda had drugged<br/>
Hiro&#39;s drink, knocking him unconscious, during which time he&#39;d stolen<br/>
Hiro&#39;s swords. Then Hiro had woken up in the street, seen Masuda and<br/>
two other people trying to rape his wife, who&#39;d come looking for him.<br/>
Seeking to save his wife and defend his honor, Hiro had no choice but<br/>
to kill Masuda and the other man, after which point Saitou had stopped<br/>
him. He also added that he demanded a new pair of swords in return for<br/>
the ones that Masuda had stolen.<br/>
&quot;And,&quot; he added, rather impulsively, &quot;I&#39;d like to join Shinsengumi.&quot;<br/>
Hijikata eyed him carefully for a moment, stroking his chin pensively<br/>
again. &quot;Tokugawa-san, I will grant your request for a new pair of<br/>
swords, as I am eager to make amends for the actions of these fools.<br/>
However, to join Shinsengumi, you must pass an entrance exam, in which<br/>
you must engage in a mock duel with one of the upper-ranking members,<br/>
such as myself, Saitou-san, or Okita-kun. Do you consider yourself<br/>
willing to go through with it?&quot;<br/>
Hiro knew all about the Shinsengumi&#39;s entrance exam-- how it involved<br/>
facing off in a practice duel with one of the chief captainsand that<br/>
though he didn&#39;t need to win to gain entrance, he would quite probably<br/>
end up with broken bones. If successful, he also knew well that he ran<br/>
the risk of getting killed, especially in the tumultuous war and<br/>
defeat of the shogunate that loomed just over the horizon. Hiro almost<br/>
pitied these men for not knowing what would happen to themthat Okita<br/>
would die in a hospital, a victim of tuberculosis at age 25, that<br/>
Hijikata would die in battle in Hokkaido, and that Saitou would die of<br/>
old age in the dawn of the 20th century, the victim of an<br/>
alcohol-induced stomach ulcer. But despite all the history, the risks,<br/>
the names, dates, and places involved, he guessed that he was probably<br/>
in this time period to stay, and that if he was to provide for his<br/>
wife, he had to have a stable job and a place to live. Which the<br/>
Shinsengumi did offer its members<br/>
There was more to consider, as well. Assuming he survived the violent<br/>
bloodletting of the Bakumatsu period, he had very little to no chance<br/>
of getting anywhere in the imminent Meiji government which<br/>
subsequently arosesince he wouldn&#39;t be able to explain his origin,<br/>
and since he had chosen to ally himself with his ancestors&#39; collapsing<br/>
order and government. But he had no choice. Shinsengumi was the only<br/>
way to go. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, staring straight into Hijikata&#39;s eyes, and<br/>
doing his best not to flinch. &quot;Yes, I am willing.&quot;<br/>
Hijikata cleared his throat. After quietly thinking to himself for a<br/>
moment, he nodded curtly. &quot;I see. Very good.&quot; He raised his tone.<br/>
&quot;Okita-san?&quot;<br/>
The sliding door glided open, and Okita bowed politely. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Get this man a new pair of swords immediately. See to it that he also<br/>
gets a bath and a decent meal. At noon, he duels me.&quot; Okita nodded,<br/>
looking somewhat amused at Hiro&#39;s shocked expression. Hijikata turned<br/>
back to Hiro. &quot;Tokugawa-san, you&#39;re free to go.&quot;<br/>
Hiro bowed, all the way to the floor mats. &quot;Thank you, Hijikata-sama.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Come on,&quot; urged Okita, smiling. Hiro got up and followed, heartened<br/>
by Okita&#39;s calm demeanor.<br/>
Hijikata closed his eyes until Hiro left, and then, when he was sure<br/>
that they were gone and fully out of earshot, turned to Saitou. &quot;Do<br/>
you trust his story?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Partly. Masuda definitely tried to rape his wife, but the story about<br/>
the swords seemed made-up&quot;<br/>
&quot;Hm.&quot; Hijikata nodded. &quot;Still, whether he&#39;s lying or not, we lost two<br/>
people today. And from what you tell me about the way he fights,<br/>
taking him in is an acceptable risk. We need people who fight like that.&quot;<br/>
He paused a moment, thinking about how Hiro had fought for his wife.<br/>
He&#39;d seen different people fight for different things, but had never<br/>
heard of a man who fought for love. Not like this&quot;And besides,&quot; he<br/>
added, &quot;once he swears the blood oath to uphold the Shinsengumi code,<br/>
we&#39;ll see just how much a man of his word Tokugawa-san is.&quot;<br/>
Saitou nodded quietly. &quot;Agreed. That always does show who the most<br/>
loyal members are.&quot;<br/>
&quot;If he does make it in, then I&#39;d like to start him off in your unit,<br/>
and then maybe move him up to the 2nd unit. If he really proves<br/>
himself, I might consider putting him in the first unitbut we&#39;ll see.&quot;<br/>
&quot;By all means,&quot; said Saitou. &quot;I&#39;d definitely like to see him in action<br/>
again-- against revolutionary samurai this time. We need that kind of<br/>
energy on our side.&quot;<br/>
Hijikata allowed himself a small, tired sigh. &quot;Agreed.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m also curious to see what the commander will think of him,&quot; added<br/>
Saitou.<br/>
&quot;Kondou-san? We&#39;ll see. He isn&#39;t quick to commenting on skill until he<br/>
sees it with his own eyes.&quot; Saitou nodded in agreement.<br/>
Hijikata rose to his feet. &quot;Well then, if you&#39;ll excuse me,<br/>
Saitou-san, I have to go prepare for a duel.&quot;</div>

&gt; Chapter 2<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kyoto<br/>
&gt; Genji 1 (1864), June 20th<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As Hiro found out, he and Yuki hadn&#39;t landed far<br/>
&gt; from the Yagi<br/>
&gt; estate-- probably only about a couple blocks away.<br/>
&gt; He was glad they<br/>
&gt; were that close, for Yuki&#39;s sake, as she didn&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; too likely to be<br/>
&gt; in a calm enough state to hike very far.<br/>
&gt; His first impression at realizing where he was, was<br/>
&gt; that the 1860s<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t smell as good as he&#39;d imagined. Despite the<br/>
&gt; extreme cleanliness<br/>
&gt; and cautious sanitation common to any major Japanese<br/>
&gt; city of those<br/>
&gt; days, there was still the smell of dirt and mud in<br/>
&gt; the air. The sky<br/>
&gt; seemed bluer, though, and the visibility was<br/>
&gt; excellent. He&#39;d read all<br/>
&gt; about it in his college textbooks, heard all about<br/>
&gt; it from his<br/>
&gt; family&#39;s stories, but he&#39;d never imagined it to be<br/>
&gt; so�overpoweringly<br/>
&gt; real. He was there, in the textbooks, as history was<br/>
&gt; being written,<br/>
&gt; walking the streets with a troop of samurai. If the<br/>
&gt; situation weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; so grave, and the era not so bloody, he might<br/>
&gt; actually have taken the<br/>
&gt; time to better soak in the atmosphere.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Here we are. Shinsengumi headquarters,&quot; said the<br/>
&gt; wolf-eyed man,<br/>
&gt; indicating the gateway with a tilt of his head.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Please follow me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; As he led them through the gate, Hiro remembered the<br/>
&gt; force that had<br/>
&gt; brought them here, and felt a chill run down his<br/>
&gt; spine. Gritting his<br/>
&gt; teeth, he did his best to put the past behind him,<br/>
&gt; and followed the<br/>
&gt; wolf-eyed man into the main courtyard.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Welcome back, Saitou-san!&quot; called a man who had<br/>
&gt; just emerged from one<br/>
&gt; of the rooms. He was about the same height as<br/>
&gt; wolf-eyes-- Saitou-- but<br/>
&gt; looked much younger, with childlike features, almost<br/>
&gt; too young to be<br/>
&gt; holding the katana in his left hand.<br/>
&gt; &quot;No time for that, Okita-kun! Go get the doctor, and<br/>
&gt; tell Hijikata-san<br/>
&gt; that I have business with him.&quot; Okita nodded curtly,<br/>
&gt; and dashed off,<br/>
&gt; returning momentarily with the Yagi family doctor<br/>
&gt; and a couple of<br/>
&gt; maids, before dashing off in the other direction to<br/>
&gt; find Hijikata.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Clean this woman up and check her for any injuries<br/>
&gt; if you would,<br/>
&gt; sensei.&quot; He nodded, and gestured for Hiro to let go.<br/>
&gt; &quot;It&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; alright,&quot; Saitou reassured him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. She&#39;s<br/>
&gt; in good hands.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Reluctantly-- very reluctantly-- Hiro let go of<br/>
&gt; Yuki, who was promptly<br/>
&gt; led away by the doctor and maids.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Saitou repeated, bringing Hiro back<br/>
&gt; to full attention.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Now let&#39;s go see Hijikata-san, and clear this<br/>
&gt; business of Masuda&#39;s<br/>
&gt; people up.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Y�yes of course, Saitou-san.&quot; As the mist cleared<br/>
&gt; from his mind, Hiro<br/>
&gt; put two and two together. Saitou�a leader in the<br/>
&gt; Shinsengumi�Saitou<br/>
&gt; Hajime! The legendary Shinsengumi third unit<br/>
&gt; captain! And Okita�must<br/>
&gt; be Okita Souji, the first unit captain! And<br/>
&gt; Hijikata�Hiro shivered in<br/>
&gt; mild horror at the name. Hijikata Toshizou<br/>
&gt; Yoshitoyo, the Shinsengumi<br/>
&gt; vice-commander and &quot;demon&quot;. Originally the son of<br/>
&gt; the farmer, he was<br/>
&gt; adopted into a samurai family, and soon became an<br/>
&gt; expert at<br/>
&gt; swordsmanship. Known for his cold and cruel manner<br/>
&gt; of leadership, he<br/>
&gt; was feared by all, friend and foe alike-- and yet,<br/>
&gt; loyal to the last,<br/>
&gt; he fought to the very end of the Bakumatsu period,<br/>
&gt; finally dying of a<br/>
&gt; gunshot wound at the Battle of Matsumae Castle in<br/>
&gt; Hokkaido. That day,<br/>
&gt; however, lay some five years into the future.<br/>
&gt; Saitou halted abruptly next to a sliding door, and<br/>
&gt; slid it open with<br/>
&gt; one hand, bowing. &quot;Hijikata-san. Sorry to keep you<br/>
&gt; waiting.&quot; He nodded<br/>
&gt; to Hiro, and they entered together. &quot;Saitou-san.<br/>
&gt; Have a seat, please.<br/>
&gt; You as well,&quot; Hijikata said, motioning to Hiro, who<br/>
&gt; sat along Saitou,<br/>
&gt; facing the vice-commander.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Now, what did you do about those three idiots?&quot;<br/>
&gt; asked the<br/>
&gt; vice-commander abruptly. That&#39;s something the<br/>
&gt; historians were right<br/>
&gt; about, thought Hiro. Hijikata&#39;s cold, cruel,<br/>
&gt; calculating, and to the<br/>
&gt; point�<br/>
&gt; &quot;We heard they were out drinking and causing trouble<br/>
&gt; nearby. However,<br/>
&gt; we hadn&#39;t counted on this man being there.&quot; Saitou<br/>
&gt; pointed at Hiro.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Masuda and the others tried raping his wife, and he<br/>
&gt; killed two of the<br/>
&gt; men in retaliation. We got there just in time and<br/>
&gt; managed to stop him<br/>
&gt; from killing Onoda.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Hijikata stroked his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Onoda will<br/>
&gt; pay duly for his<br/>
&gt; crime�he has violated the first rule of our code, by<br/>
&gt; behaving in a<br/>
&gt; manner unbecoming a warrior.&quot; He turned his cold<br/>
&gt; gaze toward Hiro.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Now, tell me who you are, and why, if you are<br/>
&gt; indeed a samurai, you<br/>
&gt; have no swords.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Hiro studied Hijikata intently, while trying to come<br/>
&gt; up with a<br/>
&gt; coherent, believable answer that wouldn&#39;t get him<br/>
&gt; instantly killed.<br/>
&gt; The books were right-- he really was tall, almost<br/>
&gt; above average.<br/>
&gt; Unlike his only surviving photograph, where his hair<br/>
&gt; lay untied, down<br/>
&gt; to chin length, it was tied up in a neat topknot.<br/>
&gt; His features were<br/>
&gt; firm and commanding, exuding a twofold aura of<br/>
&gt; immaculacy and<br/>
&gt; coldness. His photograph showed him wearing a<br/>
&gt; Western-style suit, but<br/>
&gt; seeing him here, dressed in a wide-sleeved kimono<br/>
&gt; and crisp, clean<br/>
&gt; gray trousers was more real, more powerful, in a<br/>
&gt; way.<br/>
&gt; He knew well that he couldn&#39;t say who he really was,<br/>
&gt; especially<br/>
&gt; because someone of his clan, no matter what their<br/>
&gt; rank, wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; wandering the streets of Kyoto in this era,<br/>
&gt; especially not without a<br/>
&gt; sizable escort. But he couldn&#39;t think of any other<br/>
&gt; convincing alias.<br/>
&gt; Finally, using the intricacies and seemingly endless<br/>
&gt; variations of<br/>
&gt; Japanese names to his advantage, he decided to tell<br/>
&gt; the truth�partly.<br/>
&gt; &quot;I am Tokugawa Hirotada.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Hijikata&#39;s face visibly became pale.<br/>
&gt; Hiro knew exactly what he was thinking: For members<br/>
&gt; of the Shinsengumi<br/>
&gt; to have broken the rules was bad, but for them to<br/>
&gt; have done what they<br/>
&gt; did to a relative of the shogun might cost him his<br/>
&gt; very head� <br/>
&gt; &quot;Spelled with different letters than that of the<br/>
&gt; Shogun&#39;s name. As for<br/>
&gt; my swords�&quot; Hiro heard himself make up a story that<br/>
&gt; even he partly<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t believe: he&#39;d been befriended by Masuda at a<br/>
&gt; local teahouse,<br/>
&gt; and had promptly begun drinking with him. Somehow,<br/>
&gt; Masuda had drugged<br/>
&gt; Hiro&#39;s drink, knocking him unconscious, during which<br/>
&gt; time he&#39;d stolen<br/>
&gt; Hiro&#39;s swords. Then Hiro had woken up in the street,<br/>
&gt; seen Masuda and<br/>
&gt; two other people trying to rape his wife, who&#39;d come<br/>
&gt; looking <br/>

Chapter 3<br/>
<br/>
After being given a clean bill of health by the doctor and a long,<br/>
healing bath, Yuki was helped out to the courtyard, where she&#39;d been<br/>
told Hiro was to duel Hijikata for entrance into Shinsengumi. Herself<br/>
a martial arts instructor, she was well familiar with Hijikata&#39;s<br/>
legendary mastery of his style, Tennen Rishin Ryuu. Hiro probably<br/>
didn&#39;t stand a chancethough a senior instructor of the Tokugawa<br/>
family&#39;s branch of Owari Yagyu Shinkage Ryuu swordsmanship, there was<br/>
a fundamental difference between his and Hijikata&#39;s attitude towards<br/>
the sword: Hiro knew it as a means of self-discipline and protection,<br/>
while Hijikata, like most samurai, ultimately took it as a weapon of<br/>
war. Hiro may have killed two people that morning, but Hijikata had<br/>
probably been doing so for at least the last year that he&#39;d been in<br/>
Kyoto, and probably long before.<br/>
It was still a bit unbelievable to Yuki that they were now in Kyoto in<br/>
the middle of the Bakumatsu period. The atmosphere, sounds, sights,<br/>
and smells were exactly how she&#39;d imagined it, but more surreal.<br/>
Everything had a bright, wondrous aura about it, making her feel like<br/>
she was seeing the world through new eyes. Everything, from the<br/>
blueness of the sky all the way down to her new light-green kimono<br/>
with the darker green brocade obi, was bright and beautiful. Eager to<br/>
forget about what had happened to her in the morning, she focused her<br/>
entire attention on that sense of wonder and awe.<br/>
Hiro and Okita finally emerged from one of the rooms. Yuki saw the new<br/>
swords that her husband wore, and smiled. He&#39;d finally managed to live<br/>
out his dreamto be a samurai in the age of samurai, instead of being<br/>
an anachronism in the modern age. Okita, walking next to him, carried<br/>
a suit of practice armor and a bamboo sword. Unable to restrain<br/>
herself, Yuki strode over to them.<br/>
&quot;Hiro-kun?&quot;<br/>
Hiro jerked upright at the sound of her voice. Turning on his heel, he<br/>
saw her, and tried to protest. Yuki simply put a finger to his lips,<br/>
and smiled.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m here to help you get ready.&quot;<br/>
Without waiting for a response, she took the breastplate from Okita<br/>
and started tying it into place.<br/>
&quot;YukiI&quot;<br/>
After tying the protective apron up, she undid the sash of his katana,<br/>
and took it carefully.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll hold this for you.&quot;<br/>
He nodded quietly, and took her hand, holding it up to his cheek. On<br/>
the inside, she ached to be held, and knew that he probably wanted to<br/>
do so just as badly. Both of them restrained themselves. They knew<br/>
very well what the social constraints of the age were, and how open<br/>
display of affection was considered &quot;improper&quot; and &quot;barbaric&quot;. Yuki<br/>
could feel that Hiro wanted to say something deep and romantic, but<br/>
instead, seemed to be content with two words.<br/>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>
She didn&#39;t need to answer. Giving him a short bow, she stepped back to<br/>
where the maids and serving women stood. <br/>
&quot;Fine man ya got there, Yuki-han,&quot; said one of the maids<br/>
enthusiastically, in the fast-paced Kansai accent characteristic of<br/>
natives of the Kyoto area.<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot; she sighed wistfully.<br/>
Once Okita helped Hiro tie the helmet into place, it was time to<br/>
begin. Hiro and Hijikata had moved into their starting positions<br/>
opposite each other. Kondou Isami, the commander of the Shinsengumi,<br/>
stood between and a safe distance back from them, acting as the referee.<br/>
&quot;Ready?&quot; called Kondou. Both combatants nodded. &quot;Begin!&quot;<br/>
Yuki could hear the collective gasp among the onlookers when Hiro<br/>
moved into a jodan stancesword angling backwards, held over his head.<br/>
The jodan stance was the most aggressive stance in all Japanese<br/>
swordsmanship, the equivalent of shouting You want a piece of me? by<br/>
way of posture. Consequently, to take a jodan stance against Hijikata<br/>
Toshizou, even in a practice duel, was seen as a brash and<br/>
unrestrained challenge of authority.<br/>
Try as she could, Yuki couldn&#39;t read Hijikata&#39;s intention or direction<br/>
at all. The man was an utter enigma, not allowing any opening<br/>
whatsoever. Truly worthy of the appellation of &quot;demon&quot;<br/>
Suddenly, Hijikata began moving to the side a bit, probably only to<br/>
test Hiro&#39;s reaction, but illiciting none. Hiro simply stayed in<br/>
jodan, facing the vice-commander, looking him as straight in the eyes<br/>
as possible without letting his blood curdle from fearand then it<br/>
happened. Hijikata bolted, dashing straight in toward Hiro with a<br/>
tremendous kiai, a vocal projection of inner force, moving quickly<br/>
behind the shout with the linear, frontal assault style that was the<br/>
hallmark of Tennen Rishin Ryuu.<br/>
Yuki gasped. Hiro seemed frozen in place, somehow transfixed by the<br/>
sight of Hijikata rushing him, coming closer and closer and closer,<br/>
his aura somehow inducing a total paralysis. Suddenly, he seemed to<br/>
regain control of his senses, and stepped out of the way, forcing<br/>
Hijikata to quickly stick out a foot and halt his forward momentum,<br/>
spinning around and facing Hiro again with a growl.<br/>
Now Hijikata moved into a jodan stance, more out of rage than anything<br/>
else. Hiro moved to chudan stance, and tried staring his opponent down.<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re a fool if you think you can defeat me!&quot; snarled Hijikata.<br/>
Keeping his sword high, he tilted it forward. Then he vanishedHiro<br/>
lifted his sword quickly to a vertical kasumi stance to protect his<br/>
face and torso, just when Hijikata reappeared right in front of him,<br/>
delivering a diagonal kesa-giri slash that sent Hiro and his sword<br/>
flying in opposite directions. Yuki bit her lip, stifling the urge to<br/>
run to him and block Hijikata&#39;s next attack with her own body.<br/>
Suddenly, though, Hiro stuck an arm out and rolled backward, quickly<br/>
dashing back up and running for his sword. He grabbed it just in time,<br/>
right when Hijikata tried to make a final, decisive slash, bringing it<br/>
up to meet the vice-commander&#39;s weapon. The two of them seemed fixed<br/>
in place, frozen somehowand then Hiro let loose a tremendous kiai,<br/>
sweeping Hijikata&#39;s sword to one side, and then sweeping back upward<br/>
toward his headjust when Hijikata jerked his sword up and stopped<br/>
inches from Hiro&#39;s throat.<br/>
&quot;Aiuchi! A tie!&quot; called Kondou. Both of them slowly lowered their<br/>
weapons, and bowed to each other. Yuki let out a sigh of relief. So<br/>
her Hiro had survived after all<br/>
&quot;Why&#39;re you so red all of a sudden, Yuki-han?&quot; asked another one of<br/>
the serving women, a girl probably around fourteen years of age.<br/>
&quot;Ohme? Blushing? No, far from it!&quot; she said, trying to act the part<br/>
of the brave, steady samurai wife. The women snickered to themselves,<br/>
amused at her awkwardness.<br/>
She walked over to where Hiro stood, being helped out of his armor by<br/>
Okita.<br/>
&quot;Your sword,&quot; Yuki announced. As she held it out to him with both<br/>
hands, she realized that her grip on it had been very tight. Yuki<br/>
remembered the old sayingthe sword is the soul of the samuraiand<br/>
smiled. So she&#39;d been able to hold a part of Hiro, after all<br/>
&quot;Ah. Thank you, Yuki-chan.&quot; He received the katana with both hands and<br/>
tied it back into place at his left hip, next to his short sword.<br/>
&quot;This your wife?&quot; asked Kondou.<br/>
&quot;Yes, Kondou-sama,&quot; answered Hiro, not being able to help smiling.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m Matsumae Yuki,&quot; she said quietly, and bowed low, as was<br/>
appropriate for a woman of those days.<br/>
&quot;She&#39;s a good cook, and quite skilled with the naginata (halberd) and<br/>
kodachi (short sword).&quot;<br/>
Kondou laughed. &quot;Well, it sounds like we&#39;ll have good use for someone<br/>
of her talents. But for now, Tokugawa-san, there is something you must<br/>
do.&quot; Pulling a piece of paper from inside the sleeve of his kimono, he<br/>
read, in an official voice:<br/>
&quot;Tokugawa Hirotada. As a new member of the Shinsengumi, you must swear<br/>
by the following rules:<br/>
First, never to deviate from the Way of the Samurai.<br/>
Second, never to abandon the Shinsengumi.<br/>
Third, never to raise money selfishly.<br/>
Fourth, to never engage in private lawsuits.<br/>
Fifth, not to engage in petty quarrels.<br/>
Sixth, to fight and die on the spot, should your unit captain be<br/>
killed in combat.<br/>
Seventh, to not go back for the body of any member of any unit except<br/>
the unit captain, whether the death toll is low or high.<br/>
And finally, whether on duty or not, to immediately commit seppuku,<br/>
should you engage an enemy in single combat and fail to kill him. Do<br/>
you swear to live by these rules?&quot;<br/>
Hiro swallowed hard, and nodded.<br/>
&quot;Well then, sign in blood,&quot; answered Kondou, holding out the paper.<br/>
Yuki looked on as Hiro pulled out his short sword a bit, exposing the<br/>
blade. He pricked his right thumb on the cold steel, and when he saw<br/>
the blood seep from the cut, he stuck his thumb out, and pressed down<br/>
firmly on the paper.<br/>
&quot;Tokugawa Hirotada,&quot; said Hijikata coldly, finishing for Kondou, &quot;you<br/>
have pledged in blood to honor these rules. Welcome to the Shinsengumi.&quot;</div>

Chapter 4<br/>
<br/>
	Out on patrol, Hiro had to do his best to keep from grinning like an<br/>
idiot. He still couldn&#39;t believe his eyeshe was on patrol in Kyoto<br/>
with the Shinsengumi, wearing the blue overcoat with white<br/>
mountain-shaped triangles on the sleeves, wearing swords like his<br/>
samurai ancestors, and walking in step with Saitou Hajime&#39;s 3rd Unit.<br/>
He let the whole experience, the atmosphere and all the sights,<br/>
sounds, and smells of Kyoto, sink in.<br/>
	As he walked, he let his eyes wander around. Kyoto in these days was<br/>
nothing like he&#39;d ever seen in photographseven the surviving<br/>
buildings from the period didn&#39;t look this good, this clean. The day<br/>
was calm, making the city, even in these bloody days, seem worthy of<br/>
the name &quot;Peaceful Capital&quot;. Hiro also noticed, with some degree of<br/>
amusement, that anywhere the unit went, people would entirely clear<br/>
the street, some going so far as to even avert their eyes. We&#39;re so<br/>
good, we&#39;re badhe thought with a chuckle.<br/>
	Saitou ordered the unit to halt. When Hiro noticed where they were,<br/>
he stopped smiling. In all the excitement, he&#39;d never asked the date.<br/>
Now he suddenly knewJune 20, 1864. This was the date of the pivotal<br/>
arrest that took place here, at the Masuya used clothing store.<br/>
	With a sweep of his hand, Saitou ordered the unit to surround the<br/>
building, cutting off all possible routes of escape. Hiro began moving<br/>
toward one of the groups, but Saitou motioned him back to the front.<br/>
So I&#39;m still being tested, thought Hiro, as he joined the four men who<br/>
were with the captain. After a couple of uneasy moments, they<br/>
announced themselves.<br/>
	&quot;We are the Shinsengumi!&quot; called Saitou. &quot;By order of the Kyoto<br/>
Military Commission, we wish to speak with the owner of this shop!&quot;<br/>
	A short man with furtive, darting eyes stepped forward.<br/>
	&quot;I&#39;m Masuya Kiemon.You want something?&quot; he drawled, in Japanese heavy<br/>
with a southern accent, much like the accent characteristic of the<br/>
American south. The shopworkers, who all seemed to have a similar air<br/>
about them, suddenly tensed up.<br/>
&quot;We&#39;ve received reports of rebel activity around here. Have<br/>
younoticed anything?&quot;<br/>
	In what seemed like a matter of seconds, half a dozen concealed<br/>
blades were pointed at Saitou and his group.<br/>
	I guess that answers the question, thought Hiro darkly.<br/>
	&quot;Don&#39;t make me laugh,&quot; sighed Saitou, slowly bringing his hand toward<br/>
the hilt of his sword. &quot;You Ishin dogs are only going to make it worse<br/>
for yourselves.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Get `im, boys,&quot; growled Masuya.<br/>
	Hiro didn&#39;t wait for someone to come at him. Drawing his sword, he<br/>
gritted his teeth and went toward the nearest enemy. He tried to do<br/>
his best to focus on the battle, and not on the fact that his sword,<br/>
which he believed was &quot;life-giving&quot; and protective, was actually being<br/>
used to kill. Rebel extremists or not, killing was killing.<br/>
	Moments later, the rest of the Third squad poured in through the<br/>
other entrances, quickly crushing any resistance. Soon Masuya was left<br/>
alone, standing amidst the bodies of his associates, with over two<br/>
dozen swords pointed at him.<br/>
	&quot;Surrender,&quot; said Saitou, glaring at him with his piercing, wolf-eyed<br/>
gaze. Masuya quietly held his hands up in the air, palms facing<br/>
outward. Someone found some rope, and quickly bound his hands. Another<br/>
patrolman searched him thoroughly for any hidden weapons. When all was<br/>
secure, Saitou nodded.<br/>
	&quot;Two people go and notify the Military Commission about what<br/>
happened, five people stay here as a guard until they get here. The<br/>
rest of you come with me to the Maekawa estate.&quot;	Hiro bobbed his head<br/>
respectfully, and followed Saitou&#39;s group.<br/>
************<br/>
The 3rd Unit arrived at the Maekawa estatethe &quot;other&quot; Shinsengumi<br/>
headquartersrather quickly. It seemed that Hijikata was already<br/>
there, and had been waiting for some time. After Saitou delivered a<br/>
face-to-face report, he handed Masuya over to Hijikata. Then the two<br/>
Shinsengumi leaders and the prisoner, as well as a couple of other<br/>
membeers not from the 3rd unit, entered the small building in the back<br/>
of the estate, and shut the doors. The interrogation of Masuya Kiemon<br/>
had begun.<br/>
The 3rd Unit sat around the estate idly, eating rice balls and sweets,<br/>
talking, catnapping, and in general, resting their feet after a long<br/>
day out on the streets. It was a good thing that the interrogation<br/>
room had been built as a storage buildingthe walls and doors were<br/>
thicker than usual, and thus blocked out any sounds of agony that<br/>
undoubtedly accompanied any interrogation by Hijikata Toshizou.<br/>
Hiro quietly munched on a rice ball and thought to what was happening<br/>
in the interrogation with disgust. History books on the Shinsengumi,<br/>
as well as accounts of Hijikata himself, seemed to be very good about<br/>
recounting this incident.<br/>
Hijikata had Masuya hung by his ankles by the ceiling. After letting<br/>
the blood flow into the man&#39;s head until he lost feeling in his legs,<br/>
Hijikata started to interrogate him, firing question after question at<br/>
his victim. Masuya wouldn&#39;t answercouldn&#39;t answer. Hijikata beat him<br/>
repeatedly, until his skin was raw and bleeding, and still Masuya said<br/>
nothing. Finally, exasperated, Hijikata had metal spikes driven<br/>
through the soles of the man&#39;s feet, and had placed lit candles on the<br/>
protruding part of each spike. Only when the hot wax dripped into the<br/>
open wounds in his soles did Masuya start talking.<br/>
First of all, he admitted that Masuya Kiemon was a pseudonym. He was<br/>
actually a samurai of the Ishin Shishi named Furutaka Shuntarou<br/>
Masayasu. Masquerading as a Kyoto merchant, he had slowly helped amass<br/>
a large arsenalonlu one of several which were to be used in this<br/>
attack. As it turned out, the Ishin Shishi were planning massive<br/>
action in Kyoto. Around the Gion Festival in mid-July, they planned to<br/>
execute a plan so inhuman, so cruel, that even Hijikata apparently<br/>
didn&#39;t believe his ears at first. They would secretly set fire to a<br/>
district north of the Imperial Palace and allow the wind to spread the<br/>
fire rapidly. In the ensuing conflagration, they would kill as many of<br/>
the Shinsengumi and related shogunate forces as possible, and to top<br/>
it all off, they were going to kidnap Emperor Komei and whisk him off<br/>
to Choshuu, the domain which was at the forefront of the<br/>
anti-shogunate movement, and with the &quot;approval&quot; of the Emperor,<br/>
&quot;reinstate&quot; the Imperial government. Hijikata had wanted to find out<br/>
more, but at that point, almost mercifully, Furutaka Shuntarou<br/>
Masayasu had died from a combination of blood loss and exhaustion. But<br/>
the Shinsengumi had found out the rest of the story through their spy<br/>
network, and ended up stopping the plot in the first week of July, at<br/>
the Battle of Ikedaya...<br/>
At the thought of Ikedaya, Hiro closed the mental textbook and thought<br/>
of reality. He knew that the Battle of Ikedaya lasted an entire night,<br/>
and that there were several Shinsengumi dead, as well as some people<br/>
who were wounded so badly they would never be able to see or wield a<br/>
sword again. He thought of how he might be one of those casualties, of<br/>
how Yuki would probably suffer in such a familiar yet alien time, of<br/>
how she&#39;d be alienated because of her &quot;modern&quot; approach to life<br/>
&quot;Getting ahead of ourselves, aren&#39;t we?&quot; he muttered, giving himself a<br/>
slap to the forehead. &quot;One day at a time&quot;<br/>
&quot;Neh, Tokugawa-san,&quot; said one of his fellow 3rd unit patrolmen. &quot;We&#39;ve<br/>
been on patrol all day, and haven&#39;t had any time to ask you about<br/>
yourself&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh. Yes, I suppose that&#39;s right,&quot; said Hiro, scratching his head in<br/>
embarrassment.<br/>
&quot;Where are you from?&quot; asked a man sitting next to him. &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>
tellyour accent isvague.&quot;<br/>
As with Hijikata that morning, Hiro decided to tell part of the truth.<br/>
&quot;Well, I was born in Mito, but my father was a wandering swordsman, so<br/>
I&#39;ve been all around the country, training at various schools. None of<br/>
the schools of the major styles though. Come to think of it,&quot; he<br/>
added, &quot;traveling from school to school was how I ended up meeting my<br/>
wife, up at a naginata school in northern Honshu&quot;<br/>
&quot;Skilled with the `spear&#39; and sword, eh, Tokugawa-san?&quot; someone burst out.<br/>
&quot;Ha, ha. Very funny.&quot;<br/>
&quot;She is quite a sight, though,&quot; said someone else, around a mouthful<br/>
of rice balls.<br/>
A shout interrupted them.<br/>
&quot;1st Unit is here! 1st Unit is here!&quot;<br/>
The 3rd Unit condensed themselves, moving closer together to give room<br/>
to the newcomers. Hiro looked them over. Being the first unit, they<br/>
were the unspoken objects of the envy of perhaps every other unit of<br/>
the Shinsengumi. He&#39;d thought it only had to do with the fact that<br/>
their captain was Okita Souji, but now, having gotten a good look at<br/>
them, it seemed like every one of the men of that unit was an object<br/>
of envy, as wellthey seemed cleaner, taller, and stronger than the<br/>
3rd Unit.<br/>
Suddenly, Saitou emerged from the interrogation room, quickly slipping<br/>
out and closing the door behind him. He had his eyes shut and was<br/>
shaking his head in quiet disbelief. Tugging smartly at his haori, he<br/>
moved over to his unit.<br/>
 &quot;Alright, let&#39;s head back to the Yagi mansion, everyone!&quot;<br/>
Everyone quickly got up and formed two lines. One of the men on the<br/>
right raised the Shinsengumi flag. Though none of them had trained in<br/>
Western military drill exercises, the beat of their march was more<br/>
constant a cadence than any Hiro had heard in his life. He did his<br/>
best to keep his step in time with the others.<br/>
Though still in disgust at the interrogation, and still doubtful about<br/>
the future, Hiro nonetheless felt a sense of accomplishment. He&#39;d<br/>
saved Yuki&#39;s life, joined Shinsengumi, helped apprehend a rebel, had<br/>
fought side-by-side with one of the most famous swordsmen of the age,<br/>
and was on his way to gaining respect from his fellow patrolmen.<br/>
All in all, he&#39;d had a good day.</div>

Chapter 5<br/>
<br/>
	Work done for the time being, Yuki sat leaning against a pillar on<br/>
the veranda and sighed tiredly. The day had been quite a long one, and<br/>
the work, be it cleaning, cooking, or washing, never seemed to get<br/>
done. To top it off, there were some off-duty patrolmen who seemed to<br/>
like shadowing her and the other women, so Yuki remained guarded and<br/>
alert. Tired of the day&#39;s concerns, though, she focused on the mist.<br/>
The view into the courtyard reminded her of the 11th century<br/>
literature she&#39;d studied in college. In those days, Kyoto was the<br/>
center of the vibrant Heian court culture, which remained one of the<br/>
most well-known periods of Japanese history, primarily because of the<br/>
sheer volume of writing done by the women of the court, including such<br/>
famous names as Sei Shonagon and Lady Murasaki. As Yuki recalled, one<br/>
of the favored poetic devices of the Heian court ladies was the<br/>
mistusually used in reference to the mist shrouding a departing<br/>
lover&#39;s receding figure. Just like how it shrouded the path that Hiro<br/>
took, earlier today she thought. The more things change, the more<br/>
they stay the same<br/>
	Yuki&#39;s consciousness started drifting. The rhythm of the raindrops,<br/>
gently striking the roof of the veranda and the flat, worn stones of<br/>
the courtyard, had a nearly hypnotic effect on her. She closed her<br/>
eyes, and would&#39;ve fallen asleep had the guards at the gate not made<br/>
their timely announcement.<br/>
	&quot;3rd Unit is here! 3rd Unit is here!&quot;<br/>
	She&#39;d wanted to hear those words all day. Suddenly, a poem from those<br/>
bygone days of the Heian court leapt to mind<br/>
	Faintly I saw you<br/>
a man spied for an instant<br/>
as through the morning mist.<br/>
And yet I fear that I may die,<br/>
so clear is the love that I feel.<br/>
Yuki managed to get to her feet and give the customary bow, just as<br/>
the soaked samurai of Saitou&#39;s unit came through the gate. Once safely<br/>
within the compound, they all made a dash for the dry safety of the<br/>
surrounding rooms and the veranda. She caught sight of Hiro as he made<br/>
it onto to the veranda. Shaking the moisture off his new blue and<br/>
white haori, he approached her.<br/>
	&quot;Tadaima. I&#39;m home.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Okaerinasai, Hiro-kun. Welcome back.&quot;<br/>
	She leaned forward, and quickly whispered in his ear.<br/>
	&quot;Meet me behind the kitchen tonight.&quot;<br/>
	He nodded.<br/>
I was hoping you&#39;d say thathe thought. We need to talk<br/>
********<br/>
	The rain tapered off a couple hours later, after sunset, leaving the<br/>
ground moist and the air slightly humid. Hiro didn&#39;t notice at first,<br/>
being rather occupied with sharing drinks with his fellow 3rd Unit<br/>
members in one of the smaller rooms.<br/>
&quot;Hey guysdidn&#39;t the rain stop?&quot;<br/>
	The men paused for a moment, and listened closely, some halting cups<br/>
of sake halfway in order to discern the lull that always follows a<br/>
steady rain.<br/>
	&quot;So it did&quot; mumbled someone. &quot;Aw great, now it&#39;ll be humid&quot;<br/>
	They all glanced at each other for a moment.<br/>
	&quot;At least that&#39;ll keep those Choshuu dogs off the streets for awhile!&quot;<br/>
	The entire room burst out in raucous laughter.<br/>
	&quot;Yeah! That way, maybe they&#39;ll sweat to death, and that&#39;ll take care<br/>
of them at last! `Topple the Shogunate&#39; this, you dirty slobs!&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Hear, hear!&quot; Everyone downed their cups of sake in hearty agreement.<br/>
	Hiro bowed curtly.<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;ll all excuse me, I need go outside for awhile and get some<br/>
fresh air.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Awwwalright, Lord Shogun. Hurry back, your Excellency, or we&#39;ll<br/>
finish all the sake!&quot;<br/>
	Hiro laughed at the new nickname.<br/>
If they only knewPeople around here certainly have a strange sense of<br/>
humor<br/>
	&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;<br/>
	Sake isn&#39;t what I need to calm myself down right nowhe thought.<br/>
 Quickly making it out to the veranda, he was overjoyed at his<br/>
discovery that the rain had stopped. He slipped into his sandals and<br/>
headed out into the courtyard, silently coming to the area behind the<br/>
kitchen, trying his best not to be noticed. There wasn&#39;t much room<br/>
behind the kitchenjust a narrow bit of a passage between it and the<br/>
outer wall.<br/>
	&quot;Yuki?&quot; he whispered, barely audibly. &quot;You here?&quot;<br/>
	Hiro looked around, unable to see much in the darkness. Suddenly,<br/>
though, he saw her form illuminated by the starlight-- leaning against<br/>
the outer wall, hands pressed together in a silent effort to calm her<br/>
impatience, silent tears glistening in the moonlight glow.<br/>
	&quot;Yuki.&quot;<br/>
	She looked up suddenly, squinting to make sure it was him.<br/>
	&quot;Hiroyou&#39;re here&quot;<br/>
	Unable to control herself any more, she threw her arms around him,<br/>
and sobbed bitterly.<br/>
	&quot;I was so worried about you! When I asked the date, and found out it<br/>
was June 20and I remembered that today was the day that Furutaka was<br/>
captured at the Masuya clothing store. You were out on patrol, and I&quot;<br/>
she buried her face in the folds of his kimono, unable to go on.<br/>
	&quot;Shhhhh.&quot; he whispered. &quot;It has been a long day, for both of us.<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, Yuki-chanthings will work out.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;How can you say that?&quot; she moaned. &quot;We&#39;re in the middle of a war,<br/>
siding with the doomed cause. The Ikedaya battle is only a matter of<br/>
weeks away, then the Battle of Kinmon, then the minor skirmishes, all<br/>
the way to your ancestor Yoshinobu&#39;s renunciation of authority, then<br/>
the battle of Toba-Fushimi and the retreat north, then the bloodbath<br/>
at Aizu-Wakamatsu and Hakodatecan we really live through this period?<br/>
Who&#39;s to say you won&#39;t get killed on patrol tomorrow? I&#39;ve always<br/>
loved this period, but now that I&#39;m actually in it, I feel so alien. I<br/>
need you. I don&#39;t want to lose you. &quot;<br/>
	&quot;Yuki&quot; Hiro sighed, running his fingers gently through her long,<br/>
glossy hair. &quot;If there were only one thing I could tell you to<br/>
remember now, it&#39;d be this.&quot; He took her face in his hands, and looked<br/>
deeply into her eyes, mesmerized by the way that the moonlight made<br/>
them sparkle. <br/>
&quot;Anata wa watashi no taisetsu na takaramono desuyou are my precious<br/>
treasure. I hold on to this one thought always.&quot; <br/>
	Yuki gave Hiro a gentle, loving squeeze.<br/>
	&quot;Thank youI w--&quot; she tried to say something, but he quietly<br/>
interrupted, drawing their lips together in a long, bittersweet,<br/>
satisfying kiss that tasted of tears and longing<br/>
Waves of pleasing, delightful warmth washed over both of them,<br/>
lighting the air with a beautiful, surreal glow. Yuki sensed her knees<br/>
get weak, and felt like she was almost melting in the comfort of his<br/>
embrace.<br/>
&quot;And even though the word won&#39;t exist until after the end of this<br/>
waraishiteru, Yuki-chan. I love you&quot;<br/>
	Her heart skipped a beat. She felt like it&#39;d been so long since the<br/>
last time he&#39;d said that.<br/>
&quot;Dai suki desudai suki desu, Hiro-kun...If I could shout it from the<br/>
rooftops without getting arrested by your new boss for disturbing the<br/>
peace, I would.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro quietly chuckled. Seems like her wit is the same as ever<br/>
	&quot;Hiro-kunsomething else. Will we ever get to be alone?&quot;<br/>
	He sighed again.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll have to figure something out. The guys in my unit have been<br/>
talking about the two of us this evening, offering `suggestions&#39; left<br/>
and right about all the teahouses and inns they&#39;ve heard of from here<br/>
to Edo, but I don&#39;t know anything for sure. They&#39;re all drunk right<br/>
now, so I can&#39;t say that I trust what they say right now. Just be<br/>
patientwe&#39;ll get our chance.&quot;<br/>
	Yuki&#39;s brow furrowed in frustration.<br/>
&quot;People were so up-tight in this age. They had all the licensed<br/>
pleasure quarters they wanted and morebut when it came to people who<br/>
were actually in love, they had to&quot; She lowered her voice, suddenly<br/>
remembering the secrecy of their meeting.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll wait. I don&#39;t want to wait forever, though&quot;<br/>
	&quot;I&#39;ll get right on it&quot; he said with a smirk, getting her drift. &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t know about my unit, but they say that Harada Sanosuke-sama of<br/>
the 10th Unit is the guy to ask about stuff like thatI&#39;ve readand<br/>
heard, that he seems to know a lot of the `right places&#39;. I&#39;ll ask<br/>
him, when I get the opportunity.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Can we stay like this for a while?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Yesplease&quot;<br/>
Hiro closed his eyes and letting the peace and calm of the moment<br/>
enter his soul. He knew well that he would need to hold such peace<br/>
deep inside his heart, to get both of them through the long, tiring,<br/>
and bloody days to come.<br/>
