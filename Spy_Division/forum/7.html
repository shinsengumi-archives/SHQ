Chapter 1<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto<br/>
Heisei 16 (2004), July 6th<br/>
<br/>
 "Governments may come and go, but Kyoto is eternally `the Capital',"<br/>
said Tokugawa Hirotada with a smile.<br/>
"Heian-kyothe Peaceful Capital," added his wife, Yuki.<br/>
The two of them were new to Kyoto. Out of a passion for their samurai<br/>
ancestry, as well as a desire to live the history they'd studied in<br/>
college, they had decided to establish themselves in Kyoto and pursue<br/>
a joint career in martial arts instruction and historical enacting.<br/>
Since the night was not too cold, they'd decided to get into character<br/>
a bit--put on traditional garb and walk the streets of Mibu, one of<br/>
the historic districts, for awhile.<br/>
 "Hiro-kun! Look! It's the Yagi estate!"<br/>
Hiro glanced over in the direction that she was pointing. Sure enough,<br/>
there was the Yagi estate, which had acquired quite a reputation<br/>
during the bloody Bakumatsu period in the 1860s, when the<br/>
Shinsengumi-- one of the shogunate's official police units in<br/>
Kyoto--set up their headquarters there. Seeing the gate open, Hiro<br/>
raised an eyebrow in curiosity. "Isn't this after their open hours?<br/>
Why is the gate open?" Even though he wasn't sure, something at the<br/>
extremities of his sensory perception feltamiss. Then again, there<br/>
was always something weird going on in Kyoto-- some commemoration,<br/>
celebration, or event that not everyone would hear about. Being a fan<br/>
of the Shinsengumi, he couldn't resist the urge to find out what was<br/>
going on.<br/>
"Want to check it out? At the very least we'll give the caretakers a<br/>
good shock," he said with a smile. Yuki nodded.<br/>
As they walked toward the gate of the Yagi mansion, the wind, which<br/>
had just been a gentle breeze only moments before, began to pick up.<br/>
Closer to the estate now, they could see what looked like a fire<br/>
burning in the inner courtyard. Hiro opened his mouth to say something<br/>
about the fire, when the wind's ferocity sharply increased, and the<br/>
world around seemed to darken.<br/>
Hiro didn't stop to think-- instincts honed during years of sword<br/>
training took over. Instinctively, he grabbed a hold of Yuki by the<br/>
shoulders and pulled her in quickly-- putting both arms around her and<br/>
holding her as close as he could.<br/>
"Hiro? What's going on?" she barely managed to shout over the wind.<br/>
"Hold me."<br/>
"What?"<br/>
"Just hold me!"<br/>
The wind shifted. Instead of blowing straight, it started twisting in<br/>
on itself, pushing the helpless couple around this way and that. A<br/>
word flashed through Hiro's mind, a word he didn't really believe and<br/>
didn't really like, but that seemed to be the closest thing to this<br/>
wind: kamikaze. Divine Tempest. Unable to consciously stand up to the<br/>
wind anymore, he closed his eyes and focused his entire being on the<br/>
one dearest to him, drawing courage from the gentle strength of her<br/>
embrace and the close warmth of her body. He felt her give a gentle<br/>
squeeze, as if to say, I love you. Don't ever let go of me <br/>
The wind, more untamed now, began to whistle shrilly, like a flute in<br/>
a Noh drama. Unwittingly, Hiro opened his eyes and saw that he was no<br/>
longer on the ground, but being spun through the air, faster and<br/>
faster and faster. The Yagi mansion wasn't really below, though. But<br/>
what he heard next made him forget about any of that.<br/>
I, Tokugawa Hirotada, take you, Matsumae Yuki, to be my<br/>
The wedding. That was in June-- why could he hear his words from the<br/>
ceremony?<br/>
Senzowa daijidakedo, kami wo shinjiru! I honor my ancestors, but I<br/>
believe in God!<br/>
His own voice, while arguing his new Christian faith with his father.<br/>
I'm Tokugawa Hirotada. Pleased to meet you, Yuki-dono.<br/>
The day he'd met Yuki<br/>
Tokugawa Hirotada, I pass this sword on to you, in honor of your<br/>
coming of age.<br/>
His father again-- giving him one of the family swords, the one made<br/>
by Yasutsugu XI, in honor of his coming of age ceremony.<br/>
We must endure the unendurable, bear the unbearable, and suffer the<br/>
unsufferable<br/>
Hearing his own voice, perhaps. But now Emperor Hirohito's voice?<br/>
Hijikata! Go, now! Go to Shonai and get reinforcements!<br/>
Hijikata? Reinforcements from Shonai? That could only be the voice of<br/>
Matsudaira Katamorilast lord of the Aizu domain in the 1860s, and<br/>
sponsor of the Shinsengumi...<br/>
The Shinsengumi<br/>
Hiro opened his eyes, and found himself looking at the hilt of a<br/>
sword. Following the hilt downward, he saw a blue overcoat, withwhite<br/>
mountain-shaped triangles on the sleeves. Blue overcoat, white<br/>
mountain-shaped triangles on the sleeves. The uniform of the<br/>
Shinsengumi? Butwhat would another historical enactor be doing out<br/>
thisearly? With his senses slowly returning to him, he found that it<br/>
was light again, probably around dawn. Butwhere was he? And<br/>
"Oi! Masuda-kun! Look what we've got here!"<br/>
The man who was looking over Hiro got up.<br/>
"Yeah?"<br/>
Two more men in Shinsengumi uniform held a very tired and<br/>
battered-looking Yuki up by her arms.<br/>
"Ah, so the flowers are blooming early this year? Don't worry, fellas,<br/>
we can enjoy their fragrance just as well." He rubbed his palms<br/>
together nefariously. "We can each have a turn"<br/>
The first of Yuki's screams suddenly snapped Hiro's senses back into<br/>
full focus. Rolling himself up to his knees, he saw the three men, all<br/>
in Shinsengumi uniform, trying to rip her kimono off. Hiro's right<br/>
hand automatically went to his left hip, but then he remembered that<br/>
he was obviously not armed. But he had no choicehe rose to his feet.<br/>
Quietly, he closed the distance between himself and Masudafinally<br/>
coming right behind him, he wrapped an arm around the man's neck and<br/>
jerked it sharply to the right. With his free hand, he grabbed the<br/>
hilt of Masuda's sword and yanked it out of the sheath. Masuda fell<br/>
with a yelp, startling his accomplices.<br/>
"M-Masuda-kun?!"<br/>
Hiro stood over Masuda's corpse. Now armed and ready to fight, he<br/>
raised the sword into a high guard stance.<br/>
"W-Who the heck are you?!" they choked out in fear and alarm.<br/>
"You're about to die, so knowing my name is useless to you."<br/>
"Bah! Just a wastrel ronin! Let's get `im!" The men threw Yuki down to<br/>
the ground. Drawing their swords they lunged at Hiro, hoping to<br/>
overtake him by speed. He sideswept one man, yanked him downward with<br/>
his free hand, and kicked him toward the other one. The two of them<br/>
instantly went down with a thud, their swords clattering to the ground<br/>
loudly.<br/>
"Get up!" Hiro snarled, kicking them mercilessly. "Get up!"<br/>
One of them managed to grab his own sword, and tried to get up. He<br/>
turned his gaze upward just in time to see Hiro's sword descend in a<br/>
shimmering arcspattering the other man with his blood. The other<br/>
threw himself at Hiro's feet, whimpering pitifully. "Please! Please!<br/>
Don't kill me! I didn' mean no harm! We was just out drinkin', that's<br/>
all! Please!"<br/>
Hiro couldn't hear him in his blind rage. He picked the man up by the<br/>
collar and held him off the ground. Raising his sword, he readied to<br/>
stab the man, just as--<br/>
"You! Drop the sword!"<br/>
He dropped the man instead, and spun on his heel, coming face to face<br/>
with another man in Shinsengumi uniform, with about a dozen others<br/>
behind him, all armed-- all with swords, some also with spears and<br/>
halberds.<br/>
"Drop the sword," repeated the man, obviously the leader in the group.<br/>
He was of medium-height, firm build, and had a sharp, piercing gaze<br/>
like that of a wolf.<br/>
"These...these men, whoever they are, were raping my wife. You have no<br/>
right to tell me to drop the sword! I will kill them!"<br/>
"I know who these men are," retorted the other man sharply. "And I<br/>
know their reputation. I happen to be their commander. Now drop the<br/>
sword and let me deal with them."<br/>
Hiro let the sword drop from his hand. He was pushed aside by the<br/>
large group behind the wolf-eyed man, some of whom rushed forward to<br/>
bind the wrists of the survivor, while others checked to make sure<br/>
that the other two were dead.<br/>
"What about your wife?" asked the wolf-eyed man. "Forgot about her so<br/>
quickly?"<br/>
Blushing red with embarrassment and shame, he rushed over to Yuki, who<br/>
was sobbing uncontrollably and trying to cover herself with the<br/>
tattered remnants of her kimono. Gently, Hiro laid a hand on her<br/>
shoulder. She looked up and suddenly threw her arms around him.<br/>
Closing his own suddenly tear-filled eyes, he gently rocked her back<br/>
and forth, trying to calm her down.<br/>
"Come with me, both of you."<br/>
It was the wolf-eyed man again.<br/>
"Huh? Where?"<br/>
"Don't you know where anything is? To the Shinsengumi headquarters at<br/>
the Yagi mansion! My superiors will need to hear about what happened<br/>
in order to deal properly with Onoda there." He gestured toward the<br/>
survivor.<br/>
Shinsengumi headquarters? But that would meanHiro shook his head in<br/>
disbelief. Divine Wind, indeed<br/>
"Don't worry, we'll have our doctor tend to any wounds you or your<br/>
wife may have. It's idiots like Onoda and Masuda who give us the name<br/>
`wolves'. We're actually quite concerned with the welfare of the<br/>
common people in this city."<br/>
Gently helping Yuki to her feet, Hiro followed the wolf-eyed man.<br/>

Chapter 2<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto<br/>
Genji 1 (1864), June 20th<br/>
<br/>
As Hiro found out, he and Yuki hadn't landed far from the Yagi<br/>
estate-- probably only about a couple blocks away. He was glad they<br/>
were that close, for Yuki's sake, as she didn't seem too likely to be<br/>
in a calm enough state to hike very far.<br/>
His first impression at realizing where he was, was that the 1860s<br/>
didn't smell as good as he'd imagined. Despite the extreme cleanliness<br/>
and cautious sanitation common to any major Japanese city of those<br/>
days, there was still the smell of dirt and mud in the air. The sky<br/>
seemed bluer, though, and the visibility was excellent. He'd read all<br/>
about it in his college textbooks, heard all about it from his<br/>
family's stories, but he'd never imagined it to be sooverpoweringly<br/>
real. He was there, in the textbooks, as history was being written,<br/>
walking the streets with a troop of samurai. If the situation weren't<br/>
so grave, and the era not so bloody, he might actually have taken the<br/>
time to better soak in the atmosphere.<br/>
"Here we are. Shinsengumi headquarters," said the wolf-eyed man,<br/>
indicating the gateway with a tilt of his head. "Please follow me."<br/>
As he led them through the gate, Hiro remembered the force that had<br/>
brought them here, and felt a chill run down his spine. Gritting his<br/>
teeth, he did his best to put the past behind him, and followed the<br/>
wolf-eyed man into the main courtyard.<br/>
"Welcome back, Saitou-san!" called a man who had just emerged from one<br/>
of the rooms. He was about the same height as wolf-eyes-- Saitou-- but<br/>
looked much younger, with childlike features, almost too young to be<br/>
holding the katana in his left hand.<br/>
"No time for that, Okita-kun! Go get the doctor, and tell Hijikata-san<br/>
that I have business with him." Okita nodded curtly, and dashed off,<br/>
returning momentarily with the Yagi family doctor and a couple of<br/>
maids, before dashing off in the other direction to find Hijikata.<br/>
"Clean this woman up and check her for any injuries if you would,<br/>
sensei." He nodded, and gestured for Hiro to let go. "It'll be<br/>
alright," Saitou reassured him. "Don't worry. She's in good hands."<br/>
Reluctantly-- very reluctantly-- Hiro let go of Yuki, who was promptly<br/>
led away by the doctor and maids.<br/>
"Don't worry," Saitou repeated, bringing Hiro back to full attention.<br/>
"Now let's go see Hijikata-san, and clear this business of Masuda's<br/>
people up."<br/>
"Yyes of course, Saitou-san." As the mist cleared from his mind, Hiro<br/>
put two and two together. Saitoua leader in the ShinsengumiSaitou<br/>
Hajime! The legendary Shinsengumi third unit captain! And Okitamust<br/>
be Okita Souji, the first unit captain! And HijikataHiro shivered in<br/>
mild horror at the name. Hijikata Toshizou Yoshitoyo, the Shinsengumi<br/>
vice-commander and "demon". Originally the son of the farmer, he was<br/>
adopted into a samurai family, and soon became an expert at<br/>
swordsmanship. Known for his cold and cruel manner of leadership, he<br/>
was feared by all, friend and foe alike-- and yet, loyal to the last,<br/>
he fought to the very end of the Bakumatsu period, finally dying of a<br/>
gunshot wound at the Battle of Matsumae Castle in Hokkaido. That day,<br/>
however, lay some five years into the future.<br/>
Saitou halted abruptly next to a sliding door, and slid it open with<br/>
one hand, bowing. "Hijikata-san. Sorry to keep you waiting." He nodded<br/>
to Hiro, and they entered together. "Saitou-san. Have a seat, please.<br/>
You as well," Hijikata said, motioning to Hiro, who sat along Saitou,<br/>
facing the vice-commander.<br/>
"Now, what did you do about those three idiots?" asked the<br/>
vice-commander abruptly. That's something the historians were right<br/>
about, thought Hiro. Hijikata's cold, cruel, calculating, and to the<br/>
point<br/>
"We heard they were out drinking and causing trouble nearby. However,<br/>
we hadn't counted on this man being there." Saitou pointed at Hiro.<br/>
"Masuda and the others tried raping his wife, and he killed two of the<br/>
men in retaliation. We got there just in time and managed to stop him<br/>
from killing Onoda."<br/>
Hijikata stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Onoda will pay duly for his<br/>
crimehe has violated the first rule of our code, by behaving in a<br/>
manner unbecoming a warrior." He turned his cold gaze toward Hiro.<br/>
"Now, tell me who you are, and why, if you are indeed a samurai, you<br/>
have no swords."<br/>
Hiro studied Hijikata intently, while trying to come up with a<br/>
coherent, believable answer that wouldn't get him instantly killed.<br/>
The books were right-- he really was tall, almost above average.<br/>
Unlike his only surviving photograph, where his hair lay untied, down<br/>
to chin length, it was tied up in a neat topknot. His features were<br/>
firm and commanding, exuding a twofold aura of immaculacy and<br/>
coldness. His photograph showed him wearing a Western-style suit, but<br/>
seeing him here, dressed in a wide-sleeved kimono and crisp, clean<br/>
gray trousers was more real, more powerful, in a way.<br/>
He knew well that he couldn't say who he really was, especially<br/>
because someone of his clan, no matter what their rank, wouldn't be<br/>
wandering the streets of Kyoto in this era, especially not without a<br/>
sizable escort. But he couldn't think of any other convincing alias.<br/>
Finally, using the intricacies and seemingly endless variations of<br/>
Japanese names to his advantage, he decided to tell the truthpartly.<br/>
"I am Tokugawa Hirotada."<br/>
Hijikata's face visibly became pale.<br/>
Hiro knew exactly what he was thinking: For members of the Shinsengumi<br/>
to have broken the rules was bad, but for them to have done what they<br/>
did to a relative of the shogun might cost him his very head <br/>
"Spelled with different letters than that of the Shogun's name. As for<br/>
my swords" Hiro heard himself make up a story that even he partly<br/>
didn't believe: he'd been befriended by Masuda at a local teahouse,<br/>
and had promptly begun drinking with him. Somehow, Masuda had drugged<br/>
Hiro's drink, knocking him unconscious, during which time he'd stolen<br/>
Hiro's swords. Then Hiro had woken up in the street, seen Masuda and<br/>
two other people trying to rape his wife, who'd come looking for him.<br/>
Seeking to save his wife and defend his honor, Hiro had no choice but<br/>
to kill Masuda and the other man, after which point Saitou had stopped<br/>
him. He also added that he demanded a new pair of swords in return for<br/>
the ones that Masuda had stolen.<br/>
"And," he added, rather impulsively, "I'd like to join Shinsengumi."<br/>
Hijikata eyed him carefully for a moment, stroking his chin pensively<br/>
again. "Tokugawa-san, I will grant your request for a new pair of<br/>
swords, as I am eager to make amends for the actions of these fools.<br/>
However, to join Shinsengumi, you must pass an entrance exam, in which<br/>
you must engage in a mock duel with one of the upper-ranking members,<br/>
such as myself, Saitou-san, or Okita-kun. Do you consider yourself<br/>
willing to go through with it?"<br/>
Hiro knew all about the Shinsengumi's entrance exam-- how it involved<br/>
facing off in a practice duel with one of the chief captainsand that<br/>
though he didn't need to win to gain entrance, he would quite probably<br/>
end up with broken bones. If successful, he also knew well that he ran<br/>
the risk of getting killed, especially in the tumultuous war and<br/>
defeat of the shogunate that loomed just over the horizon. Hiro almost<br/>
pitied these men for not knowing what would happen to themthat Okita<br/>
would die in a hospital, a victim of tuberculosis at age 25, that<br/>
Hijikata would die in battle in Hokkaido, and that Saitou would die of<br/>
old age in the dawn of the 20th century, the victim of an<br/>
alcohol-induced stomach ulcer. But despite all the history, the risks,<br/>
the names, dates, and places involved, he guessed that he was probably<br/>
in this time period to stay, and that if he was to provide for his<br/>
wife, he had to have a stable job and a place to live. Which the<br/>
Shinsengumi did offer its members<br/>
There was more to consider, as well. Assuming he survived the violent<br/>
bloodletting of the Bakumatsu period, he had very little to no chance<br/>
of getting anywhere in the imminent Meiji government which<br/>
subsequently arosesince he wouldn't be able to explain his origin,<br/>
and since he had chosen to ally himself with his ancestors' collapsing<br/>
order and government. But he had no choice. Shinsengumi was the only<br/>
way to go. "Yes," he said, staring straight into Hijikata's eyes, and<br/>
doing his best not to flinch. "Yes, I am willing."<br/>
Hijikata cleared his throat. After quietly thinking to himself for a<br/>
moment, he nodded curtly. "I see. Very good." He raised his tone.<br/>
"Okita-san?"<br/>
The sliding door glided open, and Okita bowed politely. "Yes?"<br/>
"Get this man a new pair of swords immediately. See to it that he also<br/>
gets a bath and a decent meal. At noon, he duels me." Okita nodded,<br/>
looking somewhat amused at Hiro's shocked expression. Hijikata turned<br/>
back to Hiro. "Tokugawa-san, you're free to go."<br/>
Hiro bowed, all the way to the floor mats. "Thank you, Hijikata-sama."<br/>
"Come on," urged Okita, smiling. Hiro got up and followed, heartened<br/>
by Okita's calm demeanor.<br/>
Hijikata closed his eyes until Hiro left, and then, when he was sure<br/>
that they were gone and fully out of earshot, turned to Saitou. "Do<br/>
you trust his story?"<br/>
"Partly. Masuda definitely tried to rape his wife, but the story about<br/>
the swords seemed made-up"<br/>
"Hm." Hijikata nodded. "Still, whether he's lying or not, we lost two<br/>
people today. And from what you tell me about the way he fights,<br/>
taking him in is an acceptable risk. We need people who fight like that."<br/>
He paused a moment, thinking about how Hiro had fought for his wife.<br/>
He'd seen different people fight for different things, but had never<br/>
heard of a man who fought for love. Not like this"And besides," he<br/>
added, "once he swears the blood oath to uphold the Shinsengumi code,<br/>
we'll see just how much a man of his word Tokugawa-san is."<br/>
Saitou nodded quietly. "Agreed. That always does show who the most<br/>
loyal members are."<br/>
"If he does make it in, then I'd like to start him off in your unit,<br/>
and then maybe move him up to the 2nd unit. If he really proves<br/>
himself, I might consider putting him in the first unitbut we'll see."<br/>
"By all means," said Saitou. "I'd definitely like to see him in action<br/>
again-- against revolutionary samurai this time. We need that kind of<br/>
energy on our side."<br/>
Hijikata allowed himself a small, tired sigh. "Agreed."<br/>
"I'm also curious to see what the commander will think of him," added<br/>
Saitou.<br/>
"Kondou-san? We'll see. He isn't quick to commenting on skill until he<br/>
sees it with his own eyes." Saitou nodded in agreement.<br/>
Hijikata rose to his feet. "Well then, if you'll excuse me,<br/>
Saitou-san, I have to go prepare for a duel."</div>

<br/>
Chapter 3<br/>
<br/>
After being given a clean bill of health by the doctor and a long,<br/>
healing bath, Yuki was helped out to the courtyard, where she'd been<br/>
told Hiro was to duel Hijikata for entrance into Shinsengumi. Herself<br/>
a martial arts instructor, she was well familiar with Hijikata's<br/>
legendary mastery of his style, Tennen Rishin Ryuu. Hiro probably<br/>
didn't stand a chancethough a senior instructor of the Tokugawa<br/>
family's branch of Owari Yagyu Shinkage Ryuu swordsmanship, there was<br/>
a fundamental difference between his and Hijikata's attitude towards<br/>
the sword: Hiro knew it as a means of self-discipline and protection,<br/>
while Hijikata, like most samurai, ultimately took it as a weapon of<br/>
war. Hiro may have killed two people that morning, but Hijikata had<br/>
probably been doing so for at least the last year that he'd been in<br/>
Kyoto, and probably long before.<br/>
It was still a bit unbelievable to Yuki that they were now in Kyoto in<br/>
the middle of the Bakumatsu period. The atmosphere, sounds, sights,<br/>
and smells were exactly how she'd imagined it, but more surreal.<br/>
Everything had a bright, wondrous aura about it, making her feel like<br/>
she was seeing the world through new eyes. Everything, from the<br/>
blueness of the sky all the way down to her new light-green kimono<br/>
with the darker green brocade obi, was bright and beautiful. Eager to<br/>
forget about what had happened to her in the morning, she focused her<br/>
entire attention on that sense of wonder and awe.<br/>
Hiro and Okita finally emerged from one of the rooms. Yuki saw the new<br/>
swords that her husband wore, and smiled. He'd finally managed to live<br/>
out his dreamto be a samurai in the age of samurai, instead of being<br/>
an anachronism in the modern age. Okita, walking next to him, carried<br/>
a suit of practice armor and a bamboo sword. Unable to restrain<br/>
herself, Yuki strode over to them.<br/>
"Hiro-kun?"<br/>
Hiro jerked upright at the sound of her voice. Turning on his heel, he<br/>
saw her, and tried to protest. Yuki simply put a finger to his lips,<br/>
and smiled.<br/>
"I'm here to help you get ready."<br/>
Without waiting for a response, she took the breastplate from Okita<br/>
and started tying it into place.<br/>
"YukiI"<br/>
After tying the protective apron up, she undid the sash of his katana,<br/>
and took it carefully.<br/>
"I'll hold this for you."<br/>
He nodded quietly, and took her hand, holding it up to his cheek. On<br/>
the inside, she ached to be held, and knew that he probably wanted to<br/>
do so just as badly. Both of them restrained themselves. They knew<br/>
very well what the social constraints of the age were, and how open<br/>
display of affection was considered "improper" and "barbaric". Yuki<br/>
could feel that Hiro wanted to say something deep and romantic, but<br/>
instead, seemed to be content with two words.<br/>
"Thank you."<br/>
She didn't need to answer. Giving him a short bow, she stepped back to<br/>
where the maids and serving women stood. <br/>
"Fine man ya got there, Yuki-han," said one of the maids<br/>
enthusiastically, in the fast-paced Kansai accent characteristic of<br/>
natives of the Kyoto area.<br/>
"Yes" she sighed wistfully.<br/>
Once Okita helped Hiro tie the helmet into place, it was time to<br/>
begin. Hiro and Hijikata had moved into their starting positions<br/>
opposite each other. Kondou Isami, the commander of the Shinsengumi,<br/>
stood between and a safe distance back from them, acting as the referee.<br/>
"Ready?" called Kondou. Both combatants nodded. "Begin!"<br/>
Yuki could hear the collective gasp among the onlookers when Hiro<br/>
moved into a jodan stancesword angling backwards, held over his head.<br/>
The jodan stance was the most aggressive stance in all Japanese<br/>
swordsmanship, the equivalent of shouting You want a piece of me? by<br/>
way of posture. Consequently, to take a jodan stance against Hijikata<br/>
Toshizou, even in a practice duel, was seen as a brash and<br/>
unrestrained challenge of authority.<br/>
Try as she could, Yuki couldn't read Hijikata's intention or direction<br/>
at all. The man was an utter enigma, not allowing any opening<br/>
whatsoever. Truly worthy of the appellation of "demon"<br/>
Suddenly, Hijikata began moving to the side a bit, probably only to<br/>
test Hiro's reaction, but illiciting none. Hiro simply stayed in<br/>
jodan, facing the vice-commander, looking him as straight in the eyes<br/>
as possible without letting his blood curdle from fearand then it<br/>
happened. Hijikata bolted, dashing straight in toward Hiro with a<br/>
tremendous kiai, a vocal projection of inner force, moving quickly<br/>
behind the shout with the linear, frontal assault style that was the<br/>
hallmark of Tennen Rishin Ryuu.<br/>
Yuki gasped. Hiro seemed frozen in place, somehow transfixed by the<br/>
sight of Hijikata rushing him, coming closer and closer and closer,<br/>
his aura somehow inducing a total paralysis. Suddenly, he seemed to<br/>
regain control of his senses, and stepped out of the way, forcing<br/>
Hijikata to quickly stick out a foot and halt his forward momentum,<br/>
spinning around and facing Hiro again with a growl.<br/>
Now Hijikata moved into a jodan stance, more out of rage than anything<br/>
else. Hiro moved to chudan stance, and tried staring his opponent down.<br/>
"You're a fool if you think you can defeat me!" snarled Hijikata.<br/>
Keeping his sword high, he tilted it forward. Then he vanishedHiro<br/>
lifted his sword quickly to a vertical kasumi stance to protect his<br/>
face and torso, just when Hijikata reappeared right in front of him,<br/>
delivering a diagonal kesa-giri slash that sent Hiro and his sword<br/>
flying in opposite directions. Yuki bit her lip, stifling the urge to<br/>
run to him and block Hijikata's next attack with her own body.<br/>
Suddenly, though, Hiro stuck an arm out and rolled backward, quickly<br/>
dashing back up and running for his sword. He grabbed it just in time,<br/>
right when Hijikata tried to make a final, decisive slash, bringing it<br/>
up to meet the vice-commander's weapon. The two of them seemed fixed<br/>
in place, frozen somehowand then Hiro let loose a tremendous kiai,<br/>
sweeping Hijikata's sword to one side, and then sweeping back upward<br/>
toward his headjust when Hijikata jerked his sword up and stopped<br/>
inches from Hiro's throat.<br/>
"Aiuchi! A tie!" called Kondou. Both of them slowly lowered their<br/>
weapons, and bowed to each other. Yuki let out a sigh of relief. So<br/>
her Hiro had survived after all<br/>
"Why're you so red all of a sudden, Yuki-han?" asked another one of<br/>
the serving women, a girl probably around fourteen years of age.<br/>
"Ohme? Blushing? No, far from it!" she said, trying to act the part<br/>
of the brave, steady samurai wife. The women snickered to themselves,<br/>
amused at her awkwardness.<br/>
She walked over to where Hiro stood, being helped out of his armor by<br/>
Okita.<br/>
"Your sword," Yuki announced. As she held it out to him with both<br/>
hands, she realized that her grip on it had been very tight. Yuki<br/>
remembered the old sayingthe sword is the soul of the samuraiand<br/>
smiled. So she'd been able to hold a part of Hiro, after all<br/>
"Ah. Thank you, Yuki-chan." He received the katana with both hands and<br/>
tied it back into place at his left hip, next to his short sword.<br/>
"This your wife?" asked Kondou.<br/>
"Yes, Kondou-sama," answered Hiro, not being able to help smiling.<br/>
"I'm Matsumae Yuki," she said quietly, and bowed low, as was<br/>
appropriate for a woman of those days.<br/>
"She's a good cook, and quite skilled with the naginata (halberd) and<br/>
kodachi (short sword)."<br/>
Kondou laughed. "Well, it sounds like we'll have good use for someone<br/>
of her talents. But for now, Tokugawa-san, there is something you must<br/>
do." Pulling a piece of paper from inside the sleeve of his kimono, he<br/>
read, in an official voice:<br/>
"Tokugawa Hirotada. As a new member of the Shinsengumi, you must swear<br/>
by the following rules:<br/>
First, never to deviate from the Way of the Samurai.<br/>
Second, never to abandon the Shinsengumi.<br/>
Third, never to raise money selfishly.<br/>
Fourth, to never engage in private lawsuits.<br/>
Fifth, not to engage in petty quarrels.<br/>
Sixth, to fight and die on the spot, should your unit captain be<br/>
killed in combat.<br/>
Seventh, to not go back for the body of any member of any unit except<br/>
the unit captain, whether the death toll is low or high.<br/>
And finally, whether on duty or not, to immediately commit seppuku,<br/>
should you engage an enemy in single combat and fail to kill him. Do<br/>
you swear to live by these rules?"<br/>
Hiro swallowed hard, and nodded.<br/>
"Well then, sign in blood," answered Kondou, holding out the paper.<br/>
Yuki looked on as Hiro pulled out his short sword a bit, exposing the<br/>
blade. He pricked his right thumb on the cold steel, and when he saw<br/>
the blood seep from the cut, he stuck his thumb out, and pressed down<br/>
firmly on the paper.<br/>
"Tokugawa Hirotada," said Hijikata coldly, finishing for Kondou, "you<br/>
have pledged in blood to honor these rules. Welcome to the Shinsengumi."</div>

Chapter 4<br/>
<br/>
	Out on patrol, Hiro had to do his best to keep from grinning like an<br/>
idiot. He still couldn't believe his eyeshe was on patrol in Kyoto<br/>
with the Shinsengumi, wearing the blue overcoat with white<br/>
mountain-shaped triangles on the sleeves, wearing swords like his<br/>
samurai ancestors, and walking in step with Saitou Hajime's 3rd Unit.<br/>
He let the whole experience, the atmosphere and all the sights,<br/>
sounds, and smells of Kyoto, sink in.<br/>
	As he walked, he let his eyes wander around. Kyoto in these days was<br/>
nothing like he'd ever seen in photographseven the surviving<br/>
buildings from the period didn't look this good, this clean. The day<br/>
was calm, making the city, even in these bloody days, seem worthy of<br/>
the name "Peaceful Capital". Hiro also noticed, with some degree of<br/>
amusement, that anywhere the unit went, people would entirely clear<br/>
the street, some going so far as to even avert their eyes. We're so<br/>
good, we're badhe thought with a chuckle.<br/>
	Saitou ordered the unit to halt. When Hiro noticed where they were,<br/>
he stopped smiling. In all the excitement, he'd never asked the date.<br/>
Now he suddenly knewJune 20, 1864. This was the date of the pivotal<br/>
arrest that took place here, at the Masuya used clothing store.<br/>
	With a sweep of his hand, Saitou ordered the unit to surround the<br/>
building, cutting off all possible routes of escape. Hiro began moving<br/>
toward one of the groups, but Saitou motioned him back to the front.<br/>
So I'm still being tested, thought Hiro, as he joined the four men who<br/>
were with the captain. After a couple of uneasy moments, they<br/>
announced themselves.<br/>
	"We are the Shinsengumi!" called Saitou. "By order of the Kyoto<br/>
Military Commission, we wish to speak with the owner of this shop!"<br/>
	A short man with furtive, darting eyes stepped forward.<br/>
	"I'm Masuya Kiemon.You want something?" he drawled, in Japanese heavy<br/>
with a southern accent, much like the accent characteristic of the<br/>
American south. The shopworkers, who all seemed to have a similar air<br/>
about them, suddenly tensed up.<br/>
"We've received reports of rebel activity around here. Have<br/>
younoticed anything?"<br/>
	In what seemed like a matter of seconds, half a dozen concealed<br/>
blades were pointed at Saitou and his group.<br/>
	I guess that answers the question, thought Hiro darkly.<br/>
	"Don't make me laugh," sighed Saitou, slowly bringing his hand toward<br/>
the hilt of his sword. "You Ishin dogs are only going to make it worse<br/>
for yourselves."<br/>
	"Get `im, boys," growled Masuya.<br/>
	Hiro didn't wait for someone to come at him. Drawing his sword, he<br/>
gritted his teeth and went toward the nearest enemy. He tried to do<br/>
his best to focus on the battle, and not on the fact that his sword,<br/>
which he believed was "life-giving" and protective, was actually being<br/>
used to kill. Rebel extremists or not, killing was killing.<br/>
	Moments later, the rest of the Third squad poured in through the<br/>
other entrances, quickly crushing any resistance. Soon Masuya was left<br/>
alone, standing amidst the bodies of his associates, with over two<br/>
dozen swords pointed at him.<br/>
	"Surrender," said Saitou, glaring at him with his piercing, wolf-eyed<br/>
gaze. Masuya quietly held his hands up in the air, palms facing<br/>
outward. Someone found some rope, and quickly bound his hands. Another<br/>
patrolman searched him thoroughly for any hidden weapons. When all was<br/>
secure, Saitou nodded.<br/>
	"Two people go and notify the Military Commission about what<br/>
happened, five people stay here as a guard until they get here. The<br/>
rest of you come with me to the Maekawa estate."	Hiro bobbed his head<br/>
respectfully, and followed Saitou's group.<br/>
************<br/>
The 3rd Unit arrived at the Maekawa estatethe "other" Shinsengumi<br/>
headquartersrather quickly. It seemed that Hijikata was already<br/>
there, and had been waiting for some time. After Saitou delivered a<br/>
face-to-face report, he handed Masuya over to Hijikata. Then the two<br/>
Shinsengumi leaders and the prisoner, as well as a couple of other<br/>
membeers not from the 3rd unit, entered the small building in the back<br/>
of the estate, and shut the doors. The interrogation of Masuya Kiemon<br/>
had begun.<br/>
The 3rd Unit sat around the estate idly, eating rice balls and sweets,<br/>
talking, catnapping, and in general, resting their feet after a long<br/>
day out on the streets. It was a good thing that the interrogation<br/>
room had been built as a storage buildingthe walls and doors were<br/>
thicker than usual, and thus blocked out any sounds of agony that<br/>
undoubtedly accompanied any interrogation by Hijikata Toshizou.<br/>
Hiro quietly munched on a rice ball and thought to what was happening<br/>
in the interrogation with disgust. History books on the Shinsengumi,<br/>
as well as accounts of Hijikata himself, seemed to be very good about<br/>
recounting this incident.<br/>
Hijikata had Masuya hung by his ankles by the ceiling. After letting<br/>
the blood flow into the man's head until he lost feeling in his legs,<br/>
Hijikata started to interrogate him, firing question after question at<br/>
his victim. Masuya wouldn't answercouldn't answer. Hijikata beat him<br/>
repeatedly, until his skin was raw and bleeding, and still Masuya said<br/>
nothing. Finally, exasperated, Hijikata had metal spikes driven<br/>
through the soles of the man's feet, and had placed lit candles on the<br/>
protruding part of each spike. Only when the hot wax dripped into the<br/>
open wounds in his soles did Masuya start talking.<br/>
First of all, he admitted that Masuya Kiemon was a pseudonym. He was<br/>
actually a samurai of the Ishin Shishi named Furutaka Shuntarou<br/>
Masayasu. Masquerading as a Kyoto merchant, he had slowly helped amass<br/>
a large arsenalonlu one of several which were to be used in this<br/>
attack. As it turned out, the Ishin Shishi were planning massive<br/>
action in Kyoto. Around the Gion Festival in mid-July, they planned to<br/>
execute a plan so inhuman, so cruel, that even Hijikata apparently<br/>
didn't believe his ears at first. They would secretly set fire to a<br/>
district north of the Imperial Palace and allow the wind to spread the<br/>
fire rapidly. In the ensuing conflagration, they would kill as many of<br/>
the Shinsengumi and related shogunate forces as possible, and to top<br/>
it all off, they were going to kidnap Emperor Komei and whisk him off<br/>
to Choshuu, the domain which was at the forefront of the<br/>
anti-shogunate movement, and with the "approval" of the Emperor,<br/>
"reinstate" the Imperial government. Hijikata had wanted to find out<br/>
more, but at that point, almost mercifully, Furutaka Shuntarou<br/>
Masayasu had died from a combination of blood loss and exhaustion. But<br/>
the Shinsengumi had found out the rest of the story through their spy<br/>
network, and ended up stopping the plot in the first week of July, at<br/>
the Battle of Ikedaya...<br/>
At the thought of Ikedaya, Hiro closed the mental textbook and thought<br/>
of reality. He knew that the Battle of Ikedaya lasted an entire night,<br/>
and that there were several Shinsengumi dead, as well as some people<br/>
who were wounded so badly they would never be able to see or wield a<br/>
sword again. He thought of how he might be one of those casualties, of<br/>
how Yuki would probably suffer in such a familiar yet alien time, of<br/>
how she'd be alienated because of her "modern" approach to life<br/>
"Getting ahead of ourselves, aren't we?" he muttered, giving himself a<br/>
slap to the forehead. "One day at a time"<br/>
"Neh, Tokugawa-san," said one of his fellow 3rd unit patrolmen. "We've<br/>
been on patrol all day, and haven't had any time to ask you about<br/>
yourself"<br/>
"Oh. Yes, I suppose that's right," said Hiro, scratching his head in<br/>
embarrassment.<br/>
"Where are you from?" asked a man sitting next to him. "I can't<br/>
tellyour accent isvague."<br/>
As with Hijikata that morning, Hiro decided to tell part of the truth.<br/>
"Well, I was born in Mito, but my father was a wandering swordsman, so<br/>
I've been all around the country, training at various schools. None of<br/>
the schools of the major styles though. Come to think of it," he<br/>
added, "traveling from school to school was how I ended up meeting my<br/>
wife, up at a naginata school in northern Honshu"<br/>
"Skilled with the `spear' and sword, eh, Tokugawa-san?" someone burst out.<br/>
"Ha, ha. Very funny."<br/>
"She is quite a sight, though," said someone else, around a mouthful<br/>
of rice balls.<br/>
A shout interrupted them.<br/>
"1st Unit is here! 1st Unit is here!"<br/>
The 3rd Unit condensed themselves, moving closer together to give room<br/>
to the newcomers. Hiro looked them over. Being the first unit, they<br/>
were the unspoken objects of the envy of perhaps every other unit of<br/>
the Shinsengumi. He'd thought it only had to do with the fact that<br/>
their captain was Okita Souji, but now, having gotten a good look at<br/>
them, it seemed like every one of the men of that unit was an object<br/>
of envy, as wellthey seemed cleaner, taller, and stronger than the<br/>
3rd Unit.<br/>
Suddenly, Saitou emerged from the interrogation room, quickly slipping<br/>
out and closing the door behind him. He had his eyes shut and was<br/>
shaking his head in quiet disbelief. Tugging smartly at his haori, he<br/>
moved over to his unit.<br/>
 "Alright, let's head back to the Yagi mansion, everyone!"<br/>
Everyone quickly got up and formed two lines. One of the men on the<br/>
right raised the Shinsengumi flag. Though none of them had trained in<br/>
Western military drill exercises, the beat of their march was more<br/>
constant a cadence than any Hiro had heard in his life. He did his<br/>
best to keep his step in time with the others.<br/>
Though still in disgust at the interrogation, and still doubtful about<br/>
the future, Hiro nonetheless felt a sense of accomplishment. He'd<br/>
saved Yuki's life, joined Shinsengumi, helped apprehend a rebel, had<br/>
fought side-by-side with one of the most famous swordsmen of the age,<br/>
and was on his way to gaining respect from his fellow patrolmen.<br/>
All in all, he'd had a good day.</div>

Chapter 5<br/>
<br/>
	Work done for the time being, Yuki sat leaning against a pillar on<br/>
the veranda and sighed tiredly. The day had been quite a long one, and<br/>
the work, be it cleaning, cooking, or washing, never seemed to get<br/>
done. To top it off, there were some off-duty patrolmen who seemed to<br/>
like shadowing her and the other women, so Yuki remained guarded and<br/>
alert. Tired of the day's concerns, though, she focused on the mist.<br/>
The view into the courtyard reminded her of the 11th century<br/>
literature she'd studied in college. In those days, Kyoto was the<br/>
center of the vibrant Heian court culture, which remained one of the<br/>
most well-known periods of Japanese history, primarily because of the<br/>
sheer volume of writing done by the women of the court, including such<br/>
famous names as Sei Shonagon and Lady Murasaki. As Yuki recalled, one<br/>
of the favored poetic devices of the Heian court ladies was the<br/>
mistusually used in reference to the mist shrouding a departing<br/>
lover's receding figure. Just like how it shrouded the path that Hiro<br/>
took, earlier today she thought. The more things change, the more<br/>
they stay the same<br/>
	Yuki's consciousness started drifting. The rhythm of the raindrops,<br/>
gently striking the roof of the veranda and the flat, worn stones of<br/>
the courtyard, had a nearly hypnotic effect on her. She closed her<br/>
eyes, and would've fallen asleep had the guards at the gate not made<br/>
their timely announcement.<br/>
	"3rd Unit is here! 3rd Unit is here!"<br/>
	She'd wanted to hear those words all day. Suddenly, a poem from those<br/>
bygone days of the Heian court leapt to mind<br/>
	Faintly I saw you<br/>
a man spied for an instant<br/>
as through the morning mist.<br/>
And yet I fear that I may die,<br/>
so clear is the love that I feel.<br/>
Yuki managed to get to her feet and give the customary bow, just as<br/>
the soaked samurai of Saitou's unit came through the gate. Once safely<br/>
within the compound, they all made a dash for the dry safety of the<br/>
surrounding rooms and the veranda. She caught sight of Hiro as he made<br/>
it onto to the veranda. Shaking the moisture off his new blue and<br/>
white haori, he approached her.<br/>
	"Tadaima. I'm home."<br/>
	"Okaerinasai, Hiro-kun. Welcome back."<br/>
	She leaned forward, and quickly whispered in his ear.<br/>
	"Meet me behind the kitchen tonight."<br/>
	He nodded.<br/>
I was hoping you'd say thathe thought. We need to talk<br/>
********<br/>
	The rain tapered off a couple hours later, after sunset, leaving the<br/>
ground moist and the air slightly humid. Hiro didn't notice at first,<br/>
being rather occupied with sharing drinks with his fellow 3rd Unit<br/>
members in one of the smaller rooms.<br/>
"Hey guysdidn't the rain stop?"<br/>
	The men paused for a moment, and listened closely, some halting cups<br/>
of sake halfway in order to discern the lull that always follows a<br/>
steady rain.<br/>
	"So it did" mumbled someone. "Aw great, now it'll be humid"<br/>
	They all glanced at each other for a moment.<br/>
	"At least that'll keep those Choshuu dogs off the streets for awhile!"<br/>
	The entire room burst out in raucous laughter.<br/>
	"Yeah! That way, maybe they'll sweat to death, and that'll take care<br/>
of them at last! `Topple the Shogunate' this, you dirty slobs!"<br/>
	"Hear, hear!" Everyone downed their cups of sake in hearty agreement.<br/>
	Hiro bowed curtly.<br/>
"If you'll all excuse me, I need go outside for awhile and get some<br/>
fresh air."<br/>
	"Awwwalright, Lord Shogun. Hurry back, your Excellency, or we'll<br/>
finish all the sake!"<br/>
	Hiro laughed at the new nickname.<br/>
If they only knewPeople around here certainly have a strange sense of<br/>
humor<br/>
	"I'll try."<br/>
	Sake isn't what I need to calm myself down right nowhe thought.<br/>
 Quickly making it out to the veranda, he was overjoyed at his<br/>
discovery that the rain had stopped. He slipped into his sandals and<br/>
headed out into the courtyard, silently coming to the area behind the<br/>
kitchen, trying his best not to be noticed. There wasn't much room<br/>
behind the kitchenjust a narrow bit of a passage between it and the<br/>
outer wall.<br/>
	"Yuki?" he whispered, barely audibly. "You here?"<br/>
	Hiro looked around, unable to see much in the darkness. Suddenly,<br/>
though, he saw her form illuminated by the starlight-- leaning against<br/>
the outer wall, hands pressed together in a silent effort to calm her<br/>
impatience, silent tears glistening in the moonlight glow.<br/>
	"Yuki."<br/>
	She looked up suddenly, squinting to make sure it was him.<br/>
	"Hiroyou're here"<br/>
	Unable to control herself any more, she threw her arms around him,<br/>
and sobbed bitterly.<br/>
	"I was so worried about you! When I asked the date, and found out it<br/>
was June 20and I remembered that today was the day that Furutaka was<br/>
captured at the Masuya clothing store. You were out on patrol, and I"<br/>
she buried her face in the folds of his kimono, unable to go on.<br/>
	"Shhhhh." he whispered. "It has been a long day, for both of us.<br/>
Don't worry, Yuki-chanthings will work out."<br/>
	"How can you say that?" she moaned. "We're in the middle of a war,<br/>
siding with the doomed cause. The Ikedaya battle is only a matter of<br/>
weeks away, then the Battle of Kinmon, then the minor skirmishes, all<br/>
the way to your ancestor Yoshinobu's renunciation of authority, then<br/>
the battle of Toba-Fushimi and the retreat north, then the bloodbath<br/>
at Aizu-Wakamatsu and Hakodatecan we really live through this period?<br/>
Who's to say you won't get killed on patrol tomorrow? I've always<br/>
loved this period, but now that I'm actually in it, I feel so alien. I<br/>
need you. I don't want to lose you. "<br/>
	"Yuki" Hiro sighed, running his fingers gently through her long,<br/>
glossy hair. "If there were only one thing I could tell you to<br/>
remember now, it'd be this." He took her face in his hands, and looked<br/>
deeply into her eyes, mesmerized by the way that the moonlight made<br/>
them sparkle. <br/>
"Anata wa watashi no taisetsu na takaramono desuyou are my precious<br/>
treasure. I hold on to this one thought always." <br/>
	Yuki gave Hiro a gentle, loving squeeze.<br/>
	"Thank youI w--" she tried to say something, but he quietly<br/>
interrupted, drawing their lips together in a long, bittersweet,<br/>
satisfying kiss that tasted of tears and longing<br/>
Waves of pleasing, delightful warmth washed over both of them,<br/>
lighting the air with a beautiful, surreal glow. Yuki sensed her knees<br/>
get weak, and felt like she was almost melting in the comfort of his<br/>
embrace.<br/>
"And even though the word won't exist until after the end of this<br/>
waraishiteru, Yuki-chan. I love you"<br/>
	Her heart skipped a beat. She felt like it'd been so long since the<br/>
last time he'd said that.<br/>
"Dai suki desudai suki desu, Hiro-kun...If I could shout it from the<br/>
rooftops without getting arrested by your new boss for disturbing the<br/>
peace, I would."<br/>
	Hiro quietly chuckled. Seems like her wit is the same as ever<br/>
	"Hiro-kunsomething else. Will we ever get to be alone?"<br/>
	He sighed again.<br/>
"I'll have to figure something out. The guys in my unit have been<br/>
talking about the two of us this evening, offering `suggestions' left<br/>
and right about all the teahouses and inns they've heard of from here<br/>
to Edo, but I don't know anything for sure. They're all drunk right<br/>
now, so I can't say that I trust what they say right now. Just be<br/>
patientwe'll get our chance."<br/>
	Yuki's brow furrowed in frustration.<br/>
"People were so up-tight in this age. They had all the licensed<br/>
pleasure quarters they wanted and morebut when it came to people who<br/>
were actually in love, they had to" She lowered her voice, suddenly<br/>
remembering the secrecy of their meeting.<br/>
"I'll wait. I don't want to wait forever, though"<br/>
	"I'll get right on it" he said with a smirk, getting her drift. "I<br/>
don't know about my unit, but they say that Harada Sanosuke-sama of<br/>
the 10th Unit is the guy to ask about stuff like thatI've readand<br/>
heard, that he seems to know a lot of the `right places'. I'll ask<br/>
him, when I get the opportunity."<br/>
"Thanks," she murmured. "Can we stay like this for a while?"<br/>
	"Yesplease"<br/>
Hiro closed his eyes and letting the peace and calm of the moment<br/>
enter his soul. He knew well that he would need to hold such peace<br/>
deep inside his heart, to get both of them through the long, tiring,<br/>
and bloody days to come.<br/>
