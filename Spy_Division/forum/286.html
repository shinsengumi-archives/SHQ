<h3>Reminder and call for contributions</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720732895">EVERYONE is welcome to submit information, commentary, movie / anime <br/>
reviews/ art fiction/ what-have-you for Shinsengumi related things you <br/>
may have seen. It doesn't matter if it's already represented on the site <br/>
I think it would be great to get as many opinions as we can since we all <br/>
view thing differently.<br/>
<br/>
I added a few comments to the run down of Shinsengumi Keppuroku that <br/>
Secretarytocapt3 wrote and  Okita contributed his thoughts to what he's <br/>
seen of the new NHK drama.  Have anything to add to my ramblings on PMK <br/>
or RK or the kenshin OVAs? C'mon and toss 'em my way.<br/>
