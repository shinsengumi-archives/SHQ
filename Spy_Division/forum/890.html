<h3>New Territory</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916626637">Hello everyone,<br/>
I wanted to post an encouraging word or two about fans taking the<br/>
Shinsengumi into new fields/media/literature.<br/>
Just do it (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
Don't feel as if you need to write the Shinsengumi story from<br/>
beginning to end, as you've seen it in television, films or manga. <br/>
Make it your own!  In my own case, I've been happy to adapt Fujita<br/>
Goro into my own short story, which turned into a novel (still being<br/>
edited) and now a screenplay for this contest <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.capeusa.org">http://www.capeusa.org</a><br/>
(don't enter if you can't devote yourself to it---it's going to cost<br/>
you $40, no exceptions).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, creators are overwhelmed by the "scope" of the Shinsengumi<br/>
story, and they should not be.  Pick 1 or 2 characters, a theme, an<br/>
angle and work at it.  You won't be able to fit everyone into your<br/>
story---that's fine.  Just work with the ones which speak to you. <br/>
Don't think "epic"---think smaller drama, horror or comedy.  The<br/>
pitfall of epic stories is it gets so 'big' you lose the intimacy<br/>
between audience and character.  You 'think' 20 chapter novel, but<br/>
your stamina tells you --- you can manage 5 chapters.  Listen to the<br/>
practical voice in you.  It's better to finish something rather than<br/>
abandoning a work.<br/>
<br/>
I watch fanfiction.net to see if stories are being finished---they've<br/>
been abandoned (-_-) either because no one is posting reviews or the<br/>
writer gets bored.<br/>
<br/>
You can't get bored if the work is truly unique.  <br/>
<br/>
That's why I wondered why no one has written a Shinsengumi "horror"<br/>
piece yet....</div>
