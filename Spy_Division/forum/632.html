a communal bath (this was suggested by captain Takeda) and to build a <br/>

atleast once a week on a rotating basis (this too was suggested by <br/>
capt. Takeda).<br/>

If Kondou looks like he is about to cry that&#39;s because he knows his <br/>
men too well.  <br/>
<br/>
Okita after growing out of the purple hair and pet pig phase moved <br/>
onto a J-pop look.  <br/>
Itou-sensei originally was recruited to be a military strategist <br/>
however he prowls the halls of their headquarters in his loose <br/>
fitting (and tends to fall off during inappropriate moments) black <br/>
crepe kimono and constantly poses for an imaginary camera.  <br/>
Nagakura has been demoted several times for his tendency to run to <br/>
Matsudaira Katamori and &quot;tattle&quot; as Kondou calls it.  He currently <br/>
works at koban (police box) where he gives directions and <br/>
occasionally holds up a stop sign for children crossing the street.<br/>
Harada was assigned to guard and inspect the docks and search for <br/>
illegal imported weapons.  Sadly, he has interpreted his seaside job <br/>
as nothing more than a chance to play &quot;lifeguard&quot; for attractive <br/>
female swimmers.  Occasionally he works overtime by applying sun tan <br/>
lotion on the mentioned attractive females.  Due to the strict dress <br/>
code he was not allowed to wander around in his swim trunks, <br/>
therefore he adopted an old battered life jacket.<br/>
Hijikata, while at his weekly salon appointment was called on an <br/>
emergency and thus his hair was burned a nice corn blonde.<br/>
Nakano Takeko is the leader of Aizu&#39;s Joushitai (Women&#39;s Brigade).  <br/>
She was sent by Teruhime, who expressed grave doubts over her adopted <br/>
brother&#39;s choice in men for the job, to inspect and report on the <br/>
Shinsengumi.  Nakano Takeko has realized that her orders and <br/>
suggestions are taken more seriously if she sports her bullet proof, <br/>
extra shiny, sleeveless body tight armor.<br/>
Lastly, the man Matsudaira Katamori calls to drive him to the nearest <br/>
Starbucks for a green tea Frapacinno is Saitou Hajime. His quiet <br/>
demeanor is a shield for his shocking insecurity and fear of change.  <br/>
Behind his back he is called horrible things like &quot;the unknown MIB <br/>
agent&quot;.  He has refused to cut his long hair because one of the new <br/>
ladies at the emergency switchboard, Tokio an associate of Nakano <br/>
TAkeko, likes his hair like that.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454345592">LOL! Nice work here Sec! LOL!!!! I love that you include Nakano-san <br/>
and hai Kondou-san is precious (yes yes I&#39;ve adopted the guy). <br/>
Nagakura tattling is a hoot... And of course we all know who <br/>
the &quot;Man in black&quot; is. LOL! Love the almost caustic air of this <br/>
piece (including description)...<br/>
<br/>
Oh with Saitou like that, it reminds me of one of my SaiSano <br/>
doujinshi here.. <br/>

Although the Saitou in that dj lacks the fear of change and <br/>
insecurity for some reason... hehehe...<br/>
