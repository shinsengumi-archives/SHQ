<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We know the infamous legend of the black cat. Here&#39;s yet another <br/>
 </span></blockquote>take on why Souji did what he did.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Any comments on the above? Yes? No? Anyone found the last part <br/>
 </span></blockquote>confusing? It is supposed to be confusing: the reader is supposed to <br/>
be as muddled as poor Souji.I would find other alternatives to <br/>
writing such death scenes refreshing, so do send me ideas, or even <br/>
better, write them and publish on ff.net. I know Souji is supposedly <br/>
very close to Toshi, but Toshi wasn&#39;t there when he died, period. The <br/>
big question is why.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Please review if you reading this, all 127 of you. The number is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>quite constant,I realise. I think it is because of the small number <br/>
of fics in PMK. Everyone reads everything, but there are so few <br/>
reviews!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, maybe now would be a good time for someone to give an <br/>
explanation of the black cat.  That black cat showed up several times <br/>
in Peacemaker (was it always the same one?) as well as a white one.   <br/>
The black cat is given a brief mention in the new Hillsborough book <br/>
(He wrote that Souji tried twice to kill the cat, but was too weak, <br/>
and Souji&#39;s last words were &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here.&quot;) And we saw <br/>
Souji trying to get the cat in The Last Swordsman too. Is that it, or <br/>
is there more to the cat story?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that the question about Toshi is, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t spending <br/>
Souji&#39;s last days with him be more important than continuing a losing <br/>
battle?&quot;  Hmm...  In our world of fanfic - Of course, Our Toshi would <br/>
move mountains to be with Our Souji.  But, in reality would Toshi <br/>
want to keep fighting for what they set out to do five years <br/>
earlier?  Would he be dishonoring his comrades who died during this <br/>
years long journey to Kyoto and back?  Would Souji be fighting at his <br/>
side if he wasn&#39;t sick? And, TB is contagious.  Lots of questions.  <br/>
Sounds like some good speculative fanfic here!  (Hint, hint to all <br/>
our writers.)<br/>
<br/>
I read all the PMK fics and don&#39;t review.  Guilty as charged.  I <br/>
appreciate all the talented writers sharing their work and in the <br/>
future will let &#39;em know!  <br/>

<br/>
         Yes. The black cat. Is there a white one? I never noticed. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
        Oooh? Did that really happen? I never read the book and would definitely love to know the details. Anyone kind enough to direct me to something similar on the web? Even better... the name and authore of the book.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
        I guess we will never truly know Souji&#39;s last thoughts. We can only keep speculating. &quot;I&#39;ll bet that cat is here?&quot; He sounds like he has truly lost it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that the question about Toshi is, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t spending <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
          Something like that. But, from my pov and in my stories, there will never be any niggling doubt as to which is more important to Hijikata. Fighting a losing battle? I think Souji would be more miserable if Hijikata just gave up without a fight: he never does things in halves. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

Would Souji be fighting at his side if he wasn&#39;t sick? And, TB is contagious.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
           No question on the first statement. He would definitely go on fighting. TB is contagious. But there is another side to this strange disease. My hypothesis is that Souji had probably contracted it much earlier than we thought. I would put it somewhere around... 1862. No evidence, just gut feeling here for the fanfic world. And not everyone dies of TB. *Hint hint* Souji may not have been the only one with the illness... but he is the only one whose illness lay dormant a few years only to flare up like a dragonhead. I believe TB has flares and relapses. *Pause* I will have to do more research on that.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Lots of questions. Sounds like some good speculative fanfic here!  (Hint, hint to all our writers.)<br/>

        Yes! Write, people! And don&#39;t forget the intricate relationship among the comedy Trio, Saitou etc...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921115654">TB was fairly rampant in these days, but the course of TB depends much on individual immunity (which is also influenced by lifestyle and diet).  TB remained a problem in East Asia for decades post-revolution as well.   TB is pretty much infectious only at certain points where a person is actively coughing.... and I don&#39;t recall reading of other Shinsengumi folks with active TB (indicated by coughing and productive, often bloody sputum)?  My guess is that Okita picked this up elsewhere  and much earlier and that it was latent for a time.   Given the extreme conditions and fatigue he encountered while active in the Shinsengumi, it&#39;s possible that the TB eventually overcame his bodies attempts to manage it.  Poor diet could be a contributing factor. (THe Japanese were prone to beri beri, scurvy and other nutritional illnesses.)<br/>

I rather like Souji&#39;s TB storyline here (Have gallery of screencaps up at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://red-bird.org/Gallery/shura">http://red-bird.org/Gallery/shura</a> ).  It&#39;s one of the most generous anime in terms of dealing with all of the various shifting factions as well. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you know which episode and which year specifically?   NHK in the beginning does a few time shifts back and forth from the sighting of Perry&#39;s ships to the year leading up to the transferrence to Kyoto.  There were outbreaks reported worldwide of various diseases, and they vary region by region.  My guess, however is that likely we are dealing with smallpox.<br/>
<br/>
pp 128-9, &quot;The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History&quot; by Donald R. Hopkins writes:<br/>
<br/>
Between 1850 and 1860, vaccination clinics were started in Japan and these sites also served as meeting places for students and teachers of Western science...  <br/>
<br/>
Unlike earlier Western counterparts, Komei did not help lead his subjects into the vaccination era, an error that cost him his life... ... Emperor Komei died of smallpox on 13 February 1867...  Mutsuhito took the throne name of Meiji in 1868 ... This did not signal the end of smallpox in Japan. Dudgeon (1871) records that barely a year later, a fierce epidemic raged along the entire eastern coast of China... the following winter, the epidemic got even worse, spilling over into Japan, where there were more severe outbreaks.<br/>

<br/>
TB has got to be one of the most deadly and prevalent diseases ever. <br/>
Some people call it the 5,000 year old epidemic.  TB still kills tens <br/>
of thousands of people each year.  People knew way, way before the <br/>
20th century how very infectious it was.  The first modern <br/>
description was published in the 1540&#39;s, but it was also described by <br/>
Hippocrates.  That pesky little Mycobacterium genus is fairly young <br/>
(about 15000 years) and researchers think that its evolution <br/>
parallels our switch from hunters to farmers.  Mummies dating to <br/>
3400BCE have been found with it.  In the 1700&#39;s, just about everyone <br/>
in Europe was probably infected.  In general, there are three stages: <br/>
first is the infection and tubercle formation, but there are very few <br/>
symptoms and it is often dismissed as a mild cold (just like in the <br/>
NHK drama).  The second stage is a dormant stage, that can last from <br/>
weeks to a life time.  As long as the host remains healthy they may <br/>
never show any symptoms.  The third stage is the one we are familiar <br/>
with, the tubercles open and the bacteria spread throughout the <br/>
body.  In the pulmonary form, sputum and sometimes blood are coughed <br/>
up.  This is also a means of transmission.  Prior to the 1940&#39;s <br/>
(development of vaccines and anitbiotics; mostly done in Europe) the <br/>
most effective &#39;treatment&#39; was to forestall the 3rd stage and to <br/>
prevent the spread.  Sanitoriums provided people with quiet, <br/>
nutritious food (very similar to the orders of that wonderfully <br/>
cranky doctor in the NHK drama), clean conditions, and were a type of <br/>
quarantine.  <br/>
Probably a good number of the folks in the Shinsengumi (and in Kyoto <br/>
and Edo and any other large city) had an infection, but only poor <br/>
Soji is described as having the final stage of the pulmonary form.  <br/>
Who knows when and where he got it?  But I can certainly imagine the <br/>
living quarters at Mibu and stress levels leading up the raid on <br/>
Ikeda as being factors causing him to move to that third stage.   <br/>
Given how common it was/is I am a little surprised that more men are <br/>
not listed as having it.  But there are several other ailments that <br/>
are actually TB that are often misdiagnosed, so maybe others did have <br/>
it.  And it is much more tragic in some one so young, which makes a <br/>
much better story, eh?<br/>

<br/>
yes I know---my specific example was from 1907<br/>
also I know of a family of American scientists (1870s-1890s)---both<br/>
husband and wife who knew they were ill it with it---yet they were<br/>
contact with family and friends---including their own children<br/>
<br/>
in the case of the 1907 family---the infected daughter lived with her<br/>
parents, sibling and foreign student<br/>
<br/>
so I should have been more clear and stated that although they knew<br/>
that it was infectious no percautions seem to have been taken in a<br/>
timely manner</div>
