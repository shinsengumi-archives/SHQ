<br/>
Toshiko, daughter of the Aizu lord Katataka, smiled as she held the<br/>
warm bundle in her arms, steadied by Teru, her newly adopted sister.<br/>
Teru shook her head in amused disbelief. She didn't think that<br/>
such...cuteness was possible.<br/>
<br/>
"Teru-nechan, isn't she cute?"<br/>
<br/>
A blush tinged Teru's cheeks. The baby that Toshi was holding was<br/>
cute...her smile and her calm, happy demeanor warmed Teru's otherwise<br/>
gently cynical heart. She was a newcomer to the Matsudaira family, and<br/>
so far had only really been impressed by her adoptive sister's<br/>
innocence and her adoptive brother's sometimes annoying calm.<br/>
Extending a finger, she raised a curious eyebrow when the baby took<br/>
firm hold of it and wouldn't let go easily.<br/>
<br/>
-So adorable...like a living doll...-<br/>
<br/>
She turned to the slightly older woman who sat a discreet distance away.<br/>
<br/>
"What's her name, Kouko-chan?"<br/>
<br/>
"It's Takeko, milady."<br/>
<br/>
-Nakano Takeko...-Teru mused quietly. -Sounds like she'll be...famous.<br/>
Or something.- Takeko giggled and once again took ahold of Teru's<br/>
extended finger.<br/>
<br/>
"She's...adorable! And such a good grip..."<br/>
<br/>
"We're so blessed to have her, milady," Kouko bowed politely. "I can<br/>
sense she's bound for great things."<br/>
<br/>
"Mm...have you thought of naginata training, when the time is right?"<br/>
Teru winced. Takeko's grip was getting really hard. "My teacher,<br/>
Akaoka Taisuke, is very good at training women. I could put in a good<br/>
word for you."<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, milady."<br/>
<br/>
"You know, Toshi-chan," Teru gently touched the younger girl on the<br/>
shoulder, "I think you'll make a great mother someday...you just look<br/>
so natural, holding Takeko-chan..."<br/>
<br/>
"You think so?"<br/>
<br/>
"You and Katamori-sama are destined for happy days, little<br/>
sister...just like Takeko-chan here."</div>
