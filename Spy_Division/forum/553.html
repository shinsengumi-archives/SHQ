<br/>
Toshiko, daughter of the Aizu lord Katataka, smiled as she held the<br/>
warm bundle in her arms, steadied by Teru, her newly adopted sister.<br/>
Teru shook her head in amused disbelief. She didn&#39;t think that<br/>
such...cuteness was possible.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teru-nechan, isn&#39;t she cute?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A blush tinged Teru&#39;s cheeks. The baby that Toshi was holding was<br/>
cute...her smile and her calm, happy demeanor warmed Teru&#39;s otherwise<br/>
gently cynical heart. She was a newcomer to the Matsudaira family, and<br/>
so far had only really been impressed by her adoptive sister&#39;s<br/>
innocence and her adoptive brother&#39;s sometimes annoying calm.<br/>
Extending a finger, she raised a curious eyebrow when the baby took<br/>
firm hold of it and wouldn&#39;t let go easily.<br/>
<br/>
-So adorable...like a living doll...-<br/>
<br/>
She turned to the slightly older woman who sat a discreet distance away.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s her name, Kouko-chan?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s Takeko, milady.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-Nakano Takeko...-Teru mused quietly. -Sounds like she&#39;ll be...famous.<br/>
Or something.- Takeko giggled and once again took ahold of Teru&#39;s<br/>
extended finger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She&#39;s...adorable! And such a good grip...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re so blessed to have her, milady,&quot; Kouko bowed politely. &quot;I can<br/>
sense she&#39;s bound for great things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mm...have you thought of naginata training, when the time is right?&quot;<br/>
Teru winced. Takeko&#39;s grip was getting really hard. &quot;My teacher,<br/>
Akaoka Taisuke, is very good at training women. I could put in a good<br/>
word for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you, milady.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You know, Toshi-chan,&quot; Teru gently touched the younger girl on the<br/>
shoulder, &quot;I think you&#39;ll make a great mother someday...you just look<br/>
so natural, holding Takeko-chan...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You think so?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You and Katamori-sama are destined for happy days, little<br/>
sister...just like Takeko-chan here.&quot;</div>
