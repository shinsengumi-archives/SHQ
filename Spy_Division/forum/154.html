<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364524067">Alright.  I&#39;m here now (and at SHQ), and I will try not to fall behind<br/>
again.  I got so behind that I was scared to come look at all the<br/>
posts I got behind on, and then you all went and switched locations<br/>
on me!<br/>
<br/>
Cheeky buggers.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to pimp the rkdreams.com forum.  A lot of the very<br/>
recognizable names in RK fanfiction are over there, but no one<br/>
organizes and executes, as far as historical information-gathering<br/>
goes, like the Shinsengumi fans.  I&#39;ve been pushing a lot of people&#39;s<br/>
(from here) writing over there when they ask for fic recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
As far as related fic-writing goes, I&#39;m stalled out on the two<br/>
Saitou-related stories I have going at the moment, but I hope to have<br/>
inspiration soon (now that I have found you again!).<br/>
<br/>
I wrote an entry for the PMK fiction contest.  It&#39;s being hosted by<br/>
some of the mods of the PMK livejournal group. (Not a very<br/>
informational/historical-type group.  More interested in fanart and<br/>
fanfiction.)<br/>

Angrybee... whee!  Welcome to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info on the PMK contests.  Now that&#39;s something I&#39;ve been dying to try my hand at drawing... so many pretty folks in PMK (and I love the character designer for the anime), but as Kurot&#39;s art is up there... maybe I&#39;ll pass.  May 2nd is a bit too close to whip out something.  *slaps the hand reaching for the tablet*<br/>
<br/>
Although... I&#39;m tempted to enrage the OxH fans.  Always wondered if Ayunee was in love with Hijikata in some weird way.   ^_^   <br/>

It&#39;s not weird at all. I thought the same thing by the way he reacted to <br/>
her death. He couldn&#39;t even bear to be in the same room with her <br/>
body....which my little romance writing mind tends to perceive as <br/>
&quot;something was between them even if it was never acknowledged or acted upon&quot;<br/>

Okita+Hijikata was just a distraction tactic of some sort...a mind<br/>
game because Hijikata knows he can&#39;t just end the relationship with<br/>
Okita nor alienate his best spy.And it would be too weird for him to<br/>
have a girlfriend right there in headquarters which would inevitably<br/>
reveal his softer side.<br/>
<br/>
When Ayunee asks Hijikata for a real mission her body language was<br/>
like &quot;I&#39;ve waited long enough for you to confess your love and since<br/>
you aren&#39;t MAN enough this is goodbye&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is all more poignant because when Okita tells Hijikata that it<br/>
isn&#39;t his fault in a way Okita is also admitting it is HIS fault too<br/>
because Hijikata just can&#39;t let go of Okita.<br/>
<br/>
First I though it would be Ayunee+Tatsu (remember that conversation<br/>
where Tatsu tells her about the tragic family story?) but the series<br/>
didn&#39;t go anywhere with that<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;d like to see PMK Saitou get together with someone to<br/>
make his character more interesting...perhaps a lusty geisha or<br/>
something to provide some kind of contrast (like someone who can&#39;t<br/>
keep her hands off him)...PMK Saitou is cute but I had to agree with a<br/>
fellow fan out there that used him as an avatar and had a sig saying<br/>
&quot;medicinal drugs are good&quot; or something along those lines...too mellow</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-78535184">I definitely agree with both of you (Tiffany/Sherlgirl)... When I <br/>
first started watching the series I definitely felt something there. <br/>
Ayunee possibly attracted to Hijikata. Still though I think that the <br/>
feeling was mutual. Just look at Hijikata&#39;s reaction to her death. I <br/>
would think there was more than just a feeling of &quot;responsibility&quot;.  <br/>
There were subtle yaoi tendecies between Hijikata and Okita but IMHO <br/>
the attraction between the two was more apparent, maybe not at the <br/>
same time.. Of course I could be wrong... Oh well...<br/>
<br/>
As for writing a story between the two of them...  Just like <br/>
Sherlgirl I&#39;d been toying with the idea but afraid to do so at the <br/>
moment for so many reasons. :O)<br/>
<br/>
I hope someone picks up the pairing soon. ^_-<br/>

<br/>
remember when when Yamazaki was listing all of Ayunee&#39;s physical<br/>
injuries...to that scum he was about to dispatch in the basement?<br/>
Well, how do we know that Hijikata wasn&#39;t ALSO aware of the details of<br/>
her horrible death too.<br/>
<br/>
Ayunee&#39;s request was like a suicide of sorts...and the whole bit with<br/>
Hijikata washing up while Ayunee was making her request kind of tells<br/>
you that he is sooo busy and there was no appointment (compare with<br/>
his meetings with KOndo/OKita and Yamazaki Susumu)...she literally had<br/>
to try to catch him alone to speak to him...she had to admire and love<br/>
him from afar the entire time :(<br/>
<br/>
Spiritus Saitou...I imagine PMK Saitou chanting mantras and trying to<br/>
maintain celibacy/holiness and this crazed attractive older woman<br/>
chasing him down (thinking out of control RK Yumi)...people like<br/>
Harada and Nagakura would just shake their heads and try to make sense<br/>
of it all :D or maybe they would try to convince Saitou to let her<br/>
catch him...PMK Saitou is just so *innocent* he had no idea what the<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288649120">Just a bit more evidence for the love between Ayunee and Hijikata.<br/>
<br/>
When she literally let down her hair...I was like -wow- she is letting<br/>
go of that &quot;big sister to everyone in the Shinsengumi&quot; image entirely.<br/>
 She has a sexy side...similarly you wouldn&#39;t have guessed Hijikata<br/>
wrote poetry (unless you have been obsessing/researching historical<br/>
Hijikata).<br/>
<br/>
Before the footrace around the temple all the guys were talking about<br/>
her rice and how much they &quot;desire&quot; it.  With all the excessive<br/>
drooling (Harada) it kind of made me wonder if her rice/cooking was<br/>
really that good.  They were talking about something else ---secret<br/>
guy code--- LOL.  Nagakura was telling his friends to calm down and<br/>
not to take the race so seriously too almost like he was suggesting<br/>
they all go take a cold a shower LOL.<br/>
<br/>
In the PMK world she is the only adult female on the premises...if she<br/>
made herself available then you would have the whole Taboo/Gohatto<br/>
scenario and practice time in the dojo would get bloody.  When she<br/>
assigns a room to the ninja girl she says &quot;its not like I can have you<br/>
stay with the men&quot; -duh- so poor Ayunee -also- has to isolate herself<br/>
too she does seem to live at headquarters because she was available to<br/>
tend to Yamazaki&#39;s wounds. And she can&#39;t meet with HIjikata either<br/>
(late night meetings with Yamazaki).<br/>
<br/>
Back to PMK Saitou he walks in on the guys imagining how the lady<br/>
would respond to Tetsu with &quot;No&quot; (hentai comments) and Saitou was like<br/>
&quot;what do you mean &#39;No&#39; or &#39;stop&#39;?&quot; he is sooo out of the loop and you<br/>
know he was probably listening the whole time (in the manga his ninja<br/>
qualities seem more prominent)...imagine him being dragged to<br/>
Shimabara by the guys.  Toudou makes extra &quot;special&quot; reservations and<br/>
Saitou and an attractive lady are stuck in a room...he brings out<br/>
those prayer beads --- total turn off.</div>

first PMK fic I ever read and it was wonderful) and I think Saitou <br/>
was a better choice than Hijikata. First I don&#39;t think the PMK <br/>
Hijikata would really do/say what Saitou did in your story. Second <br/>
because if you used Hijikata, we will not hear of Ayunee&#39;s mother <br/>

real life a playboy? Fourth (and this might not be important), I LOVE <br/>
ALL INCARNATIONS OF SAITOU-SAMA.<br/>

soon as the lucky woman starts to reveal herself. Now that literally <br/>
would be a show stopper. :OP</div>

mothers are it seemed natural<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Once again that&#39;s why it would be so cool to use Hijikata. No one would <br/>
expect it and yet after seeing the whole series it now makes perfect <br/>
sense. with the same or similar  plot<br/>
