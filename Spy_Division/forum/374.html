<div id="ygrps-yiv-733452285">Hello I have just joined this wonderful group for several reasons #1 <br/>
I am a big fan of Rurouni Kenshin, #2 I am a big fan of Peacemaker <br/>
Kurogane, #3 I am a big fan of Gohatto/Taboo. I also own all <br/>
episodes/DVDs of each series and or movie. I am also interested in <br/>
learning the history behind all the character whether they are in <br/>
anime or not. For example, I am interested in learning more about <br/>
Kawakami Gensai, the person for whom Kenshin Himura of Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin was based upon.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767347159">I absolutely *have* to welcome a fellow Alexander & Hephaestion fan.  :-D  Welcome to the group of us lost in Meiji Japan.  If you&#39;re interested in the history, I highly recommend you also join our sister list, SHQ, where discussion of history, anime, films, and just about everything else takes place.  You&#39;ll also have access to files of information collected and compiled by members.  And please, check out the message board and database (links at the bottom of the message), for even more.<br/>
 <br/>
phil<br/>
 <br/>
P.S.  I do remember there being links to some sites about the hitokiri over on the message board.<br/>
