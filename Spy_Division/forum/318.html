<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058749737">D****d spammers! I see you've set the thing to moderate new member <br/>
posts and made their membership commit seppuku. Let's hope that keeps <br/>
them out of here! What gets me is their gall! "You recieved this <br/>
because you joined OUR group..." What do you mean OUR group?! You're <br/>
not a part of this group! YOU unsubscribe. Jerks...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. I just had a rough night at work and that ticked me off to no <br/>
end.<br/>
