<h3>Story Ratings Alert</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-370340085">This bit of info came across a writer's loop this morning. It appears <br/>
that an LJ user "likebunnies" was hit with a "cease and desist" order <br/>
from the MPAA--Motion Picture Association of America for having the <br/>
nerve to use their beloved ratings system for a fanfiction archive. The <br/>
main concern seems to be with the "NC-17" rating which they claim <br/>
copyright ownership of. You can read about it at the links below.<br/>

Figures. They're generally known to be a bunch of jerks. Some years ago <br/>
Hollywood actually tried to file a lawsuit against a town here in Georgia for <br/>
copyright infringment of the "Hollywood" name. They wanted them to "change the <br/>
town's name or they were going to sue".<br/>
<br/>
LOL They didn't get too far with it. Turns out  Hollywood, GA has been around <br/>
a lot longer than Hollywood, CA.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808266529">I hope Bee doesn't mind me using the Gravitation archive as an example, but to see how another archive is handling this, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gurabiteshiyon.net">http://www.gurabiteshiyon.net</a> .  Very simple and elegant.  <br/>
 <br/>
This is something we need to discuss even though our ML story archives are not public (though stories on the shinsengumihq site are and the database uses the MPAA system as well, I believe).<br/>
 <br/>
Anyone have any ideas about a rating system?<br/>
