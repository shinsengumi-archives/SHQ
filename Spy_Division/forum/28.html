Chapter 6<br/>
<br/>
	Dawn found Hiro eagerly practicing sword cuts in the courtyard,<br/>
taking advantage of the fact that he had the day off. However brief it<br/>
may have been, his time with Yuki the night before had left him<br/>
energized. In an effort to work off the energy, he&#39;d woken up just as<br/>
the 2nd Unit headed out on patrol before dawn, and made use of the<br/>
morning quiet to practice his technique by himself. Just as he brought<br/>
the wooden sword downwards to a chudan stance, parallel to the ground,<br/>
he felt someone&#39;s presence nearby. Turning around, he saw a man with a<br/>
long fishbone between his teeth, leaning on a wooden practice spear<br/>
that nearly towered over him.<br/>
	&quot;Ah, Harada-sama! Good morning!&quot;<br/>
	Harada Sanosuke, the captain of the 10th Unit, started to laugh amusedly.<br/>
	&quot;And what a good morning it seems for you, especially. I heard about<br/>
how you got a `breath of fresh air&#39; last night.&quot; He paused for a<br/>
moment, apparently very amused at the way Hiro&#39;s face suddenly turned<br/>
pale. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t tell anyone. But I can help<br/>
you and your wife, if you&#39;re looking for some time alone.&quot;<br/>
	He motioned to Hiro to come closer, and whispered something in his<br/>
ear. Slowly, Hiro&#39;s face lit up even more.<br/>
	&quot;Thank you, Harada-sama! Thank you!&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Shut up, idiot,&quot; he said, good-naturedly. &quot;You&#39;ll wake up<br/>
Hijikata-san. Don&#39;t want him finding out, now do you?&quot;<br/>
	Hiro shuddered.<br/>
	&quot;Nope, definitely not.&quot;<br/>
************<br/>
	Nakamura Midori, the woman in charge of the kitchen, was also up<br/>
before any one of her colleagues, and was beginning the preparations<br/>
for breakfast, hoping to get as far along as she could until her<br/>
assistants arrived.<br/>
	Just as she was about to start slicing some takuan pickles, Midori<br/>
noticed a familiar figurewith a familiar fishbonelean in through the<br/>
doorway.<br/>
	&quot; `Morning, Mi-chan.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Good morning, Sanosuke-sama,&quot; she answered with a smile.<br/>
	&quot;How&#39;s work?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Well, you knowthe 3rd Unit is off-duty today, so I&#39;ve got extra<br/>
work on my hands. Youumneed anything?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Actually, yes. I have a favor to ask&quot; He strode over to her and<br/>
whispered an explanation in her ear.<br/>
	&quot;Yeah, I heard about it, tooI&#39;ll help you out, Sanosuke-sama.&quot;<br/>
*********<br/>
	Around half an hour later, Yuki strode briskly into the kitchen, with<br/>
a wistful smile on her face. The events of the night before were still<br/>
vivid in her memory. She&#39;d wished to spend the whole night with Hiro,<br/>
but knew that it wasn&#39;t possible. So, in as high spirits as possible,<br/>
she&#39;d come to throw herself wholeheartedly into her work. She bowed to<br/>
Midori, and would have started helping with cooking the rice, had<br/>
Midori not stopped her.<br/>
	&quot;Yuki-hanI have anerrand for you to run.&quot;<br/>
*********<br/>
Hiro was ecstatic. If what Harada had told him worked, it&#39;d be a<br/>
perfectly convenient and legitimate way for him to spend off-duty time<br/>
with Yuki. All that was left to do was to find Saitou and ask about<br/>
the 3rd Unit&#39;s next patrol.<br/>
Almost at that moment, Saitou emerged from his room. In no time, Hiro<br/>
was standing next to him and bowing profusely.<br/>
&quot;Saitou-sama, good morning.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Good morning, Tokugawa-san.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I have a question.&quot;<br/>
Saitou appeared intriguednot exactly sure of what was going on, but<br/>
probably possessing some inkling of what Hiro had in mind.<br/>
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br/>
&quot;When are we back on duty?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Not until just before noon tomorrow. Why?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh&quot; Hiro blushed visibly. &quot;Iwas planning on spending some time in<br/>
the city, and wanted to be sure that I&#39;d be back at the right time.&quot;<br/>
Saitou noddedslowly.<br/>
&quot;I see. Well then, have agood time, Tokugawa-san.&quot;<br/>
Hiro bowed quickly.<br/>
&quot;Thank you, Saitou-sama.&quot;<br/>
Everything finally taken care of, Hiro picked up the straw hat that<br/>
he&#39;d left leaning against the outer wall, and tied it on as he passed<br/>
through the gate. With a nod to the gatemen, he was off.<br/>
Things were definitely looking up<br/>
********<br/>
Yuki left the headquarters quickly and quietly, her feet moving almost<br/>
of their own accord. What Midori had helped arrange was wonderfuland<br/>
since Harada was Midori&#39;s lover, Yuki sensed that he&#39;d played no small<br/>
part in all of this, either. Then again, like the history books said,<br/>
he was known for being the kind of person who knew of such places and<br/>
thingsamong which was Yuki&#39;s destination, the Yanagi-ya inn.<br/>
Blissfully unaware of anything but her destination, she kept walking<br/>
*********<br/>
After a brisk, two-mile hike, Hiro arrived at the Yanagi-ya. Unlike<br/>
other inns, the innkeeper didn&#39;t stand outside and advertise his<br/>
establishment. Hiro only saw him after he&#39;d entered the building. The<br/>
young innkeeper was apparently, was a good friend of Harada, and Hiro<br/>
didn&#39;t seem surprised when the man told him that the captain came by<br/>
and rented a room regularly. Perhaps that was why the man didn&#39;t need<br/>
to advertise like other innshe had a guaranteed, good incomeand<br/>
where anyone from the Shinsengumi or Military Commission went, high<br/>
regard was sure to follow.<br/>
The innkeeper showed Hiro to a small, 2nd floor room, looking out onto<br/>
the street, and excused himself, saying that he&#39;d keep an eye out for<br/>
anyone `looking&#39; for him. Slowly pacing over to the window, Hiro noted<br/>
that the day had begun in earnest, and life moved along just the same<br/>
as ever. Just like it probably still does, `back&#39; in the 21st century,<br/>
Hiro thought with a chuckle, as he removed the swords from his belt<br/>
and placed them carefully on the provided weapon rack by the wall. The<br/>
screen next to the rack caught his eye. It was painted with a scene<br/>
depicting the triumphant entry of Tokugawa Ieyasu into Osaka, after<br/>
the fall of that castle&#39;s garrison in 1615. Hiro grinned as he found<br/>
the figure of his ancestor, aging yet still proud and fierce, riding<br/>
into the castle with his head held high.<br/>
The room&#39;s door slid open, suddenly bringing him back to attention in<br/>
the real world.<br/>
Turning on his heel, he saw Yuki standing in the doorway, clutching a<br/>
woven straw mat with one hand. She bowed and closed the door behind<br/>
her. Hiro slid the window shutter closed, as well, and stood up.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;msupposed to be getting daifuku sweets as a surprise for the<br/>
serving women, according to Midori-san,&quot; Yuki said with a smile.<br/>
&quot;Harada-sama sent me to `investigate&#39; the area for him&quot; added Hiro.<br/>
In the blink of an eye, they found themselves with their arms wrapped<br/>
around each other tightly, almost as if each one was afraid that the<br/>
other would vanish if not held onto firmly. Melting into each other&#39;s<br/>
embrace, they relaxed, as if a great weight had been lifted from their<br/>
collective consciousness. For a time, they could be their own selves<br/>
again.<br/>
&quot;Hiroit&#39;s been so long&quot; sighed Yuki. &quot;So very long&quot;<br/>
He smiled as she looked up at him, reaching a hand out to caress his face.<br/>
&quot;I love you, Yuki-chan&quot;<br/>
Slowly, gently, they brought their lips together in a deep, warming,<br/>
heartfelt kiss, which sent a sudden wave of euphoria rushing through<br/>
both of them, from head to toe. Then they sank down onto the empty<br/>
futon, which lay waitingand nature restored to them the oneness that<br/>
they had to deny themselves in the outside world<br/>
***********<br/>
	They arose early the next morning, hoping to get back to headquarters<br/>
before the 3rd Unit&#39;s scheduled patrol. After getting dressed and<br/>
paying the innkeeper a decent amount, they stepped out into the<br/>
sunshine. Hiro tightened the sash of his swords, and glanced at Yuki.<br/>
	&quot;Shall we be going?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Only if you promise to do this again soon.&quot;<br/>
	He smiled.<br/>
	&quot;Of course. And being one yourself, you know that a samurai&#39;s word is<br/>
true.&quot;<br/>
	They started walkingunable to hold hands, but walking closer<br/>
together than they had the day before, basking in the glow of the left<br/>
over euphoria and giddiness. Life would be so much easier, now that<br/>
they had a way of relieving this particular tension in their<br/>
relationship. And if anyone said anything, it wouldn&#39;t matter. They<br/>
didn&#39;t need to care about what anyone saidit was their business, and<br/>
perfectly legal in any time period.<br/>
	Suddenly, the sound of swords being drawn brought the euphoria to a<br/>
crashing halt. Hiro&#39;s hands instinctively went to his own swords, as<br/>
he turned around to see who had drawn on him.<br/>
	&quot;I am Takada Gennosuke of the Kyoto Mimawarigumi,&quot; announced the man<br/>
with the drawn sword. He was tall, well-groomed, and wearing a haori<br/>
more muted in color than that of the Shinsengumias befitting a member<br/>
of the Mimawarigumi, which also operated under the auspices of the<br/>
Kyoto Military Commission, but was made up of more well-to-do<br/>
individuals than the Shinsengumi&#39;s ex-farmers and masterless samurai.<br/>
	Takada stepped closer, the tip of his sword rising slightly.<br/>
	&quot;Present identification now, or prepare to die.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Chapter 7<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Present identification now, or prepare to die.&quot;<br/>
Hiro was enraged. He didn&#39;t care who the man worked fortime travel or<br/>
no time travel, Hiro was a Tokugawa, and despite the general humility<br/>
he had, retained certain aristocratic tendencies. To be told &quot;prepare<br/>
to die&quot; from a no-name middle-class samurai was like a slap in the<br/>
face. As a respectable heir of the Tokugawa clan, Hiro needed to keep<br/>
his honor and dignity intact.<br/>
Slowly, he started to close his hands around each of his swords&#39;<br/>
handles, ready to slash the man in half when he felt Yuki&#39;s hand<br/>
gently restrain his own. Startled back to full awareness, Hiro took a<br/>
deep breath to calm himself, bringing his humility back in control of<br/>
his mind, and deciding on being courteous instead of impulsive. Taking<br/>
a step back, he bowed low.<br/>
&quot;I am Tokugawa Hirotada, a patrolman of the Shinsengumi 3rd Unit. I<br/>
have no quarrel with you or your unit, Takada-san.&quot;<br/>
Takada snorted.<br/>
&quot;FehTokugawa, indeed. I want proof. Now.&quot;<br/>
Hiro reached into his sleeve, and pulled out his Kyoto Military<br/>
Commission identification paper which he&#39;d received right before his<br/>
first patrol with Saitou. He held it out to Takada humbly.<br/>
&quot;Here is all the proof you need.&quot;<br/>
Takada&#39;s two assistant patrolmen moved in as their leader took the<br/>
document with one hand and scanned it quickly, keeping his sword low<br/>
but ready to strike as he did so.<br/>
Hiro winced. An agonizing eternity passed as he thought of how much he<br/>
wanted to keep his head attached to his body, how he wanted to fight<br/>
at the Battle of Ikedaya, and how he wanted to live through the<br/>
Bakumatsu. Lost in these and other thoughts, he almost missed the<br/>
sound of Takada&#39;s sword being sheathed.<br/>
The Mimawarigumi patrolman bowed.<br/>
&quot;Isee, Tokugawa-san. My apologies. As you know, we can&#39;t take any<br/>
chances nowadays. At any rate, your papers are in order. You&#39;re free<br/>
to go.&quot;<br/>
Hiro took back the paper, folding it carefully and putting it back in<br/>
his sleeve. He bowed, not wanting to take any chances.<br/>
&quot;I humbly thank you.&quot;<br/>
**********<br/>
	Hiro and Yuki paused. Having covered the rest of the way without<br/>
incident, they had finally neared their destination. Ahead of them lay<br/>
the gate of the Yagi estate, which seemed to gently beckon them back<br/>
to work and the real world. They turned to face each other for one<br/>
last time.<br/>
	&quot;Well, back to work,&quot; Hiro sighed.<br/>
	Yuki nodded. Rather impulsively, she leaned in and gave him a quick<br/>
kiss on the cheek.<br/>
&quot;Neh, anata,&quot; she whispered sweetly, &quot;Again, I hope we have the<br/>
opportunity to repeat this sometime soon.&quot; She giggled as Hiro blushed<br/>
bright red, conscious as ever of the social constraints and standards<br/>
of propriety of the age.<br/>
&quot;Me too,&quot; Hiro murmured. &quot;As long as the Mimawarigumi doesn&#39;t kill us<br/>
on our way home next time.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Deal.&quot;<br/>
They took one last, longing look at each other, and then proceeded for<br/>
the gate.<br/>
*********<br/>
	Upon making it through the gate, the first thing Yuki did was proceed<br/>
to the kitchen to find Midori. Sure enough, there she was, working<br/>
quickly with the other women to make soup for the returning 5th and<br/>
8th Units.<br/>
	&quot;Ah, Yuki-han! Welcome back!&quot;<br/>
	Yuki bowed politely.<br/>
	&quot;Good to be back, Midori-san.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Did you, um, get the errand done?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Yes. Yes, I did,&quot; she said, stifling the urge to laugh. &quot;Thank you<br/>
for allowing me to go.&quot;<br/>
	Midori exchanged a knowing glance with her.<br/>
	&quot;Only you could&#39;ve done it. No one else, Yuki-han.&quot;<br/>
	Yuki bowed again in gratitude. Pulling a tasuki sash out of her<br/>
sleeve, she tied her sleeves up and went to work.<br/>
**********<br/>
	Hiro yawned. The 3rd Unit had been patrolling since noon, and they<br/>
hadn&#39;t had any troublenot even from the Mimawarigumi. Of course, the<br/>
tired, bored mood had led to joking amongst the patrolmen as they<br/>
continued to make their rounds. Saitou didn&#39;t seem to mindhe even<br/>
joined in at times. The general atmosphere of the Shinsengumi was too<br/>
`brotherly&#39; for any of its memberswith the possible exception of<br/>
Hijikatato be continually serious for any extended duration.<br/>
	The men&#39;s conversations covered everything, from politics to the<br/>
weather to the latest sumo matches. Finally, Hiro was hit with the<br/>
question he&#39;d been expecting since the morning.<br/>
	&quot;So, Tokugawa-kun, did you have a good day off?&quot;<br/>
	Okada Shichinosuke, a patrolman who&#39;d immediately befriended Hiro on<br/>
his first day, tried to intervene.<br/>
	&quot;What Tokugawa-kun does on his time off is hisumbusinessRight,<br/>
Tokugawa-kun?&quot;<br/>
	Hiro snickered at the comment. Okada had quickly proved himself to be<br/>
possessed of a sharp wit, and constantly made clever remarks left and<br/>
right, this one being no exception. He cleared his throat and tried<br/>
his best to follow up on the good-natured jab.<br/>
	&quot;Yes, it was my business, Okada-kun.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Was it a pleasure doing business, Tokugawa-kun?&quot; somebody asked<br/>
between guffaws and chortles.<br/>
&quot;Did you have any associates?&quot; asked someone else. Unable to restrain<br/>
themselves any longer, the entire 3rd Unit burst into howls of raucous<br/>
laughter.<br/>
	&quot;Shut up!&quot; ordered Saitou suddenly. &quot;Talk all you want, but I won&#39;t<br/>
have you people doing this while on duty!&quot;<br/>
	Dead silence. Suddenly, someone spoke.<br/>
	&quot;Neh, Saitou-san, do you need a business associate?&quot;<br/>
	Saitou tried to keep a straight face, but in vain. Suddenly, he burst<br/>
out laughing with the rest of them.<br/>
	&quot;I can&#39;t believe you people&quot; he muttered disbelievingly. &quot;This is<br/>
supposed to be the toughest city in the entire realm to work inhow<br/>
come you guys are still alive with such an attitude? How can this, in<br/>
all seriousness, be called a combat-ready unit?&quot;<br/>
	This time, Hiro had the answer.<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s simple, Saitou-sama. We&#39;re the best of the best. That&#39;s<br/>
because the Ishin Shishi stay away from our sick sense of humor at all<br/>
costs.&quot;<br/>
*********<br/>
	Yuki wiped the sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand and<br/>
sighed. The naginata class had gotten off to a good start. After<br/>
lunch, she&#39;d received word by way of Midori that Kondou had approved<br/>
of her teaching the women how to use the naginata, and so the first<br/>
class had been scheduled for the early evening.<br/>
	&quot;Very well done,&quot; she told the women, who all stood leaning on their<br/>
wooden practice naginata, sleeves tied back, hair tied up in tenugui<br/>
bandannas, and looking similarly sweaty and tired.<br/>
&quot;Very well done indeed. You&#39;ve all got great potential.&quot;<br/>
Very well done for the very first dayand besides, I don&#39;t know which<br/>
of these women will end up wherehopefully I&#39;m teaching them something<br/>
not entirely uselessand hopefully I&#39;m not changing the course of<br/>
history too much, she thought. Then, smirking to herself, she added,<br/>
At least I get to have longer classes here than `back&#39; in 2004and no<br/>
one can really complain of techniques which are `hard&#39; or `too<br/>
aggressive&#39;. After all, we are in a life-and-death struggle here.<br/>
Yuki bowed to the women.<br/>
&quot;Thank you. That will be all for today.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;Domo arigatou gozaimasu, sensei,&quot; they said in unison. &quot;Thank you<br/>
very much, teacher.&quot;<br/>
With that, some of them headed for the baths, eager to relax for a<br/>
time, while the others finished the necessary chores for the<br/>
Shinsengumi. As agreed before the class, the groups would switch after<br/>
a certain amount of time, allowing for equal &quot;down time&quot; in the baths<br/>
for everyone.<br/>
Just as Yuki was about to head over to the baths, she quickly glanced<br/>
over at the main building, feeling a chill run down her spine as she<br/>
did so.<br/>
Hijikata Toshizou was standing outside his room, arms folded across<br/>
his chest. He shot Yuki a glare. Even though no words were spoken,<br/>
Yuki got the message.<br/>
Keep yourself in shape. I&#39;m watching.<br/>
