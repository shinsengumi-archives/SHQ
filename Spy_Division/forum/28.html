Chapter 6<br/>
<br/>
	Dawn found Hiro eagerly practicing sword cuts in the courtyard,<br/>
taking advantage of the fact that he had the day off. However brief it<br/>
may have been, his time with Yuki the night before had left him<br/>
energized. In an effort to work off the energy, he'd woken up just as<br/>
the 2nd Unit headed out on patrol before dawn, and made use of the<br/>
morning quiet to practice his technique by himself. Just as he brought<br/>
the wooden sword downwards to a chudan stance, parallel to the ground,<br/>
he felt someone's presence nearby. Turning around, he saw a man with a<br/>
long fishbone between his teeth, leaning on a wooden practice spear<br/>
that nearly towered over him.<br/>
	"Ah, Harada-sama! Good morning!"<br/>
	Harada Sanosuke, the captain of the 10th Unit, started to laugh amusedly.<br/>
	"And what a good morning it seems for you, especially. I heard about<br/>
how you got a `breath of fresh air' last night." He paused for a<br/>
moment, apparently very amused at the way Hiro's face suddenly turned<br/>
pale. "Don't worry, don't worry. I won't tell anyone. But I can help<br/>
you and your wife, if you're looking for some time alone."<br/>
	He motioned to Hiro to come closer, and whispered something in his<br/>
ear. Slowly, Hiro's face lit up even more.<br/>
	"Thank you, Harada-sama! Thank you!"<br/>
	"Shut up, idiot," he said, good-naturedly. "You'll wake up<br/>
Hijikata-san. Don't want him finding out, now do you?"<br/>
	Hiro shuddered.<br/>
	"Nope, definitely not."<br/>
************<br/>
	Nakamura Midori, the woman in charge of the kitchen, was also up<br/>
before any one of her colleagues, and was beginning the preparations<br/>
for breakfast, hoping to get as far along as she could until her<br/>
assistants arrived.<br/>
	Just as she was about to start slicing some takuan pickles, Midori<br/>
noticed a familiar figurewith a familiar fishbonelean in through the<br/>
doorway.<br/>
	" `Morning, Mi-chan."<br/>
	"Good morning, Sanosuke-sama," she answered with a smile.<br/>
	"How's work?"<br/>
	"Well, you knowthe 3rd Unit is off-duty today, so I've got extra<br/>
work on my hands. Youumneed anything?"<br/>
	"Actually, yes. I have a favor to ask" He strode over to her and<br/>
whispered an explanation in her ear.<br/>
	"Yeah, I heard about it, tooI'll help you out, Sanosuke-sama."<br/>
*********<br/>
	Around half an hour later, Yuki strode briskly into the kitchen, with<br/>
a wistful smile on her face. The events of the night before were still<br/>
vivid in her memory. She'd wished to spend the whole night with Hiro,<br/>
but knew that it wasn't possible. So, in as high spirits as possible,<br/>
she'd come to throw herself wholeheartedly into her work. She bowed to<br/>
Midori, and would have started helping with cooking the rice, had<br/>
Midori not stopped her.<br/>
	"Yuki-hanI have anerrand for you to run."<br/>
*********<br/>
Hiro was ecstatic. If what Harada had told him worked, it'd be a<br/>
perfectly convenient and legitimate way for him to spend off-duty time<br/>
with Yuki. All that was left to do was to find Saitou and ask about<br/>
the 3rd Unit's next patrol.<br/>
Almost at that moment, Saitou emerged from his room. In no time, Hiro<br/>
was standing next to him and bowing profusely.<br/>
"Saitou-sama, good morning."<br/>
"Good morning, Tokugawa-san."<br/>
"I have a question."<br/>
Saitou appeared intriguednot exactly sure of what was going on, but<br/>
probably possessing some inkling of what Hiro had in mind.<br/>
"Yes?"<br/>
"When are we back on duty?"<br/>
"Not until just before noon tomorrow. Why?"<br/>
"Oh" Hiro blushed visibly. "Iwas planning on spending some time in<br/>
the city, and wanted to be sure that I'd be back at the right time."<br/>
Saitou noddedslowly.<br/>
"I see. Well then, have agood time, Tokugawa-san."<br/>
Hiro bowed quickly.<br/>
"Thank you, Saitou-sama."<br/>
Everything finally taken care of, Hiro picked up the straw hat that<br/>
he'd left leaning against the outer wall, and tied it on as he passed<br/>
through the gate. With a nod to the gatemen, he was off.<br/>
Things were definitely looking up<br/>
********<br/>
Yuki left the headquarters quickly and quietly, her feet moving almost<br/>
of their own accord. What Midori had helped arrange was wonderfuland<br/>
since Harada was Midori's lover, Yuki sensed that he'd played no small<br/>
part in all of this, either. Then again, like the history books said,<br/>
he was known for being the kind of person who knew of such places and<br/>
thingsamong which was Yuki's destination, the Yanagi-ya inn.<br/>
Blissfully unaware of anything but her destination, she kept walking<br/>
*********<br/>
After a brisk, two-mile hike, Hiro arrived at the Yanagi-ya. Unlike<br/>
other inns, the innkeeper didn't stand outside and advertise his<br/>
establishment. Hiro only saw him after he'd entered the building. The<br/>
young innkeeper was apparently, was a good friend of Harada, and Hiro<br/>
didn't seem surprised when the man told him that the captain came by<br/>
and rented a room regularly. Perhaps that was why the man didn't need<br/>
to advertise like other innshe had a guaranteed, good incomeand<br/>
where anyone from the Shinsengumi or Military Commission went, high<br/>
regard was sure to follow.<br/>
The innkeeper showed Hiro to a small, 2nd floor room, looking out onto<br/>
the street, and excused himself, saying that he'd keep an eye out for<br/>
anyone `looking' for him. Slowly pacing over to the window, Hiro noted<br/>
that the day had begun in earnest, and life moved along just the same<br/>
as ever. Just like it probably still does, `back' in the 21st century,<br/>
Hiro thought with a chuckle, as he removed the swords from his belt<br/>
and placed them carefully on the provided weapon rack by the wall. The<br/>
screen next to the rack caught his eye. It was painted with a scene<br/>
depicting the triumphant entry of Tokugawa Ieyasu into Osaka, after<br/>
the fall of that castle's garrison in 1615. Hiro grinned as he found<br/>
the figure of his ancestor, aging yet still proud and fierce, riding<br/>
into the castle with his head held high.<br/>
The room's door slid open, suddenly bringing him back to attention in<br/>
the real world.<br/>
Turning on his heel, he saw Yuki standing in the doorway, clutching a<br/>
woven straw mat with one hand. She bowed and closed the door behind<br/>
her. Hiro slid the window shutter closed, as well, and stood up.<br/>
"I'msupposed to be getting daifuku sweets as a surprise for the<br/>
serving women, according to Midori-san," Yuki said with a smile.<br/>
"Harada-sama sent me to `investigate' the area for him" added Hiro.<br/>
In the blink of an eye, they found themselves with their arms wrapped<br/>
around each other tightly, almost as if each one was afraid that the<br/>
other would vanish if not held onto firmly. Melting into each other's<br/>
embrace, they relaxed, as if a great weight had been lifted from their<br/>
collective consciousness. For a time, they could be their own selves<br/>
again.<br/>
"Hiroit's been so long" sighed Yuki. "So very long"<br/>
He smiled as she looked up at him, reaching a hand out to caress his face.<br/>
"I love you, Yuki-chan"<br/>
Slowly, gently, they brought their lips together in a deep, warming,<br/>
heartfelt kiss, which sent a sudden wave of euphoria rushing through<br/>
both of them, from head to toe. Then they sank down onto the empty<br/>
futon, which lay waitingand nature restored to them the oneness that<br/>
they had to deny themselves in the outside world<br/>
***********<br/>
	They arose early the next morning, hoping to get back to headquarters<br/>
before the 3rd Unit's scheduled patrol. After getting dressed and<br/>
paying the innkeeper a decent amount, they stepped out into the<br/>
sunshine. Hiro tightened the sash of his swords, and glanced at Yuki.<br/>
	"Shall we be going?"<br/>
	"Only if you promise to do this again soon."<br/>
	He smiled.<br/>
	"Of course. And being one yourself, you know that a samurai's word is<br/>
true."<br/>
	They started walkingunable to hold hands, but walking closer<br/>
together than they had the day before, basking in the glow of the left<br/>
over euphoria and giddiness. Life would be so much easier, now that<br/>
they had a way of relieving this particular tension in their<br/>
relationship. And if anyone said anything, it wouldn't matter. They<br/>
didn't need to care about what anyone saidit was their business, and<br/>
perfectly legal in any time period.<br/>
	Suddenly, the sound of swords being drawn brought the euphoria to a<br/>
crashing halt. Hiro's hands instinctively went to his own swords, as<br/>
he turned around to see who had drawn on him.<br/>
	"I am Takada Gennosuke of the Kyoto Mimawarigumi," announced the man<br/>
with the drawn sword. He was tall, well-groomed, and wearing a haori<br/>
more muted in color than that of the Shinsengumias befitting a member<br/>
of the Mimawarigumi, which also operated under the auspices of the<br/>
Kyoto Military Commission, but was made up of more well-to-do<br/>
individuals than the Shinsengumi's ex-farmers and masterless samurai.<br/>
	Takada stepped closer, the tip of his sword rising slightly.<br/>
	"Present identification now, or prepare to die."<br/>

<br/>
Chapter 7<br/>
<br/>
"Present identification now, or prepare to die."<br/>
Hiro was enraged. He didn't care who the man worked fortime travel or<br/>
no time travel, Hiro was a Tokugawa, and despite the general humility<br/>
he had, retained certain aristocratic tendencies. To be told "prepare<br/>
to die" from a no-name middle-class samurai was like a slap in the<br/>
face. As a respectable heir of the Tokugawa clan, Hiro needed to keep<br/>
his honor and dignity intact.<br/>
Slowly, he started to close his hands around each of his swords'<br/>
handles, ready to slash the man in half when he felt Yuki's hand<br/>
gently restrain his own. Startled back to full awareness, Hiro took a<br/>
deep breath to calm himself, bringing his humility back in control of<br/>
his mind, and deciding on being courteous instead of impulsive. Taking<br/>
a step back, he bowed low.<br/>
"I am Tokugawa Hirotada, a patrolman of the Shinsengumi 3rd Unit. I<br/>
have no quarrel with you or your unit, Takada-san."<br/>
Takada snorted.<br/>
"FehTokugawa, indeed. I want proof. Now."<br/>
Hiro reached into his sleeve, and pulled out his Kyoto Military<br/>
Commission identification paper which he'd received right before his<br/>
first patrol with Saitou. He held it out to Takada humbly.<br/>
"Here is all the proof you need."<br/>
Takada's two assistant patrolmen moved in as their leader took the<br/>
document with one hand and scanned it quickly, keeping his sword low<br/>
but ready to strike as he did so.<br/>
Hiro winced. An agonizing eternity passed as he thought of how much he<br/>
wanted to keep his head attached to his body, how he wanted to fight<br/>
at the Battle of Ikedaya, and how he wanted to live through the<br/>
Bakumatsu. Lost in these and other thoughts, he almost missed the<br/>
sound of Takada's sword being sheathed.<br/>
The Mimawarigumi patrolman bowed.<br/>
"Isee, Tokugawa-san. My apologies. As you know, we can't take any<br/>
chances nowadays. At any rate, your papers are in order. You're free<br/>
to go."<br/>
Hiro took back the paper, folding it carefully and putting it back in<br/>
his sleeve. He bowed, not wanting to take any chances.<br/>
"I humbly thank you."<br/>
**********<br/>
	Hiro and Yuki paused. Having covered the rest of the way without<br/>
incident, they had finally neared their destination. Ahead of them lay<br/>
the gate of the Yagi estate, which seemed to gently beckon them back<br/>
to work and the real world. They turned to face each other for one<br/>
last time.<br/>
	"Well, back to work," Hiro sighed.<br/>
	Yuki nodded. Rather impulsively, she leaned in and gave him a quick<br/>
kiss on the cheek.<br/>
"Neh, anata," she whispered sweetly, "Again, I hope we have the<br/>
opportunity to repeat this sometime soon." She giggled as Hiro blushed<br/>
bright red, conscious as ever of the social constraints and standards<br/>
of propriety of the age.<br/>
"Me too," Hiro murmured. "As long as the Mimawarigumi doesn't kill us<br/>
on our way home next time."<br/>
"Deal."<br/>
They took one last, longing look at each other, and then proceeded for<br/>
the gate.<br/>
*********<br/>
	Upon making it through the gate, the first thing Yuki did was proceed<br/>
to the kitchen to find Midori. Sure enough, there she was, working<br/>
quickly with the other women to make soup for the returning 5th and<br/>
8th Units.<br/>
	"Ah, Yuki-han! Welcome back!"<br/>
	Yuki bowed politely.<br/>
	"Good to be back, Midori-san."<br/>
	"Did you, um, get the errand done?"<br/>
	"Yes. Yes, I did," she said, stifling the urge to laugh. "Thank you<br/>
for allowing me to go."<br/>
	Midori exchanged a knowing glance with her.<br/>
	"Only you could've done it. No one else, Yuki-han."<br/>
	Yuki bowed again in gratitude. Pulling a tasuki sash out of her<br/>
sleeve, she tied her sleeves up and went to work.<br/>
**********<br/>
	Hiro yawned. The 3rd Unit had been patrolling since noon, and they<br/>
hadn't had any troublenot even from the Mimawarigumi. Of course, the<br/>
tired, bored mood had led to joking amongst the patrolmen as they<br/>
continued to make their rounds. Saitou didn't seem to mindhe even<br/>
joined in at times. The general atmosphere of the Shinsengumi was too<br/>
`brotherly' for any of its memberswith the possible exception of<br/>
Hijikatato be continually serious for any extended duration.<br/>
	The men's conversations covered everything, from politics to the<br/>
weather to the latest sumo matches. Finally, Hiro was hit with the<br/>
question he'd been expecting since the morning.<br/>
	"So, Tokugawa-kun, did you have a good day off?"<br/>
	Okada Shichinosuke, a patrolman who'd immediately befriended Hiro on<br/>
his first day, tried to intervene.<br/>
	"What Tokugawa-kun does on his time off is hisumbusinessRight,<br/>
Tokugawa-kun?"<br/>
	Hiro snickered at the comment. Okada had quickly proved himself to be<br/>
possessed of a sharp wit, and constantly made clever remarks left and<br/>
right, this one being no exception. He cleared his throat and tried<br/>
his best to follow up on the good-natured jab.<br/>
	"Yes, it was my business, Okada-kun."<br/>
	"Was it a pleasure doing business, Tokugawa-kun?" somebody asked<br/>
between guffaws and chortles.<br/>
"Did you have any associates?" asked someone else. Unable to restrain<br/>
themselves any longer, the entire 3rd Unit burst into howls of raucous<br/>
laughter.<br/>
	"Shut up!" ordered Saitou suddenly. "Talk all you want, but I won't<br/>
have you people doing this while on duty!"<br/>
	Dead silence. Suddenly, someone spoke.<br/>
	"Neh, Saitou-san, do you need a business associate?"<br/>
	Saitou tried to keep a straight face, but in vain. Suddenly, he burst<br/>
out laughing with the rest of them.<br/>
	"I can't believe you people" he muttered disbelievingly. "This is<br/>
supposed to be the toughest city in the entire realm to work inhow<br/>
come you guys are still alive with such an attitude? How can this, in<br/>
all seriousness, be called a combat-ready unit?"<br/>
	This time, Hiro had the answer.<br/>
"That's simple, Saitou-sama. We're the best of the best. That's<br/>
because the Ishin Shishi stay away from our sick sense of humor at all<br/>
costs."<br/>
*********<br/>
	Yuki wiped the sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand and<br/>
sighed. The naginata class had gotten off to a good start. After<br/>
lunch, she'd received word by way of Midori that Kondou had approved<br/>
of her teaching the women how to use the naginata, and so the first<br/>
class had been scheduled for the early evening.<br/>
	"Very well done," she told the women, who all stood leaning on their<br/>
wooden practice naginata, sleeves tied back, hair tied up in tenugui<br/>
bandannas, and looking similarly sweaty and tired.<br/>
"Very well done indeed. You've all got great potential."<br/>
Very well done for the very first dayand besides, I don't know which<br/>
of these women will end up wherehopefully I'm teaching them something<br/>
not entirely uselessand hopefully I'm not changing the course of<br/>
history too much, she thought. Then, smirking to herself, she added,<br/>
At least I get to have longer classes here than `back' in 2004and no<br/>
one can really complain of techniques which are `hard' or `too<br/>
aggressive'. After all, we are in a life-and-death struggle here.<br/>
Yuki bowed to the women.<br/>
"Thank you. That will be all for today."<br/>
 "Domo arigatou gozaimasu, sensei," they said in unison. "Thank you<br/>
very much, teacher."<br/>
With that, some of them headed for the baths, eager to relax for a<br/>
time, while the others finished the necessary chores for the<br/>
Shinsengumi. As agreed before the class, the groups would switch after<br/>
a certain amount of time, allowing for equal "down time" in the baths<br/>
for everyone.<br/>
Just as Yuki was about to head over to the baths, she quickly glanced<br/>
over at the main building, feeling a chill run down her spine as she<br/>
did so.<br/>
Hijikata Toshizou was standing outside his room, arms folded across<br/>
his chest. He shot Yuki a glare. Even though no words were spoken,<br/>
Yuki got the message.<br/>
Keep yourself in shape. I'm watching.<br/>
