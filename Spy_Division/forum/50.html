Chapter 8<br/>
<br/>
July 5, 1864<br/>
&quot;Are you sure this is alright, Yuki-han?&quot; Midori whispered loudly.<br/>
With her sleeves tied back, the bottom of her kimono hitched up, and<br/>
her practice naginata slung over her shoulder, Midori looked like the<br/>
stereotypical image of the female samuraicaring for the home, but<br/>
ready to defend it as well.<br/>
	&quot;Of course, Midori-san. Now take your stance,&quot; replied Yuki. Grinning<br/>
confidently, she moved her wooden sword into chudan stance. Under the<br/>
rules of Tendo Ryuu, she was required as an instructor to assume the<br/>
role of uketachi, or &quot;receiving sword&quot;, during one-on-one training,<br/>
allowing the student to learn the strengths and weaknesses of their<br/>
particular technique, whatever weapon of Tendo Ryuu&#39;s broad curriculum<br/>
they might be using.<br/>
Having taught intensive naginata every day for the last week and a<br/>
half, she&#39;d quickly seen that Midori was the fastest learner, and had<br/>
made a point of practicing with her privately, very early in the<br/>
morning, in order to properly train her to be an assistant instructor.<br/>
Ironically, back in 2004, her assistant instructor had been one Inoue<br/>
Kyoko, a descendant of one of the more famous statesmen of Choshuu,<br/>
Inoue Kaoru. My, how times have changedthought Yuki, as she watched<br/>
Midori slide her naginata to a ready stance.<br/>
This session was special. Here, they would be doing more than<br/>
trainingthey would actually spar, using the entire courtyard as their<br/>
`arena&#39;. In doing so, Yuki wanted to test Midori on her skill, to see<br/>
how much she&#39;d learned to exploit the weakness of the sword against<br/>
the naginata. Her grasping of this point was vital, especially because<br/>
if she ever had to defend herself, it would most likely be against a<br/>
sword.<br/>
Or a gunsaid a voice in the back of Yuki&#39;s head. Scenes from the end<br/>
of the Bakumatsu flashed before her eyes, where thousands of samurai<br/>
loyal to the shogunate were mowed down by the thousands in the<br/>
desperate, pitched battles further north, starting from Nagaoka, to<br/>
Aizu, and all the way to the Goryokaku fort at Hakodate. Squeezing her<br/>
eyelids shut, she forced the visions out of her mind. Not yetthat&#39;s<br/>
not for another 5 years. Not yet<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m ready, Yuki-han.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Very well. Then please begin.&quot;<br/>
Midori nodded, and tightening her grip on the naginata, she took a<br/>
step forward. After what seemed like an eternity, Yuki stepped in.<br/>
&quot;Toh!&quot; Her kiaithe vocal projection of her forcewas more muted than<br/>
usual. It was, after all, early, and she didn&#39;t want to wake anyone up<br/>
if she could help it.<br/>
&quot;Ei!&quot; Midori swept the cut, and dashed her naginata upward on Yuki&#39;s<br/>
sword, knocking it aside and moving around to continue the attack. She<br/>
was too slow, though, and Yuki had already come around and assumed<br/>
another chudan stance.<br/>
&quot;Faster, Midori-san. Faster.&quot;<br/>
Midori closed her eyes, and brought the naginata back around to ready<br/>
position. She paused for a moment, staring Yuki down. Then suddenly,<br/>
she lunged forward, using too much force and not enough finesse.<br/>
Again, Yuki came around and assumed a chudan stance.<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t think, Midori-san. Just move.&quot;<br/>
Sighing in slight exasperation, Midori moved back into ready stance.<br/>
Sensing the change in her attitude, Yuki moved to a low gedan stance,<br/>
crouching a bit as she did so.<br/>
Without warning, Midori came toward her, almost drifting through the<br/>
air. Pointing the blade of the naginata downwards, she tried to come<br/>
in over the top of Yuki&#39;s defense, aiming straight for her chest. Yuki<br/>
watched the blade, mesmerized and utterly in amazement at how someone<br/>
could grasp naginata so quickly in this age. But where her mind<br/>
refused to work, her reflexes did, dashing her sword upwards at<br/>
Midori&#39;s naginata and knocking it out of one of her hands.<br/>
Midori bowed.<br/>
&quot;Thank you, Yuki-han.&quot;<br/>
Yuki relaxed her grip on the sword, and bowed back.<br/>
&quot;Thank you, Midori-san, for being such a willing student to an<br/>
unworthy teacher.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No, I should&quot;<br/>
The guardsmen&#39;s voices cut her off.<br/>
&quot;3rd Unit has arrived! 3rd Unit has arrived!&quot;<br/>
Startled, Midori moved alongside Yuki. Lowering their weapons, they<br/>
bowed together as Saitou and the 3rd Unit passed through the gate.<br/>
Yuki immediately saw Hiro near the front of the unit, looking as<br/>
immersed as ever in his job. Their eyes met briefly, and he nodded to her.<br/>
So something was up. In the &quot;code&quot; they had developed over the last<br/>
two weeks, a silent nod of that sort meant Meet me behind the kitchen<br/>
tonight. We need to talk. The only other person who knew about this<br/>
was, naturally, Midori, without whose cooperation these secret<br/>
meetings could not take place.<br/>
&quot;Midori-san?&quot; Yuki asked. She didn&#39;t need to finish her<br/>
sentenceMidori had seen Hiro nod, and already knew.<br/>
&quot;Yes, Yuki-san. You may.&quot;<br/>
**********<br/>
After what seemed like an agonizingly slow day, the time finally came<br/>
for their rendezvous.<br/>
&quot;You alright?&quot; asked Yuki, the moment Hiro arrived. &quot;You look very<br/>
worried.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;You know why I&#39;m worried,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Tomorrow nightit&#39;s the<br/>
night. There&#39;s a suspicion amongst the patrolmen of all the units that<br/>
something&#39;s about to happen, but as yet, everyone from Saitou-sama on<br/>
up is keeping quiet about it.&quot;<br/>
	Yuki nodded. She knew very well that he was talking about the attack<br/>
on the Ikedaya, which was barely a day away. Having read many accounts<br/>
of that night, she knew about the kind of fighting that took<br/>
placethat there would have been so many fights going on at the same<br/>
time that the beams of the inn would be hacked to pieces, forcing its<br/>
demolition. Yuki also knew that even though Hiro had been fightingand<br/>
sometimes killingin the true classical style for about two weeks, he<br/>
was still thoroughly grounded in the 21st century martial style, which<br/>
was ultimately less aggressive in even its most `traditional&#39; forms.<br/>
She worried, too, but tried not to think too much of that night.<br/>
	&quot;I know. We both know.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro paused.<br/>
	&quot;Yuki. If I fall&quot; His voice trailed off gradually, as if he was<br/>
searching for the right words. &quot;If I fallwhat will you do?&quot;<br/>
	For a moment, there was silence, as Yuki&#39;s eyes brimmed with tears.<br/>
	&quot;Well&quot; she began with a chuckle, trying to keep her sense of humor<br/>
sharp, &quot;Are you going to ask me to do what a true samurai&#39;s wife would<br/>
do, or what I would do?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;We may come from that samurai backgroundand a noble samurai<br/>
background at thatbut we are, ultimately, our own people, and not the<br/>
same as our ancestors. I know what a samurai&#39;s wife would doI don&#39;t<br/>
need to be reminded. I want to know what you, Matsumae Yuki, the woman<br/>
I love, the woman I pledged to honor and care for with my lifeI want<br/>
to know what you would do.&quot;<br/>
	Yuki was utterly speechlessshe hadn&#39;t expected him to ask such a<br/>
question. Silently, she wrapped her arms around Hiro and wept silently.<br/>
	&quot;HiroHirotada-sama,&quot; she murmured, using his full name and honorific<br/>
for once. &quot;Hirotada-samamuch as I love this period, and am somewhat<br/>
enjoying myself, you are the only one who makes it bearable in any<br/>
way. I don&#39;t mind doing small household things, but the way women are<br/>
treated, and the menial labor that they do in this time periodit&#39;s<br/>
utterly, totally miserable at times. If you were to fallI wouldslit<br/>
my throat and willingly follow you in death. Not because it is what a<br/>
samurai&#39;s wife would do, but because it is what I would do. I cannot<br/>
live without you. Not herenot ever.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Shhhhh&quot; Hiro whispered, rocking her gently, back and forth, trying<br/>
his best to soothe her. &quot;Yukiif I fall at the Ikedaya tomorrow, know<br/>
that it I fall with your name on my lips. Andknow that I will see you<br/>
soon after.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Hirotada-sama&quot; Yuki clung to him, unable to rely on her own strength.<br/>
	&quot;AndI know I could get killed for saying this, but I&#39;m going to say<br/>
it anyway. Since you&#39;re the one who led me to kirisuto-kyo,&quot; he added<br/>
quietly, being sure to use the 21st century word for `Christianity&#39;<br/>
and not the 19th century kirishitan, which could cost him his head<br/>
under the anti-Christian laws of those days. &quot;Since you&#39;re the one who<br/>
led me to kirisuto-kyo, please say a silent prayer for me.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;I will&quot; she murmured, burying her face in the folds of his haori.<br/>
&quot;I love you, Hirotada-sama.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;I love you too, Yuki-dono,&quot; he replied, adding the honorific on her<br/>
own name, which he hadn&#39;t done since they&#39;d first met each other.  He<br/>
held her tightly, knowing that he might be holding her for the last time.<br/>
	He moved her chin up, and looked at her deeply and longingly.<br/>
&quot;Always remember I love youeven beyond death.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Chapter 9<br/>
<br/>
July 6th, 1864<br/>
<br/>
Dusk<br/>
<br/>
The time had come for the departure to the Ikedaya. The entire<br/>
Shinsengumi was lined up in the courtyard, armored and ready to deploy.<br/>
Hiro waited impatiently. He knew what no one else didand he was<br/>
beginning to struggle with himself. With the information he possessed,<br/>
he could very well change the course of history. If the information<br/>
was revealed what he knew to the right people, the Choshuu clan would<br/>
be utterly, totally crushed, and Hiro&#39;s family, the Tokugawa, would<br/>
never have been driven from power. The shogunate would be free to<br/>
pursue its systematic plans for Westernization at its own pace,<br/>
solidifying the support of all the great feudal domains of the north<br/>
and west, and then might turn its attention to the neighboring<br/>
countries. It might conquer China, as the Imperial forces had, or it<br/>
might decide to simply trade with it. And then as time went on, Japan<br/>
would probably send samurai and conscripts to the European war in<br/>
1918. And then there was World War IIthat would not be the same,<br/>
either. Might not even happen at all. But there was something that<br/>
Hiro realized after all this-- if the shogunate survived, he himself<br/>
might not exist, and thenhe might not have met Yuki, either<br/>
The power of his clan, or his and Yuki&#39;s existence. Which was more<br/>
important? Which to<br/>
Hijikata&#39;s voice interrupted his thoughts.<br/>
&quot;Attention!&quot;<br/>
There was a wave of motion that passed through the Shinsengumi, and<br/>
then a tense, overwhelming silence. Hijikata nodded to Kondou, who<br/>
stepped forward. Unlike the blue and white haori that everyone else<br/>
wore, Kondou and Hijikata wore white and black ones, denoting their<br/>
rank. Kondou cleared his throat, and began.<br/>
&quot;Rebel activity has peaked in Kyoto over the last month. Murders,<br/>
arson, ambushesthey&#39;re going all-out. Acting on good information and<br/>
evidence, tonight we are going to investigate the area of<br/>
Kawara-machi, on Third Street. Tonight is a pivotal night. In fact, it<br/>
is much like a game of shogi or gowe must seize the initiative, and<br/>
eliminate as many of them as we can. Captains Nagakura, Toudou, and<br/>
Okita will each accompany me, along with a few men from each of their<br/>
units. Also, the following men will accompany me personally: Shimada<br/>
Kai, Hayashi Nobutarou, Kondou Shuuhei, Ikeda Kotarou, Tokugawa<br/>
Hirotada, and Abe Juurou. All other captains and men, follow<br/>
Vice-Chief Hijikata. That is all.&quot;<br/>
	Nods and grunts of approval rippled through the assembled crowd.<br/>
	Okada, Hiro&#39;s friend, patted him on the shoulder.<br/>
	&quot;Congratulations, Tokugawa-kun! You&#39;re going to accompany the commander!&quot;<br/>
	Hiro managed to smile weakly, nodding his thanks. He looked over to<br/>
Saitou, who indicated Kondou with a tilt of his head, granting his<br/>
permission to go. Hiro bowed, and headed over to the commander.<br/>
	&quot;Ah, Tokugawa-kun, glad you could join us. Here, take this.&quot; Kondou<br/>
handed him a paper lantern with go-yo&quot;official business&quot;written on<br/>
it in big, black letters.<br/>
	&quot;Everyone here?&quot; asked Okita, who came up just then with three men<br/>
from his unit.<br/>
	Kondou looked around, counting the people in his group.<br/>
	&quot;Yes, it seems so.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro tightened the strings of his chain-mail helmet, and took a deep<br/>
breath. At long last, it was time to move out. Suddenly, he saw a<br/>
familiar face out of the corner of his eye. Yuki, accompanied by the<br/>
other women, stood on either side of the gate, armed with naginata and<br/>
kodachi. While all the men were out, it would be their job to protect<br/>
the headquarters.<br/>
	Hiro&#39;s gaze met with Yuki&#39;s for a moment. A lifetime of conversations<br/>
and an eternity of embraces seemed to be expressed in that one gaze.<br/>
After what felt like an eternity, the inevitable, dreaded order came.<br/>
	&quot;Move out!&quot;<br/>
	They each turned away, ready to do what had to be done.<br/>
*********<br/>
	After about two hours of quiet yet meticulous searching in the<br/>
Kawara-machi district, they finally arrived. The Ikedaya, a small,<br/>
two-story inn, was right there before them. Aizu clan forces were<br/>
supposed to have joined them over an hour ago, but they hadn&#39;t shown<br/>
up. Kondou had ordered the lanterns put out for the sake of surprise,<br/>
in case this was where the rebels were meeting.<br/>
	Hiro breathed deeply, and steeled himself for the battle that was<br/>
about to begin. Something his father had told him years ago suddenly<br/>
came back to him.<br/>
	&quot;Remember, son, the samurai treats death as an honored guest.&quot;<br/>
	Death will certainly be a visitor tonight, Father, he thought, as<br/>
Okita, Nagakura, and Toudou&#39;s men moved around the building to close<br/>
off the escape routes. Hiro and the others who remained moved closer<br/>
to Kondou.<br/>
	The commander gave a nod to them, and then strode confidently for the<br/>
door.<br/>
	&quot;Open up! Open up!&quot;<br/>
	A lantern came on, and soon a short, disheveled man answered the<br/>
door. He paused for a moment to let his eyes adjust to the ambient<br/>
light. Then he saw Kondou and the men around him, and more<br/>
importantly, their uniforms. His eyes went wide with shock.<br/>
	&quot;Hey! We&#39;re being searched! Get r&quot; Kondou&#39;s blade passed through his<br/>
neck, cutting him off.<br/>
	&quot;Move! Move! Move!&quot; shouted Kondou, bounding up the stairs. Hiro,<br/>
Okita, and two others were right behind him, drawing their swords in<br/>
near-unison. They ran for the first room, where the single lantern<br/>
that had been on was suddenly extinguished. Kondou tore the sliding<br/>
door open.<br/>
	About twenty men sat in the dark, many of them with their swords<br/>
already drawn.<br/>
	Kondou spoke up, eager to at least try to get them to surrender.<br/>
	&quot;I am Kondou Isami, Commander of the Shinsengumi. We have this inn<br/>
surrounded. In the name of the Kyoto Military Commission and Lord<br/>
Matsudaira, I order you to surrender, or face the consequences.&quot;<br/>
	They never want the easy way out, thought Hiro, as he moved to a<br/>
chudan stance. There was an awkward silence, as neither side seemed<br/>
willing to budge. Finally, one of the rebels moved. In the stillness<br/>
of the night, Hiro felt like time had no meaning, as he watched the<br/>
man slowly rise up and draw breath in for a kiai. Suddenly, though,<br/>
time snapped back to normal speed, and the man&#39;s kiai erupted across<br/>
the dead silence of the night.<br/>
	&quot;KYAA!&quot;<br/>
	Hiro&#39;s eyes widened in shock and horror as Kondou unleashed the full<br/>
force of his Tennen Rishin Ryuu training, slashing the man in half<br/>
across his chest. The rebels tensed, and suddenly, all of them fell on<br/>
Kondou and the others.<br/>
	Now was not the time to think. Hiro parried the first incoming<br/>
strike, sweeping it aside with the usual grace of his Yagyu Shinkage<br/>
training. The man jumped back, and then returned, his eyes gleaming in<br/>
the moonlight that filtered in through the slats of the inn&#39;s high<br/>
windows. Hiro suddenly remembered that he couldn&#39;t be gracious. He had<br/>
to be lethal. Strengthening his grip, he allowed rage to flow through<br/>
himpure, unabated, rage. He had felt this rage every time he read<br/>
about his family&#39;s fall from powerit was a burning, searing fire<br/>
unlike anything he&#39;d ever known. When he first read of it in a history<br/>
book at school he&#39;d wanted to torture and slowly kill every western<br/>
samurai he could get his hands on, but since they&#39;d all been dead for<br/>
over a century, he did the next best thingafter returning home, he<br/>
set his textbook up on a bamboo stake and slashed it to pieces with a<br/>
kitchen knife. His parents punished him severely for using the knife,<br/>
but had understood his rage, advising Hiro to channel the energy into<br/>
his martial arts training, instead.<br/>
	Now, though, he was there, in the midst of the fire and rain of blood<br/>
of those days. He was capable of satiating his burning desire for<br/>
retribution. At last, I will have vengeance, thought Hiro, as he swept<br/>
the man&#39;s sword and slashed upward across his chest with a<br/>
right-handed upward diagonal cut. At last<br/>
	&quot;Miburo bastard! I&#39;ll kill you!&quot; shouted another man, running at him<br/>
with his sword held in jodan position. Hiro slid into a countering<br/>
position, sword vertical to one side, and met the attack, shattering<br/>
his enemy&#39;s sword and then going into an upward slash across his chest.<br/>
	&quot;Worthless Choshuu scum! I&#39;ll kill you!&quot;<br/>
	On the other side of the room, Okita shouted at Kondou to get<br/>
downstairssomething about Toudou and Nagakura needing help. Hiro saw<br/>
Kondou race back down the stairs to the ground floor, where there<br/>
seemed to be sounds of even fiercer fighting.<br/>
	Just then, about ten more rebels came in from the other rooms, armed<br/>
with swords and spears. Hiro, Okita, and the four other men still on<br/>
the floor backed in toward each other, tightening up their mutual defense.<br/>
	Outnumbered five to one. Not a bad way to go down.<br/>
	Okita stepped into the Tennen Rishin Ryuu&#39;s highly lethal hiraseigan<br/>
stance, ready to continue the attack. With a kiai, he launched himself<br/>
at the enemy again, while the others did the same.<br/>
	On and on, they slashed left and right, cutting through the summer<br/>
night and the rain of blood. No matter how hard they fought, though,<br/>
the enemy&#39;s number didn&#39;t seem to dwindle at all. The only thing they<br/>
could do was fight to hold them off, hopefully until Hijikata&#39;s group<br/>
or the Aizu forces of the Military Commission arrived.<br/>
	Hiro was lost, intoxicated in the crimson tide. He smiled<br/>
grotesquely, taking pleasure in his enemies&#39; pain, remembering<br/>
accounts of the slaughter of the pro-Tokugawa domains in 1868,<br/>
especially that of the Aizu clan, who suffered until the 1920s as<br/>
&quot;enemies of the Court&quot;. He recalled all that had happened, and took<br/>
pleasure in paying them back in advance for what they would later do.<br/>
	Suddenly, the rebels knocked open the screen doors that led out onto<br/>
the small balcony, and jumped off onto the roofs of nearby buildings.<br/>
The Shinsengumi members pursued them, not wanting to let anyone get<br/>
away. Picking a target at random, Hiro went into a hiraseigan stance<br/>
himself, and ran, not paying any attention to his enemy&#39;s spear.<br/>
Closer and closer he came, on a collision course with both the man and<br/>
the spear. Just then, at nearly point-blank range, the man let go of<br/>
his spear and began to slump. Hiro still didn&#39;t pay any attention,<br/>
running the man through with his blade. Yanking it out, he noticed a<br/>
long, metal dagger protruding from the corpse&#39;s back. He looked up. A<br/>
man in black clothing and armor stood in front of him, and nodded in<br/>
approval.<br/>
	&quot;Next time, Tokugawa Hirotada-san, pay attention to the spear.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro gasped. How did this man know who he was? Then he rememberedthe<br/>
Shinsengumi had a spy at the Ikedaya incident: Yamazaki Susumu, the<br/>
head of the investigations division. It all made senseno one else<br/>
would be snooping around in the dead of night in support of the<br/>
Shinsengumi&#39;s operations aside from Yamazaki.<br/>
	&quot;Oh, and look behind you,&quot; Yamazaki added, tossing another dagger<br/>
inches over Hiro&#39;s shoulder. Another rebel samurai slumped over and<br/>
fell, his sword passing barely a foot away from Hiro&#39;s neck as it<br/>
fell. By the time Hiro turned back around, Yamazaki was gone. Just<br/>
like a spy, too, Hiro thought for a moment, before turning back to the<br/>
matter at hand.<br/>
	By now, the rebels were losing ground, and fleeing back into the inn.<br/>
Okita and the others once again gave chase, running back up and<br/>
leaping for the balcony.<br/>
	Hiro picked out his last man, dashing toward him with his sword held<br/>
high. All the rage he&#39;d felt, all the anger and resentment toward the<br/>
Choshuu clan and its historic aggression against his familyall of<br/>
those emotions seemed to radiate from his sword, charging the air with<br/>
a raging, uncontrollable energy. The rebel&#39;s sword started moving<br/>
upward, inch by inch, second by second, just as Hiro&#39;s sword swept<br/>
downward, inch by inch. There was a resounding clang of metal, and the<br/>
night was illuminated by sparks for a brief moment. Hiro laughed, a<br/>
maniacal, sickening laugh, as he saw his opponent&#39;s head fly off his<br/>
neck, sending a shower of blood flying everywhere. Feeling wetness on<br/>
his left shoulder, he paused to touch it, holding his hand in front of<br/>
his face and turning white at the realization that it was his own<br/>
warm, wine-red blood he was feeling.<br/>
	&quot;Tokugawa-san?&quot; asked Okita. &quot;Tokugawa-san? Are you alright?&quot;<br/>
	Hiro couldn&#39;t hear anything but the loud whooshing sound that<br/>
suddenly reverberated in his ears.<br/>
	&quot;Dirty Choshuu scum peasant dogsShould&#39;ve slaughtered you all when<br/>
we had the chance&quot;<br/>
	His grip on the sword suddenly went slack, sending the blade<br/>
clattering to the blood-soaked floor mats. Remember, my son, if you<br/>
should ever be in any serious situation which merits the thought of<br/>
the next life, just remember one thing-- the samurai treats death as<br/>
an honored guestthe voice of his father reminded him, as did the<br/>
voices of all his ancestors, all the way back to Matsudaira Hirotada,<br/>
his namesake. Wanting to be a dutiful son and heir, he obeyed.<br/>
	As he fell forward, he suddenly remembered one other thingwhat he&#39;d<br/>
said the night before.<br/>

Chapter 10<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Yuki-han! They&#39;re coming back!&quot;<br/>
	Midori pointed up the path to where a thin cluster of lanterns could<br/>
be seen, slowly approaching the gate of the headquarters. Yuki stared<br/>
at the shapes in the distance, squinting to try and figure out if it<br/>
was really them. She knew that the timing was right, and that they<br/>
were supposed to be back at any minute. But in Bakumatsu-era Kyoto, in<br/>
the dark, it was wrong to assume anything of any sort, especially that<br/>
a large crowd of people approaching the Yagi estate had to be none<br/>
other than the Shinsengumi. Just to be safe, Yuki lowered her naginata<br/>
into ready position.<br/>
	&quot;No one stands down until we&#39;re absolutely sure it&#39;s them,&quot; she ordered.<br/>
	The others also moved their weapons to a ready stance. Leaning<br/>
forward, they strained their eyes in the darkness to try and make out<br/>
the faces of the approaching crowd of samurai. If it wasn&#39;t the<br/>
Shinsengumi, then they were resolved to do their best in standing<br/>
their ground, in order to do their part for the unit. If it was indeed<br/>
Choshuu samurai who were approaching, they would not be allowed to<br/>
pass easily, and would pay dearly for every inch of ground they took.<br/>
	&quot;Go-yo! Kyoto Military Commission! Official business!&quot;<br/>
	The repeated shout suddenly sent a wave of relief through the women<br/>
at the gate, making some of them relax the death-grip they had on<br/>
their naginata. So it was the Shinsengumi, back at last after a long<br/>
night of fighting. By Yuki&#39;s estimate, they had been out for about<br/>
seven hoursfrom around seven o&#39;clock in the evening, to the current 2<br/>
AM. She&#39;d known the Ikedaya incident was long, but no account of it<br/>
had prepared her for how long it actually was.<br/>
	Eager to find Hiro, she ran up to the approaching samurai. Kondou,<br/>
Hijikata, Okita, and Saitou led the group in front, with Okita<br/>
carrying the Shinsengumi banner. Yuki noticed that they weren&#39;t<br/>
alonethere were a large number of Aizu samurai with them, as well,<br/>
clad in black haori and looking generally more well-groomed than their<br/>
Shinsengumi comrades.<br/>
Just as Yuki was about to ask someone for the location of the 3rd<br/>
Unit, she noticed several wounded Shinsengumi members being carried on<br/>
wooden stretchers. Moving smoothly alongside the stretcher bearers,<br/>
she looked over the wounded with a combination of visceral disgust and<br/>
irrepressible curiosityshe&#39;d never seen people wounded by swords<br/>
before. The cuts seemed so clean, so surgically precise. This was a<br/>
testament not only to the skill of Japanese swordsmen, but also to the<br/>
razor-sharp edge of nearly any Japanese sword.<br/>
As she walked amongst the stretcher bearers, though, one of the<br/>
wounded suddenly caught her eye. She wasn&#39;t sure why, but something<br/>
was familiar about his height and build. He had a large gash on his<br/>
left shoulder, the red of his blood staining the sky blue color of his<br/>
overcoat. And his eyesHis eyes were looking straight up to the sky,<br/>
but were emptier than any she&#39;d seen before<br/>
Yuki&#39;s hand went to her mouth in shock.<br/>
&quot;HHirotada-sama!&quot;<br/>
He didn&#39;t movejust kept staring blankly at the night sky, deaf to<br/>
everything.<br/>
Yuki. If I fallwhat will you do?<br/>
Yuki&#39;s eyes filled with silent tears as she remembered their<br/>
conversation-- his question and her response, both equally shocking<br/>
and yet, both were things that needed to be said.<br/>
&quot;I would willingly follow you in death&quot; she whispered, repeating her<br/>
response of that day. Then she paused, and squeezed his hand, choking<br/>
back tears.<br/>
&quot;Willinglybut you&#39;re not dead yet.&quot;<br/>
********<br/>
	Hiro was alonetotally and utterly alone. He still wore his clothing<br/>
and battle gear from the attack, but he was by himself, walking in a<br/>
vast, open field of grass, stretching as far as his eyes could see.<br/>
Looking down at his shoulder, he found that there was a large blood<br/>
stain on his uniform, but that his shoulder didn&#39;t hurt anymore. He<br/>
sighed in relief.<br/>
	I would willingly follow you in death. Willingly, but you&#39;re not dead<br/>
yetcame a familiar voice. His heart leapt.<br/>
	&quot;Yuki! Where are you?&quot;<br/>
	No answer.<br/>
	&quot;Yuki!&quot;<br/>
	Hiro walked around the open expanse, trying to find where his wife<br/>
could be, but to no avail. Exhausted, he sank down to the ground,<br/>
lying on his back and looking up at the sky.<br/>
	Not dead yetcame Yuki&#39;s voice again.<br/>
	&quot;Not dead? Well then where am I? There certainly isn&#39;t this much<br/>
grass anywhere in Kyoto!&quot;<br/>
	He sighed in exhaustion, and closed his eyes.<br/>
	&quot;So what brings you here?&quot; asked someone. Hiro&#39;s eyes flew open, and<br/>
he found himself looking into a face very similar to his own. His jaw<br/>
dropped at the realization that he was looking at his direct ancestor,<br/>
the fifteenth and final shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Moving to his<br/>
knees, he bowed in awe.<br/>
	&quot;Yoshinobu-sama!&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Obviously,&quot; he answered, sitting down next to Hiro. &quot;Now, I&#39;ll ask<br/>
again. You&#39;ve got a war to fight, a wife to protect, and honor to<br/>
uphold,&quot; Yoshinobu paused, emphasizing each of the rest of his words.<br/>
&quot;Why are you here?&quot;<br/>
Hiro stared at his ancestor blankly.<br/>
&quot;Idon&#39;t know. Really, Yoshinobu-sama. I don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
Yoshinobu&#39;s dark eyebrows furrowed.<br/>
&quot;Rise.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Rise.&quot;<br/>
Hiro shook his head in confusion. He wasn&#39;t sure what his ancestor<br/>
meantrise? Rise where?<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll say it again. Rise.&quot;<br/>
Hiro shut his eyes. Whatever was going on, he didn&#39;t like it one bit.<br/>
The whole &quot;talking to the ancestor&quot; bit was really getting to be annoying.<br/>
&quot;Idon&#39;tunderstandwhyyou&#39;retellingmetoriseIdon&#39;tgetitIreallydon&#39;tunders&quot;<br/>
His eyes flew open, seeing another familiar face.<br/>
&quot;Shhhlie down, Hirotada-sama. Please.&quot;<br/>
Hiro slowly eased himself back down onto the futon. Out of the corner<br/>
of his eye, he could see other men around him, similarly injured,<br/>
receiving treatment from the serving women and a tall, thin man whom<br/>
he recognized from one of his family&#39;s Bakumatsu photo albums as<br/>
Takani Ryuutarou, Lord Matsudaira Katamori&#39;s personal physician.<br/>
As with so many times in the past two weeks, Hiro&#39;s mental history<br/>
textbook opened and began to narrate itself. He recalled that after<br/>
the victory at the Ikedaya, some of the Aizu samurai had very quickly<br/>
brought word to the Military Commission and Lord Matsudaira about the<br/>
Shinsengumi&#39;s exceptional conduct in the battle. Thoroughly impressed,<br/>
the lord had immediately sent Doctor Takani to the Shinsengumi, to<br/>
help treat the wounded. Not only that, but the lord had also sent his<br/>
personal congratulations on the victory, as well as the promise of a<br/>
monetary reward for the unit&#39;s exceptional service. All this and more<br/>
was in store, but not just yet.<br/>
&quot;Take it easy&quot;whispered Yuki. &quot;You&#39;ve been wounded in the shoulder,<br/>
Hirotada-sama.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yeah&quot; murmured Hiro. It still felt a bit awkward, hearing Yuki<br/>
address him with such overly dignified terms, but given her definite<br/>
shock, it wasn&#39;t entirely a surprise. If nothing else, it certainly<br/>
fit the era better, even if he did prefer a simple &quot;Hiro-kun&quot; from<br/>
her. `When in Rome&#39;, as the Americans say, he thought to himself.<br/>
He looked over at his shoulder, which appeared to be tightly wrapped<br/>
in gauze.<br/>
&quot;I know thatA Choshuu scumbag&#39;s blade passed right through it. It was<br/>
certainly the last thing he did, though.&quot;<br/>
Yuki took a moist cloth, and wiped Hiro&#39;s forehead, cleaning off the<br/>
cold sweat that had settled there during his period of unconsciousness.<br/>
&quot;Doctor Takani stitched you up, but you&#39;re going to have to rest.<br/>
Please, just take it easy on yourself.&quot;<br/>
Hiro paused, taking a deep, steadying breath.<br/>
&quot;What about Ikedaya? What happened?&quot;<br/>
Yuki smiled, and gave him a quick kiss, quick enough not to be<br/>
noticed. Hiro smiled back at her, feeling a sort of healing that the<br/>
doctor could not provide, wash through his body, cleansing him of much<br/>
of his fatigue and agony, and leaving him with a gentle feeling of<br/>
warmth everywhere. He knew he needed to rest awhile, but he already<br/>
felt much, much better. Yuki leaned in close to him and whispered, so<br/>
low that only Hiro could hear.<br/>
&quot;You know what happened, koishii. We won&quot;<br/>

Chapter 11<br/>
<br/>
July 15th<br/>
<br/>
The night of chaos at the Ikedaya was slowly becoming a distant<br/>
memory. Life in Kyoto moved on as usual, but things were different for<br/>
the Shinsengumi. Gone were the days of their appellation by most as<br/>
&quot;wolves&quot;. Since they had saved the city from almost certain<br/>
annihilation, they were still feared, but were now respected by many<br/>
more people than beforecommoner, lord, and courtier alike. In the<br/>
wake of their success, Lord Matsudaira had personally sent a monetary<br/>
reward for the Shinsengumi&#39;s exceptional conduct, as had Emperor<br/>
Komei. It seemed as though the Shinsengumi was on the top of the<br/>
world, unshakeable in its sincerity to the Shogunate&#39;s cause and its<br/>
pursuit of public order in Kyoto.<br/>
Away from the hustle and bustle of the Shinsengumi headquarters, the<br/>
Yanagi-ya was silent, adrift in the morning calm. The sunlight,<br/>
stronger now that the sun had risen a bit above the horizon, filtered<br/>
in through the shutters, casting patterns of light and shadow on the<br/>
floor mats inside. Feeling the warmth on their faces, Hiro and Yuki<br/>
awoke from a deep peaceful sleep. They&#39;d had a very, very good night<br/>
together, and the new day seemed wonderful and bright, full of new<br/>
memories to be made. There were other battles to be fought, but for<br/>
the time being, they could focus on loving again.<br/>
Slowly opening her eyes, Yuki pressed close against Hiro&#39;s body,<br/>
losing herself in his scent, happily drowning in the ecstasy of<br/>
feeling his bare skin against her own. Gently, she kissed the long,<br/>
dark red scar on his left shoulder, and traced its path with her<br/>
little finger.<br/>
&quot;Good morning, Hirotada-sama,&quot; she murmured with a smile.<br/>
Hiro ran his fingers through her hair, which hung freely in dark,<br/>
glossy waves over her shoulders and back. Yuki&#39;s hair had a tendency<br/>
of growing rather fast. Hiro remembered that her hair was only<br/>
chin-length when they had arrived, but now, it reached down to her<br/>
shoulders. Her bangs had also grown longer and silkier. Hiro thought<br/>
it was cute when she would tuck them behind her ears every now and then.<br/>
&quot;Good morning, koishii. I see that they&#39;re right when they say that<br/>
`kissing it will make it feel better&#39;. And you know, you really don&#39;t<br/>
have to call me `-sama&#39;.&quot;<br/>
She sighed deeply and passionately, hanging onto him as though he was<br/>
the only real thing in the world.<br/>
&quot;I enjoy saying it,&quot; she said playfully, stroking his chin.<br/>
&quot;To-ku-ga-wa Hi-ro-ta-da-sa-ma. It sounds different.&quot;<br/>
Hiro rolled his eyes. Their pillow talk could be very amusing, indeed.<br/>
&quot;If you want to, then I guess that&#39;s alright.&quot;<br/>
A comforting silence followed.<br/>
&quot;Neh, anata,&quot; whispered Yuki. &quot;Is Kinmon really in four days?&quot;<br/>
Hiro sighed. The Battle of KinmonChoshuu&#39;s attempted retaliation for<br/>
the loss at Ikedayawas only four days away. He knew that at that very<br/>
moment, thousands of Choshuu samurai had left their home domain and<br/>
were marching across the Chugoku region, or sailing in vessels across<br/>
the Inland Sea, all bearing eastward toward Kyoto. At the same time,<br/>
several times that number of pro-Shogunate warriors were also<br/>
converging on Kyoto, from domains as near as Kuwana and Aizu to as<br/>
distant a region as Satsuma. In four days&#39; time, they would meet at<br/>
Kinmon, the &quot;forbidden&quot; western gate of the Imperial palace. The<br/>
battle itself would only last a matter of hours, but would cause<br/>
untold ruin and destruction, consuming much of Kyoto in fire. The<br/>
Shogunate would win, but at that terrible price not only to its<br/>
soldiers but to the city as a wholeand just like before the Battle of<br/>
Ikedaya, Hiro wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d survive. He couldn&#39;t avoid Yuki&#39;s<br/>
question, though.<br/>
&quot;Yes. Kinmon, or Hamagurigomon, or whatever, happens in four days.<br/>
What&#39;s more, I go back to active duty tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
Yuki held his face in her hands, and smiled as courageously as she<br/>
could. She had to be strong, for his sake at least.<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be fine. You know that, right, Hirotada-sama? I got<br/>
through the night of the Ikedaya Incident in one piece, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br/>
Hiro embraced her tightly.<br/>
&quot;Yes. And you saved me, too. Thank you again.&quot;<br/>
Yuki giggled.<br/>
&quot;That was more Doctor Takani&#39;s handiwork than mine.&quot;<br/>
&quot;All the same,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Thank you. And I&#39;ll say it againanata<br/>
ga watashinotaisetsuna takaramono. You are the most precious treasure<br/>
of my life.&quot;<br/>
Hiro caressed her face softly, and then brought her lips to his. They<br/>
kissed deeply, a kiss that tasted of the exhilaration of life and the<br/>
thrill of victory.<br/>
Suddenly someone knocked on the sliding door, interrupting their kiss<br/>
rather abruptly. Rolling out of bed, Hiro and Yuki quickly donned<br/>
their yukata. As Yuki hurriedly started folding the futon, Hiro walked<br/>
over to the door and opened it a crack.<br/>
&quot;Harada-samaMidori-san&quot;<br/>
Harada smiled broadly, giving Hiro a good-natured pat on the shoulder.<br/>
&quot; `Morning, Lord Shogun! Hope you had a good night!&quot; He indicated a<br/>
small stack of trays in Midori&#39;s arms. &quot;Want to have breakfast together?&quot;<br/>
Hiro glanced over his shoulder at Yuki, who had just finished folding<br/>
the futon and putting it in a corner. Opening the door the whole way,<br/>
he bowed curtly.<br/>
&quot;We&#39;d be honored, Harada-sama.&quot;<br/>
Harada turned to Midori, and nodded.<br/>
&quot;Well then, Mi-chan.&quot;<br/>
	Harada greeted Yuki, who by now had also come up to the door.<br/>
	&quot;Good morning, Yuki-san! You sure lookrested.&quot;<br/>
	Yuki giggled happily.<br/>
	&quot;You could say that.&quot; She noticed that Midori was also there, and<br/>
smiled. &quot;I see Midori-nee is here too.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro scratched his chin in curiosity. This was a phrase he hadn&#39;t<br/>
heard before.<br/>
	&quot;Midori-nee?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Yeah! We&#39;ve become quite close in the last few weeks, Hiro-sama!<br/>
Isn&#39;t that right, Midori-nee?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Sure is, Yu-chan,&quot; answered Midori, as she arranged the trays and<br/>
the food on them properly. Turning to Hiro, she gave a short bow.<br/>
&quot;Hirotada-sama, your wife is amazing. Somehow she can relate to<br/>
anything, understand any circumstance. Not only is she a great cook,<br/>
she&#39;s also a great naginata teacher, as well. She&#39;sbeyond words.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro allowed himself a small smile.<br/>
If you only knew why both of us know so much<br/>
Harada elbowed Hiro with a laugh, interrupting his musings.<br/>
&quot;Well, shall we?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ahyes, of course, Harada-sama.&quot;<br/>
They all sat down, and began eating at a leisurely pace, enjoying the<br/>
coolness of the room and the cheerful, bright sunlight coming in from<br/>
the outside. Taking a sip of sake, Harada tapped Hiro on the shoulder.<br/>
&quot;Say, Tokugawa-kun, have you heard the rumors?&quot;<br/>
Hiro knew that he was most probably referring to the impending battle,<br/>
but feigned ignorance, hoping to hear Harada&#39;s version of the rumor.<br/>
After all, he reasoned, history is more interesting when you hear a<br/>
different version of it.<br/>
&quot;NoI&#39;ve been out for most of the time since Ikedaya.&quot;<br/>
Harada started laughing so hard, he nearly choked on his sake.<br/>
&quot;In more ways than onebut anyway, the rumor is that there&#39;s going to<br/>
be another battle soon. Kondou-sama said something yesterday morning<br/>
about getting spy reports that there are thousands of you-know-which<br/>
clan warriors marching here in droves, by land and by sea. The Chugoku<br/>
and Inland Sea are swarming with `em.&quot;<br/>
Continuing the act, Hiro faked shocknot entirely dishonestly, though,<br/>
as he was still worried about what the outcome would mean for him<br/>
personally.<br/>
&quot;Really? You don&#39;t say&quot;<br/>
Midori pouted, and leaned against Harada&#39;s shoulder.<br/>
&quot;Mou, Sano-kun, please talk about pleasant things. We&#39;re all off duty<br/>
here&quot;<br/>
Harada laughed pleasantly.<br/>
&quot;Mi-chan, you&#39;re so adorable when you pout. Alright, we won&#39;t talk<br/>
business. For now, we&#39;ll just enjoy the food and the company.&quot;<br/>
Instinctively, Hiro raised his sake cup, and almost said Hear, hear in<br/>
English, which could&#39;ve gotten him into deep trouble.<br/>
Harada and Midori looked at his sudden pause with a mix of confusion<br/>
and amusement.<br/>
&quot;Is the sake too strong, Tokugawa-kun?&quot; Harada asked, breaking the<br/>
silence.<br/>
Yuki looked at him in thinly veiled shock, fully aware of what was<br/>
going on in his head, and what had nearly come out of his mouth. The<br/>
two of them had received their college education abroad, in the United<br/>
States, and had picked up some American mannerisms as a result.<br/>
However, they were now in a situation where people of their station<br/>
had no logical business speaking English unless they were spies for<br/>
the Shogunate or the rebels. All Yuki could do was watch as Hiro<br/>
teetered on the brink of inadvertently ruining everything.<br/>
Gathering his wits about him, he laughed, and forcibly willed Japanese<br/>
to come out of his mouth.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s been awhile since I had sakeit tastes stronger than I<br/>
remembered. At any rate, I&#39;ll drink to what Midori-san said,<br/>
Harada-sama. To peace and calm. Beautiful and priceless, yet as<br/>
ephemeral as the falling cherry blossoms.&quot;<br/>

Shogunate would win, but at that terrible price not only to its<br/>
soldiers but to the city as a wholeand just like before the Battle of<br/>
Ikedaya, Hiro wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d survive. He couldn&#39;t avoid Yuki&#39;s<br/>
question, though.<br/>
&quot;Yes. Kinmon, or Hamagurigomon, or whatever, happens in four days.<br/>
What&#39;s more, I go back to active duty tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
Yuki held his face in her hands, and smiled as courageously as she<br/>
could. She had to be strong, for his sake at least.<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be fine. You know that, right, Hirotada-sama? I got<br/>
through the night of the Ikedaya Incident in one piece, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br/>
Hiro embraced her tightly.<br/>
&quot;Yes. And you saved me, too. Thank you again.&quot;<br/>
Yuki giggled.<br/>
&quot;That was more Doctor Takani&#39;s handiwork than mine.&quot;<br/>
&quot;All the same,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Thank you. And I&#39;ll say it againanata<br/>
ga watashinotaisetsuna takaramono. You are the most precious treasure<br/>
of my life.&quot;<br/>
Hiro caressed her face softly, and then brought her lips to his. They<br/>
kissed deeply, a kiss that tasted of the exhilaration of life and the<br/>
thrill of victory.<br/>
Suddenly someone knocked on the sliding door, interrupting their kiss<br/>
rather abruptly. Rolling out of bed, Hiro and Yuki quickly donned<br/>
their yukata. As Yuki hurriedly started folding the futon, Hiro walked<br/>
over to the door and opened it a crack.<br/>
&quot;Harada-samaMidori-san&quot;<br/>
Harada smiled broadly, giving Hiro a good-natured pat on the shoulder.<br/>
&quot; `Morning, Lord Shogun! Hope you had a good night!&quot; He indicated a<br/>
small stack of trays in Midori&#39;s arms. &quot;Want to have breakfast together?&quot;<br/>
Hiro glanced over his shoulder at Yuki, who had just finished folding<br/>
the futon and putting it in a corner. Opening the door the whole way,<br/>
he bowed curtly.<br/>
&quot;We&#39;d be honored, Harada-sama.&quot;<br/>
Harada turned to Midori, and nodded.<br/>
&quot;Well then, Mi-chan.&quot;<br/>
	Harada greeted Yuki, who by now had also come up to the door.<br/>
	&quot;Good morning, Yuki-san! You sure lookrested.&quot;<br/>
	Yuki giggled happily.<br/>
	&quot;You could say that.&quot; She noticed that Midori was also there, and<br/>
smiled. &quot;I see Midori-nee is here too.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro scratched his chin in curiosity. This was a phrase he hadn&#39;t<br/>
heard before.<br/>
	&quot;Midori-nee?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Yeah! We&#39;ve become quite close in the last few weeks, Hiro-sama!<br/>
Isn&#39;t that right, Midori-nee?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Sure is, Yu-chan,&quot; answered Midori, as she arranged the trays and<br/>
the food on them properly. Turning to Hiro, she gave a short bow.<br/>
&quot;Hirotada-sama, your wife is amazing. Somehow she can relate to<br/>
anything, understand any circumstance. Not only is she a great cook,<br/>
she&#39;s also a great naginata teacher, as well. She&#39;sbeyond words.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro allowed himself a small smile.<br/>
If you only knew why both of us know so much<br/>
Harada elbowed Hiro with a laugh, interrupting his musings.<br/>
&quot;Well, shall we?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ahyes, of course, Harada-sama.&quot;<br/>
They all sat down, and began eating at a leisurely pace, enjoying the<br/>
coolness of the room and the cheerful, bright sunlight coming in from<br/>
the outside. Taking a sip of sake, Harada tapped Hiro on the shoulder.<br/>
&quot;Say, Tokugawa-kun, have you heard the rumors?&quot;<br/>
Hiro knew that he was most probably referring to the impending battle,<br/>
but feigned ignorance, hoping to hear Harada&#39;s version of the rumor.<br/>
After all, he reasoned, history is more interesting when you hear a<br/>
different version of it.<br/>
&quot;NoI&#39;ve been out for most of the time since Ikedaya.&quot;<br/>
Harada started laughing so hard, he nearly choked on his sake.<br/>
&quot;In more ways than onebut anyway, the rumor is that there&#39;s going to<br/>
be another battle soon. Kondou-sama said something yesterday morning<br/>
about getting spy reports that there are thousands of you-know-which<br/>
clan warriors marching here in droves, by land and by sea. The Chugoku<br/>
and Inland Sea are swarming with `em.&quot;<br/>
Continuing the act, Hiro faked shocknot entirely dishonestly, though,<br/>
as he was still worried about what the outcome would mean for him<br/>
personally.<br/>
&quot;Really? You don&#39;t say&quot;<br/>
Midori pouted, and leaned against Harada&#39;s shoulder.<br/>
&quot;Mou, Sano-kun, please talk about pleasant things. We&#39;re all off duty<br/>
here&quot;<br/>
Harada laughed pleasantly.<br/>
&quot;Mi-chan, you&#39;re so adorable when you pout. Alright, we won&#39;t talk<br/>
business. For now, we&#39;ll just enjoy the food and the company.&quot;<br/>
Instinctively, Hiro raised his sake cup, and almost said Hear, hear in<br/>
English, which could&#39;ve gotten him into deep trouble.<br/>
Harada and Midori looked at his sudden pause with a mix of confusion<br/>
and amusement.<br/>
&quot;Is the sake too strong, Tokugawa-kun?&quot; Harada asked, breaking the<br/>
silence.<br/>
Yuki looked at him in thinly veiled shock, fully aware of what was<br/>
going on in his head, and what had nearly come out of his mouth. The<br/>
two of them had received their college education abroad, in the United<br/>
States, and had picked up some American mannerisms as a result.<br/>
However, they were now in a situation where people of their station<br/>
had no logical business speaking English unless they were spies for<br/>
the Shogunate or the rebels. All Yuki could do was watch as Hiro<br/>
teetered on the brink of inadvertently ruining everything.<br/>
Gathering his wits about him, he laughed, and forcibly willed Japanese<br/>
to come out of his mouth.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s been awhile since I had sakeit tastes stronger than I<br/>
remembered. At any rate, I&#39;ll drink to what Midori-san said,<br/>
Harada-sama. To peace and calm. Beautiful and priceless, yet as<br/>
ephemeral as the falling cherry blossoms.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
July 18<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Ah, Tokugawa-kun, good to see you. Please, have a seat.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro bowed, and took his seat next to Saitou, facing Kondou and Hijikata.<br/>
	&quot;Thank you, Kondou-sama, Hijikata-sama.&quot;<br/>
	Kondou nodded briskly, and pulled some papers out from a stack to his<br/>
right, laying them flat on the mats in front of him.<br/>
	&quot;No use in wasting time, so let&#39;s get straight to business, shall<br/>
we?&quot; asked the commander briskly.<br/>
Hijikata and Saitou nodded their assent quietly. Kondou continued.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve spoken with the men who were upstairs with you at the Ikedaya.<br/>
From what they told me, I understand that you fought almost<br/>
unstoppably, getting cut repeatedly but not allowing your body to give<br/>
out until you were sure that the floor was secure. You even went out<br/>
onto the nearby roofs with Okita-san and chased some people who had<br/>
tried to escape.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Well,&quot; said Hiro sheepishly, remembering his run-in with Yamazaki on<br/>
the roof, after he&#39;d almost been impaled by a spear. &quot;I really don&#39;t<br/>
remember much. It was all so dark.&quot;<br/>
	Kondou nodded.<br/>
	&quot;Still, I believe that your conduct was exemplary. I&#39;ve spoken with<br/>
Hijikata-san and Saitou-san, and with their approval, I&#39;m going to<br/>
promote you to gochoucorporal.&quot; He handed the promotion papers to<br/>
Hiro, who accepted them with two bows, first a short bob of his head,<br/>
then a full bow all the way to the floor mats.<br/>
	&quot;Thank you so much, Kondou-sama. I am unworthy of such honor, but I<br/>
will do my utmost to deserve your trust.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro was about to sit back up when Hijikata cleared his throat.<br/>
	&quot;If you&#39;ll stop being overly grateful, Corporal, there&#39;s  something<br/>
else that Kondou-san wishes to say.&quot;<br/>
	Slightly burning with rage, Hiro kept his gaze turned to the<br/>
floorboards. His gut reaction, had revealing his background been an<br/>
option, would&#39;ve been to tear Hijikata apart for what he&#39;d said.<br/>
Sucking up? Hiro was simply being respectful to Kondou, who was one of<br/>
his childhood heroes and whom he personally admired. Hijikata was<br/>
different for him. He had a grudging respect for the man, and<br/>
admiration for the effectiveness of his technique, but otherwise, he<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand him and felt that he deserved the nickname &quot;Devil&quot; one<br/>
hundred percent.<br/>
	&quot;Tokugawa-san,&quot; said Kondou, trying to sweep away the uneasy silence.<br/>
&quot;After consultation, and much thought, I&#39;ve come to a decision. I&#39;m<br/>
going to allow your wife to fight alongside you tomorrow, asa<br/>
personal attendant.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro couldn&#39;t believe his ears. That wasn&#39;t supposed to be possible!<br/>
Then againhe realized that he and Yuki were changing history simply<br/>
by being there. Things could be different. They were.<br/>
	&quot;Iunderstand, Kondou-sama.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Very good. She can obtain her weapons and armor at the same time<br/>
that you do. That&#39;s all. You&#39;re dismissed, Corporal Tokugawa.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro gave a short bow.<br/>
	&quot;Understood. Thank you, Kondou-sama.&quot;<br/>
*********<br/>
	July 19<br/>
Yuki tightened the strings of Hiro&#39;s helmet, deftly pulling at the<br/>
tough lacquered cords with nimble fingers. Giving the knot a tug, she<br/>
made sure that it was secure.<br/>
	&quot;You&#39;re set, Hiro-sama.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Thanks, Yuki-chan. Are you ready?&quot;<br/>
	Looking herself over, she made sure that she was fully armed and<br/>
armored. Gauntlets, short sword, naginata, armored headband, and<br/>
breastplateall present and accounted for. Since she was going to be<br/>
fighting, she also wore hakama, wide-legged trousers, over her kimono.<br/>
She nodded eagerly.<br/>
	&quot;Hai, gochou-sama. I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br/>
	Yuki still couldn&#39;t entirely believe it. Not only had Hiro been<br/>
promoted, but she was his personal attendant! The risk of battle still<br/>
remained, but Yuki felt a lot better, since she&#39;d be with Hiro more<br/>
often. And beyond thatshe was eager to help him in his quest for<br/>
retribution against Choshuu. Her own clan also suffered at the hands<br/>
of the rebels, and ended up seeing their domain torn apart by the last<br/>
great battle of the period, the Battle of Hakodate. Whatever path Hiro<br/>
chose to pursue, Yuki knew one thingtheir minds and swords, as<br/>
always, were one.<br/>
	There was an eerie silence among the forces arrayed around the<br/>
Imperial Palace. It seemed like just another day, but deep down<br/>
inside, everyone knew what was about to happen. Hiro and Yuki could<br/>
almost sense it, as well. The Choshuu samurai may not have come into<br/>
view yet, but they knew very well that they were there, and drawing<br/>
closer by the second.	Behind Hiro and Yuki, the group of 3rd Unit<br/>
patrolmen under Hiro&#39;s command tensed. Swords already drawn, they<br/>
crouched behind a barricade, waiting for the order to charge.<br/>
	Yuki tapped him on the shoulder. &quot;&quot;Hiro-samafeel that?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Feel wha&quot; The words were left half-said in Hiro&#39;s mouth as the<br/>
once-faint war cry echoed from the streets west of the palace.<br/>
	Oh dear GodHiro mouthed. We are all so dead<br/>
	He turned to Yuki, and nodded.<br/>
	&quot;Get ready.&quot;<br/>
	Nearby, the voices of the Aizu brigade commanders could be heard.<br/>
	&quot;Alright, boys!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Get ready! Here they come!&quot;<br/>
&quot;No prisoners!&quot;<br/>
Hiro wasn&#39;t concerned with them. He just wanted to further his quest<br/>
for retribution and vengeance against the warriors of Choshuu.<br/>
From the surrounding streets and alleys, a seemingly huge force<br/>
suddenly materialized, brandishing every type of weapon<br/>
imaginablefrom the standard katana to muzzle-loading muskets. An<br/>
agonizing, terrible eternity passed. Then they charged.<br/>
The Aizu forces wasted no time. Everywhere there was a musket unit,<br/>
the same command resounded.<br/>
&quot;First line, fire!&quot;<br/>
The thunder of gunfire echoed in the hot midsummer air. For a moment,<br/>
only the smell of spent ammunition and burning flesh hung in the air.<br/>
Hiro looked through the haze, hoping to see most of the enemy wiped<br/>
out, but in vainthey seemed not only to not have lost anyone, but<br/>
also to have multiplied in number. What was more, they weren&#39;t slowly<br/>
advancing anymorethey were running as fast as their legs could carry<br/>
them, charging the government positions. Before any member of the<br/>
government forceAizu, Satsuma, Kuwana, Shinsengumi, or Mimawarigumi<br/>
before any of them could move, the enemy closed the gap and was upon them.<br/>
Hiro was adrift, seemingly detached from the flow of time. His blade<br/>
slashed through the torso of the first Choshuu samurai, shattering<br/>
flesh and bone in a rapidly rising kesa-giri slash from the right hip<br/>
up to the left shoulder. For a moment, Hiro felt horror at what he<br/>
saw, a horror that nearly swallowed him whole.<br/>
Then he brought the past to mind. He remembered stories of the defeat<br/>
of the Tokugawa clan in battle at Toba-Fushimi, the slaughter at<br/>
Nagaoka, the burning, bullet-riddled banners at Tsuruga Castle in<br/>
Aizu, bearing his family&#39;s triple-hollyhock crest. He forced himself<br/>
to remember that these were the people who had done that-- these men<br/>
who marched under the banner of Mori, lord of Choshuu. And with no<br/>
effort at all he remembered the words of a middle-aged Emperor Meiji,<br/>
who after a lifetime of support for the Choshuu clan, said the words<br/>
that still made his blood boil: <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was finally able to do something to show my gratitude to<br/>
Tokugawa Yoshinobu. I ought to be grateful; after all, I took the<br/>
country away from him!<br/>
 <br/>
It was in that instant that he made a critical decision. However<br/>
difficult, however dangerous, he had to put his knowledge to good use.<br/>
The past may have turned out one way, but he was able to change that.<br/>
Being in the past himself, there was no way that he could allow for<br/>
the same defeats and humiliation to happen a second time. He would<br/>
preserve his family&#39;s power and honor, no matter what the cost. The<br/>
Tokugawa Shogunate would survivehe would make absolutely sure of it.<br/>
Deftly rotating his sword back into position, he prepared to bring his<br/>
sword downwards and through another enemy again, when shots rang out.<br/>
At first he thought that it might be some Aizu riflemen firing at<br/>
will. When a couple of Mimawarigumi members went down near him, he<br/>
knew how wrong he was. Choshuu had been stockpiling guns, and now they<br/>
were using them. How obvious. How plainly, stupidly obvious.<br/>
He started to turn toward the direction of the shots, hoping to cut<br/>
down some gunners. His sword seemed to guide itself, progressing to<br/>
the more lethal techniques of the Yagyu Ryuu, slowly progressing<br/>
onward, foot by foot. Totally absorbed in his swordsmanship, Hiro<br/>
didn&#39;t see the enemy sword coming down toward his head until there was<br/>
a loud clanging noise. Glancing up for a moment, he saw the blade of a<br/>
naginata holding the sword back. In the instant before her grip<br/>
would&#39;ve given way, he took advantage of the diversion and swept in<br/>
toward his opponent, cutting him down in a shower of blood.<br/>
&quot;Yuki!&quot;<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re right behind you!&quot;<br/>
There was no point in talking. All they had to do was fight. Eight of<br/>
the men who were assigned to Hiro fought their way forward, until they<br/>
were fighting back-to-back with him and Yuki. Try as they might, they<br/>
were held up, and couldn&#39;t find the source of the gunfire. One by one,<br/>
people were going down, helpless against the incoming bullets.<br/>
	A whistling noise filled Hiro&#39;s ears. He had heard of such a noise<br/>
being heard by soldiers in World War II and Vietnamnow he knew<br/>
himself what it was likea terrible, blinding white noise that he was<br/>
somehow numbed to. Hiro pointed his sword forward and ordered a<br/>
charge. Five people responded to him, led by Yuki. With a tremendous<br/>
battle cry, they threw everything into each cut, slash, and thrust,<br/>
trying to advance in the face of the never-ending go-for-broke spirit<br/>
of the Choshuu warriors.<br/>
	Taking a lunge, Hiro prepared to follow, when he heard repeated<br/>
cracking noises ripping through the air like miniature thunderclaps.<br/>
His eyes widened in shock and frozen horror as he watched his five men<br/>
getting torn apart by shot after shot from the Choshuu guns, with Yuki<br/>
just behind them, her naginata ready to strike at anything in her way.<br/>
	Yuki&#39;s words echoed through his mind.<br/>
If you were to fallI wouldslit my throat and willingly follow you in<br/>
death<br/>
Yukihe thought, holding his sword off to one side, and putting his<br/>
entire being into a dead run. Yukiif you were to fall, I would commit<br/>
seppuku and follow you in death, as well. My life has no meaning<br/>
without you. Vengeance may be important, but you are even more<br/>
important. I love youforever<br/>
As he fell onto her, he closed his eyes and mentally said a prayer.<br/>
<br/>
Great Lord, God whom my ancestors detested, Lord whom I have chosen to<br/>
follow We are like grass before the Harvester. If it is Your will,<br/>
preserve us and let us survive this terrible bloodletting. If it is<br/>
not, let us pass from this world of grief and tears hand in hand</div>

Chapter 13<br/>
<br/>
For a long time there was nothing but silence and death hanging in the<br/>
air. Many buildings were destroyed, and many more were still burning.<br/>
In the distant foothills, the low, echoing rumble of gunfire meant the<br/>
battle was still raging, albeit in its final hours. The whistling<br/>
still raged on in Hiro&#39;s ears, until suddenly<br/>
&quot;Hiro-sama!&quot;<br/>
His eyes flew open, and he remembered where he was, and more<br/>
precisely, whom he was lying on top of.<br/>
&quot;Hiro-samaI can&#39;t breathe&quot;<br/>
Hiro rolled off slowly, moving to a sitting position and helping Yuki<br/>
to her knees. She coughed a couple of times, and took several deep<br/>
breaths, before looking him in the eyes.<br/>
&quot;Hiro-samathank you&quot;<br/>
Despite the restricted movement afforded to her by the armor, Yuki<br/>
straightened up and bowed with her forehead to the ground.<br/>
&quot;Yukithere was nothing else to be done. I&quot;<br/>
The sound of hoofbeats cut him off. Turning to the source of the<br/>
sound, they both went pale with shock. Lord Matsudaira Katamori, the<br/>
official shogunate representative in Kyoto, was slowly riding by,<br/>
surveying the damage with a mixed group of mounted retainers and foot<br/>
soldiers. Unable to control his gut instinct, Hiro looked the lord<br/>
straight in the eyes, not as the defiant low-rank Shinsengumi corporal<br/>
which he pretended to be, but as a member of the Tokugawa house, which<br/>
he was. He looked at Matsudaira honestly, as a kinsman.<br/>
The lord noticed, and rode closer. Yuki pulled Hiro down into the<br/>
lowest bow possible, noting what was happening with some degree of<br/>
horror. Even if Matsudaira was a kinsman, it was utterly inexcusable<br/>
for anyone of such a low rank, even a pretended low rank, to stare<br/>
such a high lord directly in the eyes.<br/>
They remained bowing, until the sound of hooves stopped directly in<br/>
front of them.<br/>
&quot;You,&quot; said Matsudaira, addressing Hiro. &quot;Look at me.&quot;<br/>
Slowly, Hiro looked up, straight into Matsudaira&#39;s eyes again.<br/>
&quot;My lord.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re with Shinsengumi?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes, my lord.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Your name?&quot;<br/>
Hiro suddenly felt very weak. His namethat would give everything<br/>
away, especially to Lord Matsudaira. He would have to reveal<br/>
himselfSilently, he gritted his teeth, steeled his nerves, and looked<br/>
up again.<br/>
&quot;Tokugawa. Tokugawa Hirotada, my lord.&quot;<br/>
Matsudaira&#39;s face went white as a sheet for a moment. Then he burst<br/>
out laughing.<br/>
&quot;You can&#39;t honestly be serious. The battle must have gotten to you,<br/>
samurai. I&#39;m feeling rather good today, so I&#39;ll excuse that. Now I ask<br/>
you again, what is your name? Try to be honest with me.&quot; The foot<br/>
soldiers tensed at this remark, their hands tight on the hilts of<br/>
their swords.<br/>
Not about to be intimidated, Hiro brought his ancestors to mindon his<br/>
father&#39;s side, Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shogun. On his<br/>
mother&#39;s side, Honda Tadakatsu, one of Ieyasu&#39;s chief captains. The<br/>
blood and spirit of those men and their progeny ran in him. He knew he<br/>
had nothing to fear.<br/>
&quot;Tokugawa Hirotada, my lord.&quot;<br/>
Matsudaira sighed.<br/>
&quot;I need some humor today. Alright, then, samurai, so you&#39;re Tokugawa.<br/>
Prove it.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I am of the Mito house.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Whose son?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Tokugawa Tadanobu and Honda Masako&#39;s eldest son.&quot;<br/>
Matsudaira snickered to himself.<br/>
&quot;There are no such people in the Mito house. But go on.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Our clan&#39;s swords bear our hollyhock crest, and are made by the<br/>
Yasutsugu. Our clan&#39;s official armorers are the Miochin.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Anyone who knows their history could tell me that.&quot;<br/>
Hiro was desperate. He had to prove himself.<br/>
&quot;Two of your lordship&#39;s direct retainers are named Sagawa Kanbei and<br/>
Nakano Heinai. Nakano Heinai has a wife by the name of Kouko, and two<br/>
daughters by the name of Takeko and Yuuko, who are reknowned for their<br/>
skill with the naginata.&quot;<br/>
Matsudaira nodded to his foot soldiers, who unsheathed their swords.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, samurai, but I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you go. Whatever<br/>
spying you&#39;ve been doing on my clan must end now. Thank you for<br/>
amusing me, though.&quot;<br/>
Hiro and Yuki stood up together. Gripping Yuki&#39;s hand firmly, he<br/>
looked Matsudaira in the eyes again, this time with the fiercest stare<br/>
that he could summon. There was no more pretense. Hiro was bent on<br/>
using the position of his family to full advantage. The Matsudaira<br/>
family of Aizu may have been relatives of the shogun, but they were<br/>
lower-ranking than Hiro&#39;s family, who were one of the main branches<br/>
from which the shogun was chosen.<br/>
&quot;Many years ago, during the Age of the Country at war, when our common<br/>
ancestor Toshogu (Tokugawa Ieyasu) was still a child, his mother,<br/>
O-dai no Kata, was sent back to her brother Mizuno Nobutomo&#39;s castle.<br/>
She was accompanied by some of the samurai of Matsudaira Hirotada, who<br/>
is my namesake&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Again, anyone who has read history knows that, samurai. My patience<br/>
is wearing thin--&quot;<br/>
	&quot;When they neared the castle, O-dai no Kata bade her husband&#39;s<br/>
samurai to leave. She said, `If you come with me, my brother will kill<br/>
you all. If that happens, then my son will forever despise his uncle.<br/>
As long as my son lives, I will never think of you Matsudaira men as<br/>
enemies. Since both my son and Nobutomo are related, sooner or later<br/>
our clans will make peace. But if you stay with me and get killed,<br/>
that will be utterly impossible.&#39; Having understood what she said,<br/>
they let her proceed on her way alone.&quot;<br/>
	Matsudaira&#39;s jaw dropped.<br/>
	&quot;How did you?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;As I said, my lord, I am who I am.&quot;<br/>
	A look of utter confusion passed over Matsudaira&#39;s face. Finally, he<br/>
shook his head, and barked an order to his foot soldiers.<br/>
	&quot;Take their weapons. I don&#39;t want any trouble.&quot;<br/>
	Looking at Hiro again, he nodded with a touch of contempt.<br/>
	&quot;I don&#39;t know how you know that, but I can assure you, if you&#39;re not<br/>
who you say you are, you can consider yourself utterly, without<br/>
question, dead. I assume this is your battlefield attendant?&quot; he said,<br/>
pointing at Yuki.<br/>
	&quot;She is Matsumae Yuki, my wife and battlefield attendant.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Strange, but very well. I&#39;ll allow her to remain with you. Now let&#39;s<br/>
get going.&quot;<br/>
********<br/>
	Hiro and Yuki were quickly brought to Nijo Castle, the shogunate&#39;s<br/>
headquarters in Kyoto. After being given a bath and a change of<br/>
clothes, they had been shown to the antechamber before the main<br/>
audience hall, where, they were told, Lord Matsudaira would see the<br/>
two of them.<br/>
	Kneeling alongside and slightly behind Hiro, Yuki was in awe. The<br/>
decorations and detail on the sliding doors and walls were quite<br/>
spectacular, as was the immaculate cleanliness of the tatami mats.<br/>
This life, the life of the upper class, was how Yuki had previously<br/>
imagined the past. And yet, having spent several weeks with<br/>
lower-ranking samurai and former peasants, she could no longer hold on<br/>
to that image. She looked at her fresh, light-green kimono, and<br/>
sighed, thinking of Midori and the other women back at Shinsengumi<br/>
headquarters, who wore clothing of coarse weave and went to tremendous<br/>
lengths and sacrifices to support the men of the group.<br/>
	She turned her eyes toward Hiro. Dressed in a formal black kimono and<br/>
haori, and striped gray hakama, he looked resplendent and somehow<br/>
naturally commandingworthy of someone of his rank and heritage. Since<br/>
he had yet to fully prove himself to Lord Matsudaira, the clothing<br/>
issued to him bore no family crest.<br/>
	&quot;His lordship will see you now,&quot; said an attendant, and moved forward<br/>
to slide open the doors.<br/>
	Hiro nodded curtly. As the doors opened, he and Yuki bowed all the<br/>
way down to the floor mats, and then moved forward slowly using shiko,<br/>
a delicate process of sliding on the kneecaps. When they came before<br/>
the slightly raised platform where Lord Matsudaira sat, they bowed again.<br/>
	Matsudaira gave a nod to the attendant, who left the room and slid<br/>
the doors shut.<br/>
	&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; said Matsudaira, with a slightly tired tone. &quot;There<br/>
are things I&#39;d rather be doing, believe me. But if I don&#39;t address<br/>
this immediately, it&#39;s not going to go away. You&#39;ll notice that I have<br/>
here my official secretary, who will write down any responses you give<br/>
and keep them on record. I remind you that should you be found to be<br/>
lying, I will not hesitate to take your head personally.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro bowed again, and cleared his throat.<br/>
	&quot;My lord, before I begin, may I ask one indulgence?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;What is it?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;I ask that your lordship listen to every word I say, and then make<br/>
up your mind as to what to do with me and my wife.&quot;<br/>
	Matsudaira grunted.<br/>
	&quot;Very well. Now begin.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Yes, your lordship. As I said before, I am Tokugawa Hirotada, son of<br/>
Tokugawa Tadanobu of Mito and Honda Masako, daughter of Honda Masahiro<br/>
of Sunpu. I am descended from Lord Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Much as it may<br/>
sound like madness, I come from the future.&quot;<br/>
	Matsudaira&#39;s face contorted, but being a man of his word, he kept silent.<br/>
	&quot;I do not know how I came hereI and my wife were blown here by what<br/>
I can only call a very fierce wind. But now that I am here, I must<br/>
tell your lordship that if you do not move quickly, the shogunate will<br/>
fall. The Tokugawa clan and many of its vassals will be stripped of<br/>
power and ruined. Lord Yoshinobu will be the last shogun, and will die<br/>
a heartbroken old man. Your own domain will suffer greatlymany will<br/>
die, the castle will be demolished, and your people will be exiled to<br/>
the Shimokita Peninsula in northern Honshu, where a great number of<br/>
them will die of starvation. Also, the shogunate has enemies not only<br/>
in Choshuu, but also in the Imperial Court, in the Satsuma domain, and<br/>
in the province of Tosa. And what&#39;s more, in my time, there are no<br/>
more samurai or domains. If your lordship would give me the<br/>
opportunity, I will tell you all that I know, so that you may work<br/>
toward the good of Japan, and for the preservation of our clan&#39;s name<br/>
and honor.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro bowed to the floormats again.<br/>
	&quot;I am done, my lord. You may do with me as you please.&quot;<br/>
	Matsudaira Katamori was silent for a long time. Finally, he spoke.<br/>
	&quot;I do not know what sort of person you are, nor if you are absolutely<br/>
telling the truth, but I will say thisif you are indeed an heir of<br/>
the Lord Yoshinobu, you certainly have his presence.&quot; He turned, and<br/>
nodded to his secretary, who finished his notes, and calmly bowed.<br/>
	&quot;Very well, waka-dono (young lord). The coming days will prove if<br/>
your words are indeed true. For the time being, I will allow you to<br/>
remain in this castle, and wear the hollyhock crest on your clothing.<br/>
The next time we meet, I expect a concrete example of something that<br/>
can be done to avert this catastrophe you speak of.&quot;<br/>
	Hiro bowed.<br/>
	&quot;Thank you, Lord Matsudaira. I will not disappoint you.&quot;<br/>
	Matsudaira nodded.<br/>
	&quot;Let us hope you don&#39;t, young Lord Tokugawa.&quot;<br/>

Chapter 14<br/>
<br/>
Yuki awoke with a start and looked around her in utter confusion,<br/>
unsure of exactly where she was. Even though three weeks had passed,<br/>
it took a moment for her to remember that she was in her own room in<br/>
Nijo Castle, and not at in the servants&#39; quarters at the Yagi estate<br/>
in Mibu. In the distance, she could hear the calling of the night<br/>
watch from the direction of the castle gate, which only confirmed her<br/>
suspicions. She was definitely in Nijo Castle. No question about it.<br/>
Sighing, she flopped back onto the futon, trying in vain to will<br/>
herself back to sleep. Over the last week or so, sleep was the one<br/>
thing that eluded her the most at night. Even though she&#39;d never been<br/>
one for long naps, she&#39;d suddenly become chronically tired. Now,<br/>
napping was pretty much all she did all day while Hiro was in his<br/>
meetings with Lord Matsudaira. Even when Hiro was around, Yuki found<br/>
herself almost always either lying down on her own or wanting to rest<br/>
with her head on his shoulder.<br/>
&quot;Back in 2004, I&#39;d always be training, but never be low on energywhy<br/>
am I suddenly sleeping so much?&quot; she murmured, looking up at the ceiling.<br/>
Too restless to lie still, she got out of the bed and slowly moved<br/>
toward the cabinet by the window nearby. Careful not to make too much<br/>
noise, she opened the top drawer and took out a small box. Then,<br/>
moving with just as much silence, she went and lit the small floor<br/>
lantern next to her futon.<br/>
Opening the box, she gingerly removed the contentsa hand mirror,<br/>
decorated with a pattern of floating cherry blossoms on the back. Hiro<br/>
had gotten it for her approximately a week after their arrival at<br/>
Nijo, on one of their first nights `together&#39; there, as a celebratory<br/>
present marking their good fortune and sincere hopes for a different,<br/>
brighter future.<br/>
Holding the mirror closely, she examined her reflection.<br/>
&quot;Oh, just lovelyI really have put on weight&quot;<br/>
Indeed, her features had become fuller, rounder, and somewhat softer<br/>
in the time that she&#39;d been at Nijo. Then again, it couldn&#39;t be<br/>
helped. Upperclass women back then weren&#39;t  as physically active. Yuki<br/>
herself only got naginata practice done once a week, and spent most of<br/>
the rest of her time reading, writing poetry, arranging flowers,<br/>
eating, or sleeping. It was funny-- first she&#39;d had too much to do<br/>
with the Shinsengumi, now she had too little to do. Life could be so<br/>
odd sometimes.<br/>
Sighing, she replaced the mirror in the box, and was about to take it<br/>
back to the cabinet, when she doubled over, feeling nature calling for<br/>
what was probably the fifth time that night.<br/>
&quot;Umé!&quot;<br/>
Almost instantly, one of the sliding doors opened, and in came a<br/>
short, bony woman, carrying a chamber pot. On first glance, one might<br/>
get the impression that she was frail, but her frame had a strength<br/>
that defied her years.<br/>
&quot;Good thing I have night duty, milady! Nature seems to be calling<br/>
quite a bit today!&quot; Cackling to herself, she placed the chamber pot on<br/>
the floor. Yuki hurried over, and, thankful that she hadn&#39;t tied her<br/>
sleeping kimono too tightly, undid it a bit, squatted down, and did<br/>
what needed to be done.<br/>
As she retightened her kimono, she turned to Umé.<br/>
&quot;Uméany idea why this is happening? It&#39;s most unnerving. I can&#39;t<br/>
sleep, I keep needing to goand come to think of it,&quot; she said,<br/>
touching a hand to her breasts, &quot;I&#39;ve never felt this sore in my life!&quot;<br/>
Umé rose slowly and deliberately, with the pot firmly held in both<br/>
hands, and looked straight at Yukia liberty allowed her only because<br/>
of years of loyal, devoted service to the Matsudaira family of Aizu.<br/>
The candlelight cast sharp patterns of light and shadow over her face,<br/>
bringing out the directness of her gaze. She may have been a servant,<br/>
but Yuki respected her and valued her advice.<br/>
&quot;Lady Yuki-- may I be permitted to speak frankly?&quot;<br/>
Used to frank speech all the time from 2004, Yuki nodded.<br/>
&quot;You know you can be totally open and honest with me, Umé.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Thank you, milady. As you know, I&#39;ve served the ladies of the<br/>
Matsudaira and Tokugawa clans for over three decades. I think it&#39;s<br/>
pretty obvious what&#39;s going on. As for your seiri?&quot;<br/>
Yuki gasped. She was right. The lunar calendar had thrown off her<br/>
accustomed perception of time, but<br/>
&quot;It was late this month&quot;<br/>
Umé nodded, allowing herself a small smile. Her years of experience<br/>
had proved her right yet again. She gave Yuki a polite nod.<br/>
&quot;Yes. You are with child, milady. Now if you will excuse me, I must<br/>
properly dispose of this&quot; She bowed as deeply as possible with the<br/>
pot in her hands, and moved away quickly, closing the sliding door as<br/>
she went.<br/>
Yuki stood transfixed, too stunned for words. So she was pregnant? A<br/>
babybut this would change absolutely everything. Suddenly, she turned<br/>
and headed for the other sliding door, which led to Hiro&#39;s room,<br/>
almost opening it too loudly in her haste. Quietly, she crept over to<br/>
his futon, and knelt down, leaning in as close to his ear as she<br/>
possibly could.<br/>
&quot;Hiro. Wake up, I need to talk to you.&quot;<br/>
No response. She gently shook him by the shoulders, trying not to<br/>
startle him too much.<br/>
&quot;PssstHiroEarth to Lord Tokugawa&quot;<br/>
Suddenly, his eyes flew open, and he looked around somewhat nervously,<br/>
more wary of his surroundings now that he was an aide to Lord Matsudaira.<br/>
&quot;Yuki! Whawhat&#39;s going on?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Shhh&quot; She lay down next to him, and silently put her arms around him.<br/>
&quot;Hiroyou ready for this? You&#39;re going to be utterly shocked out of<br/>
your wits.&quot;<br/>
Hiro chuckled.<br/>
&quot;Yuki, I&#39;ve been altering history for nearly a month nownothing<br/>
shocks me anymore.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Nothis&#39;ll really shock you. Ready?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yeahwhat is it, Yuki-chan?&quot;<br/>
She kissed him on the cheek.<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re going to have a baby.&quot;<br/>
Hiro pulled back a bit. He was somewhat shocked, and wasn&#39;t sure if<br/>
he&#39;d heard Yuki&#39;s last statement correctly. He simply had to<br/>
double-check something as seemingly far-reaching in consequences as that.<br/>
&quot;A baby?&quot;<br/>
Yuki nodded enthusiastically.<br/>
&quot;Really. No joke. You&#39;re going to be an otousan!&quot;<br/>
&quot;And youyou&#39;re going to be the kindest, sweetest, most wonderful<br/>
ka-chan any kid could ask for.&quot;<br/>
Hiro looked down at Yuki&#39;s abdomen, and gently placed his hand there,<br/>
imagining the new life that was forming there at that very moment. He<br/>
knew that a part of him was in there, merging with a part of Yuki,<br/>
forming something entirely unique and truly amazing. Forcing all other<br/>
thoughts aside, Hiro let the thoughts in his heart take precedence.<br/>
Feeling them too wonderful to hold in, he whispered to Yuki.<br/>
&quot;Our child&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but smile broadly.<br/>
&quot;Yes. Our child&quot; echoed Yuki. &quot;Our firstborn&quot;<br/>
&quot;At least&quot; he said, unable to suppress a chuckle, &quot;we won&#39;t need to<br/>
worry about college tuition!&quot;<br/>
&quot;He&#39;ll tutored by his father, be raised in the best traditions of the<br/>
clan, following both the literary and the martial ways.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh, I think she will be a great poet, archer, and halberdier, like<br/>
her mother. And she&#39;ll have her mother&#39;s eyes.&quot;<br/>
They brought their lips together, kissing slowly and passionately,<br/>
feeling the worries, bloodshed, politics, and intrigues of the age<br/>
recede far into the distance. Instead, the brightness and joy of life<br/>
once again surrounded them in its warm glow, as it had right after<br/>
they&#39;d been married, shortly before their arrival in this period<br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll see&quot; murmured Yuki. &quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;<br/>
Hiro kissed his wife on the forehead, and ran his fingers through her<br/>
hair softly. In the stillness of the night, with only the moonlight<br/>
shining through the windows, he gazed deeply at her, and found her to<br/>
be even more beautiful than ever.<br/>
&quot;No matter what the coming months may bring, remember that I stand by<br/>
your side one hundred percent. You know you can count on me,<br/>
Yuki-chan. I love you...&quot;<br/>
She buried her face in the folds of his kimono, breathing his scent in<br/>
deeply. It wasn&#39;t like when he was in the Shinsengumi. He didn&#39;t smell<br/>
like blood, bone and death anymorehe smelled like the Hiro she&#39;d<br/>
marriedmild sweat and cherry blossom perfume.<br/>
At last, things were right again.<br/>
&quot;I love you too, Hiro&quot; she sighed. &quot;Well get throughtogether&quot;<br/>

Chapter 15<br/>
<br/>
Keio 1 (1865), January 22<br/>
	&quot;UghOno no Komachi&#39;s poetry is too sentimental&quot;<br/>
Yuki put down the book, feeling an enormous sense of melancholy wash<br/>
over her. Sighing, she leaned back onto the mats, and looked up, out<br/>
the open window into the winter sky.<br/>
&quot;Ughthe sky is too sentimental&quot;<br/>
Turning from the window, she looked down at her growing abdomen. The<br/>
period of constant queasiness early on in her pregnancy was long over,<br/>
replaced instead by a period of calm. Safe far within the walls of the<br/>
castle, the troubles of the ageeven with Hiro&#39;s alterations to the<br/>
timelineseemed far, far away. Being freed from most responsibilities,<br/>
she was actually able to afford herself the luxury of simply enjoying<br/>
everything that was happening to her, even with the emotional<br/>
rollercoaster that brought so many tears to her eyes. In recent weeks,<br/>
she&#39;d very often sit and wonder about her unborn child, and this would<br/>
carry over into her conversations with Hirothey would talk about<br/>
names, education, clothing, the ritual ceremonies that would<br/>
doubtlessly follow their child&#39;s birth. Most of all, Yuki looked<br/>
forward to holding the child in her arms. If things were still going<br/>
the way they were at the moment, Hiro would continue to be away for a<br/>
very long amount of the day. If Yuki had the child with her, she&#39;d<br/>
always have a part of him nearby, and her mind would be at greater peace.<br/>
The sound of heavy footsteps suddenly brought her back into the<br/>
reality of the Bakumatsu period. Sitting up as quickly as she could,<br/>
she once again wiped her eyes dry, straightened out the folds of her<br/>
overcoat, and readied herself. Somehow, she knew that something major<br/>
had happened. A wry smile crept over her face as she thought to herself.<br/>
Must be mother&#39;s intuition<br/>
Suddenly, the screen door opened, and in came Hiro with an armed<br/>
retainer. They appeared to be returning from a raid, and neither of<br/>
them had taken off their armor yet. Hiro was ecstatic and glowing.<br/>
Kneeling down next to Yuki, he took her hand in his.<br/>
&quot;Yuki! Wonderful news! We raided the estates of the courtiers and<br/>
found evidence that incriminates Sanjou Sanetomi and Iwakura Tomomi,<br/>
as well as some people working with the radical samurai of Choshuu, in<br/>
a plot to poison Emperor Komei!&quot;<br/>
Yuki sat silently for a moment, staring at Hiro listlessly. Suddenly,<br/>
she broke down in tears, leaning forward into Hiro&#39;s embrace.<br/>
&quot;Aren&#39;t youuhglad?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes!&quot; she said, through her uncontrollable tears. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m glad we<br/>
got them! I justdon&#39;t know why I&#39;m crying!&quot; She tried drying her eyes<br/>
with the sleeveless haori that Hiro wore over his armor, but to no avail.<br/>
&quot;Yuki-chan&quot;<br/>
Hiro glanced over to his retainer and dismissed him. The man bowed,<br/>
and left, silently shutting the sliding door behind him.<br/>
&quot;Yukidaijoubunaitemo ii desu waIt&#39;s alright to cry&quot;<br/>
&quot;You know what I really want right now?&quot; she said, feeling the tears<br/>
suddenly stop.<br/>
&quot;What do you need? Just say what it is, and I&#39;ll get itno matter how<br/>
seemingly odd it might be.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I really want someroot beer&quot;<br/>
Hiro held an armored hand up to his mouth, trying in vain to suppress<br/>
a laugh.<br/>
&quot;A root beer?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yesa root beer, like what we used to drink in Philadelphia during<br/>
collegewith crushed ice.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yuki-chan&quot;<br/>
&quot;I know that there&#39;s no root beer yet. Nor is there crushed iceat<br/>
least, not how we know it. I justwish I were home!&quot; She broke out in<br/>
tears again. &quot;I want my parents here to help!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yukiyou know that we&#39;re most probably stuck here. I know that it&#39;s<br/>
hard. But if there&#39;s anything from this time period that I can get for<br/>
you to make things even a little easiereven if it&#39;s as simple as a<br/>
flower from Yoshino Mountain or as odd as a performance by a fat,<br/>
bald-headed comedic storyteller from Osakathen don&#39;t hesitate to tell<br/>
me. We have the means to have pretty much anything we wish now. If<br/>
there&#39;s anythinganything at all that I can do&quot;<br/>
&quot;There are.two things you can do&quot;<br/>
&quot;Anything. Name them.&quot;<br/>
&quot;The best red miso soup you can get. These people down here don&#39;t know<br/>
how to make misothey use the white type and all. Up north, where I<br/>
come from, we eat the red stuff. It just tastes better! In fact, my<br/>
mother used to make&quot; her voice trailed off, and tears formed in her<br/>
eyes again.<br/>
&quot;Sssh. Just try to focus on the here and now. What&#39;s the other thing<br/>
you wanted?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Hiro-samayou&#39;re always gone for so long. Nowadays we get even less<br/>
of chances to be together than we did when you were in the<br/>
Shinsengumi. I know you&#39;re wearing armor, but I would like very<br/>
muchfor you to hold me&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yuki-chanI&#39;m sorry&quot; murmured Hiro, and gently wrapped his arms<br/>
around her, holding her as close as he could in spite of the limited<br/>
movement offered to him by the armor.<br/>
&quot;Forgive me&quot;<br/>
*********<br/>
	The changes that Hiro made in the timeline were slow and gradual.<br/>
Having been an avid student of history, he was able to immediately<br/>
contribute to the arrest of several Choshuu rebels, but couldn&#39;t find<br/>
anyone major for a long time. The raid that caught Sanjou and Iwakura<br/>
was the first critical step toward changing history, because without<br/>
them, Emperor Komei would not be poisoned. Thus, a critical element<br/>
for the continuation of the Tokugawa government, the Imperial mandate,<br/>
was secured. However, things would not remain as simple as he thought.<br/>
Things were about to come utterly chaotic and undone, like a tapestry<br/>
with threads rapidly unwinding.<br/>
About a week after the raid that caught the two plotting noblemen,<br/>
Hiro was in his room, sleeping soundly after a particularly long<br/>
meeting with Lord Matsudaira where he expounded the need for rapid<br/>
acquisition of cannons and Gatling guns. Suddenly, the sound of<br/>
hurried footsteps startled him out of his deep, dreamless slumber.<br/>
&quot;Lord Tokugawa! Lord Tokugawa!&quot;<br/>
Slowly, Hiro drew himself up to a kneeling position. Rubbing his eyes<br/>
a couple times, he stretched in exhaustion and then finally responded.<br/>
&quot;Enter.&quot;<br/>
The sliding door opened, and in came a young, disheveled retainer,<br/>
probably serving under Lord Matsudaira.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s terrible, sir. After the raid last week, Choshuu has&quot; the<br/>
samurai&#39;s voice trailed off suddenly, as if he truly feared what he<br/>
was about to tell Hiro.<br/>
&quot;What? Out with it!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Choshuu secretly negotiated an alliance with the British awhile ago.<br/>
Last week&#39;s raid has thrown their lord into a rage, and he has openly<br/>
called in the support of the British, who even now have a fleet<br/>
sailing here from China and India!&quot;<br/>
Hiro stared at the young man in shock. So this secret alliance was<br/>
concluded before the start of his alterations to the timelineOnce<br/>
again, he was painfully reminded of a fact first told to him by his<br/>
father, years ago: Historians don&#39;t write everything down. There are<br/>
unwritten parts of history which can very well be truly, utterly<br/>
terrifying<br/>
&quot;IImpossible!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I fear not, my lord.&quot;<br/>
&quot;And what action is Lord Matsudaira taking?&quot;<br/>
&quot;His lordship has sent an urgent letter to Edo, requesting that<br/>
Yoshinobu-sama come here immediately as the regent for the shogun<br/>
Iemochi, he is best suited to assume command for the defense of the<br/>
realm and of the Tokugawa house, and to make that stand here. If<br/>
Choshuu and the British intend to strike us, they will strike us here.<br/>
In the meanwhile, Lord Matsudaira is also issuing orders for increased<br/>
recruitment by the Shinsengumi and Mimawarigumi. Lord Kondou and Lord<br/>
Sasaki will also be asked to present themselves here soon, in order<br/>
for Lord Matsudaira to explain the plans for the region&#39;s defense.&quot;<br/>
Hiro paused a moment.<br/>
&quot;And what of guns?&quot; he finally asked. &quot;Has the Lord Matsudaira said<br/>
anything about guns?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I do not know, Lord Tokugawa. That is a subject which you would<br/>
probably do better to discuss directly with his lordship than with a<br/>
mere retainer.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Understood. Does his lordship require my presence?&quot;<br/>
The retainer nodded.<br/>
&quot;Yeshe&#39;s about to hold a meeting with those of his chief retainers<br/>
who are here. He told me to summon you, and said that from now on,<br/>
when on duty, you should be fully armed and armored.&quot;<br/>
Hiro bowed.<br/>
&quot;As his lordship wishes. Tell him that I shall join him shortly.&quot;<br/>
**********<br/>
	Yuki awoke in a cold sweat.<br/>
	Hiroshe thought. Hiro<br/>
	Slowly, she brought herself up to her feet, and shuffled over to the<br/>
sliding door.<br/>
	&quot;PsstHiro.&quot;<br/>
	After not getting any response, she opened the door, and saw that he<br/>
was gone. Suddenly, though, the empty armor stand and sword rack<br/>
caught her eye.<br/>
	&quot;Ughgone again&quot;<br/>
	The moonlight broke through the clouds, and cast its dim illumination<br/>
on a piece of paper which lay on the neatly folded futon, addressed<br/>
with a simple &quot;Yuki&quot;. Slowly bending over, she picked it up and opened it.<br/>
	My dearest<br/>
	Choshuu has openly declared hostilities, and has called in British<br/>
aid. Fleet now sailing in from China and India. Lord Yoshinobu coming<br/>
from Edo. Called to Lord Matsudaira&#39;s side, don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back.<br/>
	Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
	--Hiro<br/>
Below the main body of the message, in small, barely visible letters,<br/>
was Hiro&#39;s favorite English quote from Thomas Paine&#39;s The American Crisis.<br/>
These are the times that try men&#39;s souls<br/>
