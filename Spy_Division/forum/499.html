Aizu Castle<br/>
April, Heisei 17 (2005)<br/>
<br/>
The white walls of Aizu Castle rose majestically over the<br/>
ferroconcrete city skyline, lost in their own age-old mystery. A wind<br/>
blew from the northeast, and all was peaceful, with the air awash in<br/>
the scent of spring. In the cemeteries, the ghosts of the men and<br/>
women of old Aizu kept watch over the spirit of the new Aizu. In the<br/>
fields where life once lay dying, the tall grass was truly &quot;all that<br/>
remained of warriors&#39; dreams.&quot;<br/>
Pausing on the bridge over the castle moat, Tokugawa Hirotada gazed<br/>
quietly at the sloping eaves of the tower. The fishlike talismans on<br/>
the very top of the highest roof seemed to stretch skyward in a quiet<br/>
prayer for peaceful rest.<br/>
&quot;TragicÂ…&quot; he murmured. &quot;Tragic indeed.&quot;<br/>
Hiro felt an urge to stay there, to contemplate the deep sadness of<br/>
the castle tower, to let its mystery seep into his soul, but he had a<br/>
job to do. Tugging smartly at his haori overcoat, he resumed his brisk<br/>
stride across the bridge, soon passing through the gate and into the<br/>
inner circle. Directly below the slope of the tower&#39;s stone base sat a<br/>
shallow pit, with several men and women in dusty clothing digging and<br/>
brushing away at the rich brown soil. One of them caught his eye, and<br/>
he waved.<br/>
	&quot;Hi, Yuki!&quot;<br/>
	A short, energetic woman in the deepest part of the pit waved back,<br/>
brushing her long bangs away from her eyes.<br/>
	&quot;Hi! Be with you in a minute!&quot; Exchanging a short word with the<br/>
supervisor, she picked up her cloth shoulderbag and clambered out of<br/>
the pit to join him. Exchanging a quiet kiss, they left the inner<br/>
circle of the castle, hand in hand.<br/>
