<h3>Anyone game for a round robin?</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488165035">This is all Tiffanyï¿½s fault.  She was the one who started me thinking (and remembering Barb telling me about how fun a round robin could be with the writers & Shinsengumi nuts (my description, not hersï¿½ donï¿½t go after her with katana in gatotsu stance) we have here) by imagining directing Hijikata in a commercial to advertise a bath sponge over on the message board.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So, chime in.  What do you guys think about starting a round robin here?  Iï¿½m willing to keep tabs on the organization, but what do YOU want to do?  We need ideas about scenariosï¿½ some rules, like how long a person has to get their section posted and what happens if they canï¿½t get it doneï¿½ anything else that comes to mind.  Itï¿½s been a while for me, but those I participated in were private and very smallï¿½ really more like RPG than a true round robin, so Iï¿½m counting on veterans to make suggestions based on their experience.  If we come up with a list of scenarios, I can create a poll for us to make a final choice (and anything else that needs deciding).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And, please, donï¿½t anyone be shy!!!  This is purely for funï¿½ no Pulitzer Prize hopes here.  Join in!!  Good way to get your hand in at some writing without being responsible for the whole thing.<br/>

<br/>
For theme/scenario Oh who knows? I&#39;m game for anything the more &quot;out <br/>
there&quot; the better to get us really thinking and trying to make it <br/>
plausible. Although I do think it should stay in the realm of <br/>
possibility Saitou between the years of his actual life span.<br/>
