Source: Original (Characters from "Jidai Monogatari")<br/>
Main character(s): 3rd Unit mentioned, as well as the Mori of Choshuu<br/>
and the Tokugawa, but this poem is mainly Hiro and Yuki. Written from<br/>
Hiro's point of view. Comments/explanation are in brackets (the "[]"<br/>
thingies)<br/>
General Rating: PG...it's romantic. And it's in free verse, so don't<br/>
yell at me that it doesn't rhyme, please.<br/>
Warning: Nothing really.<br/>
Disclaimer: Hiro and Yuki belong to me. Saitou belongs in the national<br/>
spirit of the Japanese people. So there. (c)2004 Shimazu Masayoshi<br/>

TAISETSU NA TAKARAMONO<br/>
<br/>
Yuki...<br/>
Snow.<br/>
Drifting, swirling, dancing around me<br/>
delicate yet commanding<br/>
covering the ugliness<br/>
in this world of grief and tears<br/>
turning everything beautiful.<br/>
Even this pack of wolves<br/>
I seem to be one of<br/>
seem better and more bearable,<br/>
since you turn everything<br/>
into shirayuki<br/>
(Snow-white)<br/>
Or something of that sort<br/>
in this field of flowers<br/>
where we write love letters<br/>
in the ash of life<br/>
in the drifting snow<br/>
through which you appear.<br/>
Reaching out, I draw you near me<br/>
my blue and white overcoat<br/>
flutters in the wind.<br/>
Coming closer still<br/>
your lips part<br/>
and a  blissful,<br/>
powerful fire passes<br/>
through us,<br/>
as we drink deeply<br/>
from the sweetness<br/>
of the cup of romance.<br/>
Embrace me, my koishii [beloved]<br/>
Soothe my troubled spirit<br/>
touch me with the heart<br/>
of your snow-white beauty.<br/>
Dry my tears,<br/>
shed in the dark<br/>
of this tortured city<br/>
where the three stars[Mori (Choshuu) crest]<br/>
the three hollyhocks [Tokugawa crest]<br/>
and the white mountains [triangles on the Shinsengumi flag]<br/>
tear each other to pieces.<br/>
Dry these tears<br/>
with the calm of your poet's heart.<br/>
Take my scarred hand<br/>
with the strength of your warrior's spirit.<br/>
Listen as the shining bright wind<br/>
tells the story of our true blue love.<br/>
I have wept too long<br/>
in this world of grief and tears<br/>
where we have no home<br/>
but a simple hermitage<br/>
shelter on the road<br/>
to somewhere we used to know.<br/>
I feel as though<br/>
I've lost a part of my soul<br/>
in the streets of this city<br/>
in these many patrols<br/>
with these vigilant wolves.<br/>
Fill my heart,<br/>
Light my vision with the fire<br/>
and glow of passion.<br/>
Kiss me, my love<br/>
and take away my pain<br/>
for I've wept too long.<br/>
Anata wa watashi no<br/>
taisetsu na takaramono...<br/>
Zutto...aishiteru...<br/>
You are my precious treasure,<br/>
and I love you...forever...<br/>
