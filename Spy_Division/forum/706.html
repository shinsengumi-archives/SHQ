  I was actually working on the second instalment. However, it turned out to be supremely problematic and the ensuing frustrations have resulted in the trash below. Forgive me! *Cringes* It will not happen again.<br/>
   <br/>
  Summary: This takes place soon after Itou joined the Shinsengumi. A little random madness never kills anyone. Link to the story: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2664997/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2664997/1/</a> <br/>

  MORNING MADNESS!<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Poor little thing, Souji sighed that morning as he lay beside Toshi, his long fingers curled around the mans limp arousal. I dont think he gets nearly enough fun.<br/>
   <br/>
  Toshi grunted, but at least his eyes were focused on him now. What have you got in mind?<br/>
   <br/>
  Oh, he mused, a little variety maybe. Something special.<br/>
   <br/>
  The entrapped member twitched in apparent agreement despite the brooding silence. Toshis eyes narrowed suspiciously. You are always asking for favours.<br/>
   <br/>
  Souji blew at the dark strands of hair that had fallen into Toshis eyes. Maybe, he said with a slight, endearing pout, but you could always say no.<br/>
   <br/>
  A moment of careful consideration, and then: What is it?<br/>
   <br/>
  Souji sat back on his heels, the minx smile in his eyes. I was with Sannan yesterday. It appears that Itou-sensei enjoys your company tremendously. He couldnt understand why you brushed him off repeatedly. He paused for effect. That was very rude, Hijikata-san.<br/>
   <br/>
  Rude? Toshi was incredulous. Of course I had to be rude. Look, hes just hes creepy. He shuddered as he recalled the times the conniving bastard made various excuses to get up close and personal with him. He scratched his neck nervously. Its disgusting; I wouldnt touch him with a bargepole.<br/>
   <br/>
  Oh, I know that, Hijikata-san, said Souji, languidly rearranging his limbs to accommodate the upthrust member. Its owner grunted in appreciation as Soujis firm bottom sank slowly on his middle, making immediate contact possible. He brushed his fringe back from his eyes with a slender forearm. What I meant was, maybe you should stop avoiding him. Itou-sensei would feel much better if you talked to him directly instead of attempting to communicate with him through Sannan as you are doing now.<br/>
   <br/>
  No way, said Toshi irritably, thrusting his pelvis urgently since Souji did not seem to be performing with usual dedication. I thought you would know me better than most.<br/>
   <br/>
  Souji looked down upon him severely. Certain muscles of his contracted. Toshi winced.<br/>
   <br/>
  Souji! Stop that! The pressure eased off and Toshi gasped. Where did you learn that trick?<br/>
   <br/>
  Learn? Souji said with a straight face. I didnt learn that: its a form of exercise. The corners of his mouth twitched. One has to exercise to remain fit, no?<br/>
   <br/>
  Right, so exercise. Toshi frowned. But dont practice on me.<br/>
   <br/>
  Yes, sir! Souji grinned; he leaned forward slightly, his long hair a feathery sensation on Toshis chest. So, when are you going to talk to him  properly?<br/>
   <br/>
  The frown deepened. Sannan is handling him pretty well, isnt he? Why cant we leave things as they are now?<br/>
   <br/>
  Really, you shouldnt be so uptight, Hijikata-san. Itou-sensei has approached several others as well, even Hajime-san.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thats different, Toshi said stubbornly.<br/>
   <br/>
  No, its not, Souji was equally stubborn. He swung off and stood up, rubbing his toned abdomen with one hand as he breathed in deeply. Toshi watched the filtered sunlight glisten on the pale skin and wished fervently he would get back to what he had been doing. <br/>
   <br/>
  Ive been talking it over with Sannan, you know, and I agree, Souji was serious now. For the Shinsengumi to remain cohesive, there must not be dissension within its ranks. And the last person you want to antagonise would probably be the Military Advisor. Even Kondou-san agrees with us. At least he didnt say anything when we brought it up.<br/>
   <br/>
  Hes not supposed to say anything, Toshi pointed out. He has to remain neutral.<br/>
   <br/>
  I feel sure he agrees with us, Souji insisted. He planted his feet firmly apart, hands on hips, frowning down at the other man. Toshi had an agonisingly splendid view of what he wanted most in the world at the moment.<br/>
   <br/>
  Well, maybe if he started hesitantly.<br/>
   <br/>
  Souji smiled, apparently relenting, then knelt and performed for only a tantalisingly few seconds that other operation which was so precious to Toshi. Then he slid his mouth up Toshis chest and to his ear. He whispered.<br/>
   <br/>
  No! Toshi exploded, shaking his head vehemently.<br/>
   <br/>
  He whispered again, telling Toshi what he would not do ever again if he did not grant him this one, tiny, insignificant favour. He groaned: Soujis hand was busy.<br/>
   <br/>
  Then he told him what he would do if he did just that tiny little thing for him.<br/>
   <br/>
  Alright, he gave in.<br/>
   <br/>
  When?<br/>
   <br/>
  Soon. Not now, of course. Soon.<br/>
   <br/>
  And Souji laughed, a bright sound, descending from a high note like bells.<br/>
   <br/>
   The End<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Right. This is the tragic result when too much caffeine overwhelms the authors mind. Late night (early morning) madness! Sorry if the characters (and author) are OOC. This is a one-time madness. I promise it would not happen again. <br/>
   <br/>
  My titles are really bad. They either contain The or bad alliteration. Suggestions for a better title would definitely be considered. <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyone wants to read the sequel about Toshis fateful encounter with dear Itou-sensei? Tell me, yes?<br/>
   <br/>
  Meanwhile, please review if you are reading this. Yes. Collapses from sheer exhaustion.<br/>
