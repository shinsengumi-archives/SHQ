<h3>FYI writing group</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374826311">Not sure if I mentioned this before but I own an email list for writers <br/>
who have a special fondness for fantasy/ s/f, and paranormal things in <br/>
general.  A lot of the discussions are interesting and you'll always <br/>
find plenty of info on which publisher are buying what so for those of <br/>
you who want to branch out into original fiction and who love  adding <br/>
elements that are a bit out there please feel free to join PNwriters at <br/>
yahoogroups..<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of you guys  (and you know who you are )  are definitely good <br/>
enough to be published and if you like to or want to write  some <br/>
seriously smutty stuff the market for that is a big one not only in <br/>
E-books  but print publishers are picking up on it sooooo....<br/>
<br/>
-- Barb (whose ability to write serious smut is as bad her non existent <br/>
action scene writing ability)<br/>
