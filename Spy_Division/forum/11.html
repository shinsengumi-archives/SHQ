Volume 1.1<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to this first full sized issue of the Mibu Times/Dispatch <br/>
brought to you with a grant from the Shieiken Dojo Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
While this publication will be used to update new Mibu citizens on <br/>
matters close to home and barracks, we here at the Times/Dispatch want <br/>
you to think of this as your newspaper, your voice, your calm, <br/>
supportive and totally unbiased anchor in the bloody streets of Kyoto <br/>
(streets made bloody by the likes of the Choshu scum who refuse to <br/>
adhere to the values set forth by our illustrious Shogunate).<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the latest news we hope to bring you public service <br/>
announcements, advertisements from reputable local businesses, <br/>
employment listings and, if Miss Yamazaki can be convinced to come out <br/>
of the kitchen long enough to share her feminine wisdom, an advice <br/>
column to  help you with those little problems that at times can seem <br/>
totally overwhelming (such as having to deal with co-management who <br/>
think they&#39;re more capable of running certain security organizations <br/>
than those whom the Daimyo appointed personally).<br/>
<br/>
Again welcome to the Mibu Times/Dispatch.<br/>
<br/>

Second Vice-Chief Shinsengumi<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # # # # # #<br/>
<br/>
Local news:<br/>
<br/>
Recently the officers and men of the Shinsengumi marked the first <br/>
anniversary of the day they were welcomed  by the citizenry of Kyoto and <br/>
the surrounding areas. According to Chief Kondou Isami &quot;We are most <br/>
honored to have been chosen as Defenders of Kyoto and we wish the <br/>
citizens to know that they can come to us any time of the day or night <br/>
to seek help. It has been a memorable year and we thank our neighbors <br/>
for accepting us with open arms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated note Chief Kondou is asking for references for local <br/>
window repair and graffiti removal services. Project bids currently <br/>
being accepted at Shinsengumi headquarters, Mibu.<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # # # #<br/>
<br/>
Other news:<br/>
<br/>
A conservation minded citizen who chooses to remain anonymous has <br/>
reported to the Times/Dispatch that while traveling some time back he <br/>
witnessed a group of young thugs slicing down trees for no apparent <br/>
reason other than their own twisted sense of amusement. The worst <br/>
offender appeared to be a young lad of no more than fourteen summers who <br/>
gleefully sliced through trunk after trunk with his katana.<br/>
<br/>
When the citizen tried to speak with the male adult who appeared to be <br/>
the boy&#39;s guardian, he was greeted with a rude bout of obviously feigned <br/>
coughing. Taking the hint the concerned citizen continued on his <br/>
travels. He planned to return to that area soon on business and had <br/>
hoped to take the matter up with local officials but has decided to <br/>
postpone his trip due to the recent onset of an unexpected  respiratory <br/>
ailment.<br/>
<br/>
(Note from the editor-in-chief) Rest assured dear citizens that we of <br/>
the Shinsengumi will not tolerate such lack of disregard for the natural <br/>
beauty of our local flora and fauna in this Han. (Anyone attempting to <br/>
deface public property will be dealt with accordingly.)<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # # # # # #<br/>
<br/>
Pubic Service Bulletin:<br/>
<br/>
Runaway child report:<br/>
<br/>
 The missing child ran away from home approximately six months ago <br/>
following an argument with his adoptive father, a potter from the Edo <br/>
area. The boy&#39;s name is Himura  Shinta sometimes called &quot;Kenni&quot; He is of <br/>
slightly below average height and build with reddish brown hair and a <br/>
generally bad attitude. He was last reported in this general vicinity in <br/>
the company of a band of older men. His father reports that he is rather <br/>
immature for his age and that he believes these &quot;older men&quot; may have <br/>
coerced his son into following them for purposes of an obscene nature. <br/>
Anonymous information on this child accepted care of this newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # # # # #<br/>
<br/>
Lost & Found:<br/>
<br/>
Lost kitten. Orange with green eyes. Belongs to a close friend who is <br/>
heartbroken. Accidently let it out when returning to barracks and it ran <br/>
off. If found, please contact the Captain of the 2nd Unit. (Repeat of ad <br/>

behind the all-night soba place. Ummm. I&#39;ll help you get a replacement <br/>
pet for your friend.  Sorry.<br/>
