<h3>PMK Fanfic idea</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-491378391">someone run with this idea please....<br/>
<br/>
According to the new translation of one of the 3-hajime.com pages <br/>
Abe Juro (a survivor from the Itou Affair) said...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Saitoo Ichiroo was untidy with women.  He was familiar with a woman<br/>
in (4) Shimabara, and since she became a (5) Geisya in (6) Gion later,<br/>
he often visited her in Gion.  At that time, we lived in Takadaiji. <br/>
Because of this woman, Saitoo Ichiroo escaped from us. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
now in PMK you have a cross dressing Yamazaki Susumu...okay I admit<br/>
this goes in the yaoi category but wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if PMK<br/>
Saitou always departs from Itou and his minions to visit a certain<br/>
attractive lady to pass info back to Shinsengumi headquarters ^_^<br/>
<br/>
*imagine PMK Yamazaki working in the red-light district @_@</div>

know your talents lie more in the visual area but go for it<br/>

want to use the scenario...and with poor Saiotu still awaiting an end to <br/>
Tokio&#39;s cruel torture...<br/>
