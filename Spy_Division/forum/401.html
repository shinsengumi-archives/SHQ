<div id="ygrps-yiv-267097592">Thank you very much!  I'm not so good at figuring out emperor years <br/>
(sweatdrop).  I'll have to add that stuff to my list, and I wonder <br/>
if those Japanese sites have any other dates... I can't believe I <br/>
could never find Okita's birthday before, and now I see it in many <br/>
places. (sigh) I'm so happy.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I need to figure out how wordperfect can make its calendar <br/>
project an image or something like that.  I'll find a way, and then <br/>
it shall be completed.  Thank you so very much to everybody!</div>
