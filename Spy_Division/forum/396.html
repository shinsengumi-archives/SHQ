>even Katsura, the others were depressing (no Kenshin!). a friend<br/>
>even helped me pst my requests for info but all I got were more of<br/>
>the same.<br/>
><br/>
>That is, until someone mailed me the info I was looking for. No<br/>
>matter how much I wrote back, he/she never answered. Here is the<br/>
>summary of what he/she sent me:<br/>
><br/>
>Hitokiri Batt�-sai - the legendary warrior of Choshu did exist. His<br/>
>name and true identity was unknown even today except for the fact<br/>
>that he was called THE Batt�-sai (yep, that's how the sender said it<br/>
>should be spelled). He was one of the best warriors unfortunately he<br/>
>did not reach the customary cult status since no one even knew where<br/>
>he was buried. There are a few rumors here and there butno<br/>
>substantial proof. He started as an assassin but became a warrior<br/>
>after the death of his wife (whom he did not accidentaly kill but<br/>
>rather died of other circumstances). He became one of the bodyguards<br/>
>of Kido Tadayoshi known then as Katsura Kogoro. He was never<br/>
>defeated but he was also not much known probably because of the fact<br/>
>that only Katsura knew his real identity. After Meiji took over the<br/>
>government, he offered his sword in a shrine (unnamed) to a person<br/>
>who gave him another sword in return: the Shin Uchi (Sakabatou were<br/>
>pretty much in use as an alternative weapon but Batt�-sai used it as<br/>
>self-defense. Arai Shatku was rumored to be that person but it is<br/>
>also unconfirmed. We all knew Kawakami Gensai was caught and<br/>
>executed but we do not know why. Batt�-sai was the reason he fell<br/>
>(unfortunately again, the sender did not tell me how Batt�-sai<br/>
>helped). Another note, after the edict forbidding the wearing of<br/>
>swords Batt�-sai carried his in a sort of bag the way Yahiko does in<br/>
>Seisouhen. That way, he both did not break the law, and did not<br/>
>provoke the government soldiers. He settled down and faded into<br/>
>anonymity.<br/>
><br/>
>Makoto Shishio - here's the case: Watsuki said that Himura's real<br/>
>life model was Kawakami Gensai. Correction, Kawakami Gensai is more<br/>
>like Makoto Shishio in the story. They were both isolationists, they<br/>
>were both unbeaten assassins from Choshu, they were both executed<br/>
>after the restoration and they fight pretty much the same way.<br/>
>Makoto Shishio was not and never will be Batt�-sai's successor. For<br/>
>one, there are not only one Hitokiri or assassin of Choshu, there<br/>
>are literally dozens of them. Kawakami Gensai was using Furanui<br/>
>style Ken-jutsu and not Batt�-juttsu.<br/>
><br/>
>Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu - was a style of Kenjuttsu that originated ryt<br/>
>after the Battle of Sekigahara. Batt�-sai was reportedly the last<br/>
>master. The style persists but goes by another name today. The style<br/>
>was not pure anymore and Hiko of the OVA was telling the truth when<br/>
>he said that Mitsurugi Ryu ends with him although in real life, it<br/>
>was Batt�-sai who said those words.<br/>
><br/>
>The Kagetai - while I doubt that it was Hajime Saito really formed<br/>
>an assassination/espionage group, towards the end of the<br/>
>Shinsengumi's life, Hijikata's tactics became dirtier, resorting to<br/>
>assassinations and bribery and even threats. The group was formed in<br/>
>order to accomplish certain missions that were not approved by the<br/>
>powers that be (Kondou or Matsudaira or whoever else). They were a<br/>
>band of mercenaries and/or ronin. And they never exceeded 20. Their<br/>
>actual name is unkown.<br/>
><br/>
>That's it. And while there are other info included, I think these<br/>
>are the things others may be interested, whether you believe them or<br/>
>not. I am also interested on info about Bakufu Hitokiri. I am<br/>
>writing a book about Batt�-sai based on what I found out. And maybe<br/>
>I can borrow some characters from your wonderful group. Thanks.<br/>
