<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215080543">I held a contest for any creative multi-media expression of the <br/>
Shinsengumi and received only 2 entries.  The prize was a hakama and <br/>
haori from Japan, however the participants did not want to claim <br/>
their prize. So I used the money to get a paid LJ account now under <br/>
the supervision of Miralee http://shinsengumihq.livejournal.com/ <br/>
(the blog is fed to http://www.shinsengumihq.com) the blog design is <br/>

*I also installed a new image based navigation bar at the top of all <br/>
SHQ pages too, so just click on the links to take you to another <br/>
section of the site<br/>

Myspace has become a great way to meet new friends and network...how <br/>
would MIBUmyspace look like?<br/>

[note: Dr. Matsumoto was the Dutch educated physician, "Miki" was <br/>
Itou's younger brother and captain in the Shinsengumi---we generally <br/>
make him considerably less intelligent and responsible than his <br/>
older sibling]<br/>

If any Bakumatsu group needed a sports drink it would be the <br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
[setting = dojo]<br/>
<br/>
Okita and Saitou decide to practice.  The captain of the first <br/>
squad, exhausted from the activity and heat goes to the corner of <br/>
the room to get a drink from the cooler filled with ice.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata is enjoying the humid day by sitting in quiet contemplation <br/>
when Saitou rushes in, "Hijikata---come to the dojo right away, <br/>
something is wrong with Okita!"<br/>
<br/>
The vice chief was shocked to see his beloved on the floor choking <br/>
and gasping. Hijikata he turns to the captain of the third <br/>
squad "you bastard, Saitou, you know how fragile my Okita is these <br/>
days now look at what you did!"<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata draws Okita into his strong arms, "Okita, you're coughing <br/>
up blood again---why are you exerting yourself this way?  Do you <br/>
want to leave me forever?  For so long I've wanted to say...to say."<br/>
<br/>
Okita reaches up to caress Hijikata's face ::dramatically:: "My oni, <br/>
you startle easily I was just coughing up this disgusting new <br/>
tropical flavored punch drink.... <br/>
http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/shinsenade.jpg , but if you had <br/>
something to say, speak now"<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata (>_>X) "this was ... a joke?"<br/>
<br/>
Saitou :: ROFL ::<br/>
<br/>
Okita  :: LMAO ::<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata throws the bottle across the wooden floor</div>
