<h3>New File Notification message</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-29788706">Please disregard this.  I don&#39;t know why it sent it... I didn&#39;t request it to notify the group.<br/>
 <br/>
MissBehavin&#39; brought up something on SHQ that I wish someone had told me was a possibility for keeping stories archived... saving them as htm files to the Files Section.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m uploading two of my stories that have appeared elsewhere.  One is the one-shot Eiyu, the other being the full text of the completed Fast Carriage on a Runaway Road.  If it still insists on bothering you with a notification, I&#39;m sorry.  If this works (which it appears it will and help get stories transfered to the SHQ website quicker), then I&#39;m freeing up the LJ for general consumption starting tonight.<br/>
