<h3>Our first nasty spam</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-718790144">At least I don't remember any others...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I removed the offender from the membership and deleted the <br/>
post.  Sorry I don't know of any way of retrieving such messages from <br/>
inboxes. In future, I'll simply remove and delete without <br/>
notification. (Is there indeed a way of "banning" someone... anyone <br/>
here with any moderator/owner experience with yahoogroups that knows <br/>
or has done this?)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the inconvenience...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389047492">Same thi happened on SHQ today but it was caught. yes you can ban them. <br/>
I set the controls to moderate all new members that way if this happens <br/>
it doesn't reach the list and when a real member's first post reaches <br/>
you you can simply set them to non moderated.<br/>
