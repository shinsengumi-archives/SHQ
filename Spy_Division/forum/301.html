<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276146190">I just received this and thought I&#39;d pass it on in case anyone was interested.  There seem to be a lot of people who don&#39;t like VA&#39;s work, but there are some of us still around.  :-D  And since she has a connection to RK...<br/>
 <br/>
The chat&#39;s tomorrow... don&#39;t know why such short notice to notify the list.<br/>
