Rokugatsu no Yume<br/>
Dream of the Sixth Moon<br/>
Prologue: A Moment of Peace<br/>
By Shimazu Masayoshi<br/>
	<br/>
	Shimabara District, Kyoto<br/>
	1st Year of Genji, 6th month, 1st day (July 1, 1864)<br/>
<br/>
11 PM<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata Toshizou was late. For once, outside of his daily routine of<br/>
being a "demon", he was actually concerned with the opinion of someone<br/>
aside from himself. Finally coming to his objective, he paused for<br/>
breath, taking little time to read the writing on the paper lantern<br/>
outside, which he'd memorized long ago: Sakurada-ya<br/>
<br/>
	"Irasshaimase! Welcome, Hijikata-dono! Asako is waiting for you<br/>
upstairs."<br/>
<br/>
	Hijikata slipped out of his sandals and went up the stairs, without<br/>
even glancing at the young maid, who stared after him with a combined<br/>
sense of fear and wistful romantic longing. She'd wanted him to linger<br/>
around a bit longer, but the vice-commander of the Shinsengumi was<br/>
already up the stairs and with his hand on the door. Sliding it open,<br/>
he bowed curtly.<br/>
	<br/>
	"Omadaseshimashita. Sorry to keep you waiting, Asako-chan."<br/>
<br/>
	"Hijikata-samaI was so worried!"<br/>
	<br/>
	"It's alright" Shutting the door, he sat down in front of the<br/>
courtesan, who carefully poured sake for the two of them into small<br/>
saucers.<br/>
<br/>
	"You've been working hard, I'm sure, Hijikata-sama. Please feel free<br/>
to relax tonight."<br/>
<br/>
	Gratefully accepting the sake, he sipped it slowly. "Things have been<br/>
getting quiet recently. Too quiet"<br/>
<br/>
	"Maybe you should enjoy the quiet while you can? Peace, like the<br/>
beautiful cherry blossoms, does not linger for long."<br/>
<br/>
	He set his drink down, and edged closer.<br/>
<br/>
	"Yeah? And will you help me with that?"<br/>
<br/>
	A passionate smile passed over her face as she felt her legs go numb<br/>
from the erotic thrill that swept through her body.<br/>
<br/>
	"And how would a simple courtesan like me help you, the great and<br/>
marvelous vice-commander of the Shinsengumi?"<br/>
<br/>
	For a moment, there was humanity in the demon's eyes. He brought<br/>
Asako's hand to his face, and touched her face with his own. Asako<br/>
wasn't sure, but she thought that she saw tears form in his eyes for<br/>
the briefest of instants.<br/>
<br/>
	"By helping me enjoy a moment of peace"<br/>
<br/>
	She undid the simple knot at the front of her kimono, letting the<br/>
silk fabric fall away, leaving the pale richness of her bare skin and<br/>
full curves of her body exposed to the dim candlelight. The demon<br/>
wasted no time in taking her into his arms. And for a moment, there<br/>
was peace in that small room in Shimabara<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
	July 2nd<br/>
<br/>
	2 AM<br/>
<br/>
	As Hijikata and Asako still pursued their moment of peace, Saitou<br/>
Hajime, captain of the Shinsengumi 3rd squad, awoke in a geisha house<br/>
in Gion, after a long night of lovemaking. Feeling the touch of his<br/>
lover's deft, slender hands, he momentarily gasped before regaining<br/>
self-control.<br/>
<br/>
	"MmmHajime-samayour fundoshi was sooo starched"<br/>
<br/>
	"Good thing it's out of the way now, eh, Chise-chan?"<br/>
<br/>
	"Oh yes"<br/>
<br/>
	Saitou closed his eyes and breathed deeply of Chise's perfume. She<br/>
took such incredible care to be the best for him, and he wanted to<br/>
show her every bit of his gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
	"I meant to ask, Chise-chan, how's your novel about the 47 loyal<br/>
retainers coming?"<br/>
<br/>
	"Very wellI just had my heroine inadvertently bump into Horibe<br/>
Yasubee-sama's hidden stash of illicit woodblock prints"<br/>
<br/>
	He laughed. True to their reputation, geisha were quite engaging and<br/>
entertaining in everything<br/>
<br/>
	"Sounds like a rather embarrassing moment for Horibe-dono."<br/>
<br/>
	"Indeedhe was most definitely not pleased. Although, even though he<br/>
didn't say it, he was rather amused by the whole incident."<br/>
<br/>
	"I seewell, shall we, in turn, amuse ourselves again?"<br/>
<br/>
	"So impatient, Hajime-sama" she said playfully. "Yes, let's get back<br/>
to amusing ourselves" And then, like Hijikata, Saitou Hajime also<br/>
knew peace<br/>

earlier when you PM'd me. Great start M!</div>
