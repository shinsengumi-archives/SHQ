Rokugatsu no Yume<br/>
Dream of the Sixth Moon<br/>
Prologue: A Moment of Peace<br/>
By Shimazu Masayoshi<br/>
	<br/>
	Shimabara District, Kyoto<br/>
	1st Year of Genji, 6th month, 1st day (July 1, 1864)<br/>
<br/>
11 PM<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata Toshizou was late. For once, outside of his daily routine of<br/>
being a &quot;demon&quot;, he was actually concerned with the opinion of someone<br/>
aside from himself. Finally coming to his objective, he paused for<br/>
breath, taking little time to read the writing on the paper lantern<br/>
outside, which he&#39;d memorized long ago: Sakurada-ya<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Irasshaimase! Welcome, Hijikata-dono! Asako is waiting for you<br/>
upstairs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	Hijikata slipped out of his sandals and went up the stairs, without<br/>
even glancing at the young maid, who stared after him with a combined<br/>
sense of fear and wistful romantic longing. She&#39;d wanted him to linger<br/>
around a bit longer, but the vice-commander of the Shinsengumi was<br/>
already up the stairs and with his hand on the door. Sliding it open,<br/>
he bowed curtly.<br/>
	<br/>
	&quot;Omadaseshimashita. Sorry to keep you waiting, Asako-chan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Hijikata-samaI was so worried!&quot;<br/>
	<br/>
	&quot;It&#39;s alright&quot; Shutting the door, he sat down in front of the<br/>
courtesan, who carefully poured sake for the two of them into small<br/>
saucers.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;You&#39;ve been working hard, I&#39;m sure, Hijikata-sama. Please feel free<br/>
to relax tonight.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	Gratefully accepting the sake, he sipped it slowly. &quot;Things have been<br/>
getting quiet recently. Too quiet&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Maybe you should enjoy the quiet while you can? Peace, like the<br/>
beautiful cherry blossoms, does not linger for long.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	He set his drink down, and edged closer.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Yeah? And will you help me with that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	A passionate smile passed over her face as she felt her legs go numb<br/>
from the erotic thrill that swept through her body.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;And how would a simple courtesan like me help you, the great and<br/>
marvelous vice-commander of the Shinsengumi?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	For a moment, there was humanity in the demon&#39;s eyes. He brought<br/>
Asako&#39;s hand to his face, and touched her face with his own. Asako<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure, but she thought that she saw tears form in his eyes for<br/>
the briefest of instants.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;By helping me enjoy a moment of peace&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	She undid the simple knot at the front of her kimono, letting the<br/>
silk fabric fall away, leaving the pale richness of her bare skin and<br/>
full curves of her body exposed to the dim candlelight. The demon<br/>
wasted no time in taking her into his arms. And for a moment, there<br/>
was peace in that small room in Shimabara<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
	July 2nd<br/>
<br/>
	2 AM<br/>
<br/>
	As Hijikata and Asako still pursued their moment of peace, Saitou<br/>
Hajime, captain of the Shinsengumi 3rd squad, awoke in a geisha house<br/>
in Gion, after a long night of lovemaking. Feeling the touch of his<br/>
lover&#39;s deft, slender hands, he momentarily gasped before regaining<br/>
self-control.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;MmmHajime-samayour fundoshi was sooo starched&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Good thing it&#39;s out of the way now, eh, Chise-chan?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Oh yes&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	Saitou closed his eyes and breathed deeply of Chise&#39;s perfume. She<br/>
took such incredible care to be the best for him, and he wanted to<br/>
show her every bit of his gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;I meant to ask, Chise-chan, how&#39;s your novel about the 47 loyal<br/>
retainers coming?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Very wellI just had my heroine inadvertently bump into Horibe<br/>
Yasubee-sama&#39;s hidden stash of illicit woodblock prints&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	He laughed. True to their reputation, geisha were quite engaging and<br/>
entertaining in everything<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Sounds like a rather embarrassing moment for Horibe-dono.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Indeedhe was most definitely not pleased. Although, even though he<br/>
didn&#39;t say it, he was rather amused by the whole incident.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;I seewell, shall we, in turn, amuse ourselves again?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;So impatient, Hajime-sama&quot; she said playfully. &quot;Yes, let&#39;s get back<br/>
to amusing ourselves&quot; And then, like Hijikata, Saitou Hajime also<br/>
knew peace<br/>
