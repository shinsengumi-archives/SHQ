<h3>New Pic</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006611979">I have uploaded a new pic to the &quot;Single Originals&quot; section-- a pic <br/>
of Yuki, after the timeline change in &quot;Jidai Monogatari&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the reason that she has the two dots high on her forehead <br/>
is because that was part of the makeup worn by the Imperial <br/>
courtiers. Since, in the new timeline, she&#39;s a granddaughter of the <br/>
previous emperor, she&#39;d wear her makeup like that for formal <br/>
functions, like what happens at the end of the story...<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll save that for later...^_^...(smiles mysteriously) All I <br/>
gotta say for now, though, is to Choshuu: Don&#39;t be so sure that <br/>
you&#39;re going to still end up winning...<br/>
