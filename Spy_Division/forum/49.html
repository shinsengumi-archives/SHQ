<h3>New Pic</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006611979">I have uploaded a new pic to the "Single Originals" section-- a pic <br/>
of Yuki, after the timeline change in "Jidai Monogatari".<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the reason that she has the two dots high on her forehead <br/>
is because that was part of the makeup worn by the Imperial <br/>
courtiers. Since, in the new timeline, she's a granddaughter of the <br/>
previous emperor, she'd wear her makeup like that for formal <br/>
functions, like what happens at the end of the story...<br/>
<br/>
But I'll save that for later...^_^...(smiles mysteriously) All I <br/>
gotta say for now, though, is to Choshuu: Don't be so sure that <br/>
you're going to still end up winning...<br/>
