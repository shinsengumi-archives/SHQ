<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309733989">Is there anybody here who has *never* registered with LiveJournal? <br/>
(Not you Barb... you were registered once) I need someone to <br/>
represent some lost soul who comes upon the LJ address and wants to <br/>
read some delicious miburo fiction.  I need them to access the <br/>
journal and tell me what happens.<br/>
<br/>
I know that it won&#39;t let me see anything but the main entry --- <br/>
everything behind the lj-cut (which will have to be done when posting <br/>
stories) and comments are denied --- when I&#39;m not logged on, but I <br/>
want to make sure it&#39;s the same for someone LJ would never recognize.<br/>
<br/>
The address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office/">http://www.livejournal.com/~shq_spy_office/</a><br/>
<br/>
Please, don&#39;t anyone start trying to join!!!  I&#39;m just getting set up <br/>
and need to do some experimenting before turning it loose.  There&#39;s <br/>
nothing for you to see anyway at this point.  It&#39;s nothing but an <br/>
empty shell.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!<br/>
