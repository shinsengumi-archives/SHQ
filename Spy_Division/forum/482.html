<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883842024">I *LOVE* PMK Saitoh his hair is perfect!!!....<br/>
and if you check out this link you'll know that I greatly appreciate <br/>
PMK Saitoh's hair <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/sig6.jpg">http://1happyturtle.com/makoto/sig6.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
His sleepy eyes are sooo cute...you want to try you hand and drawing <br/>
PMK Saitoh when he is actually *awake*? (^_^) that is when he is <br/>
fighting LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Burai Saitoh has nice hair too...but I think the hair is historically <br/>
innaccurate...I mean can we all imagine these guys flicking their <br/>
hair back all the time or brushing away their bangs? ::giggles::<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869731599">omg...u still have the wild haired saitoh XD XD that was probably my<br/>
favourite pic of Saitoh... ROFL yes i was going to draw an awake Saitoh<br/>
next...unfortunately he only appears like that ONCE in the entire PMK manga<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >.< well, in all the chapters i have anyway...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>maybe in burai the guys tie the hair into a bun when they go out to fight?<br/>
rofl Although i must say it's going to be hard fitting all that white hair<br/>
(who IS that guyanyway?) in a tiny bun...>.><br/>
so, umm...a tiny request to everyone: if anybody has a pic of *awake* PMK<br/>
Saitoh, will you please email it to me? ^^;;; thanks a bunch!!!<br/>
