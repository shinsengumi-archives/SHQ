Aizu Joushigun<br/>
Dai-ni: Ame<br/>
Two: Rain<br/>
<br/>
Summer 1864<br/>
Kyoto<br/>
<br/>
The door of the inn flew inward with a crash. The swirling dust and<br/>
rain obscured the entrance for but a moment, before the waiting forms<br/>
outside became visible. As the leader stepped inside, his white sleeve<br/>
insignia with the black letter &quot;Ai&quot; on it could plainly be seen by one<br/>
and all. The shopkeeper&#39;s face contorted. He shuddered in fear for a<br/>
moment, noting the waiting soldiers outside carrying spears and guns.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re being sear--&quot; his words ended with the squish of steel through<br/>
flesh.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am Yamamoto Kakuma of Aizu-han!&quot; the squad leader brandished his<br/>
sword, stained with fresh blood, at the cowering commoners. &quot;We come<br/>
on official business!&quot; The others poured in, the stamping of their<br/>
boots resounding throughout the building as some spread out to secure<br/>
the ground floor while the rest bounded up the stairs. There was a<br/>
ghastly stillness for a moment, and then a bloody heap fell down the<br/>
stairs. They were right...there were Shishi here, just like the spy<br/>
report had said. Just as Yamamoto started to turn, there was a blur of<br/>
motion.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Choshu!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He began to turn, blade hissing outward in a flash of light, before a<br/>
loud crack resounded in the dead air...Yamamoto only saw the dead body<br/>
just as his eyes began to adjust. At the far side of the room, one of<br/>
his men was busy reloading his Spencer rifle. The remaining men and<br/>
women, most probably employees, cowered in shock.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Resist and you will all pay the consequences! Cooperate and the law<br/>
will be lenient!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The unit from the upper floor pounded down the stairs, kicking along a<br/>
couple of bound and struggling men. Yamamoto nodded, and pointed to<br/>
the others on the floor. &quot;You, you, and you, tie these people up and<br/>
take them to Kurotani for questioning. You and you, board up the<br/>
entrance and go inform the Kuwana troops at Nijo. And you...&quot; he<br/>
pointed at the young soldier who&#39;d been so quick to shoot. &quot;With me.<br/>
Now.&quot; With a sharp cleaning whip to his sword, he sheathed and turned<br/>
to leave.<br/>
<br/>
The young soldier quickly fell in step next to Yamamoto as he emerged.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It stopped raining...&quot; he shook his head. With his men in tow, he<br/>
started on the long road back to Aizu headquarters.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I did good, didn&#39;t I?&quot; asked the soldier with a slight cough. &quot;Damn,<br/>
it&#39;s so hard to keep my voice low.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yae...&quot; he whispered, keeping his own voice low. &quot;Your technique is...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Clean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yamamoto turned to his...sister, and proffered a hand towel from under<br/>
his breastplate. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to call it, but I guess...&quot; She<br/>
wiped her forehead and grinned happily.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re like the Murasaki Shikibu of gunnery.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Does that mean I outdo you? Murasaki was better than her brother at<br/>
writing, you know...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just shut up, Yae. People will stare.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Haha...I&#39;m better than you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Save it for the demonstration before Lord Katamori tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re on!&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829502360">AHAHAHA cute brother sister interaction.<br/>
Oh remember she taught that handsome teenager in the the Byakkotai?  <br/>
Write about that scenario *please*.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you add just a shred of detail regarding gunnery it would <br/>
help alot (like the process of actually shooting).  Because when I <br/>
read the story I almost missed that part.  It is hard to do since <br/>
most of us have never held a gun/rifle in our lives.<br/>

Glossary and Notes:<br/>
<br/>
-han: suffix meaning �feudal domain�<br/>
<br/>
-Murasaki Shikibu was an 11th century poet and author of the world�s first <br/>
novel (The Tale of Genji), who outdid her brother in an age when women were <br/>
supposed to be very sparsely educated.</div>
