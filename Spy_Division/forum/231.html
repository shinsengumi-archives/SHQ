<h3>Calling All Poets!  &quot;Rurouni Rhythm&quot; Needs YOU!</h3>
by <i>unsafesects</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-688140810">Hello Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I've started a new collaborative project called "Rurouni Rhythm".<br/>
<br/>
This "story" will be a re-telling (summarization) of the Rurouni<br/>
Kenshin tale, episode by episode, in verse!<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for guest authors (I actually hope to have about 50% of it<br/>
written by others), and I was certainly hoping that the SHQ Spy<br/>
Division would have some interested parties, at the very least, for<br/>
Episodes 29-32, or other episodes where Saitou is a prominent figure.<br/>
<br/>
If your entry is selected, it will be posted under my username in the<br/>
"Rurouni Rhythm" story.  HOWEVER, -full- credit will be given to the<br/>
author!  <br/>
<br/>
Rules are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Submissions for episodes can be sent to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mindglue@...">mindglue@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
1) The email subject must include the episode number and title. We<br/>
will not accept submissions by review.<br/>
<br/>
2) The author's email address, ff.net username, and URL of the<br/>
author's profile must be in the email. These will be included in the<br/>
chapter if your entry is picked to appear as a guest author in<br/>
"Rurouni Rhythm".<br/>
<br/>
3) Poems -must- be sent in .doc or .txt format.<br/>
<br/>
4) There is no guarantee that your poem will be used. Period.<br/>
<br/>
5) Poems may be of any format, from serious to humorous, from haiku to<br/>
Dr. Seuss, sonnet to epic Homerian style. However, preference will be<br/>
given to humorous poems, as I wish "Rurouni Rhythm" to be, overall,<br/>
lighthearted.<br/>
<br/>
6) At this time, we are only looking for poems summarizing episodes<br/>
through the end of the Kyoto arc. Feel free to send any episode number<br/>
up to episode 65 at any time. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I hope some of you will consider submitting poems to become guest<br/>
poets!<br/>
