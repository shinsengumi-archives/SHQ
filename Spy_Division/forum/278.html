<h3>PMK Hijikata Fanart</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-439983648">I uploaded my PMK Hijikata Fanart in Photos.<br/>
Yes, he actually has some red eyeliner...actually you can blame the<br/>
crayola markers I purchased...the felt tip screwed up everything so I<br/>
used a bit of red to cover up something and thought "heck" heroes in<br/>
Japanese prints have red around the eyes.  The drawing was done on<br/>
paper taped together (you'll see a thin white line near the bottom.  I<br/>
submitted this fanart to the contest.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737039053">lol ... WOW, we DO think alike ... I just uploaded my PMK Yamazaki fanart in Photos also ^^  He has red eyeliner too... but I wanted it that way... it's kinda like a black and red theme.  U can see this on the cover of the PMK volume 1 manga, except it's a picture of Tetsu and not Yamazaki.  I don't have a scanner, so it turned out kinda crappy... i only have digital camera *sob* and the lighting wasn't very good... *sigh* oh well, I submitted it to the contest also.<br/>

Red eyeliner looks great on our guys don't you think? ^_^<br/>
I like the scratches on Yamazaki's cheek...somehow I find black and<br/>
red to be very seductive colors...oh, and don't forget to send a copy<br/>
to Barbara for SHQ okay?<br/>
