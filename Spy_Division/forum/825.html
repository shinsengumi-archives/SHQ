<h3>Upcoming novel featuring the Shinsengumi</h3>
by <i>chloemichelle301</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-252270049">Hi everyone. Here's a sample of MIrror, Mirror the timetravel novel<br/>
featuring members of the Shisnengumi. The book is due out in e-book format<br/>
May 12 and in a paperback version sometime in July...<br/>
<br/>
* * * *<br/>
<br/>
I sat in musty, dark storage room off the kitchens and wondered how much<br/>
time had passed since Hijikata had me placed in here to await Kaemon's<br/>
arrival. I glanced toward the tiny barred window at the far end of the shed<br/>
but couldn't really see the sky. It seemed that it was just beginning to<br/>
lighten but then there had been a few large paper lanterns strung around the<br/>
compound so I wasn't quite sure about the light or its source.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to erase the image of Kaemon's furious expression from my mind. Why<br/>
did he blame me? It wasn't as if I planned to have all that stuff happen.<br/>
Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have gone busting through the Inamoto-ro but I'd<br/>
been scared. Those gorilla guys were after me and I didn't even want to<br/>
think about what their slimy little boss had planned for me back at his<br/>
place. It was obvious that he had me pegged for some new male prostitute or<br/>
other, but once they found out I was a girl, there was no telling what they<br/>
would have done.<br/>
<br/>
What was I supposed to do? Let them take me or try to go politely in the<br/>
brothel and asked sweetly for Kaemon to come to the door and reason with the<br/>
gorillas?<br/>
<br/>
Like that would have worked.<br/>
<br/>
I sighed and leaned back against a pile of rice sacks. I closed my eyes<br/>
while sending silent farewells back to Uncle Jake, my mother and<br/>
grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
I imagined the tombstone:<br/>
<br/>
Here Lies Emmi Maeda, Executed A Century Before She was Born<br/>
<br/>
** * * **<br/>
<br/>
Though Kaemon pretended to rest in the palanquin that took him from the<br/>
Imperial Palace to Mibu, he covertly peered across the carriage to his<br/>
companion and personal retainer, Kishi Matsuyama, who had been conspicuously<br/>
absent during the incident at *Inamoto-ro*.<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly he'd been so occupied with one of the new whores, Matsuyama<br/>
hadn't realize he'd returned unexpectedly with Aneko and was involved in the<br/>
commotion. That account did not agree with the one from off-duty Shinsengumi<br/>
captain Kanryussai Takeda.<br/>
<br/>
The palanquin stopped.<br/>
<br/>
"My Lord," Matsuyama said. "We've arrived."<br/>
<br/>
Kae sat up and made a show of rubbing the sleep from his eyes then followed<br/>
his retainer out of the carriage. They entered the Shinsengumi compound<br/>
where the chief officers and a few of the captains waited.<br/>
<br/>
Following an imperceptible nod of Kaemon's head, Toshizou Hijikata<br/>
instructed two of his men to escort Matsuyama away.<br/>
<br/>
"M-my Lord-"<br/>
<br/>
"No one betrays me, Matsuyama, and lives. No one."<br/>
<br/>
Those softly spoken words chilled me to the bone as I was led past the man I<br/>
recognized as Kaemon's friend who'd gotten us out of the brothel the night I<br/>
arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the man struggle only to be knocked to the ground and bound with rope<br/>
then dragged away to a darkened corner. Light glinted off a katana blade as<br/>
it sliced through the air seconds after Kaemon's former friend cried out.<br/>
<br/>
"Your turn," Hijikata muttered as I was led past him and toward Chief<br/>
Kondou's quarters.<br/>
<br/>
I gagged and raised my  bound hands to my mouth as my stomach churned.<br/>
 Kondou read the same list of charges that Hijikata had read while Kaemon<br/>
stared at me with the same deadly expression that he'd worn when condemning<br/>
his friend to death only moments ago.<br/>
<br/>
