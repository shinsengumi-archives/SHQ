has two new files written/performed/produced by Hirotada Tokugawa<br/>
<br/>
the first "Jurisdiction Pt1" is very very good (^_^)<br/>
I enjoyed Kondou's "voice" alot!!!!<br/>
<br/>
"Akizuki Teijiro- Aizu Chujo no Onari" is more educational for those<br/>
of us unfamiliar with Edo-Era etiquette<br/>
<br/>
the advantage of audio recordings:<br/>
They are easy to make<br/>
you can drag in your friends, unwilling boyfriends and girlfriends and<br/>
have them be other charas<br/>
you can be really REALLY creative<br/>
<br/>
if anyone wants to contribute please contact the email on the page and<br/>
provide a description.  For example, in "Akizuki Teijiro..." many of<br/>
us would not know the meanings of the words so Hirotada Tokugawa gave<br/>
a brief explanation.<br/>

OLD fanfic w/ new  cover<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned this fic before when it was uploaded to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumifics.com">http://www.shinsengumifics.com</a><br/>
<br/>
However, I found more interesting historical information well after I<br/>
completed the fic which may sort of buttress the fictional scenario.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what to say about this fic --- all I know is that<br/>
hopefully historical Fujita Goro was unaware of the details<br/>
surrounding the fight for Kondou's life. <br/>
<br/>
Satsuma was more inclined to save Kondou while Tosa wanted Kondou<br/>
executed based on their belief that the Shinsengumi had murdered Ryoma<br/>
Sakamoto. The strongest voice came from Tosa man Tani Tateki. <br/>
<br/>
So I will explain how historically Fujita Goro was always "one spot"<br/>
away from Tani Tateki the man who really pushed for the death penalty<br/>
for Kondou Isami.<br/>
<br/>
so here is a diagram (ignore the names in the [middle], just notice<br/>
how Fujita Goro is "close" to *Tani).  The relationships are<br/>
especially strong in the years right after Fujita Goro retired from<br/>
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dept.<br/>
<br/>
#1 [VERY VERY strong connection]<br/>
Fujita Goro (friends w/) Yamakawa Hiroshi (friends w/) Tani Tateki<br/>
<br/>
****this is also discussed by Japanese fans, it is well known that<br/>
Fujita Goro spent alot of time at Hiroshi's house and Tani ALSO was at<br/>
Hiroshi's home too!<br/>
<br/>
****the basis of the fic is based on this strongest connection<br/>
<br/>
#2 [weak connection]<br/>
Fujita Goro (friends w/) Takamine Hideo (opposition in career w/) Tani<br/>
Tateki<br/>
<br/>
#3 [weakest connection]<br/>
Fujita Goro (employee of) Jigoro Kano (friends w/) Tani Tateki<br/>
<br/>
the diagram implies a LINEAR relationship however I should also add<br/>
that Yamakawa Hiroshi (+) Takamine Hideo and (+) Jigoro Kano all<br/>
interacted on a professional and personal level extensively as well<br/>
however it is NOT CLEAR if Tani's memoirs (WHICH CLEARLY STATED HIS<br/>
INVOLVEMENT WITH KONDOU's DEATH) was published during Fujita Goro's<br/>
lifetime or not OR if the peole in the [middle] such as Yamakawa<br/>
Hiroshi or Takamine Hideo (BOTH OF WHOM KNEW FUJITA GORO was formerly<br/>
a member of the Shinsengumi) read Tani's own writings. So if the<br/>
people in the [middle] knew then surely they would never let Tani and<br/>
Fujita Goro interact even if Mr. Fujita was completely oblivious to<br/>
Tani's past...<br/>
<br/>
As I researched these interaction by examining the educational network<br/>
I couldn't help feeling that somehow there is cruel irony involved. (T_T)<br/>

***coming soon, fanart for Tokio's page<br/>
***Yamaguchi Yukiko by Hirotada Tokugawa (niece of Fujita Goro, and<br/>
student at "Tokio's School") ok it was not technically "Tokio's<br/>
school" but we'll call it that to keep things simple<br/>
<br/>
Tokio + Yamamoto Yaeko (Joushitai) Fanart (housed on the Bakumatsu/Edo<br/>
Art page)<br/>
