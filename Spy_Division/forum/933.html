Walk One: The Lair of the Mibu Wolves<br/>

Walk Two will be about the sites around Kiyamachi Dori<br/>
<br/>
The third will be a tour guide since the distance between the sites in Southern Higashiyama and Fushimi require public transport</div>

 </span></blockquote>I love this, and it really is a great guide for anyone that might already know a lot about the Shinsengumi or for those that might not, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I am really looking forward to seeing the rest of them!!  Thank you for doing this and for sharing it with us.<br/>
