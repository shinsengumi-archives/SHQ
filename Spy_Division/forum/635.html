<h3>Hello all!</h3>
by <i>gemchansan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737045800">Hello everybody. Longtime reader and lover of RK/Shinsengumi (go<br/>
Shinpachi!), new to the forum. Some of you may remember me as Gem-chan<br/>
from over at RK Dreams. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I posted to .pdf articles over in the files section under<br/>
writing tips, Japanese terms and concepts. They are two articles I<br/>
found in my files in hard copy and then hunted down online. One is<br/>
called Samurai Discontent and Social Mobility in the Late Tokugawa<br/>
Period, the other, The Popularization of Samurai Values, A Sermon by<br/>
Hoshi Heishu. They're academic tomes, and slightly old ones at that,<br/>
but I find them to be interesting glimpses into the late Tokugawa<br/>
period. They should have their copyright notices at the front of the<br/>
articles, and as long as they are used for personal and non-commercial<br/>
use, then they are within the letter of the law. <br/>
<br/>
All you nerds who read them, enjoy! :p<br/>
