<h3>New Saitou-Sano musicvid</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451181110">I kept expecting secretarytocapt3 to say something about this since she was the one who brought it to my attention.  (This is what I get for ignoring LJ lately).<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a new RK musicvid out by a very talented person.  It&#39;s called &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; and it&#39;s by schwarefee (better known as kuroiyousei, aka Black Faery).  Extremely well done... I really don&#39;t expect anything less than excellent from her in anything she tries her hand at.  It&#39;s her first musicvid and she&#39;s really looking for some feedback and any encouragement to keep putting time into making musicvids.  Yeah, it&#39;s yaoi-inspired, but doesn&#39;t have to be taken in that perspective.  It&#39;s as much about the tentative friendship between two opposites who really aren&#39;t opposites at all.<br/>

Please take a look and give kuroiyousei an honest opinion of the piece.  She&#39;s a wonderful person who puts a lot of time and love into making us RK Saitou fans happy.<br/>

The music video had a very strong ending too...<br/>
Just so everyone understands...comments and the star ratings are <br/>
important on animemusicvideos.org...the creators are always eager <br/>
for reviews and there is a system in place for them to reply as well.<br/>
