HAIKU: SUMMER<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They were outside the great gate of Kyoto, and all the crowd was <br/>
gone. Before them lay broad green fields, and a rough sandy road <br/>
stretching brown-gold into the distance with a wood beyond. The <br/>
voices from the city died away. Somewhere a lark sung in the summer <br/>
sky; a blue sky, patched here and there with puffy fair-weather <br/>
clouds, the sun high amongst them now. They turned up the sandy road <br/>
and went on without breaking step, at a steady walk. <br/>
<br/>
Heisuke eyed the flower in Tetsu&#39;s sash. &quot;Oooh!&quot; he said in a mocking <br/>
falsetto. &quot;A flower for the puppy, is it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tetsu said irritably. &quot;Leave off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not as pretty as Saya, the one who gave it to you.&quot; Heisuke leaned <br/>
closer, his face inches from the boy. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;As who?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Saya-chan. Don&#39;t you think she&#39;s pretty, then?&quot; The lopsided grin <br/>
grew wider.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I suppose so, yes,&quot; Tetsu flushed. &quot;I never thought about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heisuke laughed, &quot;One good thing about you, you&#39;re uncomplicated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But Tettsu&#39;s mind had jumped backward to the tableau he had <br/>
unwittingly interrupted last night. He wound a loose string <br/>
thoughtfully round one finger as he walked. &quot;I wonder what Okita-san <br/>
is doing now, back there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heisuke snorted. &quot;The usual, of course. The Demon is probably moping <br/>
around in his room and Okita is most likely with him since he is not <br/>
patrolling today.&quot; His next remark startled Tetsu. &quot;Too bad the Demon <br/>
didn&#39;t take a shine to Itou-san.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tetsu stopped abruptly and frowned, confused. &quot;Well, Itou-san, of <br/>
course! But Hijikata-san? I thought he was  well, you know. I <br/>
thought  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You thought the Old Demon was gay?&quot; Heisuke roared, and half a dozen <br/>
larks rocketed into the air. He put a long arm around Tetsu&#39;s <br/>
shoulders, obviously tickled by the notion. &quot;Oh, my. No-o-o. Not by a <br/>
wondrous long shot. Hijikata-Toshizou,&quot; he informed him as they <br/>
strolled along, &quot;is in love with Nature and women are nature at its <br/>
finest for the Old Demon! Couldn&#39;t say no if a woman came to him, and <br/>
come they surely did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But &quot; Tetsu said, more confused now. &quot;But I saw them yesterday, and <br/>
he was undoing Okita-san&#39;s sash&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Note, if you will,&quot; Heisuke said, face grave, eyes alight, &quot;the awe-<br/>
inspiring lack of shock with which I greet your announcement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tetsu growled at the man he was very nearly content to call his <br/>
friend. &quot;Eat shit,&quot; he said through gritted teeth, &quot;and die.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your master has had a lamentable influence on your vocabulary,&quot; <br/>
Heisuke said with starchy disapproval.<br/>
<br/>
They sat for a time listening to the sounds of the woods and staring <br/>
at the western sky, blazing now with the colours of sundown. Heisuke <br/>
seemed to be working something out, so Tetsu just waited until he <br/>
spoke again.<br/>
<br/>
Heisuke was concerned about how the Shinsengumi would fare after the <br/>
upheaval; he did not want to see anyone hurt. Okita&#39;s all guts and <br/>
brains on the outside, but there is broked glass inside that child. <br/>
If he had to choose, the Old Demon is going to choose to follow <br/>
through with his plans and draconian laws, and he would hate to think <br/>
how Souji would take that.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, am not going to make the same mistake Sannan made all <br/>
those years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The object of this conversation was unaware of the extent to which <br/>
the exalted state of his soul was drawing notice. Toshi was sweating <br/>
buckets with Saizou curled up on his lap, radiating heat like a <br/>
second sun in the late afternoon. If, instead of assuming that he was <br/>
meditating on the future of Japan or synthesising some new forms of <br/>
torture for the Choshu members, anyone had asked him directly what he <br/>
was thinking about, he would have said, without hesitation, &quot;I was <br/>
thinking that I could really use a drink of tea.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A tea and peaceful quiet as he worked, that would have been <br/>
perfection. But even with those two elements of bliss, he knew he <br/>
would never be completely happy.<br/>
<br/>
Still, there was great contentment in the simplest moments. Like now: <br/>
sitting in his room in the Mibu Temple, where he could relax in the <br/>
afternoon while the others slept, without so many interruptions. All <br/>
the screen doors were set open, which gave a pleasant sense of summer <br/>
freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Lulled by the afternoon heat, the stilly hum and the warm breeze, <br/>
Souji would relax and Toshi would feel his breathing slow and his <br/>
sweet weight settling against him. Sometimes he would simply sit and <br/>
watch him sleep, enjoying the rare silence. Toshi pushed the hair off <br/>
his forehead one-handedly and looked down at Souji, shifting slightly <br/>
to ease the numbness in his right arm. <br/>
<br/>
And he wondered, as he recently did with startling frequency, if <br/>
Souji still missed his sister. Such topics were usually off-limits <br/>
and deftly turned aside when brought up. Mitsu was the ideal wife: <br/>
dignified, devoted, subtle, confident  in other words, a woman of <br/>
true samurai descent. He loved her low husky voice; similar to <br/>
Souji&#39;s, now that he thought of it, but unusual among grown men.<br/>
<br/>
More than anything, he wished to know if Souji blamed him for the <br/>
abject misery they had known since the move to Kyoto  endless <br/>
patrols and raids that more often than not ended with bloodshed.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Grief  where should it end?&quot; Toshi muttered, his mind struggling <br/>
sluggishly with the vague introit. He glared at the Book in the far <br/>
corner of the room; he would rather be spanked a hundred times than <br/>
risk waking Souji just to get to it. He tried again, his voice barely <br/>
a whisper:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Grief  where should it end?<br/>
 Where the leaves go in Autumn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He stopped, surprised at how fast he had managed to come up with two <br/>
lines of a haiku. It usually took him a full afternoon to complete <br/>
just one. Heartened, he started again.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Grief  where should it end?<br/>
 Where the leaves go in Autumn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And how should he proceed from there? He frowned.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where the leaves go in Autumn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And then Toshi realised the warm weight on his arm was gone and that <br/>
the distracting prickling sensation heralding the return of normal <br/>
blood circulation was starting. Souji, roused from his light nap, <br/>
yawned and craned his neck to look at Toshi. &quot;That&#39;s very poetic, <br/>
Hijikata-san. Of course the trouble with leaves is, they grow again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Toshi grunted, choosing to remain otherwise silent. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why, the great Vice-Commander of the Shinsengumi is well and truly <br/>
stumped!&quot; he paused, a finger tapping insistently on the chin. &quot;How <br/>
about this, Hijikata-san: Plum blossoms in spring. ?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Toshi started. What exactly is he getting at? His face, however, <br/>
remained an unassailable mask of calm and logic as he puffed on his <br/>
pipe. &quot;You insufferable brat. That has no logical link to the <br/>
previous lines.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Souji gazed wistfully at the courtyard. &quot;There is a link, alright.&quot; <br/>
He looked at Toshi and seemed suddenly to relax; he grinned. &quot;There <br/>
are references to plants and seasons in the second line, aren&#39;t <br/>
there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s it. I&#39;m quitting. I&#39;ve had enough,&quot; Toshi declared. &quot;It&#39;s too <br/>
hot, and this has become entirely too silly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At least it isn&#39;t bratty,&quot; his friend pointed out, laughing.<br/>
<br/>
The screen door leading to the corridor slid open and Tetsu entered <br/>
surreptitiously with the made tea. &quot;Anou, Okita-san, who were you <br/>
referring to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Toshi said, reading from an invisible scroll and <br/>
deliberately talking over Souji&#39;s head. &quot;Brats. It says, Okita Souji <br/>
and Ichimura Tetsunosuke. It also says here, insufferable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring Toshi, Souji winked at Tetsu and assured him with perfect <br/>
aplomb, &quot;It&#39;s a form of endearment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  The End  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I admit this is rather rushed too, but I tried my best given the <br/>
various constraints, so gimme some feedback, yes? That would be <br/>
wonderful and nice and beautiful. And heavenly. <br/>
<br/>
You know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Review! Grovels on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is not finished. I mean, don&#39;t you people want to know <br/>
what Tetsu saw? Snickers. You decide.</div>
