------------<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto<br/>
Kan&#39;bu Era, Year 21<br/>
The streets of Nishijin were a sea of flashing red lights. Mitsujima<br/>
Atsuo, the famous outspoken, iconoclastic writer, had finally snapped:<br/>
arming himself and his handful of students, he had broken into the<br/>
estate of a rich silk merchant, and was broadcasting a list of demands<br/>
over the city-wide intranet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Every hand held device, laptop, desktop was illuminated by the<br/>
portrait of the bare chested muscular artist with a bandanna tied<br/>
around his head. A large two story flat screen monitor outside the<br/>
Shimabara pleasure hotel drew curious crowds to the best-selling<br/>
authors. Mitsujima&#39;s still eyes gazed into the souls of his audience<br/>
as he repeated over and over again, &quot;Where is the soul of Japan? Can<br/>
we let the American States and the other nations of the world treat us<br/>
in such a way? Do not let them plunder our sacred land, do not let<br/>
them trample on our warrior&#39;s spirit! Only the brave can follow me<br/>
into the glorious red sun!&quot; Although the image of Mitsujima was<br/>
inanimate it had seemed as if molten lava was swirling in his eyes and<br/>
his usually serene voice was now thick with rage.<br/>
<br/>
The police were barely able to keep the public at bay, when an HX-12<br/>
Wasp, one of the newly developed, lithe hover-transport aircraft in<br/>
the service of the Japanese Empire, landed in the clearing mid-street,<br/>
behind the police lines. Its plain, serpentine gray fuselage bore the<br/>
five-petaled hollyhock insignia of the shogun, and on the tail boom,<br/>
where the service branch would be named, there was instead one word,<br/>
which immediately drove the crowd into a frenzy:<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
The rear ramp clattered to the pavement with a thud as the roar of the<br/>
engines died down to a whine and then a whisper. Heavily armed men in<br/>
gray Kamirion body armor rushed out, boots pounding the blackness of<br/>
the pavement. From head to toe, they were the pinnacle perfection in<br/>
urban warfare: Kawanishi AR-52 heavy assault rifles, frag and flash<br/>
grenades, and Hosoya PP52 9 millimeter pistols with AP<br/>
(armor-piercing) rounds. When twelve men had piled out of the craft,<br/>
one more followed. Unlike the rest of them, whose faces were hidden<br/>
behind visored masks, he only wore a cheek protector, one of the few<br/>
hand-me-downs still present and in use from old samurai armor. His<br/>
eyes were intense, and if one looked closely, they would be able to<br/>
see wisps of dark hair poking out from under his tightly-laced helmet.<br/>
He hefted an AR-52 with a scope the likes of which even the well-paid<br/>
and supplied Kyoto Metro Police Department had never seen before.<br/>
Wanting to seize the moment, Captain Onodera, the officer on duty,<br/>
strode over to the man.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lieutenant Colonel Hijikata Isamu?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The man turned to Onodera. His voice felt like it belonged in the<br/>
depths of some ancient shrine. It was deep and more piercing than the<br/>
highest-velocity cop-killer round.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Reporting as ordered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Onodera shivered, then attempted to regain some form of composure.<br/>
&quot;Eager to see what Aizu&#39;s finest can do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata said nothing. Raising his gloved left hand, he swept it in a<br/>
rapid, downward arc, and before Onodera had time to blink, the<br/>
thirteen men were gone.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Inside the estate, Mitsujima was already becoming more and more shrill.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where the hell is that damn Aizu Katsumori!&quot; Mitsujima referred, of<br/>
course, to Matsudaira Katsumori, the young governor of Kyoto. A<br/>
relative newcomer to the political scene, the young Lord Matsudaira<br/>
had soon reestablished order in the murder-prone and disaster-rife<br/>
Imperial District of Kyoto, and this had largely remained the case<br/>
until Mitsujima&#39;s act of insanity. At his booted feet, Kinunoya<br/>
Zen&#39;emon, the owner of the estate, cowered in terror. He had always<br/>
been a careful man, and one to avoid the tangle of politics, but this<br/>
was now his problem, in a very real and immediate sense.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If he doesn&#39;t show up IN PERSON in the next hour, you know damn well<br/>
what&#39;s going to happen, Kinunoya. And believe me...&quot; he lowered the<br/>
muzzle of his rifle against the temple of Okatsu, Kinunoya&#39;s bound and<br/>
gagged wife, &quot;It won&#39;t be pretty...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, outside, two of Mitsujima&#39;s students paced beside the<br/>
barred and barricaded gate. They were rather young and had been easily<br/>
taken in by their idealistic teacher&#39;s dreams of a grand new order led<br/>
directly by the emperor himself, but somehow they were conflicted<br/>
about their teacher&#39;s course of action. Lazily, they chatted in hushed<br/>
tones about girlfriends and literary genres, hardly noticing what was<br/>
fast approaching from behind.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata and his men had quickly scaled the estate&#39;s outer walls and<br/>
with camouflage on, were rapidly advancing through the rock garden.<br/>
Over the secure neural intranet, Hijikata gave his orders, as quickly<br/>
and quietly as though he were actually speaking.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nakano, go left and take the rear. Set up with your grenades and make<br/>
damn well sure no one gets through that exit alive, even if that<br/>
includes you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sir!&quot; On the heads-up readout generated by his ocular implants,<br/>
Hijikata could see one blue light flash and then wink out in<br/>
acknowledgement.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hirata, you take right flank and get the side entrance. When you hear<br/>
the signal, slash the throat of the bastard who&#39;s there, and from then<br/>
on do like Nakano and be ready to blow the suckers to Jodo if you have<br/>
to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sir!&quot; One more light flashed and then winked off. Ten left, Hijikata<br/>
went faster.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ioki, you&#39;re on left point; take your squad and provide overwatch at<br/>
the main building. Tatsuno, you&#39;re on point with me, we&#39;ll take out<br/>
these two chickens at the door and then head for the final push on the<br/>
house together with Ioki&#39;s squad.&quot; Ten lights flashed and then winked<br/>
out. &quot;Ready with Phase A now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata slung the rifle securely over his back, and tightened the<br/>
strap. With practiced ease, he withdrew two slim, palm-length blades<br/>
from his waist belt, which, though not connected to his camouflage,<br/>
were still a very dim gray, barely visible in the shadows of the tall<br/>
bamboo plants by the wall. He breathed in, then out. One final time,<br/>
he checked his chronometer-- 1300 hours Japan Standard time-- then the<br/>
weather. Gentle breeze, negligible speed. Still, he had to compensate.<br/>
Barely, just barely, he shifted his aim, and as one of the two fools<br/>
manning the gate bent over to tie his ill-fitting boots, Hijikata<br/>
leapt out, flicking the blades out from between his fingers; one<br/>
downward, severing the first man, the other one tearing, vertically,<br/>
between the eyes of the other man, sending him backward in a gurgling<br/>
mass of deadweight. Continuing the motion of his hand, he swept back<br/>
to the pistol on his right hip, practically ripping it out of its<br/>
holster as he moved to empty one, then two silenced shots, finishing<br/>
off the chickens at the gate once and for all.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata had no need to see his men, he could feel them, both over the<br/>
ocular implants, and also from years of experience with these raids.<br/>
Reholstering the pistol, he grabbed his rifle. It was almost time. Two<br/>
lights flashed on his heads-up display. Nakano and Hirata were ready.<br/>
<br/>
The house was spacious, but through the scope on his rifle, Hijikata<br/>
could see through it all; he could see all the dozen or so men inside<br/>
the mansion, the four or so hostages; all of it was as plain as day to<br/>
him. Much as he&#39;d want to take point himself, he had to stay outside<br/>
and do what he was equipped for: make the final call and shot.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All exits secure. Squad Zero-One, prepare for frontal assault.&quot;<br/>
*********<br/>
<br/>
Inside, Mitsujima was fast losing the last vestiges of his patience.<br/>
&quot;WHERE is Matsudaira Katsumori? What is taking him so long? Can he no<br/>
longer come out of his office at Kurotani without the help of his<br/>
concubines? Perhaps we should get a real man to run this city, not<br/>
some snot-nosed aristocratic brat! Kinunoya, it&#39;s going to be YOUR<br/>
head on a pike over your OWN door! And as long as I&#39;m at it, I might<br/>
as well make the first underlining of my point-- starting with her!&quot;<br/>
The dark muzzle of Mitsujima&#39;s rifle swept toward Okatsu.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s said that in times of immense stress, the human body and psyche<br/>
cooperate in ways that cannot be predicted, even by the newest, most<br/>
advanced biotech computers. And that&#39;s precisely what drove Kinunoya,<br/>
in utter horror, to suddenly rise to his feet. At the same instant,<br/>
the first muffled groans were heard, as Hijikata&#39;s men swept closer<br/>
and closer to that last, innermost room. And then, without even<br/>
thinking, before the rifle finished its arc, Kinunoya threw himself<br/>
onto Mitsujima, which in turn threw Hijikata&#39;s carefully calculated<br/>
surgical strike into disaster.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Back at the gate, Hijikata was still tensing at the scope of his<br/>
rifle, waiting for a clear shot to take Mitsujima down. Hijikata could<br/>
clearly make out Mitsujima&#39;s figure, distorted through the<br/>
interference of the walls, but suddenly, one of the other figures rose<br/>
up and leapt onto Mitsujima. By the look of it, it was none other than<br/>
Kinunoya, the man that Hijikata was supposed to try to save.<br/>
<br/>
Take the shot? Don&#39;t take the shot? For a split second, Hijikata&#39;s<br/>
conscience about killing an innocent man conflicted with his lifetime<br/>
drive to wipe out diseased, garbage-spouting scum like Mitsujima. But<br/>
only for a moment. Any other man would&#39;ve hesitated longer, but he was<br/>
not any other man. He was Lieutenant Colonel Hijikata Isamu, Commander<br/>
of the Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi, and if taking out one<br/>
innocent man was the price of victory, then so be it.<br/>
<br/>
With practiced ease, he primed his rifle, took one deep breath, and fired.<br/>
<br/>
*I&#39;m sorry, Kinunoya. May you live forever in Paradise*<br/>
<br/>
*Mitsujima, may you be flayed alive for ten thousand kalpa in the land<br/>
of the dead*<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Inside, Mitsujima was struggling, trying to free himself of Kinunoya&#39;s<br/>
crazed, frenzied scratching and clawing. He only felt a burning<br/>
sensation on his left temple for a moment, and then the world went<br/>
black...<br/>
<br/>
Okatsu screamed, and at that instant, the door flew off its hinges<br/>
with a crash, and ten men in dark body armor burst into the room.<br/>
&quot;Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi Squad Zero-One! Surrender or be<br/>
destroyed without mercy!&quot; Mitsujima&#39;s surviving students in the room,<br/>
still shaken from watching their master fall in a bloody heap, seemed<br/>
to slowly crumple, before retching the meager contents of their<br/>
starving bowels violently onto the tatami mats.<br/>
<br/>
Ioki directed a text transmission back to Hijikata, at the gate.<br/>
&quot;Hostages secured minus one, sir.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata received the transmission and then promptly decloaked. Even<br/>
at this price, the mission was accomplished. He returned a<br/>
transmission, this time to all units. &quot;Well done, team. Gather up the<br/>
hostages and prisoners, and rally at the front gate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Twelve lights blinked and then winked off. Mission accomplished.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Outside, Captain Onodera was still standing by the Wasp, stunned, when<br/>
the front gate of the estate opened, and out came thirteen men, three<br/>
former hostages, and five prisoners. Before he could ask any<br/>
questions, Hijikata did the talking. Handing over the former hostages<br/>
to Onodera&#39;s men, he gave a curt nod.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mitsujima&#39;s dead. Kinunoya got in the way of my shot, and while<br/>
unfortunate, his sacrifice ensured Mishima&#39;s demise. Get your men to<br/>
clean up the place, Onodera. We&#39;re taking the survivors for questioning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The twelve men herded their prisoners into the Wasp just as<br/>
efficiently as they had emerged from it. Hijikata bowed curtly once<br/>
more, and then joined them within. The dull hum of the engines soon<br/>
grew into a whine and then a roar, and Onodera had to cover his ears<br/>
as the aircraft rose straight up into the air, before zooming off<br/>
southward, no doubt toward the base at Mibu.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are we ever up shit creek now...&quot;</div>

&gt; the pavement. From head to toe, they were the pinnacle perfection in<br/>

&gt; Kinunoya, the man that Hijikata was supposed to try to save.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Take the shot? Don&#39;t take the shot? For a split second, Hijikata&#39;s<br/>
&gt; conscience about killing an innocent man conflicted with his lifetime<br/>
&gt; drive to wipe out diseased, garbage-spouting scum like Mitsujima. But<br/>
&gt; only for a moment. Any other man would&#39;ve hesitated longer, but he was<br/>
&gt; not any other man. He was Lieutenant Colonel Hijikata Isamu, Commander<br/>
&gt; of the Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi, and if taking out one<br/>
&gt; innocent man was the price of victory, then so be it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With practiced ease, he primed his rifle, took one deep breath, and<br/>
fired.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *I&#39;m sorry, Kinunoya. May you live forever in Paradise*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Mitsujima, may you be flayed alive for ten thousand kalpa in the land<br/>
&gt; of the dead*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ****<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Inside, Mitsujima was struggling, trying to free himself of Kinunoya&#39;s<br/>
&gt; crazed, frenzied scratching and clawing. He only felt a burning<br/>
&gt; sensation on his left temple for a moment, and then the world went<br/>
&gt; black...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okatsu screamed, and at that instant, the door flew off its hinges<br/>
&gt; with a crash, and ten men in dark body armor burst into the room.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Aizu Special Attack Force Shinsengumi Squad Zero-One! Surrender or be<br/>
&gt; destroyed without mercy!&quot; Mitsujima&#39;s surviving students in the room,<br/>
&gt; still shaken from watching their master fall in a bloody heap, seemed<br/>
&gt; to slowly crumple, before retching the meager contents of their<br/>
&gt; starving bowels violently onto the tatami mats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ioki directed a text transmission back to Hijikata, at the gate.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Hostages secured minus one, sir.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hijikata received the transmission and then promptly decloaked. Even<br/>
&gt; at this price, the mission was accomplished. He returned a<br/>
&gt; transmission, this time to all units. &quot;Well done, team. Gather up the<br/>
&gt; hostages and prisoners, and rally at the front gate.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Twelve lights blinked and then winked off. Mission accomplished.<br/>
&gt; *****<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Outside, Captain Onodera was still standing by the Wasp, stunned, when<br/>
&gt; the front gate of the estate opened, and out came thirteen men, three<br/>
&gt; former hostages, and five prisoners. Before he could ask any<br/>
&gt; questions, Hijikata did the talking. Handing over the former hostages<br/>
&gt; to Onodera&#39;s men, he gave a curt nod.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Mitsujima&#39;s dead. Kinunoya got in the way of my shot, and while<br/>
&gt; unfortunate, his sacrifice ensured Mishima&#39;s demise. Get your men to<br/>
&gt; clean up the place, Onodera. We&#39;re taking the survivors for<br/>
questioning.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The twelve men herded their prisoners into the Wasp just as<br/>
&gt; efficiently as they had emerged from it. Hijikata bowed curtly once<br/>
&gt; more, and then joined them within. The dull hum of the engines soon<br/>
&gt; grew into a whine and then a roar, and Onodera had to cover his ears<br/>
&gt; as the aircraft rose straight up into the air, before zooming off<br/>
&gt; southward, no doubt toward the base at Mibu.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Are we ever up shit creek now...&quot;<br/>

&gt; ------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kyoto<br/>
&gt; Kan&#39;bu Era, Year 21<br/>
&gt; The streets of Nishijin were a sea of flashing red lights. Mitsujima<br/>
&gt; Atsuo, the famous outspoken, iconoclastic writer, had finally <br/>
snapped:<br/>
&gt; arming himself and his handful of students, he had broken into the<br/>

demands<br/>

<br/>
The stress was twisting his muscles into knots. Tension gripped Okita<br/>
Soujiro&#39;s shoulders and neck. As the captain of the first unit walked<br/>
down the hallway of headquarters he nearly knocked over one of the<br/>
officers too slow to get out of his way as he walked into the gym.<br/>
Harada was kicking the boxing bag, so he went to the shooting range<br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
He took off the ear muffs to hear the shots and hoped that with each<br/>
bullet he could erase Hijikata&#39;s words from his mind.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What the fuck are you doing reading this trash?&quot; Isamu threw the<br/>
print outs in Okita&#39;s face, &quot;Where did you print them? At a café?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m studying the enemy,&quot; the younger man was emotionless as he stared<br/>
at Hijikata, &quot;and to answer your question, yes the Himeya coffee house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;ll have to be inspected tomorrow, or perhaps closed down then.<br/>
These businesses with internet access know the rules about<br/>
disseminating incorrect information under the Homeland Security Act,&quot;<br/>
Isamu folded his arms, &quot;That bastard Mitsujima is in a refrigerator at<br/>
the basement of the Kyoto security department now where he can&#39;t spout<br/>
anymore poison to confuse the people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okita collected the papers, &quot;Do you really disagree with him? Deep<br/>
down you agree and many warriors believe his words. They&#39;re coming and<br/>
we can&#39;t stop them&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Lieutenant Colonel shoved his subordinate back, &quot;Don&#39;t compare me<br/>
to that Mitsujima! I disagree with any motherfucker who thinks they<br/>
can touch Kyoto when I&#39;m _on_duty_.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&lt;i&gt;&quot;We will become impotent, obsolete Hijikata.&quot;&lt;i&gt; Okita swallowed<br/>
and looked at the floor as his mind briefly acknowledged that leader<br/>
of the Shinsengumi has not touched him for some time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;_On_duty_? Or when you are in full control of the city?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isamu&#39;s dark eyes locked onto Soujiro&#39;s as his voice became icy, &quot;We<br/>
know our place under A-han&#39;s mandate. Don&#39;t speak those words in<br/>
public Okita.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okita closed his eyes briefly if only to appreciate the delicate scent<br/>
of sandalwood which Hijikata used to perfume his clothes. For such a<br/>
fierce man, Isamu paid close attention to his appearance and was most<br/>
careful with his manners in front of representatives from A-han. Okita<br/>
was one of the few who knew what the Demon was really capable of when<br/>
at the height of his anger, but he was the only man who could satisfy<br/>
Isamu&#39;s lust as well.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is Nippon&#39;s future?&quot; Okita looked out the window at the Aizu<br/>
Phoenix Unit helicopters moving slowly over the city in the darkness<br/>
like large silent predatory birds, &quot;Mitsujima is not the only one who<br/>
will weaken our country from within. He has followers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Who will be dealt,&quot; Hijikata stood behind Soujiro, but refrained from<br/>
putting his chin on the young man&#39;s shoulder. Isamu shoved his hands<br/>
into his slacks, in a desperate attempt from running them across<br/>
Okita&#39;s tone chest and torso.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
He tried to bring his focus back to emptying the standard issue<br/>
handgun into the target. Soujiro squeezed his eyes shut and heard the<br/>
whish of a new sheet being replaced over the target and pulled the<br/>
trigger. He ground his teeth, &quot;We don&#39;t have a response to the<br/>
American States. We can&#39;t do anything&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another hand pushed down the gun. Okita opened his eyes, &quot;Saitou?&quot;<br/>
The captain of the third unit was unshaven and tired from spending the<br/>
entire night interviewing the witnesses and survivors of the incident.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Soujiro, if you want to kill a member of the Shinsengumi, always aim<br/>
for the head. The body armor developed for us by the Temple of Light,<br/>
Hoko-in, would protect our vital organs.&quot; Saitou cocked his head at<br/>
the target.<br/>
<br/>
Okita put down his weapon and looked up, &quot;That son of a bitch Harada<br/>
must have replaced some of the targets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Both captains stared at the life size, color image of their leader,<br/>
dressed in traditional attire peppered with bullet holes. In a way,<br/>
the paper representation was a shadow of the humble man a few of them<br/>
knew back at the Tama Regional Martial Arts Training Center.<br/>
<br/>
The security camera recorded the image of one tall tan skinned man<br/>
with long hair held back in a pony tail and a slightly shorter man who<br/>
could pass as one of the fashion models plastered on billboards around<br/>
the city, if only he smiled more. The small device was a state of the<br/>
art closed circuit recorder which stored images and sound in the<br/>
miburo&#39;s headquarters.<br/>
<br/>
Unbeknownst to the wolves these cameras also relayed valuable insight<br/>
to the offices of A-han.<br/>
<br/>
The Shinsengumi, who made it their duty to watch over the city were<br/>
themselves being watched very closely.</div>

Dear Wanda,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement! (^_^)<br/>
Part 3 is being polished right now.  Kyoto-Twilight (K-light) will really be <br/>
some major themes of Japanese history placed in a blender and <br/>
electrified---so it goes a bit beyond the Bakumatsu.  Many charas may <br/>
have to be combined.  For example, Hijikata and Kondou obviously have <br/>
been made into one person and he has a bit of a Serizawa streak too.  <br/>
Because we want to share the story with the list the yaoi scenes can&#39;t be <br/>
any more than innuendo.  The other creator may add touches of yuri in <br/>
his chapters too without anything graphic (^_^) .<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago I designed a template for Kyoto Twilight and once we <br/>
write up some more chapters we&#39;ll archive it all at a site and place a link <br/>
over at www.shinsengumihq.com<br/>
<br/>
Currently, SHQ has a link to a yaoi site featuring Saitou and other <br/>
Shinsengumi  for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kikue-mugen.com/">http://kikue-mugen.com/</a>  (age verification necessary)<br/>
the site has archived a very very long fanfic called Gojou and an original <br/>
novel Gojou Hajime will be released later.</div>

&quot;There are many terms for it in different religions and histories.  Simply, <br/>
it is a time great shifts and destruction.  For instance, at the end of <br/>
China&#39;s Han dynasty, the country experienced an upheaval and three <br/>
men swore an oath of loyalty to one another amongst peach blossoms <br/>
scattering in the wind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The captain turned away and mumbled, &quot;What happened to those <br/>
warrior brothers Hijikata?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata flipped open a lighter and watched the still flame.  He wondered <br/>
if there is truth to the statement that the center of the fire is actually <br/>
cool...and peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is any of this necessary?&quot;  Matsudaira Katsumori pushed his slightly <br/>
tinted glasses up his nose as his assistants hovered near him carrying <br/>
his briefcase and even his tested meals.  He has never traveled as a <br/>
commoner in a city he has sworn to protect.  The daimyo of A-han <br/>
looked at the unmarked vehicle with disdain and he could sense that his <br/>
own security would be insulted by the innovation of having  Shinsengumi <br/>
provide additional protection.<br/>
<br/>
Saitou bowed and placed his hand on the luxury vehicle caressing the <br/>
black hide, &quot;under the outer body are additional layers of armor which <br/>
can withstand even explosives,&quot;  he walked alongside the car he plans to <br/>
chauffeur, &quot;resilient bullet proof glass, run-flat tires...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let me guess the rocket launcher emerges from the sun-roof?&quot;  <br/>
Yamagawa, one of Matsudaira&#39;s aides coughed.  &quot;Will there be room for <br/>
any of us?  Where are our vehicles?&quot;  Yamagawa pointed to himself and <br/>
his fellow guards.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My goal is to escort Matsudaira-sama undetected.  An entourage would <br/>
only blow our cover.&quot;  The Shinsengumi captain smiled, &quot;As for the <br/>
rocket launcer,&quot; he opened the back door for the daimyo, &quot;We can <br/>
always put in a special request at the Temple of Light Hoko-in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I will not use a vehicle made by foreigners.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Saitou nearly prostrated himself, &quot;Your eyes cannot be deceived.  Hoko-<br/>
in engineers have atleast altered the exterior to look like a Japanese car <br/>
and added more security improvements.  The vehicle was smuggled into <br/>
our country piece by piece at the insistence of the government after the <br/>
unfortunate....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Matsudaira held up his hand, &quot;Yes I recall the assassination of the <br/>
official.  His entourage should not have stopped.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We will keep moving regardless of the circumstances my lord,&quot;  Saitou <br/>
humbly replied.<br/>
<br/>
Katsumori stretched his legs in the roomy interior, &quot;I have business with <br/>
the Imperial Officials.  There is no time to waste,&quot; he looked back at his <br/>
worried A-han  attendants as the vehicle left the garage.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata did not notice that Okita had fallen into a deep sleep, but he <br/>
continued the story.  &quot;One by one the brothers of the Peach Garden Pact <br/>
died pathetically until finally their ideals became a memory as the era <br/>
continued on without them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He reached over and picked up his PDA to monitor Saitou and <br/>
Matsudaira&#39;s whereabouts.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;My favorite warrior brother was Guan Yu, but he was the first to die.&quot;  <br/>
He glanced at Okita&#39;s back and grinned.<br/>
<br/>
The Lieutenant knew that Shinsengumi headquarters was full of devices <br/>
recording his every move, every word to ensure his loyalty.  What&#39;s to <br/>
say Hijikata did not have someone watching A-han?<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
An elderly cafe owner opened the cash register and shook before the <br/>
men sporting light jackets with  infamous Shinsengumi badges, &quot;Sirs, I <br/>
don&#39;t have cash, my wife must&#39;ve taken it all the bank already.&quot;  He tried <br/>
to back away but strong hands held his collar.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your cafe has been identified as a business which disseminates anti-<br/>
government propaganda via the internet,&quot;  Niimi Nishiki swiped a laptop <br/>
from a small round table sending it crashing to the floor.  He told his <br/>
minion to release the old man and he stepped in closer and brushed <br/>
aside his jacket to display his gun, &quot;Even if your woman has taken the <br/>
money perhaps you have something else to offer us?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Niimi turned to a young waitress who ran into the store from the <br/>
supplies room.  She screamed as a Shinsengumi grabbed her wrist and <br/>
twisted her arm after she activated a silent alarm under the counter.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hm?&quot;  Saitou knew the protocol for answering messages on the radio <br/>
but whoever called him should know he had an assignment tonight.  He <br/>
glanced in the rear view mirror.  Matsudaira was obsessively reviewing <br/>
his schedule on his laptop.  No wonder few people placed faith in <br/>
Katsumori&#39;s leadership skills.  The daimyo looked more like a CEO of a <br/>
major dot com corporation than a warrior.<br/>
<br/>
The captain adjusted the hands free device as he maneuvered the car <br/>
through the Kyoto evening traffic, &quot;Busy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The dispatcher went silent and Hijikata&#39;s voice grabbed Saitou&#39;s <br/>
attention, &quot;Just drive past the Himeya and see what&#39;s going on.  I sent <br/>
Niimi to investigate but the owner must have set off the alarm alerting <br/>
the Kyoto Metropolitan Police.  I don&#39;t want them to arrest one of our <br/>
men. I sent back up but you are closest right now.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Saitou pushed the 517 hp biturbo V12 engine and weaved out of the <br/>
lane which had become a parking lot by driving on the opposite side of <br/>
the road.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shortcut?&quot;  Katsumori closed the computer and looked out at the blurry <br/>
cityscape.<br/>
<br/>
Saitou put both hands on the steering wheel, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata closed his eyes.  Niimi was a mistake.  The fucker must be <br/>
taking advantage of his authority and in the process ruining the <br/>
Shinsengumi&#39;s reputation.  He needed to be dealt with and hopefully <br/>
Saitou would not have to take any action and leave Katsumori <br/>
unguarded.  Harada had better get there before the KMPD which would <br/>
be more than happy to have reason to fight a Shinsengumi.  He opened <br/>
one eye when he felt a cold hand on his shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hijikata, I won&#39;t forgive you if something happens to anyone at the <br/>
Himeya.  You&#39;ve become truly heartless to harass honest hardworking <br/>
people in this city.&quot;  Okita had that look in his eyes.  Few people have <br/>
seen the usually serene eyes full of fire outside the dojo or off the field.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My heart beats for this city.  If a few must suffer or die to save the <br/>
many then so be it.  This is not a war fought with weapons, but with <br/>
ideas Okita.  If businesses are unwittingly aiding and abetting the enemy <br/>
they will be shut down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okita turned away and began to dress.  He picked up his weapon slowly <br/>
from the nightstand and left the Lieutenant&#39;s quarters.</div>

New chapters such as &quot;Tables Turned&quot; has sub-headings.  Simply click on <br/>
Chapter 4 and you&#39;ll see the smaller segments.<br/>
<br/>
So far the chapters, with the exception of Chapter 1 by Nezu Ichiro, have <br/>
been short and not very detailed.  Right now we are just laying the <br/>
groundwork and maybe in the future it can be a novel or novella of some <br/>
sort with tons of details etc.  Right now we are working on the bare story <br/>
(skeleton).<br/>
