<h3>PeaceMaker!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482742147">Yes! I got the NewType magazine, and this is what it says...<br/>
<br/>
PeaceMaker Vol. 1 DVD coming out on Oct. 12, $29.98<br/>
And special collector&#39;s edition for $39.98 that comes with Vol. 1 of <br/>
the manga (PMK, mind you, not SIPM)<br/>
<br/>
Also, ADV has a trailer on the site! &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.advfilms.com">http://www.advfilms.com</a>&gt;.  No <br/>
voices though.  I think I heard tetsu once in the trailer, but it <br/>
sounded like his JPN voice T_T.<br/>
<br/>
Woo-hoo! Finally, a shinsengumi anime in english! other than <br/>
Kenshin, but that&#39;s not really shinsengumi-centric...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491809064">I picked up Vol 1 of the manga today and it picks up pretty much where <br/>
the anime left off and  I&#39;m guessing (SIPM) did<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335492019">I like the idea of the manga accompanying the anime dvd, but I think <br/>
ADV is being pretty stupid.  If someone who&#39;s never seen PMK before <br/>
picks this up, doesn&#39;t matter whether they watch the anime or read <br/>
the manga first, they&#39;ll still be pretty confused. I know I was <br/>
o.O;; but I had already seen the anime.<br/>
<br/>
Still, woo-hoo! I think I&#39;ll have enough by the time it comes out, <br/>
and my Shinsengumi fangirl friends and I can watch it on halloween.  <br/>
(And we&#39;re going as miburo this year...too bad it&#39;s on a sunday, and <br/>
thank goodness haori are warm, considering how friggin&#39; COLD October <br/>
31st gets in Nebraska...)</div>
