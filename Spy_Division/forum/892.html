<h3>[Yaoi] Short fic needs Beta reader</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121857647">Dear friends,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone here would like to beta read a 3,600 word fic <br/>
which features Serizawa, Saitou and Yamazaki Susumu (cameo with <br/>
Niimi and Aioi---later known as Aioi Tayuu).<br/>
<br/>
Just to reassure people who may be afraid of yaoi--this story does not <br/>
have graphic sex.  I think this story is at best PG-13.  <br/>
<br/>
So I was really a good girl (*^_^*).<br/>
<br/>
Please email me at secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com with "[Yaoi] Short <br/>
fic needs Beta reader" in the subject line and I'll send you the story as <br/>
an attached file tomorrow morning (I can't be online tonight).<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate any help I can get!  I really need grammar hounds to read <br/>
this work too.  The story will be featured at http://www.samurai-on-<br/>
samurai.com which is {only} for readers above the age 18.<br/>
