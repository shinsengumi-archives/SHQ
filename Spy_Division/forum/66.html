<h3>For the PMK yaoi fans among us</h3>

          In the turbulent final years of the Tokugawa Shongunate,<br/>
          Shieikan Dojo was the birthplace of one of Japan&#39;s most famous<br/>
          militias: the Shinsengumi. Many of the members have acheived<br/>
          legendary status for their skill, honor and devotion. Under<br/>
          the banner of &quot;loyalty&quot;, they would sacrifice their lives for<br/>
          their ideals...<br/>
<br/>
          &quot;Soshite Haru no Tsuki&quot; is a series by Miya Ikushima,<br/>
          currently spanning 5 books that give a decidedly yaoi-friendly<br/>
          interpretation of the Shinsengumi. The main pairing is between<br/>
          the young first captain, Okita Souji, and his vice-commander,<br/>
          Hijikata Toshi, but practically all of the well-known members<br/>
          have their own stories... and plenty of steamy love scenes<br/>
          interspersed with the fighting and intrigue the Shinsengumi<br/>
          were known for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you already telling people about that disturbing site?! Some of you may be asking what is so disturbing about it. Well, it&#39;s not the yaoi! It&#39;s Hijikata and Toudou! Hijikata looks NOTHING like himself. He has weird brown hair. (Think Saito&#39;s aku-detecting hair.) And Toudou likes like an evil Keebler&#39;s elf in that one pic of him in the &quot;characters&quot; section! Tell me that&#39;s not disturbing. The only saving grace is that Kondou actually looks pretty good for once...<br/>
