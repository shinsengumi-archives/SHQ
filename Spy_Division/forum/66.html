          In the turbulent final years of the Tokugawa Shongunate,<br/>
          Shieikan Dojo was the birthplace of one of Japan's most famous<br/>
          militias: the Shinsengumi. Many of the members have acheived<br/>
          legendary status for their skill, honor and devotion. Under<br/>
          the banner of "loyalty", they would sacrifice their lives for<br/>
          their ideals...<br/>
<br/>
          "Soshite Haru no Tsuki" is a series by Miya Ikushima,<br/>
          currently spanning 5 books that give a decidedly yaoi-friendly<br/>
          interpretation of the Shinsengumi. The main pairing is between<br/>
          the young first captain, Okita Souji, and his vice-commander,<br/>
          Hijikata Toshi, but practically all of the well-known members<br/>
          have their own stories... and plenty of steamy love scenes<br/>
          interspersed with the fighting and intrigue the Shinsengumi<br/>
          were known for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you already telling people about that disturbing site?! Some of you may be asking what is so disturbing about it. Well, it's not the yaoi! It's Hijikata and Toudou! Hijikata looks NOTHING like himself. He has weird brown hair. (Think Saito's aku-detecting hair.) And Toudou likes like an evil Keebler's elf in that one pic of him in the "characters" section! Tell me that's not disturbing. The only saving grace is that Kondou actually looks pretty good for once...<br/>
