I&#39;m trying to improve the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/links.htm</a><br/>
and I really need your help:<br/>
<br/>
I have alot of links to dev-art accounts and fanfic writers who work <br/>
with the Shinsengumi however, in the past I&#39;ve emailed them but no <br/>
one responds.<br/>
<br/>
So I ask members here that if they have deviantart accounts with <br/>
Shinsengumi fanart please just let us know if they want us to link <br/>
to their page.<br/>
<br/>
Also if anyone here blogs about Shinsengumi pop-culture or fanfic <br/>
please also notify shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com and your link will be <br/>
added promptly<br/>
<br/>
We do try to keep up with pop-culture however...that requires some <br/>
money which many of us do not have so we rely completely on <br/>
contributions. Purchasing manga/doujinshi and even scanning and <br/>
hosting material will raise the costs of our site.  Therefore it is <br/>
a matter of lack of resources and time---*not interest.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, Hirotada Tokugawa contributed scans<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/getsumeiseiki.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/getsumeiseiki.htm</a><br/>
we posted them right away to this section<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/pop.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
there are hundreds of Shinsengumi manga/doujinshi and as much as <br/>
we&#39;d like to we don&#39;t have the resources to highlight them all---so <br/>
we need your help to keep us informed<br/>
<br/>
anyone who wants to be a volunteer Shinsengumi pop-culture <br/>
correspondence raise your hand!!!!  (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
we are just a crossroad for many Shinsengumi fields whether it be <br/>
history, fanart, fanfic or movies<br/>
we are 100% driven by volunteers</div>
