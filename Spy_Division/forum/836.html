<br/>
If you would like a detailed plot bunny for a story just download <br/>
this word document<br/>

<br/>
Keep in mind that Saitou in this story is original and not based on <br/>
RK, PMK, NHK or Mibugishiden. <br/>
<br/>
In fact I made the story &quot;inspired by&quot; the Shinsengumi so the name <br/>
Shinsengumi was changed to Ookami Gumi and Aizu-han is Ise-han <br/>
because ofcourse this is a work of fiction and many situations were <br/>
completely created.<br/>
<br/>
If you really this plot bunny and will write it as original fic post <br/>
to this mailing list so people know that you will officially adopt <br/>
the plot bunny--and *ofcourse* just adapt, delete it anyway your <br/>
heart desires.  I marked certain parts as {climactic scene #1} or <br/>
{sensual} etc because in doing so I am able to see the flow of the <br/>
story and see if it has something going on for the reader...that&#39;s <br/>
how I plan things.  Many script writers also do this as a way of <br/>
insuring that their work has something movie makers can work with.  <br/>
<br/>
However people who are just curious are more than welcome to skim the <br/>
plot.  I have a new story for every moment of the day involving <br/>
Saitou---however most are comedies set when he is older (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
I have alot of ideas, but no time, or I don&#39;t want to waste time <br/>
writing like...a really really long story no one will read.  My prose <br/>
is really for non-fiction.  To have someone write non-fiction write <br/>
fiction is like having a swimmer who swims laps in a pool do <br/>
underwater ballet.  It&#39;s similar but not the same (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
I know there are alot of talented authors and artists here who can <br/>
write great stories for fanfiction.net and get alot of reviews.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have nothing better to do over the summer give it a shot!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still giving away my novel for free here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://silapajarun.1happyturtle.com/">http://silapajarun.1happyturtle.com/</a><br/>
just contact the email on the site if you want it<br/>
so far I got 2 one sentence reviews<br/>
and three other people have asked to download the file, but I dunno <br/>
if I&#39;ll ever hear from them again (LOL!)</div>
