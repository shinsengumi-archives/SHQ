<h3>Art and greetings ^^</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-247126605">Hi-hi!<br/>
I'm new here, but I've loved the Shinsengumi (and anything <br/>
related...ANYthing) for quite a while now.<br/>
Glad to have found others who think the same! <br/>
I hope we'll all have a good time here.<br/>
<br/>
I don't write, and I barely consider my writing of enough level <br/>
to 'pass' at Uni (plus, English isn't my first language), so I've no <br/>
fics to share (I do enjoy reading them, of course ^^), but in my <br/>
spare time, I do illustrations. Granted, I'm no pro either, but I try <br/>
my best. So all I can share is some art, I hope that's OK.<br/>
I just uploaded an Okita painting I finished yesterday, but I dunno <br/>
if I put it under the right folder (it's in Single Originals, I <br/>
think; if it needs to be moved, I hope I didn't cause too much <br/>
trouble ^^;)<br/>
<br/>
I also added a recent piece of RK fanart. Granted, it's not <br/>
shinsengumi, but it does include Saito (my fave character from that <br/>
series, yeah); I added it cos I'm pretty proud of the piece, and I <br/>
won't be producing any more related art, as I will now start a Harry <br/>
Potter piece, which will probably take as long as this one took <br/>
(couple of weeks, I guess?), and only one art contributed felt too <br/>
little. Let's pad out all albums, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, sorry for the long intro.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I'm new here.<br/>
Hello!<br/>
<br/>

PS: and yes, though I'm not a writer, I do like feedback, too, if you <br/>
care to leave some. Critiques very welcome, as long as they're not <br/>
flames, but I don't expect such a nice group to be the flamer type <br/>
(I'm scared to death of flamers!)</div>

(scroll down and hit -next- to see this new addition at the end)<br/>
<br/>
both are magnificent<br/>
<br/>
Okita at sundown is one of the most deepest portrayals of this <br/>
captain ever---you thought alot about him!  When I saw it I felt the <br/>
warmth of the sun.<br/>
<br/>
Kenshingumi is in a very unique style and the characters are still <br/>
recognizable and look like REAL people too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893501373">Ah, I thank you deeply! <br/>
I really wasn't sure about posting them here,since they seemed if not <br/>
unrelated, then maybe a bit 'weird'.<br/>
But now I'm happy.<br/>
And yes, I have thought about Okita a lot, and recently came upon <br/>
good information (provided by some of you guys on the web, heh) that <br/>
helped me understand him better (only in terms of the art itself, I <br/>
didn't draw him that many times before I hit this version, i think I <br/>
sketched different versions,and then settled for the one I used here, <br/>
because I wanted to try that neat shadow effect)<br/>
<br/>
As for the other one, I spent about 60 hours working on it, and <br/>
injured my shoulder in the process (<-- baka), but at least I managed <br/>
to sell it and made some money for my upcoming trip.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but look at me, I'm talking too much again. I must learn to <br/>
explain myself in fewer words, that I must ^^<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for looking!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS: I will email the site as you suggested. It's been years since any <br/>
of my stuff has been posted to a site that wans't my own gallery, so <br/>
it's always exciting ^^</div>
