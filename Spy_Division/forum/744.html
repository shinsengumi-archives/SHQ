<div id="ygrps-yiv-247126605">Hi-hi!<br/>
I&#39;m new here, but I&#39;ve loved the Shinsengumi (and anything <br/>
related...ANYthing) for quite a while now.<br/>
Glad to have found others who think the same! <br/>
I hope we&#39;ll all have a good time here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t write, and I barely consider my writing of enough level <br/>
to &#39;pass&#39; at Uni (plus, English isn&#39;t my first language), so I&#39;ve no <br/>
fics to share (I do enjoy reading them, of course ^^), but in my <br/>
spare time, I do illustrations. Granted, I&#39;m no pro either, but I try <br/>
my best. So all I can share is some art, I hope that&#39;s OK.<br/>
I just uploaded an Okita painting I finished yesterday, but I dunno <br/>
if I put it under the right folder (it&#39;s in Single Originals, I <br/>
think; if it needs to be moved, I hope I didn&#39;t cause too much <br/>
trouble ^^;)<br/>
<br/>
I also added a recent piece of RK fanart. Granted, it&#39;s not <br/>
shinsengumi, but it does include Saito (my fave character from that <br/>
series, yeah); I added it cos I&#39;m pretty proud of the piece, and I <br/>
won&#39;t be producing any more related art, as I will now start a Harry <br/>
Potter piece, which will probably take as long as this one took <br/>
(couple of weeks, I guess?), and only one art contributed felt too <br/>
little. Let&#39;s pad out all albums, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, sorry for the long intro.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I&#39;m new here.<br/>
Hello!<br/>

PS: and yes, though I&#39;m not a writer, I do like feedback, too, if you <br/>
care to leave some. Critiques very welcome, as long as they&#39;re not <br/>
flames, but I don&#39;t expect such a nice group to be the flamer type <br/>
(I&#39;m scared to death of flamers!)</div>

PHOTOS &gt;&gt; FOLDER = Single Originals <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kenshingumi&quot;<br/>
PHOTOS &gt;&gt; FOLDER = Illustrations <br/>
(scroll down and hit -next- to see this new addition at the end)<br/>
<br/>
both are magnificent<br/>
<br/>
Okita at sundown is one of the most deepest portrayals of this <br/>
captain ever---you thought alot about him!  When I saw it I felt the <br/>
warmth of the sun.<br/>
<br/>
Kenshingumi is in a very unique style and the characters are still <br/>
recognizable and look like REAL people too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893501373">Ah, I thank you deeply! <br/>
I really wasn&#39;t sure about posting them here,since they seemed if not <br/>
unrelated, then maybe a bit &#39;weird&#39;.<br/>
But now I&#39;m happy.<br/>
And yes, I have thought about Okita a lot, and recently came upon <br/>
good information (provided by some of you guys on the web, heh) that <br/>
helped me understand him better (only in terms of the art itself, I <br/>
didn&#39;t draw him that many times before I hit this version, i think I <br/>
sketched different versions,and then settled for the one I used here, <br/>
because I wanted to try that neat shadow effect)<br/>
<br/>
As for the other one, I spent about 60 hours working on it, and <br/>
injured my shoulder in the process (&lt;-- baka), but at least I managed <br/>
to sell it and made some money for my upcoming trip.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but look at me, I&#39;m talking too much again. I must learn to <br/>
explain myself in fewer words, that I must ^^<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for looking!<br/>

PS: I will email the site as you suggested. It&#39;s been years since any <br/>
of my stuff has been posted to a site that wans&#39;t my own gallery, so <br/>
it&#39;s always exciting ^^</div>
