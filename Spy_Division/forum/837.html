<h3>Products the Shinsengumi would use....</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-467501976">The following are some products Hirotada Tokugawa and I figure would<br/>
have existed during the Bakumatsu if they had the means to mass<br/>
produce stuff the way we do today:<br/>
<br/>
[old entry already featured at SHQ.com] Red Miburo Energy drink<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/fanartRedMiburo.jpg">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/images/fanartRedMiburo.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
But once you are full of masculine energy very likely you'll need this<br/>
product which was part of the safe sex campaign in Kyoto<br/>
(warning this is PG-13, not work safe :P)<br/>

The "Men who protect the city use protection!" slogan was invented by<br/>
the ladies in the red-light district who were concerned that unless<br/>
the miburo behaved more responsibly, there will be a whole new litter<br/>
of baby wolves by next spring...<br/>
<br/>
The Shinsengumi Headquarters ofcourse has a soda vending machine<br/>
stocked full of this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t270/secretarytocapt3/MTBANDAIDEW.jpg">http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t270/secretarytocapt3/MTBANDAIDEW.jpg</a><br/>
Mt Bandai is also called Aizu Bandai, and as Aizu-han is the patron<br/>
domain of the Shinsengumi it would make sense that this is the only<br/>
soda they would drink. (actually THE ONLY SODA THEY ARE ALLOWED TO<br/>
CONSUME).<br/>
<br/>
Hirotada Tokugawa noted that Aizu also had a monopoly on ginseng so<br/>
this would be the new Mt. Bandai Dew with a bit of the zazzy root.<br/>
<br/>
Very likely the Shinsengumi would shun the competing the "Choshu 7-Up"<br/>
 drink (Choshu 7 being a popular term labelling heroes of that domain)<br/>
or the heavily artificially colored "Satsuma Sunkist" pop.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be beaten, Satsuma forces wished to cater to its own homesick<br/>
samurai in Kyoto and opened up a chain fast food store symbolized by a<br/>
GOLDEN "S" and gaudy red and yellow color scheme.  Satsuma samurai are<br/>
also pejoratively called "potato" samurai and no surprise they fry<br/>
them up and serve them with a bit of salt:<br/>

<br/>
They don't believe in "super-sizing" portions, rather they call it<br/>
"Saigo-sizing" meals.  WHich means the portions are SO HUGE they can<br/>
even satisfy the apetite of big guys like Saigo Takamori<br/>
(fictionalized into a heroic figure shown in THE LAST SAMURAI).<br/>
<br/>
For general snacking Shinsengumi reach for Jozai-han rabbit/bunny<br/>
jerky. Do to a past product recall, the domain now guarantees that all<br/>
their goods contain NO BUNNY FUR. <br/>

[notes on Jozai Han by Hirotada Tokugawa]<br/>
The ancestors of Hayashi Tadataka, daimyo of the Jozai domain, hunted<br/>
for rabbits as a new year's dish for Nitta Yoshisada, the ancestor of<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu. Soon after, the Hayashi family began serving a son of<br/>
the Nitta who was the founder of the family which became the Tokugawa.<br/>
<br/>
From then on, the head of the Hayashi family would present preserved<br/>
rabbit meat to the head of the Matsudaira (later known as Tokugawa)<br/>
family on new year's day, and in return, the head of the Hayashi<br/>
family had the right to receive his new year's sake cup before any<br/>
other retainer of the Matsudaira/Tokugawa clan. <br/>
<br/>
Because of this, the Hayashi family's "triple-tomoe" crest<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kanjistyle.com/gif/JFC003.gif)">http://www.kanjistyle.com/gif/JFC003.gif)</a> had the kanji for "one" or<br/>
"first" beneath it-- which created what was later known as the "Jozai<br/>
tomoe," after the Hayashi family's fief<br/>

<br/>
I'm sure Aizu and Shinsengumi officials examined Choshu and Satsuma<br/>
soda pop politics carefully and noted the blatant partnership and<br/>
declaration of "100% Imperial".<br/>
<br/>
Choshu 7 may have no food coloring and fewer calories but it hides<br/>
more political intrigue than one can even fathom... (ominous music)...<br/>
<br/>
to counter against the heavily sugared drink insurgency Shinsengumi<br/>
were sent to confiscate Satsuma and Choshu sodas and set an example by<br/>
dropping a mentos in all cans of soda to dispose of these rebellious<br/>
products.<br/>
<br/>
To see the results of disposing soda by using mentos please search<br/>
youtube with keywords "mentos soda"</div>
