<h3>I-ke-DIE-ya (student film) and Shinsen-Easter Eggs</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571581245">So I&#39;m a day late...but that&#39;s because I waited until the egg dye kits<br/>
were on sale<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
These Shinsen-Easter Eggs are actually actors in a student film called<br/>
<br/>
I-KE-DIE-YA<br/>
<br/>
which is not yet complete because I&#39;m still constructing the set (my<br/>
refrigerator)...as you can tell it is a low budget venture and the<br/>
other actors are marshmellow peeps (which seem to be the favorite<br/>
subject for many short films).<br/>
<br/>
Wait?  Where&#39;s Okita?  Oh don&#39;t worry he&#39;ll be in the film too.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
Before projects which take up to 3 days to complete I do various<br/>
brainstorm collages in video/audio format.  For I-KE-DIE-YA I did the<br/>
same thing <br/>
<br/>
[warning! 17.6 mb of audio with no script]<br/>

<br/>
The film makers are students at the Aizu hangakko (domain school)<br/>
Nisshinkan (they are all 10 years old in 1864 so the movie will<br/>
reflect their inexperience in movie making)...they have big plans for<br/>
the movie and are planning a DVD release already---however they are<br/>
being monitored by Aizu&#39;s warrior women the Joushitai<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/WB.htm)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/WB.htm)</a>. <br/>
<br/>
They make various obscure references to stuff which will be cut out in<br/>
the final version (just don&#39;t worry if it is all confusing).  So all<br/>
of a sudden if someone talks about *Teruhime*--then it is because they<br/>
are her otaku.  <br/>
<br/>
The discussion descended into a fanboy chatter fest which seems to<br/>
parody every single fan discussion of multiple Shinsengumi universes<br/>
including (RK and PMK). Like many &quot;serious&quot; fan discussions---it gets<br/>
heated and nasty LOL!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
*Incidentally, Teruhime (Matsudaira Teruko) is -not- Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori&#39;s wife---she was his adoptive (older) sister. In the world of<br/>
fiction it is fun to have Katamori have a crush on her (after all they<br/>
aren&#39;t related by blood and she was beautiful).  Please direct<br/>
questions on Teruhime to Hirotada Tokugawa.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
I keep trying various methods to create a serious Shinsengumi film and<br/>
I tried to &quot;warm up&quot; by making a short Byakkotai vid (made with<br/>
Windows Movie Maker--nothing fancy)<br/>
<br/>

Hirotada Tokugawa and I did some brainstorming some time ago and <br/>
this clip was part of a longer narrative involving Matsudaira <br/>
Katamori&#39;s brother Sadaaki, who was the Kyoto Shoshidai. However, we <br/>
didn&#39;t finish enough of the story to make a new installment of the <br/>
Shinsengumi radio talk show.<br/>
<br/>
So pretend that this is a message on the Shinsengumi answering <br/>
machine...<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/takedawhining.mp3">http://www.streamload.com/secretarytocapt3/takedawhining.mp3</a><br/>
<br/>
now Takeda turned to speak to a &quot;sensei&quot; who may be...Itou<br/>
***films such as Gohatto and the story which inspired it are all <br/>
based on rumors that Takeda was a homosexual however, we honestly do <br/>
not know if that was the case. Furthermore, we do know that Kondou <br/>
Isami did mention homosexual activity within the Shinsengumi in a <br/>
letter to his friends...so who knows ::hehehehehe:::<br/>
<br/>
Screencaps of IkeDIEya may be downloaded here<br/>

<br/>
***Bunny <br/>
&quot;Why does Pachi-kun have a band-aid all over his face? And he also <br/>
took the lead!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the two kids who made the film are huge fans of all <br/>
Shinsengumi universes. Their design for Nagakura was probably <br/>
inspired by Peacemaker Kurogane&#39;s Nagakura who has a band-aid on his <br/>
nose.<br/>
<br/>
The creators of the movie really admire Nagakura who took their call <br/>
on the Shinsengumi radio show &quot;Kyokuchou Hour&quot; (episodes can be <br/>
found here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm)">http://www.shinsengumihq.com/MFD.htm)</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Also information we have on Ikedaya is based on Nagakura&#39;s account <br/>
so it is funny to have an &quot;exaggerated&quot; account by the captain of <br/>
the second squad.<br/>
<br/>
***Kikue Mugen<br/>
&quot;You know, I&#39;m motivated now to create something<br/>
like that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you do! I think we need to see more fanwork. Also people can <br/>
try to incorporate the Shinsengumi into school assignments as well <br/>
so they can kill two birds with one stonehave FUN [and] get a grade <br/>
(^_^).<br/>
<br/>
***Divertimento (Ellene)<br/>
&quot;if you have the soft copy of the script (written out) could<br/>
you please send me a copy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry (T_T) but I didn&#39;t write out a script or anything. <br/>
Were you unable to download the file because of streamload? Or is <br/>
your computer giving you problems?<br/>
<br/>
The files are mirrored here as well if streamload is not allowing <br/>
downloads for some reason...<br/>

(For people who have seen the movie)<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
2 scenes which could not be made due to time constraints<br/>
<br/>
1)montage of dead bodies of the Choshu warriors (partially emptied <br/>
jelly candy)injured Shinsengumi (blue marshmallow peeps) with their <br/>
candy limbs torn away and covered in blood (red tempura paint)...I <br/>
was afraid my refrigerator (the set) would get too messed up <br/>
but...well Barb provided a solution after the film was <br/>
completed...saran wrap to catch all the paint/blood<br/>
<br/>
2)the &quot;Matrix&quot; effect. Many of us have seen the Matrix flying kick <br/>
parodied over and over again...it is very easy to replicate...in <br/>
fact one of the jellies (Choshu baddie) is supposed to be suspended <br/>
in mid-air while trying to attack Kondou. The digital camera would <br/>
then rotate around the suspended jelly (and thread airbrushed out <br/>
later)...however the tripod for my camera was not stable (kept <br/>
sagging) and the images came out all a bit crooked so I tossed those <br/>
files. I had planned to have Kondou jump up and slice his attacker <br/>
and do a slow motion of the jelly sliding out of its container (as a <br/>
stand in for blood and guts)...I still wish I could do this scene <br/>
however, Kondou is now part of my tuna salad (he is just a boiled <br/>
egg you know).</div>
