NHK Saitou...he&#39;s awesome!  Nagakura is pretty cool too and Inoue<br/>
Genzaburo ~ don&#39;t you wish you had that kind of &quot;help&quot; at your house<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681188937">Hi<br/>
Mary Ann is in the process of moving, so it might take time for her to answer. She presently unplugged from internet and will be without  stable connection at least until mid-July. Yet, she might find the chance to get a computer and answer to you later.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, these are my favorite guys in the NHK drama, though I have been told that Hijikata gets better and better since they arrive to Kyoto. I&#39;ve watched only until episode 11, but I&#39;m anxiously waiting for the last ones that have been aired in Japan.<br/>
 <br/>
take care<br/>
