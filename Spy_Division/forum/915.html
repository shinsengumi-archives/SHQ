review for a yaoi novel.  The post does not <br/>

<br/>
Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I've read the early drafts of GOJOU HAJIME, a <br/>
work of yaoi so here is my review of the work...<br/>
<br/>
Whereas well known films like TABOO/GOHATTO move<br/>
at a meditative pace and leaves key narrative themes<br/>
up to viewer interpretation GOJOU HAJIME is the exact <br/>
opposite.  The novel's pace is very even and balances out<br/>
the chapters by switching between the various pairings and<br/>
leaves *nothing* to the imagination.<br/>
<br/>
What struck me the most about GH is the tone or voice of the<br/>
writing is very youthful and matches the age range of the <br/>
main characters.  One will notice how effective this "voice" is<br/>
in regards to the Hajime and Okita pairing.  The humorous interaction<br/>
between the more mature pairing, Hijikata and Kondou is absolutely<br/>
exciting and contrasts with the dominance and submission psychology in<br/>
the Toudou and Serizawa couple.<br/>
<br/>
The homosexuality in the work deviates for a refreshing mxf romance<br/>
I'll not reveal here.<br/>
<br/>
My only complaint is I wanted more action. I hope that the female lead<br/>
becomes more developed in the sequel.<br/>
<br/>
GOJOU HAJIME is a relaxing read where the plot is based on emotional<br/>
and physical reaction between characters.  <br/>
<br/>
[BLURB]<br/>
During Japan's 1800's the samurai<br/>
became dissatisfied with the shogun<br/>
for opening their isolated nation to<br/>
the Western Barbarians. Many<br/>
rebelled and plotted to overthrow<br/>
the shogun and restore their emperor<br/>
to a seat of power. The shogun<br/>
arranged a band of expert swordsmen<br/>
to manage the revolution. Given the<br/>
name, Shinsengumi (Newly Selected<br/>
Corps), the brave men were<br/>
commissioned to eliminate the unruly<br/>
samurai and ronin, sanctioned to kill.<br/>
The men lived for the moment, for their<br/>
lives could end in an instant. Under<br/>
stressful circumstances some of the<br/>
men turned to one another for comfort,<br/>
but how far did they venture from there<br/>
into the realm of taboo?<br/>
A fascinating historical, gay, yaoi,<br/>
erotic fiction for the adult reader 18+.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249684344">Wow -Sounds like a really interesting read! And great review!<br/>
<br/>
What I'm curious about with this book and the film Gohatto is why the Shinsengumi is <br/>
being used to explore the theme of nanshoku (male-male love)? Is there documented <br/>
historical reasons for this? If not, why Shinsengumi and not - say - the 47 Ronin or <br/>
Miyamoto Musashi? Just curious :-).. I do plan on picking the book up so thanks so much <br/>
for the FYI and the great post below!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***There are folktales which imply nanshoku occurred within the ranks <br/>
of the Shinsengumi.  Over time these tales became popularized to the <br/>
point that it has become fact and I think logically in the minds of many it <br/>
seems "logical" that men living in close quarters turned to each other <br/>
especially during those dry periods between their paychecks so to speak <br/>
and they couldn't go to the red-light district.  <br/>
<br/>
In popular media it's accepted canon to have Hijikata and Okita pairing <br/>
when there is little to suggest they were more than friends in history.  I <br/>
think it has alot to do with the issue that Okita as a TB patient has to <br/>
be "perpetually weak/ill" (even though that does not have to be the case <br/>
as TB patients have cycles of illness and "normal" periods) and if he had <br/>
an attractive older friend like Hijikata or even Kondou then it doesn't hurt <br/>
to imagine them as lovers with the weakened Okita playing a female <br/>
role. Combine nanshoku with the tragedy of TB and you have a really <br/>
compelling love story where one dies alone yearning for his lover and <br/>
his comrades (below is a very old essay about Okita and TB).<br/>
<br/>
The details from history which support nanshoku amongst the <br/>
Shinsengumi are:<br/>
<br/>
1) There was one very attractive Shinsengumi foot soldier and we do <br/>
have his name who may have caused some fighting amongst the ranks <br/>
<br/>
2) Itou Kashitaro was described, historically, as being attractive to the <br/>
point he made men and women take notice when he was out and about <br/>
on his strolls although we don't know for sure Itou's sexual leanings.<br/>
<br/>
If not, why Shinsengumi and not - say - the 47 Ronin or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Miyamoto Musashi?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>** I'm sure that somewhere the 47 Ronin have been portrayed in yaoi <br/>
media but I think because the group had 2 periods as retainers and then <br/>
separation before carrying out the plot, people are less likely to think of <br/>
them as practicing nanshoku.  I have never studied the 47 Ronin in detail.<br/>
In contrast the Shinsengumi's theme of "togetherness" comes across <br/>
more strongly and I think that is the reason they are so popular in yaoi <br/>
media.<br/>
<br/>
** Miyamoto Musashi, historically, did have male partners.<br/>
<br/>
GOJOU HAJIME is an interesting work and while I can't say it was written <br/>
for -just- yaoi fangirls I think it'll give people alot of insight into what <br/>
yaoi fans would like to read and why they find the "emotional" voice of <br/>
the characters so appealing.  <br/>

The Afflicted Swordsman: Tuberculosis and Okita Soujiro <br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
"It was a cough, apparently---a man's cougha cough devoid of any <br/>
zest for life or love, which didn't come in spasms, but sounded as if <br/>
someone were stirring feebly in a terrible mush of decomposing organic <br/>
material." (Mann 12)<br/>
<br/>
:: Edo Era :: Treatment :: Society :: Fiction :: Bibliography ::<br/>
<br/>
The following is a brief discussion on tuberculosis and its possible <br/>
effects on both historical Okita and how the illness aided in the <br/>
development of his fictional persona. Ofcourse, a physical condition does <br/>
not fully "define" a human being, so please do not view this exploration <br/>
as an oversimplification of him as just TB patient when obviously he was <br/>
so much more.<br/>
<br/>
To understand the biology of TB please do not rely only on websites <br/>
which often simplify the disease. Try to seek out medical texts, or <br/>
journal articles written by people in the medical community and <br/>
compare what we know now to the information available in 19th century <br/>
Japan to understand how Okita dealt with this illness. I am not a <br/>
bacteriologist nor a doctor so I will only touch on the science aspect. <br/>
<br/>
Prior to Robert Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus, the cause of <br/>
tuberculosis, was a universal mystery subject to superstition and intense <br/>
fear. There are six different kinds of disease causing Mycobacteria. Type <br/>
A was the variation found in Japan since prehistoric times. Before the <br/>
1880s some scientists had theorized that the tubercle bacilli floated in <br/>
the air and infected people. The theory was very close to scientific fact <br/>
but was rejected by a majority of the scientific community at the time <br/>
because few believed in the existence of "bacteria". <br/>
<br/>
"Airborne particles [of tubercle bacilli] formed by the evaporation of <br/>
minute respiratory droplets can carry several bacilliRespiratory <br/>
functions as simple as coughing, sneezing, spitting, and singing produce <br/>
such particlesin a closed room they disperse like tobacco smoke." <br/>
(Johnston 27)<br/>
<br/>
Exposure to the tubercle bacillus does not have to lead to infection. <br/>
Other factors such as the host's environment, age (puberty and old age <br/>
reduces the body's ability to resist infection), sex, nutrition, working <br/>
conditions (exhaustion can initiate active tuberculosis or exacerbate the <br/>
condition) as well as extreme mental stress (the last factor has been <br/>
observed by modern clinicians but there has been no extensive <br/>
experimentation) can determine the possible onset of illness.<br/>
<br/>
Japan's experience with the white plague peaked between 1890-1950 <br/>
and even the records between those years may not be accurate due to <br/>
frequent, at times, purposeful misdiagnosis to protect both the doctor <br/>
and patient's reputation. Often, innocuous complex phrases like caseous <br/>
pneumonia or bronchial catarrh were used in place of the most <br/>
ominous "consumption" on paperwork. The stigma attached to <br/>
tuberculosis will be further explored below.<br/>
<br/>
Edo Era [return to top]<br/>
Many foreign doctors and visitors who entered Japan right before the <br/>
Restoration noted the prevalence of tuberculosis.<br/>
(this section will deal with what people believed and practiced back <br/>
then, not what is scientifically accurate today)<br/>
<br/>
I have often read that Okita was a victim of pulmonary consumption so <br/>
what did that mean in his lifetime? <br/>
<br/>
Pulmonary consumption "translates into Japanese as haibyo, or 'lung <br/>
disease'" (Johnston 418) or the modern medical term hai kekkaku. An <br/>
even more common term was rosai (in Chinese, lao ji) (Johnston 43) <br/>
which appeared in Japanese texts for many centuries. Ro means "to <br/>
consume" and sai means "to hold a funeral ceremony" because after <br/>
suffering from emaciation, fever, night sweats, violent coughing and <br/>
even the external appearance of tubercles (kekkaku) the victim most <br/>
certainly died.<br/>
<br/>
How was Okita treated? [return to top] <br/>
Very likely his treatment was influenced by the techniques prescribed by <br/>
Manase Dosan (1507-1574). Manase used Chinese medical theories and <br/>
the Tokugawa sanctioned this medical approach. Aside from <br/>
popularizing the term rosai, Manase standardized a four step diagnosis <br/>
(summary from Johnston 44) procedure involving <br/>
<br/>
1) Visual observation, noting skin color, weight, weakness, condition of <br/>
the hair, sputum, feces, urine, and feces <br/>
2) Auditory observation by listening to the sounds in the chest by <br/>
tapping. <br/>
3) Interrogation using conversation to collect information from the <br/>
patient about appetite, waste elimination, emotions and what factors <br/>
induce the onset of illness<br/>
4) Pulse diagnosis a sophisticated art "that analyzed the strength, speed, <br/>
locations, and other aspects of the pulse to facilitate the identification of <br/>
a disease" (Johnston 44)<br/>
<br/>
Common treatment included moxibustion "(a method of cauterizing <br/>
specific points on the body according to principles similar to those used <br/>
in acupuncture)" (Johnston 44), recommendations to eat a diet rich in <br/>
eggs, chickens (note that they are all proteins), and residence in a rural <br/>
area (western doctors also recommended exposure to clean dry air). <br/>
One of the behavioral patterns noted by doctors of this era was that <br/>
excessive alcohol and sexual intercourse preceded illness thus they often <br/>
prescribed patients to abstain from both. Interestingly, there is a rumor <br/>
that Okita was a "clean child" or celibate. It is mentioned in <br/>
Shinsengumi "lore" that Hijikata gave the captain of his first squad the <br/>
medicine he once peddled, the Ishida Sanyaku (I am not certain about <br/>
the spelling).<br/>
<br/>
Generally, each symptom was treated because again, the cause had not <br/>
been identified. The most fascinating and common medicine was opium <br/>
in "tea" [Edit 5/19/2006] (This may be an an Asian form of poppy-head <br/>
tea or a similar derivative) which was believed to help stabilize the <br/>
digestive system and prevent diarrhea (tuberculosis affected many parts <br/>
of the body including the intestines). Note that there were extremely <br/>
strict laws against opium usage during the Tokugawa because the result <br/>
of this drug's prevalent use in China and Opium War were well known to <br/>
the bakufu.<br/>
<br/>
[Edit 5/19/2006] "There were no specific cures for tuberculosis, <br/>
pneumonia or bronchitis and opium helped to alleviate symptoms, <br/>
subduing coughing, expectoration and pain even if it could not touch the <br/>
root cause. Discharges of all sorts, too, were dealt with by the drung.Its <br/>
use in haemorrhage was well-known---'of all the wonderful <br/>
influences...exerted by opium, that by which it sustains the powers of <br/>
life...arrests the flow of blood, is the most extraordinary,' commented a <br/>
medical journal in 1846." (Berridge 67 originally from 'Review of Dr <br/>
Griffin's Medical and Physiological Problems, British and Foreign Medical <br/>
Review, 221 (1846) pp. 105-107). Although the example is from western <br/>
medicine, a similar belief was found in the East. Remember, the British <br/>
obtained opium from Asia and studied its many uses in that part of the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Matsumoto Ryojun, physician to Tokugawa Yoshinobu, was close to <br/>
Kondou Isami so very likely he knew of the medical condition of <br/>
members in the Shinsengumi such as Okita. After the Restoration, <br/>
Matsumoto became an important figure in establishing medical <br/>
education. If you have information further establishing the relationship <br/>
between this physician and Okita please contact shinsengumihq(a)<br/>
yahoo.com. <br/>
<br/>
[Edit 5/19/2006] As mentioned earlier, opium was frequently used in the <br/>
treatment of TB. According to this website "An anecdotal story about his <br/>
unorthodox techniques-- he successfully treated Tokugawa Yoshinobu's <br/>
stress condition by having him take opium (against government <br/>
regulation) and sleep for a day." (translated by Hirotada Tokugawa).<br/>
<br/>
[Edit 5/19/2006] Matsumoto's connection to the Shinsengumi can be <br/>
seen in the fact that Kondou Isami met the physician. Matsumoto also <br/>
left an account of his meeting with the Shinsengumi chief (See <br/>
Hillsborough Shinsengumi 104-105). Furthermore, after Kondou was <br/>
shot by surviving members of the Itou Affair, he sought Matsumoto's <br/>
care in Osaka (Hillsborough Shinsengumi 140). Matsumoto's last <br/>
connection to the Shinsengumi is his involvement in composing a text for <br/>
an important memorial to Kondou and Hijikata in Hino (Hillsborough <br/>
Shinsengumi 174, 181-182).<br/>
<br/>
"According to an old proverb, the best treatment for tuberculosis <br/>
was opium and lies." (Rosenberg II)<br/>
<br/>
How did society treat sick people like Okita? [return to top] <br/>
<br/>
It is highly likely that Okita's condition was kept secret as long as <br/>
possible for practical reasons. The Shinsengumi lived and worked as a <br/>
unit, a community, and this illness would affect their morale. There are <br/>
also cultural beliefs connected to pollution which should be taken into <br/>
consideration too. <br/>
<br/>
Consumption fell under the category of fuchi no yamai or incurable, <br/>
disfiguring disease. One of the symptoms of TB is hemoptysis or the <br/>
coughing up of blood, which related the illness to "red impurities" such <br/>
as menstruation, child birth and so forth. Note that blood was one of <br/>
many liquids expelled by the patient, usually they would cough up the <br/>
decomposing cheeselike material which accumlulated in their lungs as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
A more heavy term is gobyo or "karmic disease" which did not mean <br/>
that bad karma caused the disease but that it was inescapable like the <br/>
fruition of past action. Karma does not always mean "negative" action. <br/>
The significance of this term is that there is nowhere to run or hide from <br/>
the inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
Marriage would have been almost impossible. Both male and female <br/>
patients could start a tubercular family lineage or kekkaku ketto. There <br/>
are numerous accounts of women divorced due to the sickness for fear <br/>
that it would be passed down to their children via breast milk. Men, <br/>
unable to maintain their family line or women unable to marry or <br/>
produce children were generally marginalized by society.<br/>
<br/>
Victims were usually buried outside the village graveyard or separate <br/>
from the official family grave for fear that the pollution would mark their <br/>
blood line as a yamai make or diseased lineage. The belief that disease <br/>
could be inherited persisted well into the 20th century.<br/>
<br/>
Fiction[return to top] <br/>
How come Okita is always smiling, childish and ummm girly?<br/>
<br/>
Not all fictional portrayals show as cheery and upbeat but many do <br/>
because maintaining a positive attitude was believed to be beneficial. <br/>
The following representative quotes are from a medical text however <br/>
they may be outdated.<br/>
<br/>
Again, writers and artists may have worked with these generalizations <br/>
to "build" the character of Okita, which means that it may not accurately <br/>
reflect on the historical person.<br/>
<br/>
"The belief that there is a specific `tuberculous personality'<br/>
characterized by undue cheerfulness (Spes Phthisica)and marked<br/>
intellectual productivity has gained wide support." (Calden 275)<br/>
<br/>
"Tuberculous patients behave like deprived children." (Dunbar 226)<br/>
<br/>
Due to the patient's dependence on others during their illness, the <br/>
researchers chose representative quotes from the 570 subjects they <br/>
used. One said "I feel like a baby again" (Calden 288) <br/>
<br/>
"Let us assume that the patients have passed beyond the unavoidable <br/>
breaking-in period and have settled down to being ill and to being ill with <br/>
tuberculosis. Afterwards a variety of mental changes may take place <br/>
which time and again have puzzled observers. It has been said<br/>
that tuberculous patients are predominantly sensitive, neurotic, <br/>
depressed, optimistic, elated, euphoric, easily suggestible, whimsical, <br/>
CHILDISH, selfish, self-centered, capriciousMost patients with <br/>
tuberculosis are in a mood of mild overt or concealed depression and <br/>
anxiety, which are normal and adequate reaction to indisious disease<br/>
Offsprings of these reactions and defenses against them are defiance, <br/>
ULTRA-CHEERFULNESS." (Wittkower 164)<br/>
<br/>
"Much has been written on the subject of tuberculosis and genius[list <br/>
of geniuses]. The truth of the matter seems to be that tuberculosis is a <br/>
common disease, and therefore also occurs in men and women of <br/>
geniustuberculosis for a variety of reasons favors fantasy production<br/>
and the dreaded limitation of their span of life stimulates their <br/>
productivity." (Wittkower 155-6)<br/>
<br/>
There was an entire GENRE devoted to tuberculosis both in the West <br/>
and Japan.<br/>
Usually the illness is associated with young frail, beautiful women. <br/>
Interestingly, many girls after their first menses WERE likely to get TB, <br/>
especially if they had a lower intake of protein (note many Japanese had <br/>
a vegetarian and fish diet that time). We know that the Shinsengumi <br/>
were the subject of folktales and even the novel Nakazato Kaizan's <br/>
DAIBOSATSU-TOGE [the film SWORD OF DOOM] (although Okita was <br/>
not feminine or childlike in this work) it is easy to see how a doomed <br/>
swordsman with TB all of sudden takes on female qualities which would <br/>
solidify him as a perpetually tragic figure in fiction. Most patients <br/>
regardless of gender did experience exhaustion and thus if a masculine <br/>
swordsman is constantly weak he gradually becomes more and more <br/>
like the gender associated with physical weakness.<br/>
<br/>
"Life means that form is retained even though matter is being <br/>
transformed." (Mann 262)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131598382">What's more weird is that we know the top brass of the Shinsengumi had <br/>
relationships with females.  In some cases we have names of those <br/>
females and I'd like to know if any Japanese researchers have ever <br/>
followed up with finding those women's records (since they were geisha).<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Saitou Hajime he had Aioi Tayu.<br/>
<br/>
But I think ultimately the audience finds the m/m possibilities to <br/>
be more tantalizing.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
But the Shinsengumi weren't the only group from that era who got <br/>
the "yaoi makeover".  The Byakkotai's narrative as told by:<br/>
<br/>
Heise, Richard. Ueber Loyalität in Japan;<br/>
umgearbeitet nach einem Vortrag ...<br/>
Böhm.-Krumau 1931 (72 pages)<br/>
<br/>
also has homoerotic touches.  This is based on an interpretation I read <br/>
where Heise describes the bodies of the youths falling on one another <br/>
in a very "literary" way which may imply homoerotic bonds between <br/>
them.  I don't read German so I wouldn't know for sure and I don't have <br/>
specific page numbers in Heise's book where his writing seems to lean <br/>
that way.  Since Heise was writing in an era where it may not be <br/>
prudent to fully express his interpretation of the Byakkotai he may <br/>
have just held back from going overboard.  Then again my understanding <br/>
is that Germans attach homoeroticism to military groups so maybe he is <br/>
writing from his own cultural standpoint.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Now shameless plugging of a novella I wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone in the modo for *DARK* m/m set in 19th century Japan and WI USA <br/>
should try KATANA DUET: Samurai's Forbidden Love. Coming soon to Amazon <br/>
at the end of Sept 2008 in print form but the e-book version published <br/>
and distributed by BOOKSTRAND.com is cheaper and more environmentally <br/>
sound.  Some people know me on the list as being a nerd, well this book <br/>
does have nerd stuff in it but I call it historical details goodness <br/>
which sadly I could not footnote in the text. (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
KATANA DUET is a very unique work which manages to combine a touch of <br/>
the Boshin War, the struggles of samurai after that period, immigration <br/>
and an uneasy integration into an isolated area in the USA.  The theme <br/>
of blood ties, attraction between the same blood is mixed in with <br/>
research into a mysterious disease (it is actually TB).  Exoticism of <br/>
Orientals is conveyed through the vehicle of the circus (WI was the <br/>
home of the travelling show).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to buy it....(sorry only 18+ readers will be able to <br/>
purchase)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584870485">Wow you make it sound so intriguing it all makes me want to become a<br/>
historical fiction writer and stir up something for folks to read. <br/>
There's something about the thought of sitting for hours creating scenes<br/>
of anything I want and spend my time riding on the adventures of my<br/>
mind.  And what if, just what if the people who read what I write enjoy<br/>
the trip?  How fulfilling would THAT be?<br/>
<br/>
All right, where's my pen?  I'm all motivated now to get some pairing<br/>
going ^__^<br/>
