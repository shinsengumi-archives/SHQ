<h3>NEED YOUR INPUT! PLS.... www.shinsengumidb.com</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89352969">I think I made a mistake on the ratings on the database... I mean I <br/>
grouped yaoi stories PG-R together and then a separate yaoi NC17. Do <br/>
you think I should have a separate rating for each yaoi and not group <br/>
them?<br/>
 <br/>
Also another issue I'm having is the characters... Basically since I <br/>
want it to be a Shinsengumi site, the most popular (or at least I <br/>
think they're popular) miburo members are there and I grouped all the <br/>
RK characters together in "other RK". There is no specifics as to <br/>
Kenshin, Kauro, Sano, Aoshi etc... I was thinking of adding <br/>
a "Harada"/"Sanosuke" but someone commented that it was probably not <br/>
a good idea as they should not be confused. *sigh*<br/>
 <br/>
So basically if you wanted to find a SaitouxSano story or Saitou x <br/>
male for the matter you just have to settle for filtering for Saitou <br/>
and Yaoi. Does anyone have any suggestions. There are a number of <br/>
Yaoi stories now on the site but it's fine if I have to go and change <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at how the site is presented in the details <br/>
section and the search/add functions... I need input right away... <br/>
It's growing  (101 fanfics plus a bunch more that I have permission <br/>
to add but not there yet) but if I'm making changes I have to do it <br/>
now before I put in another folder of authors in there.... <br/>
<br/>
You can place your comments here OR in the "contributors page" in DB <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumidb.com">http://www.shinsengumidb.com</a> <br/>
<br/>
Once this is done... I plan to work on the fan-art and musicvids... <br/>
Then back to the commercial section (which really NEEDS a lot of <br/>
work).<br/>
<br/>
Minna... Thanks for all your help...<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
Sec, I have not made a banner yet... Quite clueless on where to start <br/>
as I am not artistically inclined nor do I know what programs to <br/>
use...</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi there Angrybee! I added your fic. What else? Oh feel free to add <br/>
your fics even if you do not inform me as long as they're Miburo <br/>
fics. I prefer this actually since I think authors knows best. :O)</div>
