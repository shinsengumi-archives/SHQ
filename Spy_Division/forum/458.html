<h3>A little list business</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598948521">Just a reminder to those entertaining us with wonderful stories... please be sure to give some indication of a rating in the story description when you upload stories to the archive (as well as any appropriate warnings, if necessary).  That description is all people have to go on when you upload there and don't post the story to the list itself.<br/>
 <br/>
And those with graphic skills, please be sure to load images to the Photos section and not in the Files.  Phoebe, your absolutely gorgeous drawing of the Shinsengumi has been moved to the Single Originals folder under Photos.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!  I return you now to your various creative endeavors.<br/>
