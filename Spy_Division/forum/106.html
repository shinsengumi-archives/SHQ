I admit I thought of bandwidth and costs too, especially after their so called catastrophic failure of April 2. While there is certain legitimacy to this, I think the management has managed to put many of us at the defensive and having second thoughts after the NC 17 ban. I don't know, I can't help to having second thoughts about their real motives... Maybe the advertisement they have really don't cover the costs, I don't know, but the way they worded this little thing sounded... mmmm I don't know...<br/>
I wonder if the response to the reviewers can be considered as violation of the said TOS... At this rate we should be having a copy of the TOS at hand, including all the clarifications like this one >.<<br/>

<br/>
hehe, I've heard a lot of people complaining about Media Miner. Honestly, I never had problems with it, problems which I did have with FF net (( like messing up format and changing the order of chapters >.<)<br/>
I had also my share of trouble with Adultfanfiction. I have just registered to anime-fiction (never heard of them before... Thanks for the tip), and I suppose I'll be uploading soon... <br/>
