this and the other recent thing about getting rid of poetry--certain <br/>

I have some stuff on Media Miner but it&#39;s such a PITA for me. It never <br/>
seems to work right and changing a password is a major adventure. <br/>
Adultff.net is even more of a pain because you have to jump through <br/>
multiple hoops to get anything to upload properly.<br/>

I admit I thought of bandwidth and costs too, especially after their so called catastrophic failure of April 2. While there is certain legitimacy to this, I think the management has managed to put many of us at the defensive and having second thoughts after the NC 17 ban. I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t help to having second thoughts about their real motives... Maybe the advertisement they have really don&#39;t cover the costs, I don&#39;t know, but the way they worded this little thing sounded... mmmm I don&#39;t know...<br/>
I wonder if the response to the reviewers can be considered as violation of the said TOS... At this rate we should be having a copy of the TOS at hand, including all the clarifications like this one &gt;.&lt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
hehe, I&#39;ve heard a lot of people complaining about Media Miner. Honestly, I never had problems with it, problems which I did have with FF net (( like messing up format and changing the order of chapters &gt;.&lt;)<br/>
I had also my share of trouble with Adultfanfiction. I have just registered to anime-fiction (never heard of them before... Thanks for the tip), and I suppose I&#39;ll be uploading soon... <br/>
