<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197223836">Hi:   <br/>
I am curious to know where the products of the Saito/Holmes challenge <br/>
ended up.  I have looked around a bit and have not been able to find <br/>
any of the stories.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds very intriguing and is making my muse whisper a bit too.  <br/>
Holmes did say that he knew a martial art at one point, wonder where <br/>
he learned it............</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271111385">Unfortunately, no one came up with any completed stories and some of us who had started stories got caught up in other things.  I may yet finish mine.  ^_^<br/>
 <br/>
The challenge is certainly still open and I&#39;d still love to see someone (or several &quot;someones&quot;) take it on.  Encourage that muse!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536461329">Thanks for the info.  Unfortunately what is running through my head <br/>
right now is not Ripper-related and therefore does not conform to <br/>
your guidlines.  However, I will still pursue it, just so it will <br/>
stop running through my head and distracting me. hee<br/>
