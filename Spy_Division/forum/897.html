<h3>[Yaoi] Illusion of Love</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-716346803">(This message is just an announcement and therefore worksafe)<br/>
<br/>
"Illusion of Love" is a short story which is a reincarnation of a <br/>
Peacemaker Kurogane fanfic I did years and years ago.  Now, the story <br/>
features an original version of the Shinsengumi in a yaoi work and <br/>
also some genre-bending elements.  I believe yaoi, like any genre can <br/>
be a vehicle for other themes which can add diversity to the field.  <br/>
Illusion of Love does have very minimal man x man and also a thread of <br/>
spirituality which will hopefully make the work very unique to readers.<br/>
<br/>
The story is hosted at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-on-samurai.com">http://www.samurai-on-samurai.com</a><br/>

Illusion of Love is under the category "Samurai Shorts" and you can't <br/>
miss this section of the website because it has male lower torsos <br/>
covered in just fundoshi (^_^)<br/>

<h3>[Yaoi] Sacred Blood</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-357389970">(This message does not contain yaoi writing or images. This just an<br/>
announcement and therefore worksafe.)<br/>
<br/>
I recently completed a short story for Samurai-on-Samurai.com<br/>
<<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-on-samurai.com/">http://www.samurai-on-samurai.com/</a>>   called "Sacred Blood" which takes<br/>
place during feudal times.<br/>
<br/>
A young handsome daimyo, Lord Akodo, is shot with an arrow during an<br/>
excursion in the forest.  Desperate to save him, the retainers take him<br/>
to a mysterious shrine attended by a priestess named Airi.  Before Airi<br/>
can do anything she requests that the archer be found.  "Sacred Blood"<br/>
is about sibling rivalry between brothers Hayato, the warrior, and Haru<br/>
the healer and advisor and their loyalty to the injured daimyo.<br/>
<br/>
The tale contains blood, very little mxm sexuality and touches of the<br/>
paranormal.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from "Sacred Blood", Samurai-on-samurai.com is also hosting<br/>
"Illusion of Love" which is an interesting Saitou x Yamazaki story with<br/>
a twist.<br/>
<br/>
Just a footnote, Sacred Blood is a short story told by some characters<br/>
from, KATANA DUET,<br/>
<<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bookstrand.com/authors/silapajarun/kd.asp">http://www.bookstrand.com/authors/silapajarun/kd.asp</a>>   a novella of<br/>
mine which was recently published by Bookstrand.com (the title is<br/>
currently on sale at 15% off so check it out) (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
I'm already planning another Shinsengumi story for Samurai-on-Samurai.<br/>
