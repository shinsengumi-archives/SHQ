<div id="ygrps-yiv-152305339">Can't believe I missed this group. Hello minna! Most of the members <br/>
looks SO FAMILIAR :O)<br/>
<br/>
Umm... Just wanted to introduce myself first to be polite. <br/>
<br/>
mg_batt here from Miburo, edojidai and SHQ. My pen name is wounds in <br/>
fanfiction.net. Crazy about Saitou-sama and a fast growing interest <br/>
on the Shinsengumi. I love reading the post in the groups, so many <br/>
informative people and it gives me something to write about. Not much <br/>
of a contributor as everytime I get anything juicy someone is already <br/>
one step ahead. Oh well, that's how good the group is... :O)<br/>
<br/>
I write stories and poems that are Saitou-sama based. I like to <br/>
write/read, alternate pairings a lot. I like to pair Saitou-sama with <br/>
just about anyone. Just started last December and not really a <br/>
writer. Heck hated English and writing back in school, was more of a <br/>
Math/Science person. So please don't kill me if by chance you read my <br/>
fic and didn't like it. PLEASE? My bestfriend already did and she <br/>
only read one chapter...   :O)</div>

<h3>A plot point that&#39;s driving me crazy!</h3>
by <i>bsher213</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-743543672">I hope someone on this list has the answer to the question that's been <br/>
making me crazy and has brought the "great Bakumatsu/Meiji time travel" <br/>
to a dead halt.<br/>
<br/>
There is a superstition that if you sleep in a room with an uncovered <br/>
mirror that a female demon will come and steal your soul/take you away <br/>
to the underworld.<br/>
<br/>
What I need to find is this demon's fatal weakness you know like<br/>
<br/>
Vampires=crosses/garlic/sunglight<br/>
<br/>
Werewolves= silver bullets<br/>
<br/>
Superman= kryptonite<br/>
<br/>
What could the mirror demon's "instant death thing" be? And it _can't_ <br/>
involve breaking the mirror.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519874184">Okay if it is a Chinese folk or daoist based belief <br/>
wooden daoist sword used in exorcisms/defeat a demon I guess (usually<br/>
wielded by a daoist priest).<br/>
<br/>
These swords look very similar with the ones used in Tai'chi practice<br/>
(with tassles and everything).<br/>
<br/>
horsetail whisk (white)<br/>
<br/>
You can chant mantras...but that's boring<br/>
<br/>
just search google for Taoist Exorcism...I assume anyone of the sacred<br/>
objects outta take out a demon<br/>
<br/>
Japan...<br/>
***In Karl Fridays "Legacies of the Sword" does mention old school<br/>
sword kata based or related to beliefs in exorcisms...the lineage<br/>
Kashima Shinryu is tied to the shrine of martial valor Kashima Jingu<br/>
(Shinto based)...very important shrine Serizawa Kamo broke a drum<br/>
there and came up with some lame excuse later "possessed by the gods<br/>
or something"<br/>

Not sure that helps all that much - but here's an amusing tale that appears in "Chinese Fairy Tales & Fantasies" by Moss Roberts.<br/>
"The truth about ghosts"<br/>
