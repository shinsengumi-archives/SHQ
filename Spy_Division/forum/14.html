Vol 2<br/>
<br/>
I would like to take a moment to remind the good citizenry of Kyoto to <br/>
please use caution when trying to gain admittance to the Shinsengumi <br/>
Headquarters.  Our squad leaders and members are very diligent about <br/>
answering calls for assistance and reports of crimes and they may not <br/>
always be able to see you loitering outside the front gate (especially <br/>
if your height falls below that of their waist).<br/>
<br/>
While our members take every effort to proceed with caution when <br/>
answering an urgent call sometimes accidents do happen and civilians <br/>
might be injured, however slightly. Should something like this occur to <br/>
you or someone you know please do not hesitate to file a report with our <br/>
insurance claims division in Aizu.<br/>

<br/>
Dear Editor:<br/>
<br/>
I am writing in regards to an article in your last issue. The article in <br/>
question concerned an alleged runaway by the name of Himura Shinta a/k/a <br/>
&quot;Kenni&quot;.  I wish to assure this newspaper and your readers that young <br/>
Himura is by no means a runaway. The boy in question is in fact seeking <br/>
refuge with my extended family after being severely mistreated by his <br/>
abusive, sake addicted adoptive father, who tried to keep him a prisoner <br/>
in a secluded mountain retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Kenni is currently in my employ (part time of course considering his <br/>
tender age) as a page and spends much of his time studying kendo and the <br/>
shamisen under the tutelage of an old family friend Sensei Takasugi.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Katsura K.<br/>

The Fifth Unit under the command of Captain Takeda Kanryuusai was <br/>
ambused  late Sunday evening while on routine patrol.  Witnesses report <br/>
that twenty squad members were killed by a single assailant alleged to <br/>
be the reputed serial killer Hitokiri Battousai.<br/>
<br/>
While this reporter finds it hard to believe that twenty of our elite <br/>
troops could be killed by a single man we are investigating each and <br/>
every lead.  Citizens are encouraged to some forth with any information <br/>
no matter how insignificant it may seem.<br/>

New Column:<br/>
<br/>
Hello and welcome to the first installment of &quot;Ask Ayu-nee&quot;----the <br/>
Column that Cares. I am Yamazaki Ayumu a long time Kyoto resident and <br/>
current barracks cook for those wonderful brave men of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami-san asked me to do this column as it seemed people were always <br/>
wandering into my kitchen and asking for advice on one thing or another. <br/>
Please feel free to write me about whatever is bothering you and I&#39;ll do <br/>
my best to help.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s start with the mail that&#39;s arrived so far...<br/>
<br/>
Dear Ayu-nee,<br/>
<br/>
I have a strange fascination with my sister&#39;s clothes. I can&#39;t get<br/>
enough of wearing them, ,luckily I&#39;ve managed to incorporate my hobby<br/>
seamlessly into my daily job but I&#39;m afraid that might change<br/>
soon when I go on the night shift and have to wear a dull black( no <br/>
yummy silk components involved)  uniform. Can you offer any advice?<br/>
<br/>
---Nobody&#39;s brother.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Brother--<br/>
<br/>
I strongly suggest that you find some other way to enjoy your hobby because<br/>
sisters do not like going to pick their favorite pink kimono for a date<br/>
with a certain dashing eighth squad captain only to find that it has <br/>
questionable stiff, dried stains below the waist!<br/>
<br/>
Dear Ayu-nee<br/>
<br/>
All of my men are Ahous. What should I do?<br/>
<br/>
-----WolfMan<br/>
<br/>
Dear Wolfie:<br/>

<br/>
Dear Ayu-nee<br/>
<br/>
I run an elite group of samurai. I trained most of them. but I find I <br/>
get no one&#39;s respect. They treat me like a kindly old man when I&#39;m not <br/>
much older than they are. What should I do?<br/>
<br/>
-Big Boss<br/>
<br/>
Dear Boss:<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t wish to be cruel but this sounds to me like a situation of your <br/>
own making. Do you defer judgment to your second in command? Do you <br/>
arrange outings and harmless recreational activities for the men much <br/>
like a friend would do or do you rule them with an iron fist no matter what?<br/>
<br/>
I think you can turn this situation around but it won&#39;t be easy. You may <br/>
have to resort to tough love and that means Seppuku----For Them! (except <br/>
maybe for certain third and eight squad leaders)<br/>
<br/>
Dear Ayu-nee<br/>
<br/>
I am currently employed by an independant security firm here in Kyoto. <br/>
Part of my duties include repelling certain competitors of my employer <br/>
but a fanatical government sponsored faction keeps getting in my way.<br/>
<br/>
How can I get them to leave me alone and let me do my friggin Job?! To <br/>
be honest we are both working towards the same goal but looking at the <br/>
matter from different perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
-Red<br/>
<br/>
Dear Red,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been fond of the kindness kills approach,<br/>
<br/>
be friendly to your opponents, invite them out for a cup of sake (well <br/>
maybe not the tall ones with the narrow eyes), be a pal, make them see <br/>
how alike you are and how much your job means to you. I&#39;m sure with a <br/>
little give and take on both sides you&#39;ll find common ground eventually.<br/>

Notice:<br/>
<br/>
 Meeting of Shinsengumi financial committee has been moved up to this <br/>
Friday morning to discuss excessive amount of company funds spent on <br/>
sword sharpening equipment.<br/>
<br/>
----Hijikata<br/>
<br/>
Local News:<br/>
<br/>
There was a break-in last night at the Mitsubishi warehouse complex in <br/>
the city&#39;s south end. The investigating unit fell that the burglar must <br/>
have been a youth or small statured adult as the means of entry was a <br/>
narrow window in the building housing stock slated to be delivered to <br/>
Keyaki&#39;s Womenswear and Cosmetics Outlet.<br/>
<br/>
A quick inventory showed that the burglar attempted to make off with <br/>
numerous cases of White Plum Perfume but only managed to get a few <br/>
bottles. Most of the merchandise was recovered a short distance away <br/>
though one of the cases was damaged causing some of the contents to <br/>
spill on the investing unit&#39;s caption one  Saitou Hajime.<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # # #<br/>
<br/>
Other Local News<br/>
<br/>
 A number of Shinsengumi members of the Third Unit were officially <br/>
reprimanded for verbally harassing their direct superior by &quot;making <br/>
jokes&quot; about his &quot;Smelling as fresh as a just picked white plum&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally that night a fire broke out in the barracks housing the <br/>
men of the Third Unit.  An anonymous witness reported seeing a black <br/>
clad man hurrying from the scene muttering &quot;The heat will kill them....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Further official investigation is pending.<br/>

Dear Ayu-nee,<br/>
<br/>
I relocated to Kyoto following the death of my fiancÃ© at the hands of an <br/>
unknown mugger. I&#39;m a girl used to nice surroundings and the finer <br/>
things in life but since coming here the only job I could find was as a <br/>
*groan*<br/>
<br/>
maid to a bunch of smelly swordsmen at a small futon and breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
As if that isn&#39;t demeaning enough now I&#39;m being told I have to babysit a <br/>
fifteen year old kid to keep him off the streets and out of trouble. <br/>
This is worse than having to look after my obnoxious little brother! Help!<br/>
<br/>
----Plum Crazy in Kyoto<br/>
<br/>
Dear Plum<br/>
<br/>
We all go through frustrating times in our lives. This kid might not be <br/>
all that bad once you get to know him. My advice is to just grit your <br/>
teeth, go along with your boss&#39;s wishes, and try to make the most of <br/>
it!  And don&#39;t jump in front of any swords no matter how trying it gets!<br/>
