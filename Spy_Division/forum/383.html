<br/>
	The snows come lightly on this night.  Light dust falling <br/>
from a dark sky.  I walk and feel it fall on my head, the tingle of <br/>
cold on my skin and scalp.  The flakes are large and slow.  They <br/>
gather on the heavy sack I carry over my shoulder  They cling to <br/>
trees and ground and cloth.<br/>
<br/>
	When I was young, I loved the snow.  I would wait all autumn <br/>
just for the first falls to come, so that I could go out and play in <br/>
it.  I would toss it above my head and run with all the exuberance of <br/>
youth.  My feet and hands would be numb from hours in it, my mother <br/>
would chide me for not coming when called, saying my sniffles and <br/>
sneezes where what I deserved for not obeying her.  My grandmother <br/>
would just shake her head, a slight smile on her face.  <br/>
<br/>
	Sometimes at night I would sit outside with my grandmother <br/>
under the awnings and watch the flakes swirl in the garden.  White <br/>
clusters to replace the white cherry blossoms.  We would sip our tea, <br/>
and maybe nibble some little snack she had made.  But we would never <br/>
talk.  We would just watch.  One night, I asked her where the snow <br/>
came from.<br/>
<br/>
	"Where does the snow come from Hayasuke?  That is a very old <br/>
question indeed.  I asked my father the same question when I was your <br/>
age."<br/>
<br/>
	"Did he know?"<br/>
<br/>
	"Oh yes dear."<br/>
<br/>
	"What did he tell you?!"  <br/>
<br/>
	Excitement and anticipation filled my voice.  The mystery was <br/>
about to be solved.  Calmly my grandmother took another sip of tea.  <br/>
No hurry.  I felt as if I would burst from containing my eagerness.  <br/>
She spoke softly.<br/>
<br/>
	"One night, after a great snowfall, we were walking home and <br/>
I asked him your question.  He looked thoughtful for a second, and <br/>
then he told me to look in the sky and tell me what I saw.  I looked <br/>
up and saw nothing but the stars.  I didn't understand.  He was <br/>
patient with me, as parents can be with children."<br/>
<br/>
	She took another sip of her tea.<br/>
<br/>
	"'The stars Yoki, don't you see', he said to me.  The stars <br/>
are fires in the sky, and the snow is their ashes falling to earth."<br/>
<br/>
	I was puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
	"But grandmother, if the stars are fire, and the snows ash, <br/>
then why is it cold?"<br/>
<br/>
	She smiled.<br/>
<br/>
	"Another question that I asked.  Because you see dear, the <br/>
stars aren't like regular fire that we have.  Their special.  The <br/>
stars are cold fire.  And the snow is their cold ashes.  Cold ashes, <br/>
from cold fire."<br/>
<br/>
	She stood up with the tea tray and went inside, leaving me to <br/>
look at the snow falling to the earth.<br/>
<br/>
	Just cold ashes from a cold fire, falling on the cold earth.  <br/>
Cold...<br/>
<br/>
	Snow melts so easily in blood.<br/>
<br/>
	The memory is startling the way it appears.  Last year was <br/>
it?  Two?  In the streets of Kyoto.  He had to be barely half my age, <br/>
yet he had run at me with his blade.  Ran at me in the snow.  Without <br/>
thought, I cut him down and watched him bleed.  Watched as the <br/>
steaming red blood melted the snow.  The life left his eyes and <br/>
became cold.<br/>
<br/>
	Cold world.  The cold world of a dead mans eyes.  Blood in <br/>
the snow.  Ashes of a cold fire.  Dead mans eyes.  Bloody snow.  Cold <br/>
fire.  Dead...  Bloody...  Cold...<br/>
<br/>
	I shake myself from the trance with a start.  So vivid the <br/>
visions, the memories.  Where am I?<br/>
<br/>
	In front of an inn.  It's small and looks empty.  Yet light <br/>
comes from within.  Not totally empty.  I walk up too the door and <br/>
call out.<br/>
<br/>
	"Hello?  I want a room for the night!  Anyone around?"<br/>
<br/>
	I hear movement from within.  Slow and lazy.  An older man <br/>
opens the door, holding a lantern.<br/>
<br/>
	"My, my, my.  What are you doing out in this weather son?"<br/>
<br/>
	"Walking."  I shuffle my feet impatiently.  "Might I come <br/>
in?  It's cold out here."<br/>
<br/>
	He steps aside to let me pass.  I slip off my shoes and move <br/>
into the main chamber.  A fires going in the pit, a pot simmering <br/>
over it, cushions gathered around.  No one else here it seems.  I <br/>
gently lower my sack.<br/>
<br/>
	"Its rather late son.  You're lucky I'm a night owl; <br/>
otherwise I might not have heard you.  Want a room you said?"<br/>
<br/>
	"A room and a hot meal if I can get it."<br/>
<br/>
	"What do you think the pot is?"<br/>
<br/>
	"How much?"<br/>
<br/>
	He names his price.  I pay it, not caring to haggle.  A wave <br/>
of hunger has come over me.  He serves me my food, the rice still <br/>
hot.  I eat in silence with the old man.  He keeps stealing looks at <br/>
me though.  I pretend not to notice.  He pours us tea after we <br/>
finish, sitting around the fire.  He clears his throat to speak.<br/>
<br/>
	"So friend, where do you come from?"<br/>
<br/>
	I stare into the fire as I answer his question, watching the <br/>
flames dance.<br/>
<br/>
	"Kyoto."<br/>
<br/>
	"Kyoto?!  My, but you've walked quite a ways then haven't <br/>
you?"  I shrug.  He falls silent, staring into the flames with me <br/>
before he speaks again.<br/>
<br/>
	"You fought there?"<br/>
<br/>
	I nod my head in response.<br/>
<br/>
	"What was it like?"<br/>
<br/>
	My voice is a whisper.<br/>
<br/>
	"Hell."<br/>
<br/>
	We are quiet for a very long time after that.<br/>
<br/>
                            * * * *<br/>
<br/>
	I ate breakfast with the old man in the morning before <br/>
starting out.  The snow has stopped but the sky is still gray.  The <br/>
path is growing slightly steeper now.  Entering the mountains.  I <br/>
remember my last words with the old man.<br/>
<br/>
	"Where are you planning on going?"<br/>
<br/>
	I point up the road I've been walking.  <br/>
<br/>
	"Where ever this path takes me I guess.  I really don't care."<br/>
<br/>
	His expression twisted into one of fear.  <br/>
<br/>
	"You mustn't go that way.  That way leads only to death."<br/>
<br/>
	"What do you mean?"<br/>
<br/>
	"That mountain is cursed with death.  It's said that so much <br/>
blood has been shed there, the streams run red.  What evil it truly <br/>
is up there, I can't tell you not, no one knows.  The only people <br/>
that live up there are crazy or cursed or both.  You mustn't go that <br/>
way."<br/>
<br/>
	I loop up the road which he tells me to avoid.  It stretch's <br/>
off into the dead forest that covers the mountain.  Dark and <br/>
uninviting.  Perhaps the old man is right, there's a branching path <br/>
that leads away in another direction.  I could take it and avoid <br/>
whatever superstition he's feeding me.  Or at least a hard uphill <br/>
walk.  But still...<br/>
<br/>
	I turn and smile for the first time in days.<br/>
<br/>
	"Sorry old man, I'll keep going this way.  I've never been <br/>
one too take the easy way in life."<br/>
<br/>
	With that I started walking.<br/>
<br/>
	"Thanks for the food and the company!"  <br/>
	<br/>
	I wave over my shoulder, not looking back.  He calls out <br/>
after me.<br/>
<br/>
	"You'll be sorry, trust me!  You shouldn't go that way!"<br/>
<br/>
	He falls silent.  I continue walking, not looking back.  Then <br/>
I hear him faintly behind me again.<br/>
<br/>
	"May the gods watch over you!"<br/>
<br/>
	Gods.  What gods in this cold world are there, but cold <br/>
statues?<br/>
<br/>
	I continue walking.</div>
