<h3>Eastern Sea Road</h3>
by <i>warg3791</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-213474638">Found a little piece on the road (one of them anyway) between Kyoto <br/>
and Edo. This might have been the road our boys took when they first <br/>
came to Kyoto. Also, this may be helpful to those who write fanfics <br/>
(at least the RK ones, where there is a lot of coming and going <br/>
between the two cities) which is why I&#39;m posting it here. This is <br/>
from a book called Reader&#39;s Digest Everyday Life Through the Ages <br/>
(1992) ISBN# 0-276-42035-7 (Be forewarned there are only four pages <br/>
in the whole book on Japan.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Grains and goods made by craftsmen were carried from place to place <br/>
on a network of roads which included the Eastern Sea Road. This <br/>
highway, 300 miles (480 km) long, connected Kyoto and Edo, and at the <br/>
time it was probably the world&#39;s busiest road. A constant traffic of <br/>
merchants, government officials, pilgrims, priests and doctors <br/>
travelled along it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Most people travelled by horse or on foot, and it took 20 to 30 days <br/>
for pedestrians to complete the journey. The few wheeled vehicles <br/>
were used to carry very heavy loads. There were incessant stops at <br/>
checkpoints where the agents of the shogun kept a watchful eye on <br/>
travellers. Their main concern was to give the shogun advance warning <br/>
of powerful local lords on the move with large bodies of armed men.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759041183">Toshizo.com has a basic chronology of where the boys stopped at and<br/>
the dates, inns etc (one of links on the column on the left)...I&#39;m not<br/>
sure if it is worth babelfishing or not though<br/>
