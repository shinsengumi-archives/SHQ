Sooo...<br/>

Phil, will Sano ever be more than a brown-eyed puppy waiting at home<br/>
for his master?  I mean really your brand of yaoi is sooo adorable :)<br/>
<br/>
Why am I not surprised that you managed to tie in this story with Sagara?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271345271">Can Sano ever be anything more than a sweet, adorable, brown-eyed puppy sitting around waiting for his master to come home???  Is he really qualified to do anything else?  ;-D<br/>
 <br/>
I'm probably half way through the first chapter of "Yasou."  Farstrider helped me a lot with... you're not going to believe this after my previous messages about writing... STRUCTURE, so I have a much better idea of what to do with it.  Actually, the structure has more to do with just how to get the story told rather than content.  Exactly what will happen is still open to thought (and where *they* decide to go with it).   I've been amazed that my mood and focus have been stabilizing quicker than I ever dreamed and I'm starting to get the urge to get back to writing... finally.  So maybe I'll try to finish that chapter tonight.  I can't think of anything better... a late night with my favorite crazies.  I'll give it a try at any rate.<br/>
 <br/>
I'm about ready to start labeling my stories SaitouxSanoxSagara.  Because I love dealing with angst and so much of Sano's angst stems from his good and bad experiences surrounding Sagara, I can't seem to leave poor Souzou alone.  There are interesting comparisons (in similarities and differences) between Saitou and Sagara that play into how I see Sano being attracted to both men, especially to Saitou.  "Yasou" is a story I've wanted to explore for a long time... the idea that Souzou is actually Sano's father.<br/>
 <br/>
SaitouxSano yaoi can so easily go in so many directions... it's wonderful!  Both characters display so many possible facets to their personalities and potential types of relationships.  I seem to be stuck in the student/teacher, antagonistic comedy partners, mutual caring mode, but I've read some BDSM stories that knocked my socks off and were surprisingly believable... I tend not to like that genre.  Sometimes I wish I could get  more graphic because I do enjoy the sexual aspect... I just can't seem to go that far.  C'est la vie (or maybe c'est l'amour).  Maybe I should just be happy that I've got non-yaoi fans who are willing to read my yaoi.  I'm always kind of stunned when I hear from them. :-O  So I'll probably go on writing the adorable.  It's too much fun to stop.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the little shove to get back to it!!!<br/>
