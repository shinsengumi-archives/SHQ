<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607424517">Regular visitors of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumifics.com">http://www.shinsengumifics.com</a> who use Internet<br/>
Explorer should read an important announcement regarding the site's<br/>
security<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
Fujita Goro walks home with a big box.  He has a scowl on his face<br/>
because ~someone~ insists that he needs to work overtime to bring in<br/>
more money.  Unfortunately the only open security position aside from<br/>
his undercover work is a post at the Rokumeikan dance hall which will<br/>
have special Christmas dance for the barbarians...errr...foreigners<br/>
working in Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
As he entered his home's gate his niece Yamaguchi Yukiko staggers out<br/>
the front door gasping...<br/>
<br/>
Goro lifts his eyebrow, "Yukiko! Are you ill what's wrong?"<br/>
<br/>
Yukiko, turning blue, "C-c-can't breathe---corset suffocating me..."<br/>
his niece takes shallow breaths, pulls at the lace collar from her<br/>
throat and walks out of the Fujita residence in a fancy western dress.<br/>
<br/>
Goro steps inside the living room, careful to avoid stepping on the<br/>
measuring tape, scissors and pins on the wooden floor.  Goro "Tokio<br/>
why have you applied this corset torture to my niece?"<br/>
<br/>
Tokio "Everyone student at the Normal School needs to dress in western<br/>
clothing for special events---and you HAVE to wear a corset to enhance<br/>
one's figure---what is in the box?"<br/>
<br/>
Goro "clothing I must wear to work at the Rokumeikan--I don't<br/>
understand why barbarians where layers upon layers of clothing!"<br/>
<br/>
Tokio rummages through the box and helps him dress...<br/>
<br/>
Tokio "oh a perfect fit!  Wait right here, I made myself a dress at<br/>
the school's workshop from some odd and end scraps."<br/>
<br/>
Tokio comes out dressed nicely...<br/>
