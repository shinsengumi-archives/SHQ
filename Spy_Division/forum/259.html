<div id="ygrps-yiv-176613287">I just checked out the site (http://www.nfiction.net)... uh, it&#39;s almost completely patterned after ff.net --- unless they&#39;re connected to ff.net, I can hear screams of &quot;foul&quot; unless they change their layout and graphics.  I didn&#39;t go deeper and see what kind of rules they&#39;re forcing on authors, though.<br/>
 <br/>
I probably will not be archiving my stories there (or ff.net) because of my lack of control over format and presentation.  I meant to make a proper announcement with a new story or something, but from now on I&#39;m planning on keeping my fanfic on my own site --- http://philalexandros.tripod.com/wolf_in_the_coop .  Someone is currently helping me set up a guestbook so any comments/reviews can be posted there.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll be curious to hear any comments about nfiction if anyone here explores it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533951902">I got a message from them too a while back I registered and although <br/>
it&#39;s like ff.net you can&#39;t seem to upload very long chapters or fics <br/>
only part of a couple things came up correctly. Needless to say I <br/>
probably won&#39;t venture back there anytime soon.<br/>

It looks to me like their kinda like fanfiction.net, only they just started. <br/>
Heh. Hardly have anything in their directories. :p<br/>
<br/>
*shrugs* ^_^ I dunno how they found out about you though, I guess they sent <br/>
someone or something searching for authors and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
On the internet...nothing is ever save or secure, no matter how much someone <br/>
claims your info stays private.<br/>

get my address (it&#39;s obviously computer-generated --- I don&#39;t write as <br/>
