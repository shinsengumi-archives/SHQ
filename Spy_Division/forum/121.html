<h3>Something I forgot to mention...</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138729899">The idea of being a woman writing a man&#39;s point of view...<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, it isn&#39;t just men who seem like aliens... just being <br/>
human is enough.  ;-D  Amazingly, men are human.  They generally have <br/>
the same hopes & dreams, the same fears, the same basic needs of <br/>
being loved and secure... it simply often gets expressed differently, <br/>
partly because of biology and partly because of culture.  They live <br/>
with enormous pressure to be what society says they should be just <br/>
like women do. That those expectations are different is really <br/>
irrelevent --- think in terms of the kinds of stresses, the hurts, <br/>
the insults, the frustration, the wishing it could be otherwise that <br/>
you as a woman encounter when you try to do something that goes <br/>
against what is generally expected or assumed about women <br/>
culturally.  If for some very rare reason you&#39;ve never encountered <br/>
that, think of what women who were (and are) fighting for women&#39;s <br/>
rights have gone through.  Men have faced the same prejudices and <br/>
pains.  To feel & need is *human*... to want love, have children, the <br/>
need to cry, et al. is all human.  Don&#39;t get too hung up on specifics <br/>
of gender and try to concentrate on the universal that speaks to the <br/>
condition of being human.  After years of studying male bonding and <br/>
intergenerational relationships (starting back in the &#39;70&#39;s with Kirk <br/>
and Spock from Star Trek), honestly, there&#39;s precious little that <br/>
makes us different.<br/>
<br/>
Do some research if you feel uneasy about how to handle writing a <br/>
man&#39;s perspective.  Read stories or novels that center on men <br/>
interacting that touches on emotions and expression. Another source <br/>
is men&#39;s magazines, where issues are addressed. Films and television <br/>
shows that explore men and their feelings abound.  I just finished <br/>
watching the latest episode of a BBC drama called &quot;Take Me,&quot; which is <br/>
what reminded me I&#39;d forgotten to touch on this subject.  In the end, <br/>
after years of denying himself any intimacy with his father, the lead <br/>
character finally accepts how much he loves his father... how much <br/>
the man means to him... and finally reaches out and just holds him <br/>
close, eventually listening in his head to the music you get the <br/>
impression his father always listened to and slow-dancing with him on <br/>
the sidewalk.  It was so beautiful, so real, and so human.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been touched at the stories of Hijikata being a demon <br/>
publically and, privately, alone at night, crying.  My sense is that <br/>
Saitou was the same way.  I can understand that... can relate to it.  <br/>
Both expressions are a survival tactic... a way of staying sane... of <br/>
remaining in control.  By the same token, look at the raging emotions <br/>
and fits of crying in samurai movies that ignite at the first sign of <br/>
distress.  Men, women... it&#39;s all the same.  Some are stoic, some are <br/>
overly emotional.  I wouldn&#39;t worry whether or not you&#39;re trying to <br/>
think in terms of a character being &quot;a man,&quot; but in terms of that <br/>
character&#39;s personality... are you staying true to *that* as opposed <br/>
to gender.<br/>
<br/>
And if this doesn&#39;t touch at all what you were getting at, <br/>
sorry...  :-D  I easily misunderstand intent behind broad questions <br/>
(no pun intended).<br/>
<br/>
phil (who doesn&#39;t think she knows how to write about women after 30 <br/>
years of writing about men, though admittedly, slash/yaoi opens whole <br/>
new cans of worms...)<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Try reading some Yukio Mishima.  He does a lot of delving into <br/>
men&#39;s psyches... sometimes to the point I want to scream &quot;just get on <br/>
with the story!&quot;  (Thinking of &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot; and &quot;Forbidden <br/>
Colors,&quot; which I&#39;m currently reading, but psychological exploration <br/>
seems to be one of his hallmarks in all his fiction... and he&#39;s <br/>
writing from a Japanese perspective, though again, it&#39;s actually <br/>
universal.)</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019158164">Hi,<br/>
Just on the men&#39;s psyche subject, I&#39;d like to ad my two cents.<br/>
Like Phil says, they are not aliens, and they are human exactly like women.  But they feel, think and act differently from women. Culture indeed has a lot to do with it,but the most important differences are strictly biological. They have a way to approach things that it&#39;s just... different.Not better, not worse, merely different.<br/>
If it helps of some consolation, they are at loss with us too.<br/>
Phil&#39;s advice about reading books or magazines made by men from a masculine POV is an excellent suggestion. And certainly her choice of Mishima is very appropriate in this context.<br/>
Concerning characterizations and what MissBehavin says of getting someone else&#39;s POV when you are in doubt about it and how it fit in your story, she hits right in the nail. This is also a very helpful tip, indeed. <br/>
As much as it was said about getting a thorough beta reader, and if you can get more than one at once, even better because you can make cross references in many points, and have the perception of the general reader most of the times, which helps in clarify some points that while can be perfectly clear to you, might be more than obscure for the reader. (remember: you know the plot beforehand, and all those little details that might lay in the background, unseen for the common eye).<br/>
About editing, each one has his or her method. Personally, I do a very little editing while writing. Then I simply let it rest. After at least a couple of days, I go again through it, and while I read, make the first major changes (repeated words, wrong wording, etc). Then, I let it rest again. I go through it again, and then I sent it to my beta readers (who, btw, usually go along the whole process from the initial version of each scene, and make the suggestions while I&#39;m writing the first draft). When they return it, I do the second serious &#39;cleaning&#39; , I revise all the extra suggestions, and discuss them with my beta. and if everything is ok, then I post. If not, I re-write the parts in question, and re send to the beta. at the end of the day, I can tell you the chapter by heart, with every comma and question mark.<br/>
Something I forgot, but phil&#39;s comment reminded me: as inspiration strikes in the more whimsical ways and moments, when a scene comes to you, write it. No matter it will be part of chapter 22 and you have just started the prologue.Later, when the story progresses, you surely will have to do rewriting to make it fit, and  also, to write the (damn) bridges to unite these  loose chunks you&#39;ve been writing. Did I mention that I HATE bridges, I am severely allergic to bridges and I abhor bridges? Well, now you know. Hehehe... In brief, sometimes, those  so called bridges between scenes or chunks can be real PITA.<br/>
Take care<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378612391">Thank you everyone for replying to my question.  All of you<br/>
understood...and gave very helpful advice.  I even learned something<br/>
new.  Men=humans.  Anime men=gods.  I got that straight<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Try reading some Yukio Mishima. He does a lot of delving into<br/>
men&#39;s psyches... sometimes to the point I want to scream &quot;just get on<br/>
with the story!&quot; (Thinking of &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot; and &quot;Forbidden<br/>

seems to be one of his hallmarks in all his fiction... and he&#39;s<br/>
writing from a Japanese perspective, though again, it&#39;s actually<br/>
universal.)<br/>
<br/>
completely OT...<br/>
<br/>
Mishima was a pretty *interesting* guy.<br/>
I happen to be reading THE TEMPLE OF THE DAWN (isbn 0394466144) right<br/>
now because it centers on a character&#39;s rebirth in Thailand (a country<br/>
I am studying)<br/>
<br/>
I would like to call attention to a lengthy passage in The<br/>
Temple...pages 169-174 which deals with the &quot;Land of the Pomegranate&quot;<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; Miss B! (symbolism of this fruit is interesting here)<br/>
<br/>
[scary quotes from The Land of the Pomegranate passages...]<br/>
<br/>
page 170 &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s true brotherly love to terminate life<br/>
while beautiful people are still young?&quot;<br/>
Think Mishima&#39;s life o_O<br/>
<br/>
page 171 &quot;...there are only two roles for humans in this world: those<br/>
who remember and those who are remembered.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about the commercialized revival of the Shinsengumi and<br/>
the reexamination of the group by historians (by the way there are<br/>
many talks/lectures going on around Japan this year at museums etc<br/>
some are held at Shinsengumi club chapters too)<br/>
<br/>
page 172 &quot;The basic concept is memory, and in a manner of speaking,<br/>
memory is national policy&quot;<br/>
The Land of the Pomegranates talks about beautiful and ugly people<br/>
(who worship the beautiful)...the worshippers remember the beautiful<br/>
people and the imaginative land is propelled by memory.  I&#39;m thinking<br/>
about historical figures which are constantly resurrected/reincarnated<br/>
(Mishima talks about this too) would fit in the category of the<br/>
&quot;beautiful&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***anyways the passages talks about errrr some very adult stuff so I&#39;m<br/>
keeping it rated G but yeah Mishima has amazing insight into the human<br/>
psyche</div>
