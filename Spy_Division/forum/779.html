<h3>WHEN THE FOG CLEARS (Rated-R Doujinshi Translated) Yamazaki Susumu + Okita</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034076019">notice I typed (Yamazaki Susumu + Okita)<br/>
not<br/>
Yamazaki X Okita<br/>
(too bad yaoi fans!)<br/>
<br/>
this is a serious drama doujinshi rated - R for graphic violence<br/>
I didn't translate to the part where there is serious violence yet I stopped <br/>
on page 11 and will finish later<br/>
<br/>
the art is beautiful and yes there are other Shinsengumi (though not <br/>
labelled---we just need a list of names of guys who went with Okita to <br/>
recruit in Osaka---off the top of my head I know Saitou Hijikata and Itou <br/>
did travel to recruit in Osaka--you see them in this manga all shivering in <br/>
their blankets...)<br/>
<br/>
The zip file will explain where this story came from just read the "Info" file<br/>
I also explain why I can't figure out the orginal Japanese title for it<br/>
<br/>
I had to color each speaking part<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu (blue)<br/>
Okita (orange)<br/>
baddies (red)<br/>
extras (black)<br/>
and there are supporting charas of the girl and her mother<br/>
<br/>
if someone has seen this doujinshi translated already please let me know <br/>
so I can stop (it is stime consuming because I have to sit there and erase <br/>
the words with photo shop) ... tiring!...<br/>
<br/>
oh and incidentally...many of us know of how Okita has a "flat fish face" <br/>
and we don't know what that means...<br/>
this is a (possible) explanation<br/>
this story tells that Okita's ***favorite food is<br/>
"rice with eel face" (literal translation)<br/>
or<br/>
"eel over rice" (smooth translation)<br/>
perhaps that association of "fish" and "face" got corrupted and became a <br/>
description of him?  I dunno...but it is in the Thai<br/>
