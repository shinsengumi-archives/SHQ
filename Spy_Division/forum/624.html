<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245217712">You can do most of the major ones in and around Kyoto in about a day, I <br/>
would estimate. The Maekawa residence (Maekawa-tei), the Yagi residence <br/>
(Yagi-tei), Aizu headquarters (Konkaikomyo-ji/Kurotani), Nijo Castle <br/>
(Nijo-jo), Imperial Palace (Kyoto Gosho), Koudai Temple (Koudai-ji), &quot;Ruins&quot; <br/>
of Fushimi Shinsengumi HQ (Fushimi-bugyosho ato).<br/>
<br/>
There are other sites, but the easiest and cheapest thing to do (if you <br/>
don&#39;t have the money to pay for train trips to Hiroshima and <br/>
Aizu/Tokyo/Hakodate/Sendai, where the other major sites are) is to stick to <br/>
Kyoto.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One day is more than enough to see most or all the<br/>
Shinsengumi-related sites. Most of them are in Mibu<br/>
and within walking distance from one to another. Just<br/>
take the bus to Mibu and ask for directions there, if<br/>
needed :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The Maekawa residence (Maekawa-tei),<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just reminding that you can&#39;t enter the residence<br/>
(after all, there are people living there!), but you<br/>
can give a look at the front entrance and buy a<br/>
blueprint of the house.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the Yagi residence <br/>
&gt; (Yagi-tei), <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can visit (enter) this. The Yagi residence, the<br/>
Maekawa residence, the Shintoku-ji temple (where<br/>
Kiyokawa Hachiro stayed) and the Mibu Temple are next<br/>
to each other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Aizu headquarters<br/>
&gt; (Konkaikomyo-ji/Kurotani), Nijo Castle <br/>
&gt; (Nijo-jo), Imperial Palace (Kyoto Gosho), Koudai<br/>
&gt; Temple (Koudai-ji), &quot;Ruins&quot; <br/>
&gt; of Fushimi Shinsengumi HQ (Fushimi-bugyosho ato).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a stone marking the place where Ikeda-ya was<br/>
located, but it&#39;s a bit hard to find. You can visit<br/>
Sumiya as well. While in Mibu, don&#39;t forget to visit<br/>
the Mibu temple, where most of the Shinsengumi related<br/>
tombstones are.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are other sites, but the easiest and cheapest<br/>

&gt; sites are) is to stick to <br/>
&gt; Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. And besides, it&#39;s a pretty place to go :) Buy<br/>
a 1-day bus token, which will allow you to ride all<br/>
busses in Kyoto and enjoy! :)<br/>
