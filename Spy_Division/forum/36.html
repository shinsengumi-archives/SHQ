<h3>Upload of SaiSa stories to Fiction Archive under Files</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338033615">I&#39;ve uploaded all of my completed stories to the yahoo site (and Barb <br/>
has already started transfering story files to the SHQ website).  If <br/>
you&#39;re interested, I have three stories in progress available at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/~philalexandros">http://www.fanfiction.net/~philalexandros</a> .<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kitaku&quot; (rated R) follows two timelines:  15 years after Sano has to <br/>
leave Japan (post OAV &quot;Reflections&quot;) and flashbacks to 1878/79.  <br/>
Saitou finds the mature Sano on the mainland and they begin a new <br/>
phase in their association.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oujougiwa no Seizonsha&quot; (rated R) should probably be &quot;Seizonsha no <br/>
Oujougiwa&quot; (only our resident Japanese translator knows for <br/>
sure... ).  Anyway, it&#39;s a rough one with Saitou having to bring Sano <br/>
through opium withdrawal when the ahou decides he&#39;s had enough of <br/>
living in the Meiji Era.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;Yasou&quot; (rated R), which I posted the intro to here on the list.  <br/>
I got part of Chapter One written before we began this expansion <br/>
project for miburo and I haven&#39;t been able to touch it since.  I&#39;ll <br/>
continue to post installments of this story on the list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very much RK and SaiSa obsessed, so that&#39;s likely the most you&#39;ll <br/>
see from me... though Barb&#39;s still trying her best to talk me into a <br/>
SaitouxTokio story.  I&#39;m about to be introduced to PMK... who knows <br/>
where my yaoi tendencies will lead me there.  And most have you have <br/>
probably already been introduced to these stories.  I&#39;m just making <br/>
them available here (and the website) for the future.  This is <br/>
Shinsengumi Headquarters, after all.<br/>
<br/>
Masayoshi&#39;s already regaling us with art in the Photos section.  <br/>
Yeah!  The rest of you --- get those fingers saving files to htm/html <br/>
(just *what* is the difference between htm and html... one text, one <br/>
images??) and upload those babies!<br/>
