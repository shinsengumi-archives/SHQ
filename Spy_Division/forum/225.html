<h3>Sharing info etc (x-post)</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241442696">No one asked but I&#39;ll toss out my opinion on this and that.  I loved the <br/>
Miburo list and love the SHQ lists because we&#39;re all more than a bit <br/>
obsessed with finding out the truth behind the men of RK, PMK and the like.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always had the feeling that what&#39;s been contributed was done so in <br/>
the spirit of sharing with like minded souls. And to me that sharing <br/>
includes using any facts gathered as a source for our fictional and <br/>
artistic endeavors.<br/>
<br/>
On the lists it&#39;s between us members but anything I transfer to the <br/>
website is open to all much like Serizawa&#39;s site or that of Christopher <br/>
Mayo.  As far as crediting where the info/inspiration originally came <br/>
from in a fanfic I wouldn&#39;t be stressed if someone used something I came <br/>
across in an obscure book or whatever  and didn&#39;t credit me.<br/>
<br/>
However if they used it for an original project and made money off it <br/>
then it would be a definite courtesy to thank the sources but even then <br/>
it&#39;s just a courtesy and you can&#39;t enforce it in an way unless a word <br/>
for word copying is passed off as original work.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe we need to add a blurb to the Yahoogroup page stating that <br/>
information shared is for the benefit of all the listers to use as <br/>
inspiration or background for any creative endeavors?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, while I try to remember to check in and ask if essays or <br/>
whatever can be used on the website (I do make certain to credit written <br/>
reports) there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll forget to contact you for permission to <br/>
post ahead of time   so if you don&#39;t want this info you&#39;ve shared made <br/>
public in anyway then perhaps you can make this known upfront.<br/>
