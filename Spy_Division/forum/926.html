<h3>Okita Art</h3>

the drawing is inspired by a Shinsengumi doll I received for Christmas <br/>
and while the face is so sweet like how Okita is often portrayed in <br/>
modern fiction I looked closely and saw that the figure has Kondo's crest!<br/>
I was looking down on the doll as I was drawing and so there is an <br/>
abstract feel to the work and I liked the details of the hair, which really <br/>
was that long on the doll (^_^).<br/>
<br/>
Played around with the cell phone:<br/>

<br/>
I have some ideas on filming the doll but I'm trying to figure out a few <br/>
things...<br/>

P.S. the site's new wordpress design is functioning: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumihq.com">http://www.shinsengumihq.com</a><br/>
(Thanks, Alohaworld.com)<br/>
<br/>
gradual restoration of the site progress report can be followed here:<br/>

<br/>
what I do is make a list of all the things I need to finish and upload <br/>
several pages at once so please bear with me---my day schedule is <br/>
really hectic and I design arts/crafts projects for an elementary school at <br/>
night so I've been busy (-_-) and I'm doing this using a free html editor <br/>
(not Dreamweaver) while testing it on wordpress so it's been fun...<br/>
<br/>
fanart and links to vids you created can still be sent here:<br/>
secretarytocapt3(at)hotmail.com<br/>
when you work is online I'll inform you ASAP</div>

Yes it looks like a moustache but it's his lips---just stylized---the<br/>
doll's lips look like this:<br/>

In 1868 one Aizu girl recalled that her sister desired to go forth and<br/>
fight the enemy so she prepared herself and in the process drew her<br/>
lips with down-turned corners perhaps to adopt a more fierce/grim<br/>
"look" as well.<br/>
