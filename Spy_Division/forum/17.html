<h3>There&#39;s always one more thing...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936720645">Thanks to Barb mentioning something about keeping text and image <br/>
files separate on the SHQ site, I realized I'd made a fatal error... <br/>
nothing new, I do it all the time.  I had image folders in the files <br/>
section and she's absolutely right about wanting to keep them <br/>
independent.  SOOOO...  In the photos section you will find various <br/>
albums all sitting clean and new and ready to take images.  Just so <br/>
we can find things, the albums are:<br/>
<br/>
Doujinshi scans --- images from doujinshi published by non-members <br/>
you find delightful or inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
Doujinshi Originals --- doujinshi created by members of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Manga Scans --- same as for doujinshi, but for manga.<br/>
<br/>
Manga Originals --- manga created by members.<br/>
<br/>
Illustrations --- scans of illustrations or calligraphy from books<br/>
<br/>
Screencaps --- captures from the various anime, films, and other <br/>
moving picture formats.<br/>
<br/>
Single Originals --- the one-shots of the art world, pictures created <br/>
by members that are meant to stand alone.<br/>
<br/>
Am I leaving out any other formats?<br/>
<br/>
If you have a group of images (posting up an original manga or <br/>
doujinshi, for instance, would be in several separate uploads), <br/>
create an album within the album it belongs in, giving your album the <br/>
title of the piece.<br/>
<br/>
In the next few days, the guidelines will change again... this time <br/>
oriented towards art.  For now, I'm going to try to leave you guys <br/>
alone, stop bugging you.  :-)<br/>
