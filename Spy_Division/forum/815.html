<h3>How to know you have tolerant friends</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134024737">Even though, they couldn't care less about the Shinsengumi:<br/>
<br/>
they decide the opalite (iridescent blue/green) mala just ins't close<br/>
enough and make you ANOTHER mala closer matching the asagiiro out of<br/>
turqouise.<br/>
<br/>
one of them buys asagiiro tuperware for the weekly feeding of the dead<br/>
 ancestor ceremonie.<br/>
<br/>
they take pictures of arbitrary vehicles because theya are asagiiro.<br/>
<br/>
They can recognise every depiction of tv/anime and american released<br/>
manga versions of the commander/vice commanders and cpts.<br/>
<br/>
Your friends declare 9pm sacred fundoshi washing/ kirtan singing time.<br/>
To be observed EVERYDAY.<br/>
<br/>
One of them beeds you the shinsengumi flag on her loom.<br/>
<br/>
They understand what you mean when you say vol 7 of Rurouni Kenshin is<br/>
the actually beginning of the manga and why.<br/>
<br/>
They think Rurouni Kenshin Anime starts with epp 28.<br/>
<br/>
They watched the tv show with you (whial beeding the banner)<br/>
<br/>
They too think epp 15 of PMK is the funniest thing they have ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
They specifically request you write at least two fan fictions and beg<br/>
you to put Saitou-san in positions where he looses his bad ass<br/>
composure and actually enjoy the silly stories you make up.<br/>
<br/>
the one who is taking a college course in Asian History plans a<br/>
hostile takeover for the first day of Japanese history and will refuse<br/>
to discuss anything  but the shinsengumi for the entirety of the class.<br/>
<br/>
Two of you wear a bendi  of asagirro and the other wears a sari of the<br/>
same color... and you didnt plan it.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the above... I made them dinner of stickey rice balls,<br/>
seaweed/veggies and a cake this weekend... (while making them watch<br/>
the tv show again)</div>
