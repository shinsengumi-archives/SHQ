<h3>FIC PREVIEW: Rokugatsu no Yume</h3>
by <i>shimazuryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-127402908">A preview scene from "Rokugatsu no Yume" (A Dream of the Sixth Moon),<br/>
the fic I'm going to write and release on the anniversary of Ikedaya--<br/>
July 6th (by our calendar, not the old Imperial calendar):<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Harada leaned on his spear, exasperated by the wait. Turning to Okita,<br/>
he grinned nervously.<br/>
<br/>
"Neh, Okita-kun, did you remember to wash your fundoshi?"<br/>
<br/>
"H-Harada-san?!"<br/>
<br/>
Harada suddenly felt a stealthy tapping on his shoulder. Turning<br/>
around he saw Saitou, making final adjustments to his armor<br/>
chestplate. "I've made sure to wash mine, Harada-kun. Very well, I<br/>
might add."<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Just a little something to look forward to ^_^<br/>

You are going to start a fire here! The numerous fudonshi addicts <br/>
that we have (ummm... I try not to be but... umm...) will be all <br/>
over you. Good luck on the fic and I can't wait to read it!<br/>
<br/>
~wounds<br/>
<br/>
p.s. are fudonshi's white or red? are there other colors?</div>

orange-red as well as white</div>

I will see them soon Barb... I was privee only to the red one which <br/>
Kondou wore in NHK... Maybe that's why I like Kondou so much in <br/>
NHK...</div>
