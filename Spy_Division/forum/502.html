again to get the metal effect I&#39;d have to sit there with a pencil <br/>
and sketch everything in but since I didn&#39;t have time I just <br/>
outlined the concept design with marker so it looks more gaudy than <br/>
I had intended.  It was inspired by two different models of the <br/>
Honda motorcycle.<br/>
<br/>
now your wondering...&quot;huh?&quot; makes no sense at all...<br/>

I give you the Matsudaira-Benz (^_^)<br/>
okay, again use your imagination...it is entirely black with dark <br/>
deep blue bullet proof tinted windows.  I like the Mercedes <br/>
headlights but I decided to put them in a frame which reminds you of <br/>
cat&#39;s eyes.  The grill has the shogunate crest.<br/>
Just imagine it drawn by a professional...remember this car is sooo <br/>
darn sexy that it is beloved by Matsudaira Katamori and his chaffeur <br/>
Saitou Hajime.  Ofcourse when Matsudaira is out of town, the <br/>
Shinsengumi&#39;s vice chief may &quot;borrow&quot; it without permission.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata &quot;SAitou you&#39;re going to have to take the blame for something-<br/>
-&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Saitou &quot;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata &quot;you&#39;ll know in a second&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Matsudaira K. &quot;okay, someone has been using my car because I found -<br/>
this- in the backseat&quot; (holds up female undergarment)<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata elbows SAitou<br/>
<br/>
Saitou (throws himself on the floor) &quot;Please forgive me my lord it <br/>
was me I&#39;m soo soo sorry&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Matsudaira K. &quot;Why Saitou, I never knew you would stoop to such <br/>
behavior!&quot;</div>
