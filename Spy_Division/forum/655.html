<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060637991">Samurai of the Shinsengumi<br/>
Meiji era Rounin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	In the 4th year of Meiji the samurai were considered to be <br/>
no more. Few where able to continue with the only way they know of <br/>
how to live but in a state of hiding, unable to fulfill their Samurai <br/>
Duties. Few, however former Mibu Wolves in the days of the Shogunate <br/>
where still amongst the world of modernization. Saito Hajime, now <br/>
going by the name Fujita Goro, he patrols the city of Tokyo's streets <br/>
as a one of the sword-baring policemen. He is known for the Tennen-<br/>
Rishen Gatotsu stance and is known to be equally powerful to the now <br/>
deceased Souji Okita, former Captain of the 1st Shinsengumi Unit. <br/>
Saito was the former 3ed Unit Captain. One of his specialties was his <br/>
so said ability to see beyond the normal human eye. He was able to <br/>
see spirits and even speak with them, seeing those who haunt others <br/>
and those who are unable to rest in peace. Other survivors, such as <br/>
the 2nd and 10th unit captains Shinpatchi Nagakura and Sanosuke <br/>
Harada, where trying there best to coup up and live with the new <br/>
Mejia Modernization days. Sanosuke was known for his ways with a <br/>
spear, being rather horrid at sword fighting. He was a master of <br/>
Taneda Style Spear-Fighting. But this story is about two samurai who <br/>
where only recruits of the Shinsengumi in the Bakumatsu war. They are <br/>
Taika Noezoe and Fujiwara Makoto. They continue to strive as Samurai <br/>
in the name of the Shinsengumi. They still patrol the roads of Kyoto <br/>
and live as if it where still the "good old days". Here is their <br/>
story, about the revival of the Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hey. Taiki wake up." Eye opening, Taiki Noezoe wakes to see his <br/>
partner Fujiwara kneeling down beside him. "Hm. Fujiwara. Is it <br/>
midnight?" "Yes brother, it is. Its time now so get off your ass and <br/>
lets go." Taiki stumbled from his small bed. Fujiwara was standing <br/>
next to him. He was wearing his blue white uniform with the "Faith" <br/>
symbol on the back in white. The body of the uniform was a darkish <br/>
blue and on the bottom of the sleeves where white spick like patterns <br/>
running upward. He wore a black fishnet shirt with his dark black <br/>
kimono. Fujiwara walked to the closet of their small one roomed home. <br/>
He slid open the door and took out Taiki's matching uniform and his <br/>
light gray kimono. Taiki walked up to Fujiwara who then took in hand <br/>
his clothing then quickly slide on his dressage. Fujiwara then went <br/>
up to his sword rack that was sitting on the floor next to his <br/>
bedding. He lowered and lifted up his black and red sheathed katana <br/>
as well as the matching wakizashi. He tied them to his belt then <br/>
stood there, ready for there upcoming night. Taiki as well went to <br/>
his sword stand and took in hand and tied to his belt his sword set. <br/>
Taiki looked up at Fujiwara and gave a slight smile. "Well Fuji, you <br/>
ready?" "Heh always am, brother." Taiki nodded then walked to the <br/>
door and slowly slid it open then peeked out into the dark night. <br/>
Small faint lights lit the sides of the street showing a few people <br/>
sitting here and there on a corner. Taiki and Fuji then quickly <br/>
rushed out into the night, quickly running into a dark alley for <br/>
cover. Taiki went farther into the alley while Fuji stayed at the <br/>
opening of the alley peeking out into the open. Fuji then rushed out <br/>
of the alley up to another alley with Taiki right behind him. Taiki <br/>
then took watch. He saw in the distance four men walking down the <br/>
street, all four wearing blue uniforms and dress blue jean pants, <br/>
symbolizing them to be a local police brigade on patrol. "Hey Fuji, <br/>
wanna test out our blades on these simpletons?" "Heh. Taiki, you <br/>
don't want to stain your sword with government pigs blood now do <br/>
you?" He said giving a small laugh showing sarcasm. Taiki gave a <br/>
small laugh as well as he unsheathed his blade. "Lets get em bro!" <br/>
Fujiwara drew his blade as well. They both waited for their moment of <br/>
attack. The men walked until they came to one of the few houses that <br/>
where still light inside. They simply walked in. "Huh what in the <br/>
world? Hey Fuji, they went into that local home. You think there <br/>
suppose to be there?" "Don't know but lets go crash their little walk <br/>
in and go see what their up to." They both ran swiftly to the edge of <br/>
the house. Fujiwara peeked into a window that had barely enough eye <br/>
peeking room. In there he was able to see three of the police and <br/>
part of one other person but he was unidentifiable. "Okay, on my <br/>
count. 1. 2. 3 NOW!" Taiki rushed into the door followed right <br/>
next to Fuji. As they entered they both quickly took out one of the <br/>
policemen as if they wanted to fight fairly with the others. "What in <br/>
the hell?!?!?  HEY?! Who the hell are you?" The other two policemen <br/>
drew their sabers. The other man drew a katana. "How dare you jump <br/>
into my home and kill a government official. Wait a second." The man <br/>
stared at Fuji and Taiki then went into slight shock. "SHINSENGUMI?! <br/>
DAMN YOU SHOGUNATE DOGS YOUR ALL SUPOSE TO BE DEAD!" Fuji smiled <br/>
demonically. "Yeah, I guess we are suppose to be dead. Maybe we ARE <br/>
dead. He he he." Taiki laughed with him. The police then charged the <br/>
two, their sabers up. "Wow, thinking they can overcome us with wimpy <br/>
sabers." Fuji quickly went into Tennen-Reshen stance, lifting the <br/>
blade up into the policemen, their blades striking. Taiki dodged the <br/>
policemen's attack then glanced around. He saw a spear hanging above <br/>
the fireplace and went for it, grasping it in hand then pulling it <br/>
down. "I'm not to hot with a sword so I'll just use this for now. He <br/>
then lunged at his enemy police officer, pulling off a move that made <br/>
the policeman's saber fling out of his hands and into the wall. Taiki <br/>
then jabbed the blade of the spear into the gut of his enemy and <br/>
claimed the officer's death as his victory. "Hah hah. That's what I'm <br/>
talking about!" Fuji was messing with his enemy. He continued <br/>
blocking wimpy attacks while taunting the police. "Come on man. <br/>
Aren't you government pigs suppose to be great fighters. So kill me <br/>
already." "Damn it. Shut your face and die!" Fuji lunged backward <br/>
from the officer's supposedly strongest jabbing attack. "Wow, you're <br/>
starting to really bore me. Guess I'll just finish you off right <br/>
NOW!" Fuji quickly got into Gatotsu stance and struck at the officer, <br/>
his blade sliding right through his chest, another death. The other <br/>
man, owner of the house, stared at the two now seen as <br/>
murderers. "Damn you. Why the hell did you kill them?" "Well, where <br/>
big time Mejia Government haters. So where going to end the terror of <br/>
the ones who think modernization is what Japan needs." Fujiwara's <br/>
speech spread fear into the mind of the man, him being a Loyalist-<br/>
Exclusionist. The man quickly got into his sword stance. He looked to <br/>
be a master of Hokushin Single Sword Style, the same as the now dead <br/>
ex-vice-commander of the Shinsengumi, Kuisuke Yamanami. Fujiwara <br/>
stared at him in slight confusion. <br/>
"Vice Commander! Vice Commander Yamanami. Where is he?" <br/>
	"Oh, Fuji"<br/>
	"Master Okita? Where is Yamanami?"<br/>
	"He committed"<br/>
The attack was on. The man lunged at Fuji who was still in shock. The <br/>
blade was swung downward right above Fuji.  CLING!!!  Taiki was <br/>
standing right next to Fuji, the spear right above Fuji's head, <br/>
blocking the attack. "Damn it Fuji what's wrong with you?" "Huh WHAT <br/>
THE?!" Fuji stared up at the crossed blades. "He, sorry about that <br/>
Taiki." Fuji then took up his blade and lunged it into the neck of <br/>
the Loyalist. He then pulled it out, blood spewing everywhere. The <br/>
corpse fell backward onto the floor. Fujiwara's eye gleaming <br/>
demonically, he took out a small napkin and whipped the blood from <br/>
his blade. "Well then, we best be go" He was interrupted of the <br/>
sight of the fourth police officer staring at them from the back <br/>
room. The terrified officer ran for his life out the back door then <br/>
into the streets, heading back to the precinct. "Humph, guess we <br/>
missed one." Stated Taiki. "He, what a shame. Well we better continue <br/>
with our original plan." Fuji re-sheathed his blade then ran out the <br/>
front door, followed by the now spear using Taiki. They rushed down <br/>
the street, taking a right on the next road intersection. They ran <br/>
past Shimabara, the local whorehouse that was soon to be sold out by <br/>
the government. They past a few thrift shops then finally came to one <br/>
in particular, Masuya Thrift. "Damn shame this part of the city <br/>
wasn't burned to the ground." Taiki remarked. "Apparently so." They <br/>
busted down the boarded up door. The shop had close down because of <br/>
the death of Masuya. He had been hiding Choshu Loyalist in his shop <br/>
and they based there for a while till they attacked the city. Okita, <br/>
Koundo, Hijikata, Saito, Harada, Nagakura, and Todo where able to <br/>
infiltrate Masuya's shop and kill all who apposed. They began to <br/>
search the wreckage, Fujiwara taking upstairs and Taiki taking down. <br/>
Fujiwara found a few papers stacked on an end table in the back of <br/>
the main room. He lifted up the stack to see that they where nothing <br/>
but a bunch of sale papers. Taiki then came storming down the stairs. <br/>
In his hand was a small bag. "Hey Fuji check out what I found." He <br/>
opened up the small bag revealing almost 50 Ryo. "Check it out man. <br/>
Were gonna be fine for a while with this." bragging about his <br/>
discovery. Fuji glanced onto the ground. There next to the end table <br/>
was an abacus lying on its side.<br/>
<br/>
	"He committed Seppuku I killed him with my own hands."<br/>
	"But Mr. Okita why would you WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING <br/>
LIKE THAT?!"<br/>
	"Because Fuji because of the rules of the Shinsengumi."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Fuji dude are you all right?" Fuji looked back to his <br/>
friend. "Yeah.. I'm fine. Just remembering of things back before the <br/>
war." "Man don't think of such depressing things. It's not good for <br/>
you." "Well seems they refuse to get out of my mind." "Hm" Fuji sat <br/>
down as well as Taiki in front of him. "Well what WERE you <br/>
remembering." " When Yaminami" "Oh that I remember that." Vice <br/>
Commander Yaminami. Everyone befriended him. Unlike his fellow <br/>
partner Vice-Commander, Toshizo Hijikata, Keisuke Yaminami was a kind-<br/>
hearted man who never really seemed to get angry. One day though, he <br/>
was getting fed up with how Hijikata was treating him and how the <br/>
Shinsengumi seemed to be getting out of control. He abandoned the <br/>
Shinsengumi, but was caught by Souji Okita. He brought him back to <br/>
Shinsengumi headquarters. Their Koundo made it final that Yamanami <br/>
were to commit seppuku, Okita being his second. <br/>
Seppuku is when a samurai is in so much dishonor that he decides or <br/>
is forced to take a small blade into his stomach. The person called <br/>
the second, in this case, Souji Okita, then beheads him to relieve <br/>
him of the pain of his now sliced open gut. <br/>
<br/>
One, You must not stray from the samurai's code.<br/>
Two, Desertion is not permitted.<br/>
Three, You will not raise private funs without permission.<br/>
Four, You will not take up litigious matters without permission.<br/>
Five, Private conflicts are not permitted.<br/>
	Those who defy these articles shall be sentenced to commit <br/>
seppuku without fail.<br/>
<br/>
"Well did you find anything, Fuji?" Naw. Just some stupid sales <br/>
papers." "Oh. Well I guess we can head out now if theirs nothing else <br/>
here of use." Fujiwara and Taiki then stood up and walked to the <br/>
door. They walked out then began rushing back to their home. Once <br/>
there they disarmed then got back into bed. The sun was visible now <br/>
out from the window, slowly rising up to bring morning light.<br/>

Second part.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai of the Shinsengumi<br/>
Meiji era Rounin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	"Open up now!" A loud slam came from the door. Fujiwara's <br/>
eyes widened as he woke from the banging from outside. "Open now in <br/>
the name of the Meiji Police." Fuji looked over to Taiki. He was <br/>
awake as well. Fuji whispered, "Taiki, what are we to do?" <br/>
"Heh. Beats me. All I knows that we gotta get out of here and <br/>
fast." "Open up now or we will be forced to break down the <br/>
door." "Heh. You know Taiki these Meiji fools are wimpy. If we as <br/>
Shinsengumi where after someone locked in a home or room we would <br/>
have broken down the door without saying word." "Hah!" They then both <br/>
quickly got from their beds and ran for their uniforms and <br/>
swords. "Lets get going." They then snuck out the back of their door, <br/>
seeing in front that the police had just busted down the door. They <br/>
both started running to the west, Fujiwara in front.<br/>
<br/>
	"Hey Souji, do you think me and Taiki will get as strong as <br/>
you one day?"<br/>
	"Huh? Well of coarse you two will. I bet you two will be <br/>
stronger then me and even Mr. Hijikata."<br/>
	"Huh!? No way! That's imposable."<br/>
	"Heh heh. Nothings imposable Fuji."<br/>
<br/>
	"So, Fuji, where on hell we gonna be stationing at <br/>
now?" "Don't know to tell you the truth, but it can't be here in <br/>
Tokyo. If we stay here the police will surly catch up with us one of <br/>
these days." "Damn it! We shouldn't have let that one police get <br/>
away!" They continued going past many houses down the street. They <br/>
made sure not to stray onto the main road knowing there would be many <br/>
other police out looking for them. They would be a prime look out now <br/>
in Kyoto until captured. They would have to escape to another city, <br/>
but where?<br/>
<br/>
	They made their way to the out skirts of town after five <br/>
minutes of non-stop running. They came to a gate and collapsed next <br/>
to it. "Damn Taiki we haven't ran so damn fast in so damn <br/>
long." "Hah its not that its only that you are so out of <br/>
shape." "Hah hah really funny." Taiki stabbed his spear into the <br/>
ground and leaned on it. Fuji was leaning his back to the gate. "Well <br/>
we better keep going. Its lucky us that theirs no one watching over <br/>
this gate during the day." Fuji looked up at the sun. He could tell <br/>
from its position that it was around noontime. He pulled out his set <br/>
of prayer beads and wrapped them around his hand and began to pray. <br/>
Taiki looked at him and sighed. "Why on Earth do you still pray to <br/>
Buddha?" "Because its forever my second most important thing in <br/>
life." "Oh really. So tell me I'm the first most important thing is <br/>
that correct." " No." Taiki laughed. "Of coarse not. Samurai first <br/>
like same with me." "No, that's not entirely true." "Oh Fuji you <br/>
gotta be shit'n me. Don't tell me your still attached to your wife." <br/>
Fuji stayed in silence. While he and Taiki where living in a small <br/>
village outside of Kyoto for the time being two years ago, Fuji had a <br/>
wife who was killed during the 2ed year of Meiji. They where only <br/>
married for a year and bared a one and a half year old child. Both <br/>
his wife and his son where killed in a raid on their home after Fuji <br/>
was suspected for killing the local tax collector, which, of coarse, <br/>
was true. The tax collector was being ruthless and unjust. He was <br/>
taxing way more then reasonable and always had his way because he had <br/>
a group of bodyguard Ninjas. Fuji and Taiki both decided to take up <br/>
the sword, and spear in Taiki's case, and bring justice old fashion <br/>
style. Fuji and Taiki lived because they where out for the moment, <br/>
collecting food from the local farm. When they came back, they saw <br/>
the bodies of Megumi, his wife, and Shintada, his son.<br/>
<br/>
	"Fuji I was able to get over the death of my wife. How come <br/>
you cant?" "Because I refuse to. I know I will be with her again one <br/>
day." "Well yeah you will when you're dead!" Fuji glared at Taiki, <br/>
who was really starting to get on his nerves. Taiki's wife had died <br/>
earlier, in the 1st year of Meiji. She and him where married three <br/>
months before the war. They settled down in Mibu but shortly, Taiki <br/>
was called to battle with the 10th Unit. When the war was over, Taiki <br/>
came back to see that his wife, Toki, had died from a fatal case of <br/>
pneumonia. This brought him to a temporary insanity and he almost <br/>
killed Fuji but Fuji was able to get through to him after having a <br/>
spear in his side and a katana in Taiki's shoulder. <br/>
<br/>
	"Hey Taiki. You want to go to Mibu for a while?" "Hmm oh I <br/>
don't know." Fuji took his prayer beads and slide them back into a <br/>
pocket in the inside of his uniform. "Well we have to go somewhere, <br/>
and fast." "Well I don't really want to go back to Mibu. Don't want <br/>
any bad memories to get to me." "Well, why don't we go to Edo!" "HAH. <br/>
Are you crazy? Okay A its now named Tokyo and B it's the capital of <br/>
the Meiji government. Walking into the capital wearing Shinsengumi <br/>
uniforms with swords strapped to our hips is like intentionally <br/>
walking into the gates of hell." Fuji stared at Taiki with a blank <br/>
look. "You nimrod like anyone would know where there in the first <br/>
place." Taiki looked down at the ground. "Well what ever man. Its <br/>
your call." "Right then. We go to Tokyo. There, we can be two of the <br/>
very few Rounin there." "Yeah good luck with that." Taiki rolled his <br/>
eyes then took a firm hold of his spear then lifted it up out of the <br/>
ground. "Lets just get going now before we have more pansy's in blue <br/>
after us." Taiki slightly laughed at his own joke. Fuji stood back up <br/>
then began walking, Taiki following him. They where now on their way <br/>
to Tokyo, the capital of the Meiji Restoration, The Capital of modern <br/>
Japan.<br/>
<br/>
	"Mr. Harada!"<br/>
	"Oh! Hey they're Taiki. What's up?"<br/>
	"Nothing much. Hey could me and you spar?"<br/>
	"What! Are you serious? You want to spar with me spear <br/>
against sword?"<br/>
	"Heck no! Spear against spear"<br/>
	"Hey now that's more like it. So you wanna be a spear fighter <br/>
like me hm?"<br/>
	"Of coarse I do. You're the coolest guy here."<br/>
	"Shucks, really. Your to kind just so to kind."<br/>
	"Mr. Harada stop being so boosting and fight me!"<br/>
	"Alright dude, simmer down. Ready?  FIGHT!"<br/>
<br/>
	Taiki looked up at the sky then at his spear. He smiled at it <br/>
knowing he was king of all spear fighters in Japan, of coarse right <br/>
next to Sanosuke Harada. "Hey Taiki, you remember where Sanosuke went <br/>
to after the war?" "Beats me. All I know is he's settled down with a <br/>
wife somewhere with Shinpatchi living with him." "Heh, you could <br/>
never get those two jokers apart could you." Nope not at all." Taiki <br/>
stretched backward. He then gazed at his spear yet again. It was a <br/>
very nice and from the looks of it a very expensive piece of <br/>
weaponry. It had a smooth polished wood shaft and a sharp cross blade <br/>
at the top. There was a blue strap wrapped around the end and the <br/>
middle of the red colored shaft to allow a good grip. "Wonder how <br/>
much the poor bastard spent on this fine spear. Well too bad for him <br/>
cuz I have it." "That and he's dead so to sad for him as well." "Heh <br/>
heh. Of coarse." They where now coming up to a intersection of the <br/>
path. In one direction you could see that it lead to a sea road and <br/>
in the other direction it lead to Mibu. There was a sign that said <br/>
Mibu right and Tokyo left. "Well I guess where taking left eh <br/>
Fuji?" "That's right." Fuji turned left, Taiki of coarse right behind <br/>
him. Taiki looked backward to get a last glimpse at the once long <br/>
time home of his, Kyoto then looked down the path to Mibu.<br/>
<br/>
	"Well Taiki, where at the intersection. One way goes to Mibu <br/>
village and the other to the capital, Kyoto. Where are we to go?"<br/>
	"I say we go to the capital. I bet we could find a great <br/>
opportunity to make so real cold hard ryo."<br/>
	"That's true, so very true. Well Kyoto, make way cuz here <br/>
comes the two greatest samurai in the land."<br/>
<br/>
	<br/>
<br/>

End <br/>
