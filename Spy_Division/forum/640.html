<h3>A Shinsengumi Fiction Site</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044119121">Alright! Thank you to Phil, Barb, M and Sec for their input and <br/>
encouragement in this project. I had Safety write up a little <br/>
something, a more formal introduction to the Fic site (see below)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumifics.com/">http://www.shinsengumifics.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Courtesy of Safety:<br/>
<br/>
After some hard work we're pleased to announce that Shinsengumifics <br/>
is now active and ready to go!<br/>
 <br/>
Shinsengumifics.com is an original and fan fiction achive in the <br/>
model of other archive sites such as fanfiction.net where authors <br/>
can upload and edit stories but unlike ff.net it allows for more <br/>
than just Rurouni Kenshin and Peacemaker Kurogane-based stories.  <br/>
Any Shensengumi universe - RK to the NHK drama, Kaze Hikaru to pure <br/>
historical - is open for all authors to unleash their creativity and <br/>
tell some great stories about the Shinsengumi.  <br/>
 <br/>
So come by, register and add your stories!  Or come by and read and <br/>
offer comments/encouragement to other fic writers - like ff.net <br/>
there is a capacity to submit and recieve reviews but unlike ff.net <br/>
you may add images (limited).  We look forward to seeing you there.<br/>
<br/>
--------<br/>
<br/>
Try it out. Since it's still new, Safety and I would really like to <br/>
hear your suggestions and/or comments, just send them to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:admin@...">admin@...</a>. Oh and while I'm at it, I might as well <br/>
let you know of my fansite on Saitou but you probably already <br/>
stumbled upon it one way or the other: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hajimenokizu.com/">http://www.hajimenokizu.com/</a> <br/>
a smorgasborg of everything with a doujinshi gallery (a highly work <br/>
in progress page). Now off to contact those listed in the DB and <br/>
other related sites.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone.<br/>
