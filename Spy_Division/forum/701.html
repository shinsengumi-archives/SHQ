<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351417862">Hello your friend in hibernation is here again... LOL! I hope <br/>
everyone is doing well. <br/>
<br/>
Just letting you guys and gals know I made a music vid for NHK. ^__^<br/>
Check it out and enjoy for ummm what it is. I have no idea what the <br/>
song is about except that I like it. Which pairs are you going to <br/>
see?<br/>
<br/>
Kondou and Tsune (my fave couple)<br/>
Serizawa and Oume (very interesting couple)<br/>
Yamanami and Akesato (by request, but these two are a give coz I <br/>
bawled at their love story)<br/>
Hijikata and girl (sorry I forgot her name - again by request)<br/>
Okita x Hide x Todou (well more like Todou coz okita gets like two <br/>
seconds. I'm sorry Souji fans, we all love Souji but Todou seemed <br/>
nicer for Ms. Hide and it's fun with a little love triangle)<br/>
<br/>
Okay then... Everyone take care. Till next time. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133055350">Oh you're very welcome. I've always seen music vids as a medium to <br/>
relive the show/or aspect of a show in a short span. I enjoy making <br/>
them and watching as well. So for those who have music vids, I hope <br/>
they post too for both our sakes. ^__^<br/>
<br/>
Ja ne!<br/>
