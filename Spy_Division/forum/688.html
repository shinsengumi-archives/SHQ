First up, I would like to thank the community for the very fruitful discussion on TB and its various causes, symptoms, prospects etcÂ But to lighten things up, sit back and just enjoy yet another take on some missing events in the PMK anime. God knows there are a million possible in that one, no offense to Nanae Chrono of course.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Summary: AKA The Messed-up World of H/O or How They Finally Got It Going. I was laughing all the way as I wrote this. There is something perverse about KichiÂs messy involvement inÂ Â<br/>

<br/>
CONFLICTING CONFESSIONS<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Toshi sat, eyes closed, unable to look at the man he had inspired to take up the autocratic ideal of the Shogunate.  That of all things he did not wish responsibility for. And then Souji was kneeling in front of him and through the roaring in his head, he heard the animated chatter, ÂÂ and the place was sooooo bright, Hijikata-san! The atmosphere was amazing andÂ Â Here, there was a thoughtful pause. ÂHijikata-san? WhatÂs wrong?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
WhatÂs wrong? ToshiÂs mind howled in impotent disbelief. His hips were beginning to get arthritic and he suddenly felt like the old man he was becoming, getting to his feet and giving an impression of immense silent menace, the menace of accusation. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂThe Shimabara! Of all the places in Kyoto, you had to make a total fool of yourself there and now you have the nerve to ask me whatÂs wrong?Â Toshi said, incredulous, fluent in his fury. He suddenly stopped and turned on Souji. ÂDid you come here to tell me to count my blessings, Souji? Am I supposed to be grateful to you for attempting to relieve the Shinsengumi of its hefty financial burdens?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Okita Souji pulled himself to his full, if modest, height and looked frankly at the other man, whom he had idolised in childhood and whom he still wanted to love, in spite of everything. ÂI have no idea of what you are saying, Hijikata-san. Sannan asked me to come along with him today.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Toshi went very still. When he spoke, his voice had the quiet, nearly calm sound of viciously controlled anger. ÂAh. Your task then is to shame me for making such a fuss.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Souji found there was nothing he could say and, helpless, let the silence linger.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂTell me, Souji,Â Toshi asked, the voice caressing now, brows up, mouth open slightly, waiting for confirmation. ÂHow much did it cost them? That Â that Â Teahouse? How much did they pay you?Â He watched him carefully.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
SoujiÂs eyes lit up dangerously. Comprehension dawning, Toshi knew. Then just as suddenly as it had appeared, the spark was extinguished. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂNo,Â Souji said softly, with a smile that left his eyes untouched. ÂI donÂt have as many admirers as you, Hijikata-san, thus I would have to be the one forking out money for such pleasures.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Toshi endured his gaze as long as he could. When he did turn away finally, he could not close out the soft savage voice. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂIÂm not sure if you already knew this, but you shouldnÂt expect others to accomplish what you canÂt even hope to achieve. ThatÂs all I have to say for now. Goodnight.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When Toshi looked up, he was gone.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Â Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And crouching among the beams above the room, Kichisaburou of Togotoya fame snickered. He waited until the hallway was clear before landing lightly in front of the FukuchouÂs screen doors. He stared at his reflection in the polished wood, tidied his hair, rearranged his yukata. He tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. He tried again. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂHijikata-san,Â he whispered aloud.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The voice sounded peculiar too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂHijikata-san!Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now. He rehearsed it several times more. Then he raised his fist and rapped the screen door softly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Â Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂWhoÂs there?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A muffled voice from the hallway called, ÂItÂs me, Hijikata-san.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Both hesitant and concerned, Toshi tightened the sash around his waist and edged toward the screen door. HadnÂt he left in a fit of anger just moments before? What is he doing outside his room now? Reluctantly sliding open the door, Toshi peered out into the dark hallway. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Souji stood there, and as far as Toshi could tell his visitor was alone, unless of course the rest of the first unit was waiting just down the hall.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂWhat do you want?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂI need to talk.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂDidnÂt you just storm out of my room claiming there was no reasoning with me?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There was an unguarded flash of genuine bewilderment, and then the shrouded expression was back on his face. ÂLet me in. Please?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂItÂs late,Â Toshi replied, still not opening up. Souji remained silent, unmoving.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I shouldnÂt be doing this, Toshi thought. It was a whole can of worms, insidious ones at that. A mess that was sure to grow only worse if he opened the door. Yet even though Toshi wanted to tell him to go away, to leave him alone, he could not force those words out. He found his feet compulsively moving away, stepping aside, and pulling back the screen door. In an instant the shorter figure darted through the opening. Toshi closed the door, turned around, and stared at the back of his late-night guest. It would not be the first time, but this was different. Nervously scratching his naked chest, Toshi reached down, firmly held the knotted sash in place around his waist. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Looking away from Toshi, Souji was reclining against the table. His head was hung; his position seemed calculated to show as much of the smooth slim legs as could be considered decent.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂSo talk.Â Toshi demanded, refusing to be distracted.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂIÂ IÂ Â he began, shaking his head. ÂIÂm sorry. It was really stupid of me.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Toshi sighed. ÂItÂs not a good idea. Who knows what those perverted men could have done to you.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂOr what I could have done to them.Â Not bothering to rearrange his yukata, as he normally would have done, Souji moved languidly across the room on all fours. He stopped at ToshiÂs feet, his voice quivering as he lifted his head and faced him for the first time. ÂItÂs kind of complicated, and I really donÂt know how much I should tell you.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Toshi was suddenly wide-awake. He could not steady himself, nor make his body quit trembling: he knew where this was heading. Go back to the door. Slide it open. Tell Souji to get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂBut Â Â Souji continued lazily, fingers trailing up and down his calves. ÂI happen to like my men mature.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
His burning gaze grazed ToshiÂs half-naked body, and a prick of adrenaline shot his heart. Kat-chan said the chemistry of homosexuality was simply floating in the air, pheromones just lingering in the headquarters waiting for the men to pick up on them. Toshi sensed it otherwise. If the eyes met and held for a fraction of a second too long, he could see the truth. And looking into the violet orbs before him, he saw not only his sexuality but also the unfamiliar depth of lust.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He felt the eyes on his chest, where his muscles were the thickest. Then he sensed the stare upon his biceps, which were hardened by years of swordsmanship. And next SoujiÂs eyes were following the thin trail of hair that zipped down his stomach, over his navel, and on down beneath the yukata.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A moment later, Toshi felt the hands on his sash, and then his robe was tugged totally open. Shit, he thought. Here he was, all of him, including the extent of his arousal, totally exposed, as easy to read as a book.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂClose your eyes, Fukuchou,Â Souji said softly. ÂJust take from me.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He could not help but reach out, open his eyes as SoujiÂs right hand skimmed over his stomach. What was this? This was definitely different from what he was used to. It felt lopsided, as if he was being used, nothing more. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Surprised at himself, amazed that he was breaking away, he grabbed at his robe, pulling it shut. His body surging with desire, his head churning with confusion, he pushed open the screen door and rushed out into the open courtyard. Breathing as hard as if he had just killed a dozen of the Choshu ingrates, he wondered if the silence would be broken and a naked Souji would join him, wondered, too, if that was what he wanted after all.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Nothing happened however.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He was not disturbed as he sat, desperately trying to regain his wits and control. Control? Forget about that, he thought. For so long he had been so tight, so worried. He had to let go; nothing mattered, not anymore. But did that mean giving in to his lust? Maybe. Maybe eventually. Looking up at the clear night sky, he came to a silent decision. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He did not notice the dark figure as it nimbly leapt onto the rooftop and disappeared into the dark night.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Â Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In his room, Souji just lay there on the futon, his eyes open, his body not moving beneath the cotton blanket. For a moment he considered trying to catch up on his practice, but then decided against it almost once.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It was hopeless. He groaned in frustration and rolled over onto his stomach. Visiting the ladies in the Shimabara district was not prohibited by Shinsengumi laws, was it? Even Sannan was there with him! It just isnÂt fair, he pouted, thumping his legs lightly against the soft futon. Hijikata-san himself had visited those quarters often enough. Wait, even Heisuke, who was younger, hadÂ Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Souji sat up immediately, his senses alert as he strained to catch more sounds coming from the adjacent room. He stood up silently and unsheathed his katana, the moonlight playing on the sharp blade. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He moved cautiously into the darkened hallway and braced himself as he pushed the screen door of his friendÂs room. ÂHijikata-san, are youÂ Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But the room was empty. The moonlight illuminated the room with a faint glow. The door leading to the courtyard was open all the way, so clearly the intruder had escaped through the courtyard. Could Hijikata-san possibly have him cornered?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He was scanning the room for clues when he heard it, darting steps behind him. He spun around, and then released the grip on his katana. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂHijikata-san, I thought there was an intruder in your room. Did you see him?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Toshi stared at him, ÂWhat are you talking about? You were here all along, werenÂt you?Â He was moving toward him, his steps slow but sure and as Souji looked into his eyes, the intensity frightened him. ÂIÂm sorry about what happened just now.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He was not sure he liked this. Something was different, not so easy, and he stepped back, felt the wall at his back, realised he was cornered. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂItÂs alright, really.Â With a nervous laugh and his voice surprisingly faint, Souji added jokingly, ÂAs if I werenÂt exhausted enough, you wore me out.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂIt was great, wasnÂt it?Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They were now less than a foot apart. Souji felt the other manÂs deep, hot breath on his neck and then trickling downward. He inhaled the now-familiar odour of tobacco smoke.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂHijikata-san, wha Â Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂSh.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂBut, Hiji Â Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂSouji.Â Toshi said in a hushed voice as he closed in.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂIÂmÂ IÂm not sure IÂm ready for this.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂJust put down your katana.Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ÂButÂ Â <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then Souji knew it was a helpless situation, that there was no stopping it. He sheathed his katana, set it carefully on the low table and closed his eyes as he saw the hand reaching out slowly. An instant later he felt the strong fingers of the other man wrap around the back of his neck. Souji gasped, then leaned over, pressing his cheek against ToshiÂs thick wrist. He opened his mouth, softly bit at the skin. Then he sensed ToshiÂs right hand on the other side of his neck, and as it kneaded and massaged him, SoujiÂs breath began to come in short, deep gasps.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He reached up with his right hand, wanting to touch Toshi, satisfy, please him in some way as well. But just as his hand descended on ToshiÂs shoulder, the man removed it, gently pressing it down and back against the wall. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Souji tumbled into a nervous kind of bliss as the fingers massaged his neck, the back of his head. With a deep, gentle, and circular motion, the steady fingers worked their way over SoujiÂs ears, through his hair, up his scalp. He dreamily opened his eyes, and saw how intently Toshi was inspecting him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Trapped in the corner of the room, held captive by a deep surge of desire, Souji moaned, feeling the hands next on his forehead, next softly descending to his temples. A finger brushed over his lips, and he lunged at it, bit and sucked on it. But Toshi would not be entrapped, and slowly, steadily, his hand moved down. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He never liked to be alone; the spoilt child in him needed comfort, yearned to be held, warmed, taken care of. Hesitantly raising his fingers, he was more than eager to explore: he was desperate to. His fingers sensed the heaviness of ToshiÂs yukata. And then, almost simultaneously, Souji felt a hand on his waist, a sure hand that rubbed his skin, then reached for the knot of his sash and untied it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Â Â The End Â Â<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And the rest, as they say, is up to the readersÂ active imagination. I left it at that because the coward in me wanted to retain my account since I donÂt know where else to put up the fanfics.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If some parts sound a wee bit like the Bridging Chapter (TK fic), you have my apologies. In fact, this was actually Phase 4 of Elemental Evolution. Crosses fingers and prays no SEED fans read this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What brought about this fic? WellÂ remember episode 16-17 where the unforgettable Kichisaburou appeared in the Okita Impersonator arc? Yes, yes, thatÂs it. I vividly remember Toshi saying something to this effect: ÂSouji? It canÂt be. He was in my room until late at night.Â And then there were the naughty thoughts: what were they doing? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The fic is set in episode 17: just before the scene with Tetsu and Souji enjoying the view of the night sky.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I couldnÂt stop laughing as I wrote the fic, so maybe it could actually be called a humour fic. There is something perverse about Kichi bringing them together, in the most unexpected way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359637503">Ellene J, I enjoyed your fic and sent a review to you off-list.<br/>
But have you ever wondered by PMK Saitou showed up just in the nick of<br/>
time to save Hijikata from Okita&#39;s evil twin? Hmmmmm?<br/>
<br/>
A new fic, is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumifics.com">http://www.shinsengumifics.com</a><br/>
called &quot;A Friend of a Friend&quot; is completed--not too long<br/>
but deals with Kondou&#39;s execution.  So the story takes place post<br/>
Kyoto and jumps to the Meiji Era.<br/>
The last chapter has footnotes and links to pages on the net which<br/>
will specifically mention the character from Tosa.<br/>
It is based on some real creepy historical connections. I&#39;ve double<br/>
and tripled checked these details--it&#39;s really uncanny.<br/>
