<h3>The Longest Fanfic EVER....</h3>
by <i>secretarytocapt3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136400672">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I wrote an original novel which is what I'd call "historical" <br/>
fanfic. <br/>
Fujita Gorou plays a key supporting role in it however he is in no <br/>
way similar to portrayals we have seen in the past (anime/manga/live <br/>
action movies)  he is just simply my "take" on him.  Yes it will <br/>
also depict the Fujita family and explain some stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The story is mainly about the Meiji Era however there will be scene <br/>
which take place during the Bakumatsu.<br/>
<br/>
The rating for this story is NC-17 due to the portrayals of various <br/>
forms of sexuality. Please, only people over 17-18 should read it.  <br/>
I don't want to traumatize the youngins.  I am building a website <br/>
for this story and for the general public to acquire the story <br/>
they'd have to paypal some amount of money (which basically means if <br/>
they are old enough to have a credit card or checking account---they <br/>
can read my story).  It was not professionally edited, and ofcourse <br/>
I'm not a professional writer.  It will not be published or anything <br/>
so you will notice that each chapter has a different theme and <br/>
nearly a different tone to it.  That's because this novel is sort of <br/>
an experiment.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a nerd.<br/>
<br/>
So there will be footnotes in the story (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
It is OVER 70,000 words long.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOSUZUE.pdf">http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOSUZUE.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
if the story was even mildly entertaining to you, please consider <br/>
sending me money (^_^) <br/>
<br/>
members of SHQ have generously donated money for the upgrade of the <br/>
website, which is now in its final phase (basically 2 weeks to go) <br/>
and aside from teh initial donations, I've been paying for stuff out <br/>
of my own pocket.  I know the website hasn't "changed" or been <br/>
updated in months, but that is because updates would drive the <br/>
programmer insane due to the database format we are implementing. <br/>
Once everything is done then updates will resume immediately.<br/>
<br/>
You can paypal the email contained in the story ($1, $1.50---I don't <br/>
care)<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
You can paypal shinsengumihq(a)yahoo.com and help support the site's <br/>
server<br/>
<br/>
it's totally voluntary because ofcourse I just gave the link to the <br/>
story above (^_^)<br/>
<br/>
if you have comments, please email the author (email is in the <br/>
header of every page)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240862396">Aiyaaah!<br/>
<br/>
It's true, I converted and older version of the story into pdf (I use <br/>
pdfonline---very cool free service).  I use a mac at one of my jobs, <br/>
a computer in a PC lab and use either my dead laptop at home or a <br/>
borrowed laptop so usually I have to keep straight in my mind the <br/>
versions of documents I upload and overwrite.<br/>
<br/>
SO today, I spent....5 hours going through the story and RE-EDITING <br/>
it (T_T) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOSUZUE.pdf">http://1happyturtle.com/SilapaJarun/ONOSUZUE.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks Hirotada Tokugawa for informing me that it was full of <br/>
spelling errors (that's how I knew I converted the wrong draft) and <br/>
probably overwrote the GOOD draft, with an older version (I'm stupid).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I think that people who want to learn about the Meiji era <br/>
should give the story a chance, especially the last chapter will <br/>
cover an important death (not really popularized in manga or pop-<br/>
culture yet) and a very key development of the era.<br/>
<br/>
Footnotes galor all over the place, however there are tons of details <br/>
which are accurate but I did not footnote, because it would be <br/>
annoying to see footnote number 105 and then have to read an <br/>
explanation at the bottom of the page.<br/>
<br/>
I forced one friend to read the story and she finished it in five <br/>
days and her frank review was the story was atleast "strange".<br/>
<br/>
Again you can support SHQ by paypaling $$ to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:shinsengumihq@...">shinsengumihq@...</a><br/>
or you can donate money to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:silapajarun@...">silapajarun@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone likes my version of Fujita Goro (I purposefully <br/>
altered his name to Fujita Gorou, just as I tweaked the names of many <br/>
historical figures in the story).<br/>
<br/>
Please review and email me---I'll even take one word reviews.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115089681">Your story was GREAT !!!! I enjoyed reading it !!!<br/>
And I wanted to appologise for the info I gave you. It wasn't<br/>
incorrect or anything but if I knew what time period you were working<br/>
with I would have given you what was known about Sobek at that time,<br/>
which would be slightly differant from what is known/pulbished now. I<br/>
did try and look into it but Budge hurts me so it will probably take<br/>
me a few days.. but there are two other authors of that time period<br/>
whos works I have and can look there if you would like.<br/>
and thank you for that story. It has some elements simalar to the one<br/>
Im working on and someday I will be finished w/it.<br/>

just one sentence from you makes it all worthwhile and I enjoy our <br/>
YIM chats concerning this story.  You are the second person who <br/>

<br/>
I have finished the entire website and uploaded video trailers for <br/>
the chapters too.  Please see the vids...everything is factual.  I <br/>
highly recommend it for people who want the history [under the story <br/>

Meiji Era. <br/>
<br/>
This story is long, but not boring.... (^_-) around 70K the actual <br/>
length is 75K but I think this is due to the footnotes etc...<br/>

<br/>
The story is based on the original character named Ono Suzue a man <br/>
born into the samurai rank of Satsuma-han.  His peculiar name is <br/>
explained in the story, as Hirotada Tokugawa (M) pointed out it is a <br/>
soft (woman's) name.<br/>
<br/>
There is varied forms of sexuality and that's the reason why only <br/>
people 18 and above should read it...so if you want it email <br/>
silapajarun(a)1happyturtle.com.<br/>

Fujita Goro, again, is not based on an established universe, this is <br/>
my independent interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
The chapters:<br/>
<br/>
I.    THE PET RABBIT, covers Boshin 1868 and Aizu especially. Fujita <br/>
Goro (I spelled it Gorou in the story) will also appear as Yamaguchi <br/>
Jiro. (theme:childhood)<br/>
<br/>
II.   SLEEP ON THE SEA, the Iwakura Mission of 1871 starring Okubo <br/>
Toshimichi and Mori Arinori (fictionalized as Moriyama Arinori) <br/>

<br/>
III.  RED ON BLACK, you enter the Imperial Palace, 19th century <br/>
