<h3>All members please read. Database</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-418217102">Some of the members already know that I am creating companion <br/>
website to the SHQ and the MB. It&#39;s just a one stop shop for finding <br/>
websites, commercial releases and fan fiction/artwork. The test site <br/>
is up <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://geocities.com/mg_batt">http://geocities.com/mg_batt</a> and will launch in <br/>
www.shinsengumidb.com. It will just be links/summaries, no archiving <br/>
is done. For a user to view your work they will have to use the link <br/>
and follow it either to your own website or at the archiving website <br/>
like ff.net.<br/>
<br/>
Now I would like to merge the database here in the yahoo group and <br/>
copy over the entries to the website. I will be doing that <br/>
tonight. . The summaries I will use whatever your have on your <br/>
website or ff.net. If you need something to be edited and for those <br/>
who do not want to be included, please drop me a line so I can <br/>
remove/edit the entry. When the website is officially launched you <br/>
can also add entries.<br/>
<br/>
For those other stories that are not listed here in the database, I <br/>
will be sending out &quot;I want your permission&quot; e-mails... *wounds <br/>
crosses fingers and mutters &quot;I hope they say yes&quot;.*<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time... :O)<br/>
<br/>

---- To phil ----<br/>
<br/>
I got your e-mail. I will not be taking your entries in the group <br/>
database, until you are ready. So let me know because I don&#39;t want <br/>
to miss out on those wonderful yaoi stories. :O)<br/>
<br/>
Phil, sec mentioned a link to the livejournal SHQ for the fanfic <br/>
challenges, can I go ahead and put the link on the website?</div>
