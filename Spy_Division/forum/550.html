<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314589361">now before you rush to download<br/>
here are some things to consider<br/>
it is 5 mb as a .wmv file<br/>
and there seems to be something {{really}} wrong....<br/>
I lost a minute of footage <br/>

so just enjoy the music...don&#39;t complain because sec is very mad...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made the vid at the school computer lab so I can&#39;t retrieve the <br/>
original format and try to &quot;restore&quot; the missing images so the vid <br/>
is only 2 min long...but the song is 3 min long<br/>
<br/>
thanx Barb for the images and theories on the love triangle in NHK, <br/>
or did we settle on love square, polygon oh heck circle because <br/>
everyone is in on it....I even worked in Serizawa Kamo and <br/>
Saitou...but alas it seems that my abuse of school resources has <br/>
resulted in this technological tragedy<br/>
<br/>
**just a note to people out there...windows movie maker &quot;unlinks&quot; <br/>
images/slides from the &quot;timeline&quot; used to make the vid (if some kind <br/>
of crash occurs).  So all your images shows up as &quot;x&quot; and when you <br/>
try to plug in the image to restore it all you end up screwing up <br/>
the timing...just one HUGE headache....so keep &quot;saving&quot; your work<br/>
otherwise windows movie maker is a very easy to learn program<br/>

how appropriately sad Takeda was.<br/>

You _had_ to get the bears in there though huh? *shakes head* It could <br/>
be worse he could like Hello Kitty...<br/>
