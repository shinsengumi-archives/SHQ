<h3>IMPORTANT!  Template changes and Archives</h3>
by <i>spiritus_saitou</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070809554">I&#39;ve made some minor changes to the document over in the Files <br/>
Section under List Business.  One thing is important --- a slight <br/>
change to the fiction template.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, we now have an LJ community, SHQ Spy Office, although <br/>
it&#39;s not ready for business yet --- it really is just blank walls at <br/>
the moment and everything is restricted until it&#39;s ready.  It&#39;s going <br/>
to take me a little while to get an archive site set up and linked to <br/>
SHQ, so the LJ will be acting as a temporary archive site in the <br/>
meantime.  It will remain open only to members of this list who join <br/>
the LJ community until a real website is established.  Once that site <br/>
is up, then I will free up the LJ to open membership and viewing.  At <br/>
that time, all stories stored and searched under &quot;Memories&quot; that <br/>
authors have indicated they don&#39;t want available through LJ will be <br/>
removed from the journal and Memories.<br/>
<br/>
To try to put this plainly...  The LJ will be a temporary archive for <br/>
stories posted on this list, closed to all comments and viewing <br/>
EXCEPT for members of this list who apply for membership to the LJ <br/>
community, SHQ Spy Office.  When an official archive site is up, the <br/>
journal and Memories will be edited and *stories* by authors who <br/>
don&#39;t want them available there will be REMOVED from the LJ community <br/>
entirely.  After that&#39;s done, the LJ will become public.  That&#39;s why <br/>
the addition to the template.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I&#39;ve tweaked some things, I&#39;ll post addresses and <br/>
information. Don&#39;t start pelting me with membership requests yet... <br/>
please.  :-)  Those of you who already have stories posted, don&#39;t <br/>
worry about going back and changing anything on the header.  I can <br/>
reach you privately about it.<br/>
<br/>
That was the one important thing.  The other is just to encourage you <br/>
to upload stuff to the Web Features at your leisure, but not to be <br/>
shocked and dismayed if you find it in a different place than you put <br/>
it.  I&#39;m not into deleting or censoring... just getting to be a <br/>
control freak about organization since I&#39;ve been trying to clean up <br/>
my hard drive... things keep popping up that I&#39;ve wanted and went <br/>
lost because I obviously just stuck it anywhere.  MissBehavin&#39;, are <br/>
you sure I shouldn&#39;t be Hajime instead of Shinpachi?  How about we <br/>
give him a split personality... you can be the bored PMK &#39;Jime and <br/>
I&#39;ll be the control-freak RK &#39;Jime... hmmm?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
uh... I&#39;m not sure who I am anymore...  List Bitch?</div>
