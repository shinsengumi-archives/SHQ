<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717775221">PMK Nagakura wearing elf hat<br/>
&quot;The holidays are here!  So if anyone would like a polaroid or digital<br/>
pic of their screaming infant with no bladder control with Kondou<br/>
wearing a fake beard---I mean Santy Claus over there please get in<br/>
line...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kondou &quot;Ho ho ho Merry Christmas---ok we need to come up with better<br/>
fundraisers, I&#39;m starting to smell like diapers, how about kidnapping<br/>
Teruhime, gagging her annoying assistant and having Matsudaira<br/>
Katamori take his time in paying the ransom...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
PMK Nagakura yells to SEC &quot;Why DO I HAVE TO BE THE Elf?  Just because<br/>
I have orange-red hair---&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SEC &quot;You have got to be the most vertically challenged swordsman in<br/>
all of Kyoto. Please continued with the promo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
PMK Nagakura ::sigh:: &quot;Ok people get over to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinsengumifics.com/contest2005.htm">http://www.shinsengumifics.com/contest2005.htm</a> and write like crazy to<br/>
win REAL PRIZES!!!! One of which is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hajimenokizu.com">http://www.hajimenokizu.com</a> &#39;s<br/>
entire collection of Saitou X (insert anyone) yaoi doujinshi&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SEC &quot;Wait!  Kizu is going to give away her yaoi doujinshi?  SErious?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hajimenokizu &quot;NO!!!! Please carefully read the rules to the contest<br/>
before making RIDICULOUS assumptions.  Contact Shinsengumifics if you<br/>
have any questions as well&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SEC &quot;Darn, I so wanted those SAitou X Hiko ones...&quot;<br/>
----------------------------------------------------<br/>
VERY RARE FIC<br/>
I know most of us can&#39;t read Japanese but I just wanted to post this<br/>
sample anyways.  The new fanfic genre... ShinsenAizu fics which blends<br/>
the emerging appreciation for Aizu historical figures with the<br/>
Shinsengumi who were fighting in the domain in 1868<br/>
<br/>
Yamaguchi Jiro (SAitou) & HIjikata & Takagi Morinosuke & Takagi Tokio<br/>
& DIARY at Sawamoto Waterfalls <br/>
<br/>
Prologue<br/>

Actual story it seems<br/>

<br/>
I cannot fully understand it with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nifty.com/globalgate">http://www.nifty.com/globalgate</a><br/>
but I found it while searching for Takagi Morinosuke---I should be<br/>
finding fanart on him any day now<br/>
<br/>
many people visit his grave in Aizu and all...also several historical<br/>
figures who are all deeply connected to the Fujita family during the<br/>
Meiji have fansites with MUCHO hits---strange how manga writers<br/>
haven&#39;t combined Shinsengumi, Joushitai, Byakkotai together<br/>
somehow...it really is a no brainer</div>
