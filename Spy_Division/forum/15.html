you that a thorough investigation has been completed and appropriate <br/>

best to you all.<br/>

Dear Ayu-nee,<br/>
<br/>
My life is a mess and I can't stand it!  My parents were killed a few <br/>
years back and I've been living with my older brother who is the worst! <br/>
He makes me sleep in a closet. He's always lecturing me and shoving me <br/>
on the ground and accusing me of doing something bad even when I'm <br/>
totally innocent.  I thought things would change when he got a new job <br/>
in the finance office of a local paramilitary group and I decided to <br/>
apply too, to show him that I really am grown up. What a mistake that <br/>
was! The job is a dead end and what's worse is my boss! The man is an <br/>
absolute demon and nothing I do is ever good enough to suit him!<br/>
<br/>
If that's not bad enough the guys here treat me like I'm some kind of a <br/>
freak just because I'm a little short for my age. They tease me <br/>
constantly and act like I'm some kind of personal pet. I do have one <br/>
friend among them but he's always busy working, he hasn't been feeling <br/>
well and even though he doesn't say anything I think he's having <br/>
problems with his "significant other".<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait, Ayu-nee it gets even worse!  There's this guy (my age) who <br/>
works here too and for some reason I can't stop thinking about him. He <br/>
does a lot of undercover work and sometimes he has to disguise himself <br/>
as a woman and when he does he's so freakin' kawaii I can't stand it! <br/>
Lately I've been having this dream where I'm walking down the street and <br/>
he's dressed like a  girl and he grabs me and drags me into an alley and....<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's just say that the past few nights I'm kind of glad my <br/>
brother makes me sleep alone in a closet.<br/>
<br/>
The bad part is that it's hard trying to explain why I need clean sheets <br/>
every day...<br/>
<br/>
Can you help me? Will things ever get better?  Do those dreams mean <br/>
I'm-----gay?<br/>
<br/>
-----Don't call me Puppy-kun!<br/>
<br/>
Dear Pup,<br/>
<br/>
This is quite a complicated set of events and I do sympathize. However, <br/>
I think the best advice I can give would be in person and I encourage <br/>
you to send me a note c/o this paper to arrange a private meeting.<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # # # #<br/>

Full Page Notice:<br/>
<br/>
Attendance is Mandatory for Captain Harada's lecture tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
evening--My Brush with Seppuku and What it Means to You.<br/>
<br/>
There will also be a quiz on the Internal Regulations.<br/>

This Just In:<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami Keisuke, formerly with the Shinsengumi was found dead this <br/>
morning of<br/>
<br/>
an apparent suicide. No details are available and an official <br/>
investigation is under way.<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # #  # # # #<br/>
<br/>
Official Notice:<br/>
<br/>
All members are Strongly Encouraged to attend the memorial service for <br/>
Captain Okita Souji's cat Buttons tomorrow noon at Mibu Temple. While <br/>
special dispensation will be granted to those members scheduled to be on <br/>
patrol such members are expected to offer their condolences to Captain <br/>
Okita immediately following the end of their shift.<br/>
<br/>
 -----Hijikata<br/>
<br/>
# # # # # # # # # #<br/>
<br/>
Addendum to Official Notice:<br/>
<br/>
All rumors circulating in the compound concerning the demise of Captain <br/>
Okita's cat Buttons shall cease immediately as it is upsetting my Souji. <br/>
The cat was not eaten by anyone. It was merely caught in the crossfire <br/>
of Captain Harada's skirmish with Ishin scum while it attempted to jump <br/>
up and play with the fuzzy ball thing on his uniform.<br/>
<br/>

Dear Editor:<br/>
<br/>
It has been brought to my attention that I have been slandered in your <br/>
publication. I refer to the recent letter by one Mr. (Or Miss) Katsura <br/>
concerning my runaway adoptive son and kenjutsu pupil Kenshin Himura.<br/>
<br/>
I have never abused Kenshin in any manner. I rescued the boy from slave <br/>
traders and gave him a stable home as well as instruction in the great <br/>
Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu--- Instruction which he clearly did not appreciate <br/>
as he ran off before his training was complete.<br/>
<br/>
I'm certain that those of you with teenagers can understand how it is <br/>
when your child falls in with the "wrong crowd"--- in this case a bunch <br/>
of older left wing political extremists . I tried my best to talk sense <br/>
into the boy but he refused to listen so that I had no choice but to let <br/>
the little shit choose his own path and learn from his mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
As far as allegations of my alleged "sake addiction" I will have you <br/>
know, Katsura K. that I drink no more t han the average citizen. And <br/>
since when is it a crime to enjoy a cup of fine sake to help one relax?  <br/>
Again, those of you with teenagers can surely appreciate this simple <br/>
pleasure I allow for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Should anyone be in contact with my son please tell him that I have not <br/>
permanently closed the door to him he has only to seek my guidance and I <br/>
will be there.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Hiko Seijuro<br/>

Dear Ayu-nee:<br/>
<br/>
I am a member of one of the most respected units of a local law <br/>
enforcement agency and while I take great pride in my unit I am <br/>
concerned with the way our Captain treats us. He is a rather intolerant <br/>
man whose personal code of Aku Soku Zan leaves no room for even the <br/>
simplest human error. I hesitate approaching his immediate superior as <br/>
they seem to be cut from the same mold.  Can you offer any advice? <br/>
Transferring to a new job is out of the question, I'm afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Nervous<br/>
<br/>
Dear Nervous:<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your Captain is under a bit of stress. I know that the crime <br/>
rate has been steadily rising and it's quite possible that your <br/>
superior's superiors are giving him a hard time. Please hang in there <br/>
and keep me posted.<br/>
<br/>

There is an opening for a skilled, non nonsense swordsman in the Third <br/>
Unit.<br/>
<br/>
Send letters of application to Shinsengumi Headquarters Attention <br/>

<br/>
Official Notice:<br/>
<br/>
Interested citizens who may have come to earlier meetings concerning the <br/>
latest Shinsengumi Recruitment Drive are encouraged to come back for the <br/>
next round of information sessions.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Captain Saitou slightly overstated the dangers associated <br/>
with our organizations. The probability of being slaughtered by a single <br/>
Ishin hitokiri is far smaller than the good captain may have led you to <br/>
believe and while our Internal Regulations are rather stringent they are <br/>
by no means an automatic death sentence for even the slightest <br/>
infraction.  <br/>
<br/>
Future meetings will be overseen by Captain Nagakura of the Second Unit <br/>
and a nurse will be in attendance should we have anymore fainting <br/>
incidents.<br/>

Dear Ayu-nee,<br/>
<br/>
It's Plum again, I've been holed up here in the middle of nowhere with <br/>
the boy wonder for weeks now and he's been looking at me like he wants <br/>
to...you know,  play house "for<br/>
real"...Ewwwwwwww. What do I do now?<br/>
<br/>
 Plum Crazy but not in Kyoto<br/>
<br/>
DearPlum,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just sit the young man down and explain gently but clearly that you're <br/>
flattered by his attention, but that you're not interested in him that <br/>
way. Remind him you're only doing your job. 'm sure he'll understand.... <br/>
It's not as if he's violent or anything, right?<br/>
<br/>
 P.S. Perhaps if you have a brother he might help set this young man<br/>
<br/>
straight.<br/>

Dear Ayu-nee, It's Red, remember me :-)<br/>
<br/>
The job thing has settled down a bit and now I'm on an out of town <br/>
assignment, the problem is y roommate. She's an older woman and I think <br/>
I'm in love with her, well maybe not love but definitely lust, *blush* <br/>
She's really hot in a dazed sort of way and well, I'm not as experienced <br/>
as you might think so how do I , um, you know, do it?<br/>
<br/>
 Red<br/>
<br/>
 Dear Red,<br/>
<br/>
I've referred your letter to you to my colleague Capt Harada who offers <br/>
this advice:<br/>
<br/>
"Loosen her up with a bit of sake, some candelight and a nice meal. Talk <br/>
a little about "chick stuff"--- you know, family, gardening, etc and <br/>
then make like it's no big deal and sit by yourself<br/>
while she goes off and combs her hair or reads a book. If she comes and <br/>
sits near you just follow our instincts and do what comes naturally. If <br/>
Shinpachi can score with this plan then anyone can!<br/>
