 </span></blockquote>Your story has to contain at least one Shinsengumi character but ti can<br/>
be from any &quot;universe&quot; Kenshin Peace Maker Kurogane, the NHK Taiga<br/>
drama, historical, films etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the guidelines as they appear in the group files section<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  *Submitting Fiction*<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Stories and poetry can be posted to the list or uploaded into the <br/>
Fiction folder under Files, or both.  When you post to the list, <br/>
formatting will usually be lost.  Saving your story or poem as an html <br/>
document enables you to format a story the way you want and have it be <br/>
seen that way. Just keep readability in mind when you get enthusiastic <br/>
with color and fonts.  J  (In MSWord, to save a document in html format, <br/>
you can either choose the &quot;Save as&quot; feature under File and choose &quot;web <br/>
page&quot; in the drop down menu OR again under File, click on &quot;Save as web <br/>
document.&quot;  Those of us accustomed to uploading stories on ff.net should <br/>
be aware that uploading to the yahoo list site keeps formatting exactly <br/>
as you save it, unlike ff.net which puts lines in after returns.  It&#39;s <br/>
been ages since I&#39;ve worked with WordPerfect, so I don&#39;t know how it <br/>
works, but I imagine it&#39;s similar.  Send a query to the list for help if <br/>
you need to.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If the story or poem is being posted to the list, in the subject line, <br/>
please provide the following FIC: &lt;title&gt;, &lt;source material&gt;, &lt;character <br/>
or pairing&gt;, &lt;rating&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As an example, using one of my Rurouni Kenshin stories:  FIC: Kitaku, <br/>
RK, SaitouxSano, R<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You can use semi-colons to separate the information or put non-title <br/>
information within parentheses, etc., but include the information so <br/>
others can see at a glance if it is something they&#39;re interested in.  <br/>
With so much potential diversity of characters, situations, and source <br/>
materials, it&#39;s only common courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please include the following header when posting a story to the list or <br/>
uploading it to the File folder.  I know it&#39;s a pain, but it allows <br/>
readers the choice of what they want to read and what they want to <br/>
avoid, as well as quick access to author information, permission to <br/>
archive on the website, and a disclaimer to protect yourself.  Stories <br/>
that are posted without the header will be deleted.  Forgetfulness <br/>
happens --- don&#39;t take it personally.  Just repost it with the header.  <br/>
(Or just send a message that, ACK! you forgot the header and correct it <br/>
on the upload in Files.) If the story contains multiple parts or <br/>
chapters, you can either repost the header each time or at the very <br/>
least repost the disclaimer.  If information should change (such as the <br/>
story has suddenly jumped from PG to R), please repost a new header when <br/>
you realize information in the original header has changed.  If you have <br/>
any questions, feel free to contact me, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:spiritus_saitou@...">spiritus_saitou@...</a> <br/>

<br/>
*Archived on the website:  *(Is it okay to archive it on the SHQ <br/>
website, yes or no)<br/>
<br/>
*General Rating*:  (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17... I know it&#39;s hard to <br/>
estimate, but a general idea helps)<br/>
<br/>
*Warning*:  (M/M, F/M, F/F sexual situations, graphic violence, strong <br/>
language, rape... anything you think might be disturbing)<br/>
<br/>
*Disclaimer*:  (If you are using characterizations drawn from a <br/>
copyrighted source (such as anime, manga, film, books), you must <br/>
acknowledge you do not hold the copyright.  If your story is based on an <br/>
original idea with original characters, give yourself at least a little <br/>
protection from potential plagiarism by stating you own the rights to <br/>
your original ideas and characters.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859347632">Okay, I feel really stupid, but I joined because I wanted to read/post fanfiction about the Shinsengumi. I saw something on the main page about business lists and files, and here again you mention group files, but I can&#39;t find anything that says &quot;files&quot; or &quot;fanfic&quot; or &quot;fiction folder&quot; or anything of the kind. While it&#39;s entirely possible that I&#39;m a) retarded or b) blind, I find it very frustrating that this isn&#39;t more obvious when that&#39;s supposed to be the major reason for the group. Or so the listing on Shinsengumi HQ said. Help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
