<h3>Apologies</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900730220">Sorry for the sudden rush of answers to the question.  ^_^  (And, <br/>
stupid me WOULD forget that OOC is used in fanfic, too.)<br/>
<br/>
First YIM started acting up on me and crashing my computer.  Now I&#39;m <br/>
having trouble with mail.  &gt;_&lt;  The more they change things, the more <br/>
my computer is not digesting it well.  (old age)<br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry about that.<br/>
