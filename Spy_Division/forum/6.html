<h3>Web Features sections (Files, Links, etc.)</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117828732">I&#39;ve started creating folders over in the Web Features and you can <br/>
begin loading them up.  Just keep a couple things in mind.  I&#39;m <br/>
trying to keep it organized so see if an existing folder meets your <br/>
need (and don&#39;t forget there are folders within the main folders).  <br/>
If not, then do what you have to do.  I *might* move what you load up <br/>
into an existing folder I think it belongs in or create a whole new <br/>
folder.  Please don&#39;t take it personally.  It&#39;s just an attempt to <br/>
keep things findable.<br/>
<br/>
Photos --- let&#39;s try to keep photographs (real images, not art) in <br/>
the photos section.  There&#39;s a folder in Files that will hold the art <br/>
and scans and screencaps we post up for inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Links --- also has some general folders... take a look and see what <br/>
you can add to things, like your own webpages and archives and other <br/>
fanfic & fanart sites you&#39;re aware of that would be related to the <br/>
Shinsengumi.  Let&#39;s try to keep factual information over on SHQ... <br/>
that&#39;s where it belongs... so we don&#39;t repeat too much info and back <br/>
up BOTH sites&#39; files with the same stuff.  This is why I encourage <br/>
members here to join SHQ so that they have access to historical <br/>
information (or other info related to miburo, like anime, etc.)  This <br/>
includes history links... try to keep them on SHQ and focus on <br/>
fiction and art here.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t upload any stories to the files... at least not at this point.  <br/>
I&#39;m looking at archiving stories authors give permission to be <br/>
archived on a separate site that&#39;ll be linked to the SHQ site.  Also, <br/>
we&#39;re not ready for art yet.  I can understand how anxious you might <br/>
be, but we want to put our foot sure and steady from the outset.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds restrictive, I know.  I don&#39;t mean to sound that way.  I want <br/>
you to load things up to these sections without reservation... in <br/>
fact I&#39;m counting on you guys to share information so we&#39;re all fat & <br/>
sassy, but I want to work at keeping things organized.  The site&#39;s <br/>
less than 24 hours old... there&#39;s still plenty of work to be done.  <br/>
In fact, the guidelines already need to be revised, but I expected <br/>
that once things got going.  Feel free to make comments or <br/>
suggestions to me, on the list or privately.<br/>
<br/>
And to those of you have joined already --- THANKS and welcome.  <br/>
Start exercising those fingers and let&#39;s get some stories going.<br/>

MissBehavin&#39; and had to settle for Nagakura Shinpachi)</div>
