<div id="ygrps-yiv-817504299">Some of you who started out with the Miburo list will recall the Top <br/>
Ten Reasons to Join the Shinsengumi and the What Saito Would Never Do <br/>
post from there. Well, we need more of both. I've been chatting with <br/>
Barb and I'm going to attempt to come up with some humor stuff for <br/>
our website. Those two posts seem like as good a place to start as <br/>
any.<br/>
<br/>
Among the other topics I'm considering is some sort of Shinsengumi <br/>
Life Lessons category. So yeah, I need input for that as well. If <br/>
anyone has anything they want to contribute please post it to the <br/>
list or e-mail me ASAP. Thanks.<br/>
