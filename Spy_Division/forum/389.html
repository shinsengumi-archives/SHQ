<h3>Best Versions of The Shinsengumi Characters</h3>
by <i>darkmalik</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996122324">Here&#39;s a question which version (anime, manga, live action) of each <br/>
character is best. Here&#39;s my vote:<br/>
Hajime Saitou: PMK version, RK one is nice too but the PMK version is <br/>
more softer and I like that.<br/>
Souji Okita: PMK version hands down, I don&#39;t liket he way they <br/>
portrayed him in PK as a stupid looking little kid.<br/>
Susumu Yamazaki: PMK I&#39;ve only seen him in this particular series so <br/>
I vote this version best.<br/>
Keisuke Yamanami: PMK again as I&#39;ve only seen him in this series I <br/>
can only vote for this version of him.<br/>
Isami Kondou: PMK I don&#39;t liek the way he&#39;s sometimes portrayed as <br/>
old and fat in live action so I choose PMK for the liveliness they <br/>
gave him in it.<br/>
Sanosuke Harada: PMK because of the comedy factor totally.<br/>
Toshizo Hijikata: PMK I don&#39;t like how they prtray him as an <br/>
overpowering jerk with no sense of humor in the live actions I&#39;ve <br/>
seen so I have to vote for the cool one in the anime PMK.<br/>
Shinpachi Nagakura: PMK for the comedy routine he, Sanosuke and <br/>
Heisuke get into.<br/>
Heisuke Toodou: Is he even real? Oh well since I&#39;ve only seen him in <br/>
PMK I vote for the PMK version.<br/>
Well here&#39;s my votes, what&#39;re yours?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002887421">Here are my favorites, with a couple other depictions of &quot;lesser&quot; figures.<br/>
<br/>
Saitou Hajime: Kaze Hikaru version!!<br/>
<br/>
Okita Souji: Kaze Hikaru version!!<br/>
<br/>
Yamazaki Susumu: Shinsengumi Keppuroku version.<br/>
<br/>
Yamanami Keisuke: NHK Version! But the fact that he&#39;s always smiling is <br/>
kinda creepy...<br/>
<br/>
Kondou: Even though I&#39;m not a big fan of yaoi I&#39;d have to say Soshite Haru <br/>
no Tsuki has the coolest-looking version. Shinsengumi Keppuroku comes a <br/>
close second.<br/>
<br/>
Harada Sanosuke: NHK!! He acts like he&#39;s stoned half the time! Heck, knowing <br/>
him, he probably is...<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata Toshizou: NHK Version. But Shinsengumi Keppuroku&#39;s Hijikata is cool <br/>
too, but only because it&#39;s the same actor who plays Inspector Aoyama in <br/>
&quot;Hatchobori Seven&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Nagakura Shinpachi: NHK version. I don&#39;t like the fact that the PMK version <br/>
is a red-haired runt (there&#39;s no such thing as a red-haired Japanese), but <br/>
that version totally had the edge as far as humor, though.<br/>
<br/>
Toudou Heisuke: NHK version!! He&#39;s so...lost! PMK version was good, but only <br/>
because of the laugh factor.<br/>
<br/>
Matsudaira Katamori: NHK version -rules-.<br/>
<br/>
Yoshimura Kanichirou: Mibugishiden version.<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all, folks!<br/>
