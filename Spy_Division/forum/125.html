The name of the Eastern Sea Road was the Tokaido road. It ran mostly <br/>
along the Pacific coast and has been around since before they thought <br/>
to keep track of history in Japan. It said there were 53 shukuba <br/>
machi along the route. These were posting stations were travelers <br/>
rested and were controlled by the Bakufu. Remember, they did this to <br/>
keep track of potential threats to the Shogun. The road is mostly <br/>
covered by the Tokaido highway now, but you can still see parts of <br/>
the old road today and the Shinkansen line is supposed to run more or <br/>
less alongside the old route.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently it was one of five Gokaido or main highways during the Edo <br/>
period. The site listed one other route. The Nakasendo road was about <br/>
500km or 310 miles long and had 67 shukuba machi. It began in <br/>
Nihonbashi in Edo and ended in Kyoto, cutting through the mountainous <br/>
central region of Japan. Because it was a much harder way, it was <br/>
less travelled than the Tokaido road.</div>
