 </span></blockquote>That's why quoting the source (this ML) is the wiser thing to do, to avoid all the nasty thing of leading unnecessary mass charges. <br/>
Since the 'accuser party' is not a seer in most cases , and unless the accused one quotes the source previously, the accuser is absolutely entitled to suspicion, and I mean the historical data in this case. Sorry if I sound stubborn. <br/>
 <br/>
Honestly, if I find that any of my author notes is taken by someone else (comma by comma), and this person doesn't quote the source, I simply rip the guy/gal to bits. He/she can come with friends and protest all they like, but unless they provide real and solid proof, I simply don't back off, no matter how many charge (and believe me, I know, I faced mass charges). But, maybe it's just me...<br/>
 <br/>
It's the strict responsibility of the author to be clear about this, and avoid uncomfortable situations. It doesn't take too long to mention: thanks to the gals and guys in the SHQ ML, who provided ideas and historical data.<br/>
 <br/>
Concerning the plotlines, the right thing is, if you know a previous fic with a similar idea, to contact the author. It's also simple and quick, and avoid misunderstandings. <br/>

I understand all that about the train wreck.   Done that a time or two myself. But I was thinking, we've all recently seen a   "Mary Sue" in a popular anime and loved her to death! Who do I mean? Ayu-nee!   She fits the criteria laid down almost exactly in that 1) Everyone loves her,   2) She's always solving everyone's problems for them with her advice and 3)   even though the Shinsengumi are master swordsmen, it is sadly apparent she can   kick most of their tails... So, Mary Sue-nee anyone? (Yes, I know she's an   "original" character, but she probably began as a "Mary Sue" somewhere,   ne?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I still maintain the Gatotsu threat. I don't want anyone   here who uses info we've gathered to be accused by someone unconnected to the   group of stealing "their story" or "their data" because they have the same   info. I will lead a mass charge in that person's defense. Going several rounds   with the goldfish and then it's evil brother has made me cranky. Esp. after I   realized I've HAD the info I've been looking for all along! -_- Sometimes, you   really can have TOO much info.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, there's another translator service   we can gripe about now. It's called Alis Translation Solutions and the name of   the program is Gist. For good reason. That's about all you'll get of the page   - the gist. (On a serious note, in some cases it's worse, but in others the   translation is clearer and easier to figure out.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342549733">Hi...<br/>
 in this case, I'd just keep a copy of the e-mail I sent, just in case the author shows up one day and says 'Hey, you took my idea!'. (I usually back up all my mails once a month, so I keep track of years exchanged mails.... But I'm a little obsessive about this)<br/>
Hope it helps...<br/>
