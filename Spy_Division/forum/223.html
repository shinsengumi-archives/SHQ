 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why quoting the source (this ML) is the wiser thing to do, to avoid all the nasty thing of leading unnecessary mass charges. <br/>
Since the &#39;accuser party&#39; is not a seer in most cases , and unless the accused one quotes the source previously, the accuser is absolutely entitled to suspicion, and I mean the historical data in this case. Sorry if I sound stubborn. <br/>
 <br/>
Honestly, if I find that any of my author notes is taken by someone else (comma by comma), and this person doesn&#39;t quote the source, I simply rip the guy/gal to bits. He/she can come with friends and protest all they like, but unless they provide real and solid proof, I simply don&#39;t back off, no matter how many charge (and believe me, I know, I faced mass charges). But, maybe it&#39;s just me...<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s the strict responsibility of the author to be clear about this, and avoid uncomfortable situations. It doesn&#39;t take too long to mention: thanks to the gals and guys in the SHQ ML, who provided ideas and historical data.<br/>
 <br/>
Concerning the plotlines, the right thing is, if you know a previous fic with a similar idea, to contact the author. It&#39;s also simple and quick, and avoid misunderstandings. <br/>

&gt;   &gt; And as far as &quot;Mary Sue Tokio&quot; goes? If I don&#39;t like-ey, I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;   &gt;read-ey. End of story.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah, but sometimes, you know, you   just can&#39;t look away.  It&#39;s such a <br/>
&gt; train wreck, and you are   drawn in...seduced by the grotesque.  I <br/>
&gt; guess, I sometimes read   Mary Sue stories for the same reason I watch <br/>
&gt; horror movies.    Just as it is good to know my arm isn&#39;t being gnawed <br/>
&gt; off by zombies,   it is also good to know that I am -not- as bad of a <br/>
&gt; writer as I   sometimes like to think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -MissBehavin (Has Saito ready   to Gatotsu anyone who unjustly accuses <br/>
&gt; our members of stealing   data.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah, I see it now, the Shinsengumi-fans, gathering our   boats, sailing <br/>
&gt; off into the wide-wide internet, our Makoto flags   unfurled, our <br/>
&gt; eyepatches and parrots in tow...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &quot;Arrrrr.  We&#39;re here for your DATA.  We&#39;ve come to pillage <br/>
&gt;   your <br/>
&gt; research.  Hand it over, or feel our wrath!<br/>

I understand all that about the train wreck.   Done that a time or two myself. But I was thinking, we&#39;ve all recently seen a   &quot;Mary Sue&quot; in a popular anime and loved her to death! Who do I mean? Ayu-nee!   She fits the criteria laid down almost exactly in that 1) Everyone loves her,   2) She&#39;s always solving everyone&#39;s problems for them with her advice and 3)   even though the Shinsengumi are master swordsmen, it is sadly apparent she can   kick most of their tails... So, Mary Sue-nee anyone? (Yes, I know she&#39;s an   &quot;original&quot; character, but she probably began as a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; somewhere,   ne?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I still maintain the Gatotsu threat. I don&#39;t want anyone   here who uses info we&#39;ve gathered to be accused by someone unconnected to the   group of stealing &quot;their story&quot; or &quot;their data&quot; because they have the same   info. I will lead a mass charge in that person&#39;s defense. Going several rounds   with the goldfish and then it&#39;s evil brother has made me cranky. Esp. after I   realized I&#39;ve HAD the info I&#39;ve been looking for all along! -_- Sometimes, you   really can have TOO much info.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, there&#39;s another translator service   we can gripe about now. It&#39;s called Alis Translation Solutions and the name of   the program is Gist. For good reason. That&#39;s about all you&#39;ll get of the page   - the gist. (On a serious note, in some cases it&#39;s worse, but in others the   translation is clearer and easier to figure out.) <br/>

 in this case, I&#39;d just keep a copy of the e-mail I sent, just in case the author shows up one day and says &#39;Hey, you took my idea!&#39;. (I usually back up all my mails once a month, so I keep track of years exchanged mails.... But I&#39;m a little obsessive about this)<br/>
Hope it helps...<br/>
