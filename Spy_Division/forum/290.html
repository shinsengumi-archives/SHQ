 </span></blockquote>No, no, no, no, no. We've had it all wrong! It's the ghost of the Ishin! Particularly Saigo! He's such an attention hog! He can't stand that the Shinsengumi have such a devoted following, so he wants to keep us away from any sites where he stands even half a chance of getting noticed! LOL!<br/>
