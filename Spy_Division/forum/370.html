<div id="ygrps-yiv-58248675">The Hijikata pic is very interesting because<br/>
1) Hijikata is not looking at the audience<br/>
2) Hijikata does not have his pipe<br/>
both of the above mentioned factors make him look quiet appealing and <br/>
unintimidating...in fact he looks sensitive.<br/>
Perhaps, his signature PMK glare and pipe are the 2 things which make <br/>
him look older and more authoritative...without them he looks like <br/>
like a "pretty boy" LOL! (^_^)<br/>
I like the detail in the hair and neck.<br/>
As always outstanding work...if you would like them posted at <br/>
