<h3>Do you do this? Mini-questionnaire for the writer in you.</h3>
by <i>mg_batt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288013195">Hmmm... It's 1:33 AM from where I'm at... Sleepy but funny can't <br/>
sleep so here goes... Let's discuss about things you do, w/ regards <br/>
to writing of course... This is in no particular order and if it's <br/>
sounds kinda weird... It's 1:34 AM...<br/>
<br/>
1) While writing you... ????<br/>
a. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts <br/>
are finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.<br/>
b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever<br/>
c. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, <br/>
oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
2) After writing you... ????<br/>
a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important <br/>
than Proof-read!<br/>
b. One quick read. I'm confident enough in my work.<br/>
c. Oh who needs to check? It's too late. I wrote and posted the <br/>
thing already!<br/>
<br/>
3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>
a. Oh that's nice. I'll check it in a bit. *feels good*<br/>
b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!<br/>
c. Review... Well that's fine. I'll get to it when I get to it. <br/>
<br/>
4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>
a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!<br/>
b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there's any basis <br/>
and then correct if need be...<br/>
c. What? You didn't like it. Oh! I've got to fix that quick!<br/>
<br/>
5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>
a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!<br/>
b. I'll update exactly one week from now. There's got to be a <br/>
defined routine.<br/>
c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this <br/>
great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.<br/>
<br/>
6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>
you...<br/>
a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written <br/>
now!<br/>
b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it's more convenient.<br/>
c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!<br/>
<br/>
7) You published something, you think it's decent... So you...<br/>
a. Post on every messageboard, yahoo group and even e-mail close <br/>
(not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need to <br/>
read ASAP or else!<br/>
b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement <br/>
in a community where you are an active member or popular<br/>
c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your fic <br/>
in the depths of ff.net.<br/>
<br/>
Here's mine...<br/>
1. a<br/>
2. c<br/>
3. b<br/>
4. b<br/>
5. c<br/>
6. c<br/>
7. b<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll post some sort grading system and interpretation to the <br/>
results that you get. Right now though.. Well no way. Sleep has <br/>
come! YEY! It might be nice though to see your responses so that we <br/>
know a little bit more about each other. Maybe get a few laughs <br/>
too. :O)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848021735">Wounds, I have the same problem with your little survey that I had with Milady's more extensive one over on SxSAS (the one she's doing for reading & writing in fandoms) --- a choice doesn't fit precisely enough nor does a choice apply in every case.  I'll try to choose one of your responses, but with comments...<br/>

 <br/>
All of the above.  Some days the words flow like water, other days they won't even trickle even though I feel like writing.  I'm always taking little breaks, but I also drink soda/water/tea and tend to chain smoke while I write.  There's also one more thing that tends to happen --- I usually have to stop here and there and do some research... either checking through notes or list messages, do some googling, or review a scene or episode... or I stop for a little refueling (inspiration) by searching for certain images (screencaps) looking for expressions or moods in a character (can we say "excuse just to stare at RK Saitou"?).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>2) After writing you... ????<br/>

c. Oh who needs to check? It's too late. I wrote and posted the <br/>

A, though on occasion, B.  Depends on how well the writing went.  (I do a lot of proofing and editing while I write.) Never C.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>

b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!<br/>
c. Review... Well that's fine. I'll get to it when I get to it.<<<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I *never* take reviews lightly --- my initial response is B, but *when* I read it depends on what's happening at the moment, how much other mail I have (usually I get through other mail first then go back and read reviews... like saving the best for last), or how I felt about the piece the review is probably for.  If I felt insecure about it, I tend to read them immediately just to see what's been said.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>

c. What? You didn't like it. Oh! I've got to fix that quick!<<<br/>
<br/>
First, mentally bless the person profusely.  Then B.  Never A because nothing I write is perfect and always open for improvement.  Probably rarely, if ever, C... it would entirely depend on *why* is wasn't liked... but I won't change things wholescale or things I like/want just to keep an audience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!<br/>

c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this <br/>
great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.<<<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
All of the above.  Sometimes I desperately need to get something out of my system and I don't want to wait for fear I'll lose the momentum or the mood (or it just refuses to rest).  Sometimes it does me a lot of good to give myself a schedule because of the dysthymic disorder (though I'm less successful at sticking to a schedule).  Most often I update as the mood strikes me... in other words, when I can write.  Finishing "Fast Carriage" was torture, and yesterday's chapter of "Yasou" went *VERY* slowly.  If I hadn't felt a deep need to get something out after Tiffany brought it up, it wouldn't have gotten done; consequently writing what was left of what I had started ages ago took hours of stops and starts.  (And why it went out even though I wasn't entirely happy with it... I *needed* to get it out.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>

b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it's more convenient.<br/>
c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!<<<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
All of the above.  I've been known to get up in the wee hours of the morning just because I've awakened with an idea, turned on the computer, and stared writing.  I also keep a notebook beside the futon (yes, I sleep on the floor on a futon) and will jot things down, usually snippets of dialogue.  The cats *HATE* it when I do this because it often ends up being a series of get up, turn on the light, scribble something, turn off the light, lay back down, get up, turn on the light... until I finally run out of ideas or decide to just get up permanently, turn on the computer and write (which they hate even more).  Every time a new story idea pops into my head (which is all the time), I sigh deeply with great agitation --- the last thing I need is a new story idea with so many stories already started or in fragments.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>7) You published something, you think it's decent... So you...<br/>

c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your fic <br/>
in the depths of ff.net.<<<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
All of the above.  Though I tend not to email people privately and I don't tend to think of any of my writing in those terms (i.e. great).  I hope people will read it, but I don't expect them to.  I might be more inclined to email some people privately if ff.net didn't have the author alert feature (when it's working, that is), just to give them a heads-up.  Most of my stories end up on ff.net and a few select communities.  When it comes to any of the archives (ff.net or adultfanfiction.net, etc.), I'm *always* amazed when people find it.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the little moment to think about things... <sigh>  It's a new day... will I be able to write today????  (Which reminds me, something else that would be interesting to read others comment on is how they feel about multiple stories in progress --- do they avoid it stringently or do they just let stories start as they come or ??? I hate having so many in progress, but at the same time, I rely on the variety because each story carries a particular mood that I can tap into.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653701077">It'll probably sound like I'm plagiarizing Phil here since her responses <br/>

same day!<br/>

><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'm generally a B since I tend to go over things once I've finished a <br/>
page or so but if I'm trying to do something "serious" /original book <br/>
length I lean a bit more toward the A <br/>
<br/>
*looks at Miss B and Masayoshi*  I see  you smirking and rolling your eyes*<br/>

of posting something new I check the site just in case...<br/>
<br/>
*Yes, I'm pathetic*<br/>

><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I would certainly remove the "Perfect" from A I think I'm a cross <br/>
between A and B leaning more toward the B side.<br/>
<br/>
However I tend not to do major rewrites for fanfic because that's my <br/>
"fun all for me" writing so as long as I think it's "good enough" then <br/>
it stands as is.<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>A & C depending on how  badly the characters want me to tell this <br/>
particular story.. I've stalled don my current fanfic mainly because of <br/>
an original story that's going really well---or better than any others <br/>
have for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
*distant whisper drifts by*  "I wish she'd finish the stupid book and <br/>

<br/>
Now if the miracle of miracles happens and I publish something "for <br/>
real" again  I'll be an obnoxious little wretch and stretch that 15 min <br/>
of "fame" out for as long as I can. --Consider that your warning <br/>
potential book buyers LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422829080">1) While writing you... ????<br/>
b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever<br/>
<br/>
I generally sit down and write the scene out in my head as it occurs. <br/>
I tend to think like a film person, so it's important for me to sit <br/>
continuously and type quickly.   But I also try to get up once in a <br/>
while. ^_^  Although I have been known to not eat or go to the <br/>
bathroom if I'm in the midst of something really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2) After writing you... ????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generally I read it once before posting, then post it, and then read <br/>
it again and fix it.  For some reason, I can't pick things up on one <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>
<br/>
 b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!<br/>
I love them.  Even the "U R So MEAN U MUst continue PLZ" reviews <br/>
*grin*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>
 b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there's any basis <br/>
 and then correct if need be...<br/>
people who point out typos are great. I love em. People who point out <br/>
inconsistencies also are great.  I hate mistakes and that other <br/>
people will be reading them... so I love people who are giving me <br/>
helpful reviews.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>
a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!<br/>
b. I'll update exactly one week from now. There's got to be a <br/>
 defined routine.<br/>
<br/>
a and b.<br/>
I believe in finishing the big stories. Smaller ones can go on a <br/>
schedule or be intermittent. I often use the ff.net tracking <br/>
statistics to also decide how to proceed.  ONe story I wrote was <br/>
getting usually 100-200 reads within 3 days per chapter, so I decided <br/>
to go ahead and keep whipping out the updates.  But some of the other <br/>
ones have been getting read more slowly, so those aren't quite as <br/>
urgent.  <br/>
<br/>
6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>
 you...<br/>
 a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written <br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes I tell other people the idea and get them <br/>
to write it ^_^ .  <br/>

more of a B, smoke stop think stop drink soda (do this 10x over)<br/>
2) I'm definitely a C... I get so excited on my fic and post it ASAP. <br/>
Unfortunately when I start reading I find typos here and there. I fix <br/>
what I catch but it takes another hour to show the changes, by then <br/>
everyone has read the story T__T<br/>
3) B! I am crazy about reviews... They make me feel good. <br/>
4) B! I check if there's a basis... I feel sad but I check and I <br/>
appreciate those who have critiques to give.<br/>
5) C! I'm always on a writers block. ALWAYS!<br/>
6) C! Eventhough I have writers block on a fic I'm writing.. The <br/>
ideas for a new fic just keeps knocking... Baka Brain!<br/>
7) B. I announce once in a while... I don't want my fic to be <br/>
forgotten or left to Kami.... :O)<br/>

<br/>
1) d. Have the whole d****d thing written out as a rough draft and all I have to do is type it, but I still split my time between answers b and c! In my defense, I usually only have the time to type up a story at like 3 or 4 in the morning, so I'm trying to keep from falling asleep as I type.<br/>
<br/>
2) a. And then I find all the mistakes only AFTER I post it. Another side-effect of only being able to type up a new chapter at 4 in the morning, ne?<br/>
<br/>
3) a.<br/>
<br/>
4) d. Cry to Barb. Feel better afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
5) c. (You know how I am already! Of course, my job is generallly behind my long time between updates. That and too many stories going at once.)<br/>

<h3>Re: Do you do this? Mini-questionnaire for the writer in you.</h3>
by <i>maryannsfanfic</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611761369">Hi Grace! <br/>
<br/>
A questionnaire is always a good idea I just love questionnaires! <br/>
Here are my answers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >1) While writing you... ????<br/>
>a. Type non-stop. Happily. Everything is where it should be. Drafts <br/>
>are finished. Spell/Grammar checker is on. Nothing will go wrong.<br/>
>b. Stop intermittently. Grab a smoke or snack or coke or whatever<br/>
>c. Stop stare at the computer screen 10 minutes, oops 30 minutes, <br/>
>oops 60 minutes... Ah! Turn it off.<br/>
><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely (b). Strangely, I always find it easier to have new ideas <br/>
while walking or doing anything else. You have no idea of how many <br/>
times I leave the room, do something else, and then come back running <br/>
to add my latest idea. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  >2) After writing you... ????<br/>
>a. Proof-read! Proof-read! Proof-read! Nothing is more important <br/>
>than Proof-read!<br/>
>b. One quick read. I'm confident enough in my work.<br/>
>c. Oh who needs to check? It's too late. I wrote and posted the <br/>
>thing already!><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely (a). After the first draft is written, I put the chapter <br/>
aside for a whole week. Then I come back and almost completely re-<br/>
write it, and put the chapter aside for another week. And then Well, <br/>
I think that you get a clear idea by now that this re-writing process <br/>
can be repeated many times before I'm finally satisfied. Then the <br/>
chapter goes to the beta-reading stage and when it comes back, there <br/>
is generally another series of re-writes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>
>a. Oh that's nice. I'll check it in a bit. *feels good*<br/>
>b. Wow a review! Got to drop everything and read the review quick!<br/>
>c. Review... Well that's fine. I'll get to it when I get to it. ><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(b) I'm thrilled when I receive reviews and I have to read them right <br/>
away. But when the review alerts follows a very harsh critic, then <br/>
I'm a bit anxious and hesitate before opening the review, although <br/>
while actually reading it, I forget about my fears. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>
>a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!<br/>
>b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there's any basis <br/>
>and then correct if need be...<br/>
>c. What? You didn't like it. Oh! I've got to fix that quick!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When the critique is justified, and when I'm truly mistaken, I will <br/>
acknowledge the fact and try to make the necessary changes. But <br/>
unjustified or unfair critiques really morally affect me. After I <br/>
receive such a thing, it generally takes me days before writing <br/>
anything again. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>
>a. Got to update ASAP! While the fans/ideas are still hot!<br/>
>b. I'll update exactly one week from now. There's got to be a <br/>
>defined routine.<br/>
>c. Update? Does the word exist. Oh maybe later after I get this <br/>
>great idea or if this writers block ever goes away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(c) without any doubts. When was the last time I updated? Two months <br/>
ago?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>
>you...<br/>
>a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written <br/>
>now!<br/>
>b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it's more convenient.<br/>
>c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generally (b) I have difficulties writing without have a very, very <br/>
clear idea of the plot. I tried that the other week, but the re-<br/>
writing process is very painful. The fic is full of plot-holes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >7) You published something, you think it's decent... So you...<br/>
>a. Post on every message board, yahoo group and even e-mail close <br/>
>(not so close) friend that you have this great fic that they need to <br/>

>b. Let some friends know here and there. Maybe post an announcement <br/>
>in a community where you are an active member or popular<br/>
>c. Pray to God every night that someone miraculously find your fic <br/>
>in the depths of ff.net.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(c) I fear to annoy people by making such an announcement, so I just <br/>
hope that miraculously people will notice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I don't have spell check, personally.  Or grammar check.  It<br/>
annoys me.  I type up my stories in an old terminal window, and then<br/>
import each chapter into a spell-checker when I am finished.  I can't<br/>
stand grammar-checking.  This would be because I break grammar rules<br/>
left and right.  But, I tell myself that is OKAY, since I do it on<br/>
purpose, at least.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to start writing at about 9:00 every evening, and go until<br/>
approximately 2:00am, when I go to bed.  There's a 45 minute break in<br/>
there for going to work out.  Every 30-60 minutes or so, I get up and<br/>
take a 2-3 minute break -at least-.  Or, at least I try to.  Sometimes<br/>
I forget.  Oops.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2) After writing you... ????<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I proof-read each section after I write it.  Then I go back and<br/>
proof-read the entire chapter when I am done.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3) When you get reviews you... ???<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tend to read reviews as they come.  But, if they aren't saying<br/>
anything besides "loved the fic", I also delete them as they come.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 4) When you get a critique you... ???<br/>
> a. What was he/she talking about? This fic is perfect!<br/>
> b. Hmmm... I better check up on this and see if there's any basis <br/>
> and then correct if need be...<br/>
> c. What? You didn't like it. Oh! I've got to fix that quick!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, definitely B.  Especially if they point out a timeline error or a<br/>
historical error.  Then I correct it -right- away.  Grammatical and<br/>
formating errors I tend to not get around to changing as quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 5) When it comes to updates you... ???<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to update at least two of my stories per week.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 6) An idea pops in your head that would make for a good story.. <br/>
> you...<br/>
> a. Get a pen and paper.. Get your laptop.. This needs to be written <br/>

> b. Take a quick note. Write about it later when it's more convenient.<br/>
> c. STOP! NO MORE IDEAS! Baka Brain!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hahaha.  I tend to think C is the correct answer.  But, what I<br/>
generally do, if I don't have the time to write it all out JUST THEN,<br/>
is get the first 3 or 4 paragraphs on paper.  Then I can come back to<br/>
it later when I have time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 7) You published something, you think it's decent... So you...<br/>

> in the depths of ff.net.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I tend to just do C, mostly, though I'm doing more and more of<br/>
B.  I think, for long stories, I let the momentum build up a bit, and<br/>
then I try to find a community or forum where they would most be<br/>
interested.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the questionaire, wounds!  It was fun!<br/>
