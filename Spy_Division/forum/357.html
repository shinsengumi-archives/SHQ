Since I finally got my internet and scanner back, I decided to scan in all my fanart adn stuff thats been lying around ^^ I found a pic of Saitoh's head and the colored version of Yamazaki Susumu ... i think i uploaded it already somewhere in the group a few months ago but that was a really bad pic since i took it w/ a digital camera ^^ they are now in the single originals folder under photos XD take a look please, you guys, and give me some comments maybe? ^^ thanks a bunch in advance!!!!!!!<br/>
