<h3>The Interesting Life and Times of a Writer</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323303062">Awhile ago, Tiffany asked this question, which I find so intriguing I think <br/>
I'll answer it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Anyone want to share how weird it is to try to think as someone of the<br/>
>opposite gender? :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It _is_ weird. It started out that way, anyway...for example-- in "Jidai <br/>
Monogatari", my main character was not always Hiro-- in previous drafts, it <br/>
used to be Yuki. I think that writing and thinking so much as a character of <br/>
the opposite gender actually helped me in the long run-- it helped me become <br/>
more balanced as an individual. In a way, I've always been unlike other guys <br/>
(I dislike watching sports on TV, I'm generally more open and sensitive, I'm <br/>
not afraid to cry openly), but this sort of helped me define that. Writing <br/>
as Yuki opened me up to a new range of emotions and perception-- in a way, <br/>
when I wrote as her, it turned things upside down.<br/>
<br/>
And something else (sort of related)-- much as it looks like a skirt (but <br/>
isn't), I'm not afraid to wear a hakama, or Japanese clothing, in public <br/>
anymore. Like Tom Cruise's character said in "The Last Samurai"-- "I know <br/>
why you're mad-- they make you wear a dress!" lol! I'm beyond caring whether <br/>
it looks like a skirt-- in my mind, this is one way that I pay tribute to <br/>
the culture and era that I'm studying. Of course I don't wear them all the <br/>
time, but I regularly put them on. As with writing from the POV of the <br/>
opposite gender, wearing clothing of a different culture opens your eyes and <br/>
helps you look at things from a different angle-- like tying your hakama <br/>
strings tight so that you don't trip all over yourself as you climb stairs! <br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's all for now.<br/>
