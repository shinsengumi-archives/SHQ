11. Lord Matsudaira and your mother said so.<br/>
12. You're an otaku from the 21st century who wants to travel back in<br/>
time with rifles and grenade launchers and burn as many Ishin as you<br/>
possibly can (before your ammo runs out).<br/>
13. You like free food (glares at Sano and Shinpachi).<br/>
14. Hey, it's a living.<br/>
15. You like little pigs.<br/>

2. Turn down soba.<br/>
3. Turn down a drink.<br/>
4. Wear Kenshin's pink gi.<br/>
5. Write haiku.<br/>
6. Fart-- it'd mess up his "cool" aura.<br/>
7. Burp-- see above for reason.<br/>
8. Run around going "Ni! Ni! Ni!"<br/>
9. Run around pretending to ride on a horse, with an armed retainer<br/>
