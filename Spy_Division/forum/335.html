"Jeopardy!" belongs to some rich Hollywood people. So what? Monty<br/>
Python belongs to Monty Python, the greatest ensemble of British<br/>
comedic geniuses in all human history (ESPECIALLY John Cleese!!).<br/>
PeaceMaker Kurogane belongs to Kurono Nanae-sensei, Kaze Hikaru<br/>
belongs to Watanabe Taeko-sensei, Rurouni Kenshin belongs to Watsuki<br/>
Nobuhiro-sama (All hail the great and almighty god of historic<br/>
manga!!), "Shinsengumi!" belongs to NHK, etc. etc. Caveat ripoff artist.<br/>
<br/>
(fade in to the Jeopardy set. Standard announcer voice.)<br/>
<br/>
Announcer: Live, from Nijo Castle Studios in beautiful Kyoto, THIS IS<br/>
BAKUMATSU JEOPARDY!<br/>
<br/>
(cut to contestants' row)<br/>
<br/>
Announcer: Tonight's contestants are (in no particular order)Kondou<br/>
Isami, a native of Bushu Tama, 4th generation master of Tennen Rishin<br/>
Ryuu, and commander of the Shinsengumi!<br/>
<br/>
(Kondou enters, waving politely)<br/>
<br/>
Announcer: Next, Hijikata Toshizou, (Hijikata enters, glaring)<br/>
licensed expert of Tennen Rishin Ryuu, self-styled poet (Hijikata<br/>
glares more sharply). Andum(whispers: demon) vice-commander of the<br/>
Shinsengumi!<br/>
<br/>
(Hijikata takes a long drag of his pipe. Cut to audience. Young girls<br/>
scream for Hijikata and swoon. Hijikata flashes a grin. Girls swoon<br/>
some more.)<br/>
<br/>
Announcer: And last, but certainly not least, the constant companion<br/>
of Shinsengumi first unit captain Okita Souji, the last line of<br/>
defense of Shinsengumi headquarters, and ham hock extraordinaire,<br/>
Saizou the pig!<br/>
<br/>
(Saizou enters with an angry, indignant *buki!* at the announcer)<br/>
<br/>
Announcer: Uhhrightand now, here is the host of Bakumatsu Jeopardy,<br/>
SAKAMOTO RYOMA!!<br/>
<br/>
(Ryoma enters in spotless kimono-haori-hakama combination, swords at<br/>
his side, and salutes the audience)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Ohhh say can you seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerright. (straightens<br/>
up) Good evening, and welcome to the first installment of "Bakumatsu<br/>
Jeopardy!" Our guests tonight are all members in good standing of the<br/>
Shinsengumiwhich makes them prime targetser ::phew:: contestants<br/>
for our show! Now then, our categories are<br/>
<br/>
(Board lights up with the funky beeping sound)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Ichimura Tetsunosuke<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata: (mutters) Useless page<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Next category The Pleasure Quarters<br/>
<br/>
(Kondou and Hijikata look up)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Excuses For Showing up Late to a Raid.<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata: (screams) OKUZAWA YOU BASTARD!<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: A-HEM. Moving right along-- next category, Famous Swords!<br/>
<br/>
(Kondou lovingly pats his Nagasone Kotetsu katana)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: And the last categoryThe Mimawarigumi Inquisition!<br/>
<br/>
(Crashing sound is heard. A crowd of samurai in gray uniforms and<br/>
black hakama, led by a man in a similar uniform but in a red<br/>
sleeveless jinbaori overcoat, enter)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Ack!! Sasaki Tadasaburou!!! (runs and hides)<br/>
<br/>
Sasaki: NOBODY expects a Mimawarigumi Inquisition! Our weapon is<br/>
pedigreesthat's all, just pedigrees.<br/>
<br/>
Kondou: What about government stipends?<br/>
<br/>
Sasaki: Ah, yes yes yes, alright, pedigrees and government stipends,<br/>
fanatical devotion to ourselves, and nice gray uniforms. Now<br/>
<br/>
(Crowd of Shinsengumi samurai rush in and shove the Mimawarigumi off<br/>
the set)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: (slowly emerges) Umright. Well, it looks like it's time for<br/>
our first commercial break, so don't go away!<br/>
<br/>
(Commercial begins. Cue patriotic music)<br/>
<br/>
Announcer: Are revolutionaries attacking you? Is your centuries-old<br/>
military government in peril? If so, then we know who you<br/>
needSHINSENGUMI! No matter where you are (especially if you're in the<br/>
pleasure quarters), with just one small down payment of 200 ryo and<br/>
two large vats of sake, Shinsengumi will keep you safe and free of<br/>
rebel activity.<br/>
<br/>
(MAKOTO flag appears)<br/>
<br/>
Announcer: Now at the Yagi estate, within convenient walking distance<br/>
of Shimabara and Nijo Castle. SHINSENGUMI! A Matsudaira Bros. company.<br/>
AKU! SOKU! ZAN!<br/>
<br/>
(Commercial break ends)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Welcome back! Nowlet's get started! Kondou Isami, please<br/>
select the first category.<br/>
<br/>
Kondou: I'll take "Ichimura Tetsunosuke" for 100, Ryoma.<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: (clears throat) And the answer is"Tetsunosuke's least favorite<br/>
sound." Yes, Hijikata Toshizou?<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata: What is "An oiran in Shimabara"?<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Sorry, that's incorrectyes, Saizou?<br/>
<br/>
Saizou: Buki!<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: That'sCORRECT! Next category please, Saizou.<br/>
<br/>
Saizou: Bu-bukibukibuki!<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: "Famous Swords" for 100! And the answer is"The Japanese word<br/>
for weapon." Yes, Saizou?<br/>
<br/>
Saizou: BUKI!<br/>
(author's note: This is true. Hey, don't blame me, look it up in the<br/>
Japanese-English dictionary.)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: CORRECT! Next category.<br/>
<br/>
Saizou: Bu-buki!<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: "The Pleasure Quarters" for 100The answer is "Akesato." Yes,<br/>
Hijikata Toshizou?<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata: "Who is an oiran in Shimabara?"<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: Correct!<br/>
<br/>
(Suddenly, PMK Saitou enters the set)<br/>
<br/>
Saitou: (monotone) I sense a disturbing presence here<br/>
<br/>
(Maro enters from the other side, shooting flaming arrows)<br/>
<br/>
Maro: Burn! Burn, you bastards!!! Maro will burn you all!!<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: (hurriedly) UhI guess today's winner is Saizou the Pigsee you<br/>
all latermaybe<br/>
<br/>
(Hijikata and Kondou draw their swords and run toward Maro, as the set<br/>
starts burning to ashes)<br/>
<br/>
Ryoma: (starts running, crashing through the burning set) DON'T<br/>
WORRY!!! HAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!<br/>
<br/>
(fade to black)<br/>
<br/>
Enter the author, clad in full Shinsengumi regalia.<br/>
<br/>
Masayoshi: Yeah, I know, I know, that was ridiculous. But did you<br/>
expect anything less?<br/>
<br/>
