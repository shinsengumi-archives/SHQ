DOUBTS<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Exciting,&quot; said Okita Souji, muffled, through a mouthful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; The proprietor of his favourite confectionery<br/>
sounded <br/>
like her products  and looked the part, with her small, cosily<br/>
plump <br/>
form and bright dark eyes. &quot;Indeed, even in a place where <br/>
extraordinary things happen on a daily basis. I think I have had <br/>
enough excitement to be getting along with, for now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Souji said lightly, deliberately, &quot;I suppose the last real stir<br/>
was <br/>
the Ikedaya Incident.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ah,&quot; the lady said. &quot;Who could forget that? Hijikata-san<br/>
is a kind <br/>
soul, no doubt he had his reasons. Tell me, Soujirou, have you had <br/>
some sort of quarrel with him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Souji thought: And that&#39;s what you wanted to ask me, with the bag<br/>
of <br/>
candies, because you are a kind soul too And I wish I could be <br/>
properly honest with you.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No,&quot; he said, choosing his words carefully. &quot;But we have<br/>
had a <br/>
couple of bad news recently and I think he just wants to be alone. <br/>
For a while.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She shook her head. <br/>
<br/>
A small pain shot through Souji&#39;s chest; he clutched it briefly,<br/>
and <br/>
Saizou squirmed uneasily against him.<br/>
<br/>
He said suddenly, &quot;Did he never come back at all, ever? Your son?<br/>
How could he just go off and leave you, like that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the lady said. &quot;But no, there was no<br/>
sign of him <br/>
since.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To go away like that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She looked at him sharply. &quot;Have you heard anything about<br/>
him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, no, of course not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re a funny boy yourself,&quot; the lady said curiously.<br/>
&quot;Sometimes <br/>
you sound like an old man. Comes from hanging around the Shinsengumi <br/>
for such a long time, I suppose&quot; She hesitated for a moment,<br/>
then <br/>
drew closer. &quot;There was once, a few days before he left, when we<br/>
were <br/>
alone, he told me: If you have once betrayed a great trust, you dare <br/>
not let yourself be trusted again, because a second betrayal would be <br/>
the end of the world. I don&#39;t know if you can understand<br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You mean he was frightened of what he might do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And more frightened of what he had done. Whatever it was.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So he ran away. Poor guy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Poor me,&quot; the lady sighed.<br/>
<br/>
There was a gentle tug at the hem of his yukata. Souji bent slightly, <br/>
tipping Saizou out onto the streets where he capered excitedly around <br/>
his feet. The child gazed up at him with wide adoring eyes; face <br/>
alight with anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Here you go, Miki-chan,&quot; Souji poured out a generous portion<br/>
of <br/>
candies into the cupped hands, smiling all the while.<br/>
<br/>
Stuffing the candies into her mouth, the child turned suddenly and  <br/>
gave him a clumsy hug before running off. &quot;Thank you,<br/>
Soujiro-san!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The lady laughed when she saw his smile brighten with pleasure and  <br/>
surprise, &quot;Fond of you, those orphans.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am fond of them too, very.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be careful then, won&#39;t you?&quot; Her round face was innocent<br/>
of all  <br/>
expression, but the words had force. Souji looked at her rather <br/>
coldly. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well,&quot; the lady said carefully, pottering about her shop.<br/>
&quot;I am not <br/>
at all sure what it is that is going on all around us, or where it is <br/>
leading. But those who know anything at all about the Shinsengumi <br/>
also know that there is a fierceness to its power, like the white <br/>
burning of the sun.&quot; Suddenly her voice sounded to Souji very <br/>
strong. &quot;At the very heart, that is. Other things, like humanity,<br/>
and <br/>
mercy, and charity, that most good men hold more precious than all <br/>
else, they do not come first for the Mibu-Ro. Oh, sometimes they are <br/>
there; often, indeed. But in the long run the concern is with <br/>
absolute order, ahead of all else. You are like fanatics. Your<br/>
masters, at any rate. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her warm lyrical voice ended, and there was only the roar of bustling <br/>
humanity around them. Souji looked out over the mass of bobbing <br/>
heads, silent.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That was a whole lot of nonsense, now,&quot; The shopkeeper<br/>
continued <br/>
awkwardly. &quot;But I was only saying, be careful not to forget that <br/>
there are people in this city who can be hurt, even in the pursuit of <br/>
good ends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Souji heard again in his mind his opponents&#39; anguished cries as<br/>
he <br/>
cut them down And for a second another image, unexpected,<br/>
flashed <br/>
into his mind out of his past: the strong, bony face of Kondo Isami, <br/>
cold in judgement of a once-respected figure who, through the frailty <br/>
of being no more than a man, had once betrayed the cause of the <br/>
Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
He sighed. &quot;I understand what you are saying,&quot; he said sadly.<br/>
&quot;But  <br/>
you misjudge us, because you are a human yourself. For us demons,  <br/>
there is only the destiny. Like a job to be done. We are here simply <br/>
to stop any potential revolutions at all costs. The charity and mercy <br/>
are for you, they are the only things by which men are able to exist <br/>
together in peace. But in this hard case that we are in, confronting <br/>
the Choshu and the other such renegade factions, we can make no use <br/>
of them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Souji reached down and lifted his hyperactive pet, cradling it <br/>
against his chest as it grunted in satisfaction. A fine rain began to <br/>
mist the streets of Kyoto. He turned around then and began his long <br/>
walk back to the Headquarters.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Soujiro,&quot; The voice behind him called out softly. &quot;It is<br/>
a cold  <br/>
world you live in, my boy. I do not think so far ahead, myself. I <br/>
would take one human being over all the principle, all the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He stopped then. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he said slowly over his<br/>
shoulder, &quot;in <br/>
this sort of a war, it is not possible to pause, to smooth the way <br/>
for one human being, because even that one small thing could mean an <br/>
end for countless others.&quot; Then bowing his head slightly, and <br/>
gathering round him his robes, he glided away.<br/>
<br/>
For all he knew, the lady&#39;s son could very well have joined a<br/>
rival <br/>
faction. In that case, it was quite likely that he, Okita Souji, <br/>
demon-child of the Shinsengumi, have played some part or other in the <br/>
man&#39;s postulated demise. No one would know: he had already killed<br/>
so <br/>
many. Perhaps the lady would never know security: what right had he <br/>
to value an individual less than the potential collapse of a regimen <br/>
as he knew it? Suffering is not increased by numbers: one body can <br/>
contain all the suffering the world can feel. He had judged like a <br/>
true assassin in terms of quantity.<br/>
<br/>
Twilight had passed into night; he wandered through the network of <br/>
turns, with Saizo whining for his late dinner. The city was full of <br/>
narrow streets and alleys, all of which he knew like the back of his <br/>
hand, but he was too careless of his own welfare and safety to be  <br/>
cautious and he had left his katana in his room.<br/>
<br/>
So it came as no surprise when he saw Tetsunosuke waiting at the <br/>
gates to the Headquarters: &quot;Okita-san! Hijikata-san would have<br/>
fifty <br/>
fits if he sees you in this state!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Souji smiled and patted the boy&#39;s head absent-mindedly as he <br/>
passed. &quot;A little rain won&#39;t kill me, Tetsu-kun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hijikata Toshizo did have fifty fits when he passed him in the  <br/>
hallway. Soujiro stifled a snigger as he watched his brother-in-arms <br/>
turn an alarming shade of bright purple. Could fits be quantified? he <br/>
thought, and burst out laughing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Souji! What did you think you were doing? A Shinsengumi captain <br/>
reduced to this state! What is the world coming to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Souji found himself promptly divested of his robes and his hair dried <br/>
by a pair vigorous hands. In minutes, he was clad warmly in a crisp <br/>
clean robe, hair trailing down his back. <br/>
<br/>
Behind him, Toshi said unexpectedly, &quot;You are killing<br/>
yourself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One human being over all the principle.<br/>
<br/>
Souji lay down on his futon, curling into a ball, pulling up his <br/>
knees. &quot;Oh, so would I,&quot; he said sadly to himself. &quot;So<br/>
would I, if I <br/>
could. It would feel a lot better inside me. But it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Toshi couldn&#39;t have known that his young friend was not replying<br/>
to <br/>
him when he said that. He stood up stiffly and left the room, <br/>
remembering to close the screen doors firmly to shut out any draught.<br/>
<br/>
He thought of the day years ago and Souji kneeling in front of him, <br/>
with his wide innocent eyes on the katana bestowed upon him. How he <br/>
wished there existed someone to whom he could say he was sorry.<br/>
<br/>
The End<br/>
<br/>
The end? Well, maybe not. We shall see. Meanwhile, if there is anyone <br/>
out there reading this, please review.</div>
