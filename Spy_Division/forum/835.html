<h3>Songfic:  Serizawa &quot;Kyoto Hustler&quot; Kamo</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125590738">Below is a song mangled by secretarytocapt3 for my own sick <br/>
pleasure...<br/>
<br/>
Many details about Shinsengumi history are suppressed, or distorted <br/>
for the sake of IMperial propaganda!<br/>
<br/>
However the truth is, even within the ranks of the New Selection <br/>
Group certain secrets remain in the shadows.<br/>
<br/>
Serizawa Kamo, the wild duck and outrageously out of control first <br/>
chief of the group was dispatched by his own men,<br/>
<br/>
not because of his drunkeness<br/>
<br/>
his womanizing<br/>
<br/>
or his brawling<br/>
<br/>
but his hustlin'<br/>

TITLE:  Kyoto Hustler<br/>
<br/>
Miso drinkers we're back<br/>
Ser-za-wa with the hot track<br/>
<br/>
Lyrical tanto cutting off yo saihu (purse)<br/>
I feel no pain, I'm insane<br/>
Smoke yo ass and eat a bowl of udon<br/>
I'm a genuine Kyo-to OG<br/>
Original Shin-sen-gu-mi<br/>
New day, new game<br/>
Buy your tempura and say it's nasty<br/>
Kyoto fastfood-bitch���.<br/>
I'm a pimp, never slick<br/>
Pick my nose with a pair of chopstick<br/>
Charmin them onna just to pay the rent<br/>
I turn out your girl for a ryo<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto Hustler<br/>
Live and die like a Kyoto Hustler<br/>
Bonafied, crazy ancestor worshipper<br/>
In the town that's a mother to the hustler<br/>
Kyoto Hustler<br/>
Live and die like a Kyoto hustler<br/>
Bonafied, crazy miso drinker<br/>
In the town that's a mother to the hustler<br/>
Bonafied crazy samurai man<br/>
<br/>
Pulling out my sword, adjust my fan<br/>
Watch yo buddies drop when I take a slash at<br/>
Yo ass<br/>
Ain't nobody gonna last<br/>
Ser-za-wa clique gonna take you out fast<br/>
Not gonna stop my flow<br/>
To run these streets you got to keep it down<br/>
Low<br/>
I know<br/>
We ain't being outdone<br/>
Straight from the ghetto like Mu-sa-shi<br/>
That's right yeah<br/>
Steal the beans out your mochi bun<br/>
All in the name of being number one<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto Hustler<br/>
Live and die like a Kyoto Hustler<br/>
Bonafied, crazy ancestor worshipper<br/>
In the town that's a mother to the hustler<br/>
Kyoto Hustler<br/>
Live and die like a Kyoto hustler<br/>
Bonafied, crazy miso drinker<br/>
In the town that's a mother to the hustler<br/>
Bonafied crazy samurai man<br/>
<br/>
Life is a struggle for scum<br/>
Want to bring the hustle and run<br/>
Living in the ghetto no fun<br/>
Got to hustle in the midnight sun<br/>
<br/>
Life is a struggle for scum<br/>
Want to bring the hustle and run<br/>
Living in the ghetto no fun<br/>
Got to hustle in the midnight sun<br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah<br/>
Fight to live, live to fight<br/>
Got to break some bones when the money's<br/>
Right<br/>
I'm doing my just to get the bento-meal<br/>
With sumo wrestlers versus Japanese steel<br/>
Keep it real<br/>
In the flesh I'm a killer<br/>
Packin' more rage than the tiger<br/>
What the deal in Kyo-to<br/>
Who Know?<br/>
I've more talent than your entire do-jo<br/>
Got a better chance against me in a casino<br/>
Than living the Kyo-to ghetto<br/>
